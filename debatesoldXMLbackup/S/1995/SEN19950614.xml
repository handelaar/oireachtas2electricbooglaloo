      <P>It is proposed to take item 16, motions 18 and 19, today. Motion 18 is to conclude not later than 6 p.m.; motion 19 will take place between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.  It is proposed that speakers will have 20 minutes each on motion 18 and may share time.</P>

      <P>In view of the announcement of the Minister for Justice last Tuesday and the Government's statements last Thursday, we should have the opportunity to discuss the commitment of the Government to law and order.  I ask the Leader to arrange with the Whips to provide time for a general debate on crime sooner rather than later.  The Minister for Finance introduced many innovative proposals in the Finance Bill.  However, since then there have been other announcements.  The House should be given the opportunity <Col N="1846" /> to discuss the Government's policy on finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise with the Leader two issues that should be addressed by this House.  First, a report on Sunday trading was published and received by the Minster of State at the Department of the Taoiseach in the last few days.  What is happening in this area at the moment is leading to all sorts of difficulties and domestic and ordinary life is being undermined.  There is also unfair competition.  Dunnes Stores workers in particular are being treated like commercial slaves and many of them are being victimised for not being prepared to work on Sundays despite the impact this is having on their families and other people.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into a long discussion on the matter &mdash; it is not appropriate on the Order of Business &mdash; but times are changing.  Sunday trading will be part of our future and we should have a discussion of the impact that will have on social life.  I have come across situations in the last two weeks where people have suffered badly because of Sunday trading.  In deference to the Chair, I will not develop that point any further, but that report deserves consideration and discussion.</P>
      <P>The second area that should be discussed is the difference of opinion between the veterinary surgeons and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  We discussed this matter in the House before on a number of occasions when we talked about brucellosis, badgers etc.  I worry when I hear a Minister say he is not prepared to be told how to do his business by a professional group.  If the vets, whom we trust, are not to be trusted to give us the proper advice or if a Minister does not trust them, that worries me.  They are getting a rough deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to explain this issue to the House because the views of the vets have not been fairly listened to and they are being treated unfairly.  The Minister has <Col N="1847" /> shown a lack of sympathy for the sensitivities of the relationship between vets and farmers and the way they do their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on TB eradication.  We have debated this subject at great length in the past.  If I recall it correctly &mdash; I am sure the Senator can recall it too &mdash; the former Senator &mdash; now a Minister &mdash; Doyle, treated us to a lengthy dissertation on this subject when she was in this House.  I would question whether we would achieve anything effective with a debate on TB eradication but I would be happy to participate in it if it is brought before the House.</P>
      <P>I see from the newspapers that the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, which deals with the revision of constituencies. has been prepared.  Since I have a direct personal interest in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request to the Leader of the House for a debate on agriculture.  There are two aspects I would like to mention in this regard. First, the alarming rate at which small <Col N="1848" /> farmers are being forced out because of the milk quota system, leasing or whatever.</P>

      <P>In light of the Government decision last week, would the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Justice to come into the Seanad, as a matter of urgency, to explain the cruel and callous decision which has been perpetrated against the people of Roscommon, particularly the people of Castlerea, to shelve the prison project? What right has any Minister or Government to play political roulette with the people of Roscommon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on the question of the vets and the TB eradication scheme.  It is a running sore, a scandal and a disgrace.  I am reliably informed that the vets have been milking the country for the last 42 years and I would welcome an opportunity to place on the record that it is a scandalous waste of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to cutbacks in the Prison Service, would the Leader ask the Minister for Justice whether this will also affect the suggested open prison facility in Parnell Street, which I understand was dislodged from Cabra as a result of pressure from local representatives? We would not welcome it in that area of the north inner city.  We have done our duty and we certainly do not need that kind of institution when they have stripped the north inner city of so many other institutions.</P>

      <P>Would the Leader ask the Minister for Justice if this particular potato is going to be dropped in the cutbacks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it possible to have a debate &mdash; or even to pass the concern on to the relevant Minister &mdash; about the possible loss to this country of a very important asset, which is the Shackleton Garden in Lucan?  I know the State has limited resources and it cannot buy every stately home or great garden.  However, this is a remarkable collection of plants <Col N="1850" /> and enhances the tourist potential of Dublin.  It might be possible for the Government to find some method of taking it into public ownership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two weeks ago I requested the Leader to arrange a debate in this House and, if possible, to bring in the Minister for Justice.  That situation has now become more serious. I support Senator Finneran's request for a debate and for the Minister for Justice to come into the House.  I was alarmed when I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, saying in the Lower House yesterday that he could redeploy some of the gardaí now serving in the Border areas to areas of greater need. Such a move would frighten all those who live and work in the Border areas because it may not be realised but many people's income has been affected by the peace process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader to bring the Minister for Justice into this House so that we can clear up this matter.  This is not a political bandwagon or a flag waving operation. Those living in the area are genuinely concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a further point in regard to item 16, Motion No. 4 on the Order Paper.  In view of the concern of many people who have heard that matching funding will not be available for the INTERREG programme, for the Delors package, and other funding, could the Minister say whether those <Col N="1851" /> funds will be available?  Perhaps many of the rumours are unfounded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

      <P>The Senator is lucky to have been here for ten years, I have not been here for ten years, I was in another House.  I wish to make another point.  If we are to have a discussion on walls built in Roscommon, maybe we will have a discussion about all the walls built by the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>I, too, wish the Cathaoirleach a very speedy recovery.  I hope he will be back among us very soon.  In view of the embargo announced by the Government last Thursday on recruitment to the public service, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come into the House to indicate to us the priorities he has for his Department, if the implementation of the Child Care Act will be a priority and if it will be implemented in accordance with the Government's promise.</P>

      <P>I join in sending best wishes to the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on Sunday trading.  It is obviously a complex issue.  Nobody wants to close down the corner shop that sell newspapers and so on but there is potential for exploitation as well.  I have not seen the regulations, referred to by Senator O'Toole, that the Minister of State is to implement but it would be useful if we had a debate in this House to tease out the various issues and see if there are ways to safeguard workers and, at the same time, allow the kind of legitimate Sunday trading that would be acceptable to all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole and others who spoke about the dispute with the vets.  Bovine disease eradication is very important to agriculture. If the operation of the scheme were to cease that would be very dangerous.  There were two cessations before and it is ironic that the previous cessations were at a time when the Ministers for Agriculture were members of Fine Gael.  Now a Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is refusing to meet the vets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on agriculture with particular emphasis on the disease eradication schemes in view of the worsening relationship between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the veterinary profession.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on crime and prisons in light of the Government decision to shelve the Castlerea prison project.  At present there is a chaotic, revolving door system in our prisons, and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill, which is going through the other House, when enacted, will put additional pressure on the prisons. A debate on this subject is therefore, urgently required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the demands for a debate on prisons and the custodial policy of the State, which is daft.  It is proposed to invest almost £5.5 million in a women's prison, while a recently issued report on prisons shows that women commit hardly any crime. Almost all offences are committed by men, under every category.  Women are being locked up for selling on streets without licences or non-payment of fines or debts, all of which could be recouped in a sensible way.  We should <Col N="1854" /> have a reasonable debate, without point scoring.  If there is to be a cutback in any facet of the economic or social life of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In answer to Senator Dardis, I have yet to discover a way to grow a parliamentary party except by putting candidates forward in by-elections; the Progressive Democrats obviously have a new system.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to make a statement on penal policy and the women's prison? I strongly disagree with the last speaker.  All the reports have shown a need for a women's prison because they are held in appalling conditions in the prisons in this country.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to make a statement on bail? She said there would be a reform of the law on bail but because of the pressure on prisons it would have to wait.  Would the Leader ask the Minister to make a comprehensive policy statement on the subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Magner that we should have a general debate on prisons and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice here as soon as possible to discuss our prison structure.  As others have said, there is a danger that people may be put in prison <Col N="1855" /> unnecessarily and loss of life may result. In a recent case in Cork, a young person died and the coroner's report stated it may not have been necessary to have locked up that person in prison.  Our debates should be constructive.  Many people could be dealt with other than by imprisonment.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education to the House for an open-ended debate on the number of students who committed suicide in the last few weeks.  This is a serious problem.  As I said in the past, our education system is oriented to failure rather than success.  It is like showjumping; it operates a process of elimination which is a bad system.  There should be a system of standards and everyone who reaches them should succeed, rather than the present system, which is chaotic and unfair to parents and pupils.</P>

    <P>Last week I asked the Leader to consider the possibility of a debate on the <Col N="1859" /> press, especially the <i>Irish Press.</i>  He did not consider this to be a good idea.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Various matters were raised by a number of speakers, so rather than deal with all the speakers I will deal with the main issues.  There is no problem with the call for a debate on law and order. Members will see that we have a very busy schedule of legislation for the remainder of the session, but I will convey to the Minister, as a matter of urgency, the desire from all sides of the House to have such a debate in the <Col N="1860" /> immediate future.  I will discuss the details with the Whips.</P>
    <P>On the question of a debate on the economy, last week Senator Lee requested a debate on the OECD report.  The Minister for Finance has agreed to this, and on Thursday, 22 June, there will be a debate on the OECD survey of the Irish economy which will allow Members raise the issues arising from the continued strong growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>I do not have any plans for a debate on Sunday trading, although it is a serious matter.  A casual trading Bill will be presented to the House before the end of the session which may allow an opportunity to raise some of these issues.</P>
    <P>On the question of the vets, somebody once said that Senator O'Toole could never see a sleeping dog but he kicks it.  He raised an issue today which generated a great deal heat in the House.  There is no useful purpose in having a debate in the House, but if Members think otherwise I will ask the Minister to attend.

      <P>On the question of newspapers, no useful purpose would be served by having a debate in the House at this stage.  Everybody knows that what is needed is investment in newspapers, including a business plan and confidence.  I do not believe there is anything we can usefully do at this stage.  I will talk to the Senator if he thinks otherwise, because we all want to see the return of the Irish Press Group, or a group in its place, functioning viably.  If the Senator can persuade me such a debate would be useful I am willing to listen.  I conveyed Senator Lanigan's message to the Minister, but I do not claim credit for the drop of £100 in the price being asked.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For the information of the House and in response to a question last week from Senator Mullooly as to what Bills are before the House this session, it is hoped the following Bills will be dealt with before the end of this session: the Investment Intermediaries Bill; the Social Welfare [No. 2] Bill, which is part of the preparation for the divorce referendum; An Bord Bia Bill; the Tourist Traffic Bill; the Casual Trading Bill, 1994; the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Bill; the Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1994, which is currently going through the other House; the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Bill; the Consumer <Col N="1862" /> Credit Bill, 1994; the Minerals Development Bill and the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Bill, which are both in the other House at present; the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994; and the Family Law Bill, 1994.  That is what the Government has asked of us between now and the end of the session.  I am not sure if all of that can be done.  It indicates a heavy load of legislation between now and the end of the session and limits to an extent the amount of time available for the discussion of topical issues.  I will continue to try to do my best on that.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann endorses the declaration made in Lisbon at the Inter-Parliamentary Conference on East Timor; and calls on the Irish Government to take all necessary steps to ensure the implementation of the declaration in order to secure freedom and the right to self-determination for the people of East Timor.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and thank her for her attendance. I thank the Leader for providing time for this motion, as I realise the schedule for the remainder of the session is crowded, and for allowing the debate in the form of a motion rather than statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the motion is unusual.  It is signed by all parties in House and by the Independent Senators.  This is quite unusual and is an indication of the seriousness with which this matter is viewed.  The motion arises from the Interparliamentary Conference on East Timor which took place in Lisbon from 31 May to 2 June.  All <Col N="1865" /> the parties in the Dáil and Seanad were represented there.</P>
    <P>A declaration was adopted at the conference supported by Members of Parliament from more than 30 countries from every continent.  It is important that individual parliaments adopt and support the Lisbon Declaration on East Timor and that is why this motion has been tabled.  The authority for the motion will be greatly strengthened by unanimous support from Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is important to read the declaration which was adopted at Lisbon as it was amended.  It was adopted by a general assembly of the conference on Saturday morning in the parliament chamber. The declaration states by way of introduction that the Lisbon international parliamentary conference was primarily aimed at helping the people of East Timor to win their rightful freedom. Following a brief outline of the recent historical background to the present plight of the people of East Timor, it pointed out the illegal annexation of East Timor by Indonesia, the genocide policy which has caused the deaths of more than 200,000 people and the refusal of Indonesia to abide by UN resolutions. The declaration, with the amendments, states:</P>
    <P>In view of the existing situation, the participants in the Lisbon international parliamentary conference:</P>
    <P>1.  Exhort the Republic of Indonesia to abide by the UN resolutions on East Timor and comply with the international norms of human rights and international law;</P>
    <P>2.  Call on the United Nations to ensure the respect for human rights in East Timor;</P>
    <P>3.  Urge the UN and all Governments and Parliaments of the countries which have been selling arms to Indonesia to take measures aimed at enforcing an embargo to such trade condemned by the European Parliament and by the international community;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> 4.  Demand the immediate releases of Xanana Gusmao and all Timorese political prisoners held in custody in Indonesia and East Timor;</P>
    <P>5.  Urge the United Nations' member states, namely the powers with an influence in the area, to cooperate in the search for an internationally acceptable solution that enables the East Timorese people to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination;</P>
    <P>6.  Request the United Nations to proclaim the 7th day of December as the international day of East Timor;</P>
    <P>7.  Congratulate the people of East Timor on their struggle for freedom and their preservation of their centuries old identity.</P>
    <P>8.  Appeal to Parliaments in the international community to show solidarity with East Timor [which was an amendment from Brazil].</P>
    <P>A 23 point action plan on East Timor was included in the formal declaration. This plan was drawn up by the chairman of the executive committee of the International Commission of Jurists, Justice Kirby, who is a member of the Australian Supreme Court.  It also included a resolution from Lord Avebury of England, one of the founding members of the Parliamentarians for East Timor group.</P>
    <P>There is not enough time this afternoon to go through that plan in detail, but several aspects must be highlighted. Justice Kirby proposed that parliamentary resolutions be adopted, calling for the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of East Timor.  We are seeking to do this today and to endorse the Lisbon Declaration.  As parliamentarians we have also been asked to raise the issue of the rights of the people of East Timor in correspondence and at meetings with representatives of western and other countries which are <Col N="1867" /> major investors in Indonesia.  The economic aspect is most important.</P>
    <P>Justice Kirby made a number of other prominent proposals in his action plan and I wish to draw the House's attention to a number of them.  One proposal requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit East Timor and to report to the Secretary General, the Commission on Human Rights and the international community on the compliance by Indonesia with (a) the report of the Special Rapporteur on Summary Executions; (b) the reported abuses of fundamental human rights; and (c) the conformity of Indonesia with the duty to accord to the people of East Timor the right to self-determination accorded to them by the international community.</P>
    <P>Additional elements are included in the 23 point plan.  There is a proposal regarding an embargo on the sale of arms to Indonesia.  It is also proposed that there would be help from UNICEF and the Red Cross for the people of East Timor; that the issue of East Timor would be raised in the European Union and the European Parliament; that we would consider the use of the convention on genocide in respect of alleged cases of genocide by Indonesia and its military forces and officials on East Timor; and that we should call on the Indonesian Government and Parliament to respect rights of Members of that Parliament so that they can speak freely.  A particular case in this regard is referred to in the declaration.</P>
    <P>Several of these points were covered when I and other Members of different Parliaments met the Secretary General of the United Nations in February 1994. We then called for the withdrawal of Indonesian troops from East Timor and the holding of a referendum on self-determination for East Timor under strict international supervision.  Pending that referendum, we urge the Secretary General to open an office in East Timor to oversee its demilitarisation, provide humanitarian aid and monitor human rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1868" /> In an impressive message to the Lisbon conference, the imprisoned East Timorese leader, Mr. Xanana Gusmao, said that a referendum is a target to be aimed for and that there can be no genuine solution in East Timor if it is not by the freely expressed will of the people of that country.  He said that a referendum must be supervised by the United Nations, given that the Indonesian regime clearly fails to understand the true meaning of democracy in its universal sense.  In his statement, he also called for the dismantling of the secret police apparatus and a withdrawal of Indonesian armed forces.</P>
    <P>I regret that, this afternoon, time prevents me from making more detailed reference to the 20 years of suffering and oppression which have taken place in East Timor and what the East Timorese people have had to go through but I am sure other speakers will be able to go into that aspect in more detail.  The country was invaded, as we all know, on a pretext in 1975 and for the intervening 20 years the people have had a lonely struggle to establish their rights.  We have to salute, as we have in the past, the bravery of individual journalists, some of whom have given their lives &mdash; in particular five Australians &mdash; for establishing beyond any doubt what was and is taking place in East Timor.  There was definitely a campaign to try and convince us that what was happening there was not taking place.  We also have to salute Bishop Belo, Mr. Xanana Gusmao and the Timorese people for refusing to be silenced in the face of torture and death.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Portuguese Government and the chairman of the Portuguese Parliament's select committee, Mr. Fernando Amaral, for monitoring the situation in East Timor and for keeping the problem to the forefront of international consciousness by organising the Lisbon conference.  The Portuguese Minister &mdash; I have had problems trying to pronounce his name &mdash; Mr. José Manuel Durao Barroso, has acknowledged the mistakes and omissions of the Portuguese colonial past. <Col N="1869" /> He stated in Lisbon that Portugal has no sovereignty or other claim to the East Timor territory; that Portugal's objective is to complete the colonisation through an act of self-determination in East Timor validated by the UN; and he stressed that Portugal would accept whatever solution is freely chosen by the East Timorese people.  That position is to be commended.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope that the adoption of this resolution this afternoon &mdash; if it is adopted &mdash; can help contribute to the peaceful solution of the problem in East Timor and I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government to show that they are serious about East Timor and to continue to exert international pressure to allow the people of East Timor to live in freedom and in peace.</P>

      <P>Since my colleague, Senator Dardis, did not put the full declaration on the record, I would like to take the time to read to quickly read the full text of the declaration.  What I regard as the preamble has already been put on the record.  The reason I want to put the actual plan on the record in detail is that a number of us were quite frustrated by the attitude of the Portuguese authorities, well intentioned as they were, because they had already pre-packaged and prepared their position and we were there almost as a cosmetic decoration.  Without the presence of the representatives from this House, the Portuguese would have had their way and the teeth which are clearly contained in the action plan would never have seen that light of day.  I would like to salute in particular the work of Senator Taylor-Quinn, who forcibly intervened.</P>

      <P>She was supported by me. It was important that the Irish people were there, in particular the representation from this House.  I will read the action plan into the record quickly.  It was important because the platform <Col N="1870" /> party wanted to get a get a bland neutral exhortatory piece of diplomatic language on the record but the delegates from 32 countries unanimously insisted that teeth be put into it.  The action plan states:</P>
      <P>1.  Propose Parliamentary resolutions calling for the exercise of the right of self-determination by the people of East Timor and related action;</P>
      <P>2.  Propose Parliamentary missions to visit Indonesia and East Timor in order to inspect and report upon the position of human rights, the rule of laws and the demand for self-determination by the people of East Timor;</P>
      <P>3.  Establish Parliamentary Committees to receive reports and focus attention upon the position of East Timor in International Law and in respect for human rights;</P>
      <P>4.  Raise the issue of East Timor in Parliamentary Committees of Amnesty International supporters; circulate amongst Parliamentarians the reports (or summaries of the reports) of Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists, the International Platform of Jurists for East Timor and other human rights NGOs concerned with East Timor;</P>
      <P>5.  Raise the issue of the rights of the people of East Timor in correspondence, and at meetings, with the representatives of the western and other countries which are the major investors in Indonesia;</P>
      <P>6.  Make contact with the Parliamentary groups concerned with the rights of the people of Tibet, the Kurds, Western Sahara and other peoples denied their right to self-determination. Make common cause with such groups and find and express the common principles of International Law and justice raised by cases with issues similar to those raised by the case of East Timor;</P>

      <i>Action within the United Nations</i>
    </P>
    <P>7.  Inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the initiatives of Parliamentarians, Parliaments and Parliamentary Committees;</P>
    <P>8.  Request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to call on the Government of Indonesia to comply with the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on Summary Executions which have so far been ignored;</P>
    <P>9.  Request the Commission on Human Rights to call on the Government of Indonesia to report to the Commission on Indonesia's compliance with the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur;</P>
    <P>10.  Request the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations to visit East Timor and to report to the Secretary-General, the Commission on Human Rights and the International Community upon the compliance by Indonesia with:</P>
    <P>*The report of the Special Rapporteur on Summary Executions, etc.;</P>
    <P>*The reported abuses of fundamental human rights; and</P>
    <P>*The conformity of Indonesia with the duty to accord to the people of East Timor the right to self-determination accorded to them by International Law.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Action</i>
    </P>
    <P>11.  Introduce motions or legislation on a selective arms embargo, or to forbid the sale of arms to countries which offend International Law on human rights and on the right to self-determination of peoples, including Indonesia in respect of East Timor;</P>
    <P>12.  Establish an information exchange to distribute Parliamentary resolutions in parliaments concerned;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> I feel particularly strong on that one because it was my contribution to get that included.  The information exchange is vitally important.  The action plan continues:</P>
    <P>13.  Establish a media exchange to provide local media with material collected internationally, to support the struggle of the people of East Timor and to help explain that struggle, and the right of the people of East Timor, to the people of the democracies which will help alter government and private sector inaction over East Timor;</P>
    <P>14.  Establish a central point for gathering sound, confirmed data on the current situation in East Timor as a basis for practical action in the Parliaments of democracies;</P>
    <P>15.  Make representations to the International Committee of the Red Cross and UNICEF to increase their presence in, and activities for, East Timor and its people;</P>
    <P>16.  Consider actions which will persuade democratic Governments to recognise the freedom movements in East Timor as the true representation of the people of East Timor;</P>
    <P>17.  Urge Parliamentarians to join the organisation &ldquo;Parliamentarians for East Timor&rdquo; (PET) and encourage its institutional support for the rights of the people of East Timor and for future meetings of Parliamentarians who support the rights of the people of East Timor;</P>
    <P>18.  Establish attention to the role of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) in the Indonesian economy and ... its role in East Timor;</P>
    <P>19.  Encourage the European Parliaments, in particular, to raise issues of East Timor in the organs of the European Union and in the European Parliament and especially to persuade the Government and the Parliament of the Netherlands to embrace the <Col N="1873" /> cause of the rights of the people of East Timor to self-determination and to the respect for their individual human rights.</P>
    <P>20.  Consider use of the Convention on Genocide in respect of alleged cases of genocide by Indonesia and its military forces and officials in East Timor.  Encourage and organise the collection of depositions, including from refugees from East Timor, on instances on genocide and on cases of violations of fundamental human rights.  Press for the establishment of an International Penal Tribunal or a Special Penal Tribunal for East Timor and encourage steps to gather the evidence for use by such tribunals once established;</P>
    <P>Here, I want to break from reading to make an important point and a specific clear determined call to the Government for action on this issue.  Among the representation at that meeting was not just Mr. Justice Kirby, who is an extremely distinguished judge internationally, but a woman judge from Sweden.  She put this case strongly and clearly.  It was indicated in the discussion that Ireland could act on this matter.  As a result of that discussion another judge, an American, offered the services of his law firm free of charge to the Irish people in any international forum to establish just such a case against Indonesia on the question of genocide.  If the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs are serious about bringing people to book for the crime of genocide which we know has been committed, we must take seriously this recommendation which has been made to us in an international democratic parliamentary forum by three internationally renowned judges.</P>
    <P>We have made our position clear as a matter of principle and are now in a position to act as a country having been offered the means with which to do it. Unlike the Shackleton Gardens it will not cost the taxpayer any money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> I will now resume reading from the statement:</P>
    <P>21.  Distribute the addresses and fax contacts of participants in the conference to retain a network of the parliamentarians and other persons dedicated to law and justice in East Timor which will endure after the meeting has concluded.</P>
    <P>22.  Call on the Indonesian Government and Parliament in Indonesia and elsewhere to respect the rights of members of the Indonesian Parliament to speak freely in the cause of human rights in Indonesia, and in favour of the rights of the people of East Timor to self-determination and to respect for their individual human rights.</P>
    <P>There was one person in addition to Xanana Gusmáo who was missing from that conference.  He was a man for whom we must all have the greatest respect, an Indonesian Member of Parliament who was detained in Indonesia for the crime of speaking out in a relatively mild sense about the misdeeds of Indonesia in East Timor.  These are the sort of matters we should be raising with the Indonesian Government.</P>
    <P>I was revolted to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> that, according to a reporter there, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, apologised to Mr. Habiebie, the Indonesia Ambassador, for the temerity of myself and Mr. Tom Hyland &mdash; who is in the Public Gallery today representing the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign &mdash; and for the inconvenience we caused.  I do not sustain that apology and in private discussions with the Minister I do not believe it was ever given.  I do not believe for one second that Mr. Habiebie was telling the truth.  I would not dishonour a decent man like the Minister by suggesting that he would proffer such an apology.  If it was proffered it was done without the permission of this House or the consent of <Col N="1875" /> the people of Ireland and as far as I am concerned it is hereby withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will resume reading from the statement:</P>
      <P>23.  Call on the Interparliamentary Union (IPU) to add the issues of East Timor to the active concerns of the IPU.  [On the three occasions on which I have attended the IPU I have actually raised this issue].</P>
      <P>24.  Propose resolutions calling on the President and Government of Indonesia to release Xanana Gusmao from prison immediately and without preconditions.</P>
      <P>I wish to add three other main points on the advice of the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign.  We would like the Indonesian military to reduce its presence in East Timor.  They are continuing to act both as a military presence and as death squads.  This oppression is continuing at this very moment.  While we were in Portugal we were made aware of a demonstration in Dili and the possibility of further reprisals against the civilian population; a United Nations humanitarian office to be established in East Timor that would report directly to the United Nations Secretary General, Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali; and the Irish Ambassador to Australia and Indonesia should visit the East Timorese resistance leader, Mr. Xanana Gusmáo, who is currently in jail in Indonesia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This a specific Irish political request I am making formally on the record of this House.  I strongly request that this resolution should be passed in its entirety because there was an attempt to disengage the action plan from the Lisbon Declaration.  The parliamentary conference, however, made it absolutely and unanimously clear that it would not suffer such disengagement.  The text which I have laboriously read onto the record forms an active and indissoluble <Col N="1876" /> part of the Lisbon Declaration itself.  As Irish people we can specifically direct the Irish Ambassador to Australia and Indonesia to take the required action.</P>
    <P>I referred to the presence of Mr. Tom Hyland and I will not embarrass him by referring to his good works; I have done so before on the record of the House.  I also salute the fact that we have with us in the Public Gallery a very distinguished journalist, Mr. Hugh O'Shaughnessy, formerly of <i>The Observer</i> and currently working with the BBC.</P>
    <P>The kind of concerns we have are not just genocide, but also situations which parallel those in Tibet, for example.  I argued strongly for the inclusion of a paragraph which referred to related issues.  Just as in Tibet where the local population is being swamped as a matter of deliberate population policy by the Chinese authorities in Beijing, so on the small island of East Timor the 600,000 native inhabitants are being deliberately swamped by what is known as transmigration.  This is not the transmigration of souls but the plantation of East Timor.  In this country we have suffered from the evils of plantation.  Some 400 or 500 years after the initial plantations occurred we are still dealing with the complex and tragic human repercussions of this brutal policy.  We are in a position to insist that this policy should be stopped.</P>
    <P>There are number of other small actions that we can take also.  We have many travel agencies through which people book trips to ever more exotic countries.  For example, many people choose Ball which is regarded as a paradise. However, I would like to remind the House that Bali is under the malign control of the dictatorship of Indonesia and that people frolicking along its beaches may well be frolicking over the buried corpses of the approximately 1 million Indonesian people who have been destroyed by that vicious and tyrannous regime.</P>
    <P>Very often when we make this kind of case from the Independent or the Opposition benches &mdash; and I salute <Col N="1877" /> Senator Dardis for the work that he has done in this area &mdash; we are told, as I was told when I opposed the beef contract with Iraq, from the Government benches that what we are proposing might well be the moral line but could a small country like Ireland afford it?  There was a rather wry smile on my face when it turned out that not only had we done the immoral thing by selling beef to the Iraqi Army so that they could pelt the bejasus out of the Kurds, but we were left with the bill because Saddam Hussein would not pay it.</P>
    <P>My strong belief is that a small independent neutral country with a colonial history such as Ireland's can adopt a position of moral leadership and by so doing can act in its own long term interests.  The dictatorship in Indonesia will not survive forever because you cannot trample on the rights of 200 million people indefinitely.  There will be change in that regime which is not as stable as American foreign policy makers appear to think it is.  It will be toppled and if any action of ours, any small impact of the words we speak in this House, can help to destabilise that regime, then I for one think it would be a good day's work; a kind of cleansing of the Augean stables on the Pacific rim.</P>
    <P>It may well be in our long term interests to act humanely so that the incoming regime &mdash; be it in five, ten, 15 or 20 years &mdash; will recognise that the Irish people stood up for the rights of the oppressed.  This may not be a particularly popular view and it may be regarded with cynicism by the machiavellian manipulators of the international political stage.</P>
    <P>Six weeks ago at the COSAC meeting in Paris I raised the question of East Timor and listed the arms sales which the French Government still insist on making to the Indonesian Government. They do so despite the fact that, as they know perfectly well, the arms are used against a largely unarmed and defenceless civilian population.  In my opinion, the sale of that equipment and as justification for it, the use of figures relating to employment is the same as if the firm <Col N="1878" /> of IG Farben had defended the manufacture of Zyklon B gas during the Second World War on the basis of the need to keep up the employment figures in Essen.</P>
    <P>The response that I got from the then Foreign Minister, Monsieur Alain Juppe &mdash; who is now, I regret to say, the Prime Minister of France &mdash; was that, first the European Union had nothing to be ashamed of in its human rights record.  I was relieved to hear that because there must be few international organisations that can make such an astonishing claim.  His second comment, that the European Union is not a human rights organisation, was more worrying.  That appears to be the depths of cynicism.  It might not be primarily a human rights organisation but if we abandon an honourable position with regard to human rights &mdash; as the French, apparently, are quite prepared to do &mdash; we have sunk to the level of the beast that prowled Europe during the Second World War.</P>
    <P>As politicians we should be ashamed to take such a line in light of the extraordinary courage not alone of the Indonesian Member of Parliament whose case I referred to earlier and whose name I have both forgotten and could not pronounce when I could remember it, but also of the many people in Indonesia who in circumstances of the greatest difficulty are struggling to establish civil rights both for themselves and for the people of East Timor.  That shows remarkable and moving imagination.</P>
    <P>It is not often that I find myself moved to compliment and congratulate a senior member of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.  However, Bishop Belo, who at first I think regarded his appointment in East Timor as something of a penance and who was seen as being from a rather conservative wing of the Church, has done remarkable work.  That work has continued through to the last few weeks when an important series of meetings were held in Austria which led to the Schlaining Declaration.  That meeting was particularly important <Col N="1879" /> because the representatives of two sides in East Timor met.  The Indonesians have deliberately fostered a type of opposition which, in a quisling sense, appears for a variety of reasons to give some degree of support to Indonesia. The two sides have met.  The presence of Ramos Horta, Foreign Minister designate of free East Timor, was very important in producing this document. The document was unanimously agreed. However, under pressure from Indonesia, the pro-Indonesian side is now attempting to renege on it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat my clear and specific call for action on the part of the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs, if what has been said is to mean anything.  I remember Deputy Dick Spring, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and a man of extraordinary political wisdom and tactical good sense, suggesting there might be a case for mounting sanctions against Indonesia at European Union level.  That would ill consort with the toadying that Mr. Habiebie incorrectly suggested was taking place in Dublin the other week. In particular, I would like a clear answer to the suggestion made to the Irish people through the Portuguese conference that we as an independent neutral country should take up the offer of free legal assistance at the highest international level to mount the charge of genocide against the Government of Indonesia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that this motion is before the House and that we are discussing it within ten days of returning from an international parliamentary conference on East Timor in Lisbon.  That conference was attended by parliamentarians from over 32 countries. The Irish delegation made its mark by insisting on the inclusion of the action plan drafted by the Australian delegation and chiefly by Justice Kirby from the appeal court in Sydney.  That action plan, as Senator Norris said, put teeth into the declaration.  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Norris for <Col N="1880" /> seconding a proposal I made to ensure that the action plan was included in the declaration.  All the Irish delegates spoke strongly about the terrible violations of human rights that are taking place in East Timor at the behest of the Indonesian Government.</P>
      <P>The people of East Timor have been prevented by force from exercising their right to self-determination since 1975, when the Republic of Indonesia invaded East Timor in violation of the United Nations Charter.  The United Nations General Assembly and Security Council at the time condemned the aggression perpetrated by the Republic of Indonesia. However, the Indonesians continued by brutal and violent force to occupy East Timor.  The Republic of Indonesia annexed the territory of East Timor and subjected its people to a policy of genocide which has resulted to date in the deaths of over 200,000 people.  I will not go into the details of how those deaths and atrocities took place because that has previously been put on the official record.  Suffice to say that it was totally contrary to all human rights declarations and all principles of international law.</P>
      <P>Repeatedly, the Republic of Indonesia has shown its unwillingness to abide by the resolutions adopted by the United Nations.  It also has shown an unwillingness to attend to the appeals made by the international community while refusing to recognise Portugal's status as administering power of the East Timor territory in charge of promoting the self-determination process of its people.  It is appropriate that Seanad Éireann compliment the Portuguese Government on its work in trying to ensure that human rights are upheld in East Timor.  While its record in East Timor some generations ago was less than commendable, the Portuguese, having left the country over 20 years ago, are now demonstrating a positive approach.  We should appreciate their honesty and goodwill about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the existing situation, it is appropriate that we in Seanad Éireann discuss this issue, taking into account <Col N="1881" /> the proceedings of the interparliamentary conference, and support and endorse the declaration that emanated from that conference.  Senator Norris and Senator Dardis have put the details of the action plan and of the declaration on the official record.  It is important that we endorse every aspect of those. The motion before us has the unanimous support of all parties in Seanad Éireann.  We fully support the declaration made at the conference on East Timor and call on the Irish Government to take all necessary steps to ensure the implementation of the declaration in order to secure freedom and the right of self-determination for the people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>In particular, we call on the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure that the United Nations insists on respect for human rights in East Timor, and that the United Nations and the Governments of the countries which have been selling arms to Indonesia take urgent measures to enforce an embargo on such trade.  This trade has previously been condemned by the European Parliament and by the international community. Pressure must be put on the Indonesian Government to release all East Timor political prisoners who are held in custody in Indonesia and in East Timor.  Among these is Xanana Gusmao, one of the leaders of the freedom movement in East Timor.  We ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to demand his immediate release.</P>
    <P>We specifically request special action within the United Nations.  It is time that the Department of Foreign Affairs requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to call on the Government of Indonesia to comply with the recommendations of a special rapporteur on summary executions which have so far been ignored by that Government. We also ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to request the Commission on Human Rights to call on the Government of Indonesia to report to the commission on Indonesia's compliance with the recommendations of the special rapporteur.  It is time the <Col N="1882" /> United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights visited East Timor and reported to the Secretary General, the Commission on Human Rights and the international community on the compliance by Indonesia with the following: first, the report of the special rapporteur on summary executions; second, the reported abuses of fundamental human rights; and, third, the conformity of Indonesia with a duty to accord to the people of East Timor their right to self-determination, accorded to them by international law.</P>
    <P>I am raising specific aspects of the action plan upon which I believe the Department of Foreign Affairs is in a position to act.  Seanad Éireann has repeatedly condemned the sale of arms to countries which offend international law and human rights.  Today we again call on those countries selling arms to Indonesia to immediately cease trading with Indonesia while it continues to commit such atrocities against the East Timorese people.</P>
    <P>I express my outright condemnation of the EU in deciding last week to grant aid Indonesia for forestry development to the tune of almost £26 million while that country continues to break basic international law on human rights.  I hope the Minister will outline in her response if the Department of Foreign Affairs was aware of the EU decision on that specific matter and, if it was, what action it has taken.  If the Department was not aware of the decision, I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take a stand at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers on behalf of the Irish people and express their concern and annoyance at the EU decision on this grant assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs should also focus attention on the role of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in the economy of Indonesia and its role in East Timor.  Consideration must be given to the Convention on Genocide in respect of alleged cases of genocide by Indonesia and its military forces and officials in <Col N="1883" /> East Timor.  It is time that an international penal tribunal or a special penal tribunal for East Timor was established and the case of human rights violations processed in that tribunal.</P>
    <P>I agree with and endorse fully Senator Norris's suggestion.  A constructive offer was made at the Lisbon Conference to the Irish Government by Justice Kirby from the appeal court in Sydney, Australia, as well as a lawyer from the United States and a Swedish judge. They are prepared to process cases against Indonesia in relation to human rights violations.  I join with Senator Norris in calling on the Government to take up that offer because information has been collated on a number of instances and specific cases and there is sufficient information and grounds to process cases of this nature.  It was requested at the conference that the United Nations proclaim 7 December an international day for East Timor.  I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to promote that idea within the various bodies.  It was also requested that the Red Cross and UNICEF increase their presence in and activities for East Timor and its people.  I urge the Minister to proceed down that line.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris made specific proposals today relating to Ireland.  He suggested that the Department of Foreign Affairs proceed at every forum possible to urge Indonesia to reduce the level of its military personnel and arms in East Timor.  This is a specific suggestion from Seanad Éireann.  Senator Norris also suggested that a United Nations humanitarian office be established in East Timor.  I fully support that and I hope the Department of Foreign Affairs pursue it further.  He also suggested that the Irish Ambassador to Australia and Indonesia visit the MP imprisoned in Indonesia.  That MP spoke out in a mild way against the atrocities being committed by the Indonesian Government against the people of East Timor.  All parliamentarians must condemn the imprisonment of a parliamentarian and must stand for the right of free speech. <Col N="1884" /> It is important that this message be conveyed to the Indonesian Government and that every effort is made to ensure that parliamentarian is released.</P>
    <P>A number of other aspects were raised at the conference which may be outside the ambit of the Department of Foreign Affairs, but nevertheless action can be taken.  It was proposed that a parliamentary mission visit Indonesia and East Timor in order to impact and report upon the position of human rights, the rule of law and the demand for self determination by the people of East Timor.  While in Lisbon I met some delegates from Sweden.  One of them had visited East Timor but unfortunately found the visit not to be very satisfactory.  Everything was very well stage-managed by the Indonesian Government and the delegation was limited in where it went and what it did. When they attempted to go outside the organised official tour or try to establish information outside of what the Indonesian Government wanted them to know, there was a poor and bad reaction from the Indonesian officials.  Any parliamentary mission would have to be under the auspices of the United Nations and its purpose should be to establish exactly what principles of international law and human rights have been violated.</P>
    <P>Today we are acting on Justice Kirby's first proposal, which was that parliamentary resolutions calling for the exercise of the right of self determination by the people of East Timor and related action would be introduced in every parliament.  I am delighted Seanad Éireann is to the fore in that, but we need support and follow up from the Department of Foreign Affairs through the various official channels. We were asked to encourage the European Parliament in particular to raise the issue of East Timor in the organs of the European Union and in the European Parliament and especially to persuade the Government of the Netherlands to embrace the cause of the right of the people of East Timor to self determination and respect for their individual human rights.  It was interesting <Col N="1885" /> that only one delegate from the Netherlands attended the conference.</P>
    <P>It was heartening that there was a strong delegation from Australia at the conference, including Justice Kirby.  The fact that the Australians came forward with such a specific action plan, being so closely aligned and associated economically with Indonesia, was heartening and encouraging.  The Department of Foreign Affairs should take courage from that and recognise that Australia, which itself is economically tied and closely aligned with Indonesia, was prepared to come into an international forum made up of parliamentarians from over 32 countries with an action plan of this nature.  It is extremely encouraging and a good indication of what should happen in this area in the future.</P>
    <P>We could go on at length about the details of what is happening in East Timor, but I know there are a number of other speakers.  I take the opportunity to compliment the East Timor Solidarity Group in Ireland for the tremendous work they have done in bringing to the attention of people such as myself the situation that exists in East Timor.  They have circulated us with information and knowledge about an issue that we do not really have the opportunity of researching ourselves.  If it were not for groups such as this and the tremendous work they are doing, this type of momentum would not have arisen.  I pay particular tribute to Tom Hyland, who has done specific and good work in the area.  It is important that the media at all levels, local, national and international, are constantly advised of what is happening.  The media has played a fantastic and courageous role in pursuing this matter and finding out exactly what the situation is on the ground.  Mention was made earlier of the five Australian journalists who lost their lives trying to establish the realities and facts on the ground in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Of course, the real compliment must go to the East Timorese people, who are consistently fighting for their human rights and showing courage in difficult <Col N="1886" /> circumstances to publicise their stand for freedom.  They have suffered hugely and yet continue to pursue their case with great courage and vigour.  We must congratulate them and, in a sense, empathise with them.  As a country which was colonised for hundreds of years, we appreciate the difficulties they are currently experiencing.  The fact that we are now in a different situation puts us in a special position to argue their case effectively at all international fora. I hope this debate will in some way assist in furthering the case of delivering human rights to the people of East Timor and allowing them the opportunity for self-determination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was one of those privileged Members of the House to have been invited to the recent international interparliamentary conference on East Timor held in Lisbon from 31 May to 2 June.  This conference produced the important Lisbon Declaration.  It was held in a lovely setting in the illustrious rooms of the Palácio de São Bento which houses the Assemblia da República.  Indeed, some of our meetings were held in the old Senate Chamber, the Sala do Senado, and in the Salão Nobre.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Portuguese Assemblia da Republica and, in particular, to His Excellency, the Speaker, Mr. Barbosa de Melo and to Femando Amaral, a member of parliament and the chairman of the select committee on East Timor.  I also pay tribute to all those who took part, in particular the dynamic and vociferous Irish delegation which made an enormous contribution to the final result and to Mr. Tom Hyland from the Timorese action group whose work is a credit to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is over 20 years since the invasion or the illegal occupation of East Timor by Indonesia.  Since then many things have taken place.  At that time Portugal was <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> the ruler of East Timor and, as far as I and the United Nations is concerned, it is still <i>de jure</i> the legal authority.  During those 20 <Col N="1887" /> years it is estimated that over 200,000 East Timorese, one-third of the population, perished and it is difficult to count the number of political prisoners, people who have disappeared and who have been persecuted and tortured.  It has been 20 years of terrible suffering, oppression and abandonment for those who have survived.  It has also been 20 years of determined struggle by a people resisting the oppressor and defending their identity.</P>
    <P>During that time Portugal did not deny its share of the responsibilities in the process of decolonisation of East Timor, nor, indeed, before the General Assembly of the UN.  I suppose history will judge the period when it was under Portuguese colonial domination.  In 1974, after 450 years, East Timor was to Portugal a territory which distance made difficult and expensive to administrate. While this may justify accusations of Lisbon's neglect regarding the development of the territory, it had the advantage of resulting in less interference in the daily life of the indigenous population and in more freedom to preserve its identity, culture, traditional customs and forms of organisation.</P>
    <P>The Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, said that it would have been easier and certainly cheaper for Portugal to have behaved like other colonial powers in relation to territories where international disputes broke out, to have taken a formal stand in the UN, to have washed its hands in practice and to have shrugged off its historic responsibilities, but that fortunately its recently restored democracy did not allow it to distort the most elementary values, nor to ignore the principles of international law.  He said that for this reason Portugal took up its historical, moral, legal and political responsibilities in accordance with the status of administering power of the non self-governing territory of East Timor as recognised by the UN.  He said Portugal fought internationally to defend the interest of East Timor over the years and that at stake are the most <Col N="1888" /> fundamental human rights of all East Timorese; their basic human right as a people to the free choice of their political destiny, the right to self-determination.</P>
    <P>At many fora Portugal has acted as a type of advocate or a lawyer for the people of East Timor.  The Portuguese Government has continuously stressed that it would accept whatever solution came about, whether it was independence, integration or association, even with Indonesia or any other state.  Portugal no longer has any interest in claims of sovereignty or claims in relation to the territory of East Timor. This stance by Portugal is based on the premise that military intervention could not succeed.  As a country, Portugal respects the peaceful solution to conflicts enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  I am afraid that over the past 20 years, Indonesia has proved that military suppression cannot work because with every passing day Timorese resistance gets stronger.</P>
    <P>Portugal has been using diplomatic methods to try to develop things.  It has used opportunities at international for a, when the issue of human rights in several countries and regions is raised, to give information about the situation in East Timor.  This is one way in which Portugal hopes to bridge the gap or breakdown the fence around Jakarta and get through the wall of silence.</P>
    <P>Portugal has acted at the UN Commission on Human Rights, the UN Decolonisation Committee, in the European Parliament, within the framework of the Common Security and Foreign Policy of the EU, within the framework of the EU/ASEAN relations and through bilateral contacts with the authorities of various countries at several levels.  Portugal's objective is to draw the attention of these bodies to the need for a political solution to the East Timorese tragedy with full respect for human rights and the right to self-determination.</P>
    <P>This is also the background to the lodgement of a complaint by Portugal to the International Court of Justice <Col N="1889" /> against Australia as regards the Timor Gap Treaty.  At stake is the respect for the status of territory as defined by the UN and the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination and to permanent sovereignty over their natural resources.  It is a crying shame that the international community has not spoken out more loudly against this blatant disregard for the natural resources which belong to the East Timorese people which would have been divided up between Indonesia and Australia.</P>
    <P>Since 1984 Portugal has taken part in direct talks with Indonesia under the aegis of the UN Secretary General in accordance with the mandate he received from the General Assembly through Resolution 37/30.  The Portuguese objective is to achieve a negotiated agreement in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter with full respect for the legitimate rights of the Timorese people.  It should not be forgotten that according to Article 73 of the Charter the rights of a colonised people should prevail over every other interest.  We should constantly remind ourselves of the first Article of the United Nations Charter, written 50 years ago, which established the new organisation on the foundation of friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples. The common first Articles of the International Covenants declare that all people have the right to self-determination and by virtue of that right to freely determine their political status and to freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.  The International Court has given its blessing to the self-determination of people as a legal right as in Namibia and Western Sahara, for example.</P>
    <P>One of the things which Portugal has consistently spoken out against is the provision of arms to Indonesia and it has stressed the importance of mobilising international efforts to stop the supply of arms to Indonesia.  Another Senator also spoke about this.  It is <Col N="1890" /> immoral to supply Indonesia with the means to perpetuate the occupation and control of these people.  Nobody should have any illusions about the worth of any guarantees given because they do not hold up.  When we speak of Portugal and East Timor, we must also look at Indonesia, which is a huge state, one of the fastest growing in the world.  It has a huge population and its annual growth rate has been nearly 7 per cent for the past 25 years.  By the year 2020 it is expected that Indonesia will be the world's fifth largest economy.</P>
    <P>Australia deals with this country, as does New Zealand.  Australia was one of the first country's to support the Indonesian demand for self-determination 50 years ago.  In the UN Security Council, Australia objected to the police action when the Netherlands sought to re-impose colonial rule.  We should remember that.  However, in 1979 Australia recognised Indonesia's <i>de facto</i> sovereignty over East Timor and in 1985, under Mr. Bob Hawke's Government, it gave <i>de jure</i> recognition of sovereignty. Australia is one of approximately 30 countries, many of which are in the Asian Pacific region, which does so.  In December 1989 Australia signed the Timor Gap Treaty with Indonesia. Australia's highest court upheld the validity of the Timor Gap Treaty which is legal there, but it determined that even if it was unlawful in international law, it could not be challenged successfully in an Australian court, not that it makes much difference internationally.  We await the outcome of the other court case.</P>
    <P>The people of Australia have become uneasy in recent times about the way their Government has behaved.  There has been pressure from within and from outside Australia on the Government to modify its dealings with the Indonesians. There has been pressure to insist upon an improvement Pressure has been exerted to insist upon an improvement of the military's record on human rights in East Timor, to demand respect for the religious and cultural traditions of the East Timorese people and to <Col N="1891" /> terminate aid, particularly military aid, to Indonesia in the interim.  There have also been calls in some quarters to repeal the 1989 Timor Gap Treaty.  New Zealand and Australia have huge markets in Indonesia.  Therefore, it may be unrealistic to expect too much from them.  It is only through international pressure that change will occur.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church in Australia, including Cardinal Clancy of Sydney who has been highly critical of the Australian Government.  I would also like to pay tribute to the Auxiliary Bishop of Melbourne, Monsignor Hilton Deakin, who is one of the few non-Indonesians to visit East Timor in the past 20 years.  He returned with an image of a people without a voice, terribly oppressed but courageous, and determined, like Bishop Ximenes Belo, who despite surviving death threats and two assassination attempts by individuals contracted by the occupying forces, has continued to defend the human rights, and the right to a referendum on self-determination of the people of East Timor.  His request to the Secretary General of the United Nations in February 1989, proposing the realisation of a referendum on self-determination so that the people might choose their future, testified to his own courageous attitudes.</P>
    <P>Monsignor Hilton Deakin has had many dealings with the president and secretary of the Portuguese Council of Catholic Bishops, the president of the Portuguese Catholic University, Monsignor Jose Policarpo and the Cardinal of Lisbon.  These have been very enlightening and encourage the strengthening of links between the Catholic Church in Australia, Portugal and East Timor.  It should be noted that the number of Catholics in East Timor rose from 30 per cent in 1974 to over 80 per cent as a reaction to the occupation by the forces of Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim country.  Catholicism has also become a very important component of Timorese nationalism and of <Col N="1892" /> resistance to the Indonesian occupation. I feel that tribute should be paid to these individuals due to their activities within the cause.</P>
    <P>Some good news has come from East Timor.  This includes the establishment of an Indonesian national commission for human rights, the conducting of international workshops on human rights, the expressed interest of the president on the ratification of more international human rights treaties, the investigation by the military honour council and the human rights commission of the Dili massacre in 1991 and the punishment of soldiers for proven misconduct when previously they would have been protected by the military. According to some reports there has been growing evidence of the independence of the judiciary in Indonesia in recent times.  A downgrading of the military command structure in East Timor took place in April 1993. However, this does not excuse the fact that the occupation continues, as repeated reports of acts of violence in East Timor indicate.  The abiding problem of denying a people their right to self-determination remains.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion as to whether or not the East Timorese people are part of Indonesia.  If we consider the findings of the UNESCO committees, where unanimity exists about the features of a &ldquo;people&rdquo; for the purposes of the people's right in international law to self-determination, four features were described: (1) That the people concerned had common elements of history, tradition, racial or ethnic identity, cultural homogeneity, linguistic unity, religious ideological affinity, territorial connection and common economic life; (2) that they were sufficiently numerous to be a people for the purposes of international law; (3) that they had the institutions which gave expression to their commonalties as a people and (4) that they exhibited the will to be, and to be seen to be, a people entitled to exercise the self-determination right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> There is no doubt that the people of East Timor have these characteristics and continue to manifest them.  By the general criteria and the long-established standards of the colonised people, the people of East Timor enjoy the right to self-determination under international law.  The Secretary General of the United Nations, through his special representative, Mr. F. van der Ell, continues to offer the good offices of the United Nations to resolve the differences between Indonesia and Portugal over East Timor.  Many people were doubtful that things would change.  It might have been different if East Timor had not been integrated, but that has happened.  It will be difficult to get away from that fact.  Many people, particularly in Indonesia, are afraid that if East Timor were to become independent from Indonesia, separatist movements would develop in certain areas. These problems can be solved, however.</P>
    <P>We have to keep up the pressure.  I was proud to be part of the delegation that contributed to this declaration. Having adopted it in this Parliament, we are committed to courses of action which may escape the notice of the Government but will return to haunt us because the commitments in this declaration are real.  I hope we honour them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will quote from two sources.  The first is Mr. José Manuel Durao Barroso, who said:</P>
    <P>I earlier called the cause of East Timor noble and idealistic.  Let me make it clear that these words do not entail any lack of realism regarding the objectives of that cause.  I am firmly convinced that the self-determination of East Timor will be a reality.  A few years ago the self-determination of Namibia, the independence of Eritrea and of the Baltic countries, the evolution of Palestine and South Africa did not seem realistic.  Nevertheless, these realities are now before your eyes.  That reinforces our confidence and determination to continue to act in defence of the just cause of East Timor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> The events in our own country, where the long-standing occupation is slowly coming to an end, also reinforce a belief in the self-determination of formerly colonised people.  I will end with a quotation from a speech by Justice Michael Kirby from Australia.  At the conclusion of the conference he said:</P>
    <P>Far away in East Timor are the people who know the answer to the riddle which we are examining.  The answer belongs to them.  It does not belong to states, to countries, history, geography or economics.  Those who are pessimistic should remember the enormous progress that we have seen in the past decade.  In due course, freedom will also come to East Timor.  It may be freedom freely chosen within Indonesia, it may be the freedom of independence.  International law promises that that freedom belongs to the people of East Timor.  No one else has the right to take it away or deny it.  Ultimately that freedom will prevail.</P>
    <P>I hope that the people of East Timor, who suffer in horrific ways every day, will achieve the right to self-determination. They can exercise that right any way they wish thereafter.  This fundamental right cannot continue to be denied to an independent sovereign people, overrun by a stronger military power</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues in relation to the resolution itself, which has the support of all parties in this House.  I welcome our distinguished guests, who represent the East Timorese action group in Ireland, and the distinguished journalist who has visited and been deported from East Timor.  It is fitting that we salute the dead of East Timor, those who have suffered torture or rape and those who risked &mdash; in some cases lost &mdash; their lives in attempting to report the carnage taking place in that country to the rest of the world.  Many parallels could be drawn between Ireland and East Timor. On a sunny afternoon in Dublin it may <Col N="1895" /> seem a rather pointless to pass resolutions or condemn foreign governments thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>Whenever the question of the birth of our own country's independence and successive Irish rebellions &mdash; long before the global village or communications that could inform people instantaneously existed &mdash; was raised in the American Congress, in the French Assembly or by courageous British MPs in the House of Commons, it was heard in every town and village in Ireland.  It gave people heart.</P>
      <P>It is of profound importance that this resolution be quickly discussed, debated and agreed in our Parliament, which has the history I have outlined.  It is vitally important that the voices of the East Timorese people are heard in this House.  It is even more important, when the Indonesian military straps people to iron cots and attaches electrodes to their bodies, that those screams are heard here and when women and children are brutalised, raped and killed, that their screams are heard here.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely important day for those people who are oppressed.  I have no doubt, just as in this country, that this resolution and the ones which will be passed throughout Europe, will be heard and discussed by people in the villages and towns of East Timor and will give them the heart, will, strength and encouragement to carry on to achieve the freedom and independence which is rightly theirs and which we enjoy in this country and for which we paid in blood and torture.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon referred to the arms dealers.  There is no point in appealing to arms dealers.  It was interesting that in the Gulf War the munitions used by the Iraqis came from Britain and America. The torpedo boats used by the Iraqi Navy came from Brooklyn and the components for the gas the Iraqis dropped on the Kurds were manufactured in New Jersey.  Appealing to arms dealers to have consciences is a contradiction in terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> The actions of the Australian Government have long been a source of condemnation.  There are little gleams of light that the Australians, who are reputed to have pretty hard necks, are finding it more and more difficult to defend internationally their position from a trade or any other standpoint.  I believe the pressure the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, has applied, and I know will continue to apply, will have that effect.</P>
    <P>When Ireland assumes the Presidency of the EU in the second half of 1996, we will be in a unique position to apply not just moral but also strong political and, perhaps, economic pressure.  We cannot have a situation in which we are kind of in favour of people not being shot, murdered or raped.  We cannot be kind of in favour of independence.  We are for the principle of democratic rule or we are not.  The EU has a unique opportunity to prove it can match its words with action.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a good record in relation to emerging nations in Asia and Africa. Long before the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton, who will reply to the debate, held exalted office, she had a tremendous record in the Labour Party on civil and human rights.  She is uniquely qualified in many ways to hold her present position and to have an impact on the situation in East Timor because of her work in the Third World as a teacher and now as a politician.</P>
    <P>It would be pointless to repeat a great deal of the eloquent contributions which were made, particularly by Senator Norris.  Great credit is to due to him.  He repeatedly raised this issue almost on a weekly basis and it is right and proper that he be given credit for it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Irish delegation to the Lisbon conference.  It is unanimously agreed that they did an excellent job and what emanated from the conference will go a long way towards ensuring that the conditions in East Timor and of its people will be kept on the political agenda in Europe.  This is <Col N="1897" /> extremely important and as much as can be hoped for in my opinion.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and compliment those who have worked hard, in a lonely and silent way in some cases, because there was not a great deal of interest in this issue as people were getting on with their lives.  I am sure that organisations and journalists who tried to keep it alive were ploughing fallow land.  I believe that insufficient recognition is given to people who risk their lives to bring us news of events throughout the world, particularly in war areas.  I am mindful of people like Mr. Bob Fisk who would have known about the Israelis and the camps in Chatila.  Nobody would have known about this if journalists had not gone there at great risk to their own lives to show the world what was happening and to make it act.  I salute them and the victims of the Indonesian Government's policies.  I hope this motion will lead to pressure being brought to bear on the Indonesians to accept the inevitable; the people of East Timor will be free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like some of the previous speakers, I was privileged to attend the conference in Lisbon.  I was a little dismayed the first day because I felt we had been brought there to sign a package which had already been agreed. While it may have been agreed by some Portuguese parliamentarians, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Lisbon and the diplomats working there were extraordinarily pleased by the objections put forward about this plan. We are very good at praising ourselves today but the Irish delegation was very important in resisting this move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two sessions on the first day.  We decided that each session should be attended by members of the delegation.  Deputy Lynch and I attended one of the sessions, at which after four hours it was agreed that East Timor was the victim, Indonesia the aggressor, the people from a western culture will side with the victim and the UN is the judge but cannot enforce the sentence.  Some people said we could <Col N="1898" /> have been sent postcards telling us of these decisions without having to go to Lisbon at all.  There was a tremendous feeling that it was most urgent that the conference produce something concrete. This is why it was so important that interventions by Senator Taylor-Quinn in particular were noted and the whole atmosphere at the conference changed.</P>
    <P>It is also important that there was a large number of Australian and New Zealand parliamentarians there.  An amazing number of them had Irish connections and I want to point out the value of using the Irish diaspora in this situation.  I have been in contact with one of these parliamentarians because they explained to me that in New Zealand, which is not quite as important as Australia in this matter, there is a strong feeling among the general public that the Australian Government in particular, and the New Zealand Government to a lesser extent, should become much less involved with the Indonesians on certain matters.  It would be well worth our while writing to those parliamentarians to ask them to raise with their foreign affairs committees our objections to the involvement of these two countries in military matters with Indonesia.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Magner.  It is a splendid idea to ask for the sale of arms to Indonesia to be banned, but when one realises that arms were sold by every nation that apparently banned the selling of arms to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war, one begins to despair.  It may be a question of seeing which country sells the arms first.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of joint military training.  This is a deplorable situation but something could be done about it.  For example, if pressure was applied to the New Zealand Government, it might do something.  That is an area in which we could lodge the strongest objections.  The New Zealand parliamentarians to whom I spoke said that something could be done if there was a little more support from the outside.  We are always talking about the Irish vote <Col N="1899" /> in the United States, but there is also a strong Irish vote in New Zealand and Australia.  I suggest that the Department of Foreign Affairs write to the New Zealand Administration; we can also write to individual parliamentarians. The New Zealand Administration is to be involved shortly in joint military training with the Indonesian Army.  The Indonesians rely to a great extent on both of these groups for training, which seems extraordinary.  If more pressure was put on New Zealand regarding the training, it would show our strong objection to what is happening in East Timor.  It is amazing to discover the amount of training the Australians are giving to the Indonesian Army; we could build a policy around this.</P>
    <P>Having written a letter to the <i>Bangkok Times</i> on the atrocities on the Thai-Burmese border and getting a response, it might also be worthwhile writing to Australian and New Zealand newspapers. I stress Australia and New Zealand &mdash; of course all countries should object &mdash; because they are important to Indonesia from an economic point of view and letters to their newspapers signed by a Member of this House would do no harm.  Our embassy can also keep making our objections known in both countries.  There are practical measures that we can take as well as the more extensive ones that Mr. Justice Kirby pointed out in his excellent summing up of what he felt should be done.</P>
    <P>The only other country I can see in the region over which we might have some influence is Japan.  The Japanese representatives we met at the conference seemed open to discussion on this subject and evidenced concern about the impact its involvement with Indonesia might have on trade.  After all, we have many economic connections with Japan.  I suggest that avenue could also be pursued.</P>
    <P>It was impossible not to be moved by the appalling accounts the members of the various resistance groups told us. Senator Magner described some of the <Col N="1900" /> atrocities that are going on there, but the brutality meted out by that regime is extraordinary.  I have been to Indonesia and it was the only country I have visited where I felt a great sense of fear among a substantial number of its population. It is hard to imagine what the current situation must be like for the people in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Our objections are worthwhile. People ask what we can do about events occurring on the other side of the world. We do have influence there, particularly in Australia and New Zealand.  On an individual as well as a national basis, I would like to see us trying to cash in on that influence a little more.  My most urgent wish would be that neither the Australian or New Zealand Armies should give any more co-operation in the training of the Indonesian Army because they are only training those who go out to commit genocide.</P>
    <P>In case anyone thinks I had a falling out with Tom Hyland, I want to say that I am glad to see him present in the Public Gallery.  I too recognise what a tremendous contribution he has made to this debate in Ireland.  I also want to praise those members of the press who have put their lives in danger by reporting from an area where there is no safe haven for anyone and there is little in the way of respect for freedom of speech or reporting.  It is essential that we ensure that those who died have not done so in vain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion. All too often, our delegates go abroad to conferences but seldom do we get any response.  It is important that this debate is taking place and the fact that we have put it at the top of our agenda shows our concern for East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that some sections of the media appear to consider our deliberations irrelevant because they are missing out on debates which often reflect the concerns of the Irish people at large.  Senators have lost no opportunity to ensure that the plight of the East Timorese people remains at the top of the political agenda, but talk must <Col N="1901" /> be accompanied by action.  We should start by looking for action on the trade between Ireland and Indonesia and between the European Union and Indonesia.  People rarely come before profit and that has been especially clear in the case of Indonesia.</P>
    <P>I would like for a moment to focus on the role which trade has played both in the Indonesian regime and the role which selected sanctions could play in persuading the Indonesian authorities to observe human rights in East Timor, Irian Jaya, North Sumatra and Indonesia itself.</P>
    <P>The situation in East Timor is by no means unique.  The process of invasion, settlement and institutionalised discrimination has been repeated all over the world in slightly different forms. What is unusual in the case of East Timor is that the Indonesian occupation is not recognised by the United Nations, which regards Portugal, rather than Indonesia, as the administering power of East Timor.  This places East Timor in a position similar to that of Namibia prior to independence where the South African occupation was not recognised by the United Nations, which continued to regard Namibia as a mandated territory under terms deriving from the League of Nations.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the efforts of both the United Nations and the Portuguese authorities with regard to East Timor have been greeted with little more than an indulgent smile by those countries with vested economic interests in Indonesia, East Timor or Irian Jaya.  All in all, the United Nations has adopted ten resolutions relating to East Timor. It is regrettable that the international community has not acted on them with the same determination they displayed in the case of Kuwait.</P>
    <P>Let us face it, Indonesia is an international crook.  The following are just some of the international laws and conventions which it has breached; the United Nations Charter, the 1949 Geneva Convention, the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation <Col N="1902" /> among States and the UN General Assembly Resolution 31/53 of 1 December 1976.  In addition, Indonesia has breached its own code of criminal procedure on numerous occasions. Most dispassionate observers must wonder why, in the face of repeated breaches of both international and domestic law, the Security Council has not resolved to impose sanctions in accordance with Article 41 of the United Nations Charter, which provides for complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio and other means of communications, and the severance of diplomatic relations.</P>
    <P>There have, of course, been numerous contacts between the United Nations and the Indonesian authorities regarding East Timor and the role of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in facilitating talks has been particularly valuable.  The UN Commission on Human Rights, together with the International Committee of the Red Cross, have also played an important role in gathering information and monitoring human rights abuses.  I am sure all Members are familiar with the recent report prepared for the commission by the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions.  The actions taken by the UN to date, however, have had little impact on the Indonesian authorities.  Indeed, one cannot avoid the impression that Indonesia is merely playing international opinion on a string.</P>
    <P>Much of the world today is organised in economic blocs of one form or another, and in many cases these blocs have been a force for peace, stability and human rights.  Indonesia, together with Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, is a member of ASEAN &mdash; the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations.  At a foreign Ministers meeting in September 1994, the EU and ASEAN Ministers issued a joint declaration, part of which stated:</P>
    <P>The Ministers emphasised their common commitment to the promotion <Col N="1903" /> of and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. They expressed their strong support for the successful implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.</P>
    <P>That statement, to which the Indonesian Minister was a signatory last year, must ring hollow in the ears of the thousands of East Timorese and Indonesians who have been systematically brutalised by the Indonesian regime.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the need for continuing contacts between the EU and ASEAN. However, I feel that more pressure must be exerted by the EU on ASEAN in general, and Indonesia in particular, if the EU is to fully live up to its Treaty of Rome aspirations.  In particular, I am concerned that our own Government received the Indonesian Ambassador as part of an ASEAN delegation.  This sends conflicting signals both to Indonesia and to the beleaguered people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>Since the Indonesian invasion ten years ago, one-third of the East Timorese people has been exterminated while the rest of the world has stood idly by.  The Governments of France, Britain, Australia and Japan, in particular, seem determined to maintain the <i>status quo.</i>  In effect, the oil trade and the arms trade have conspired against the East Timorese people.</P>
    <P>I do not, however, believe that we can view East Timor in isolation from other territories occupied by Indonesia, as I have already mentioned, in particular, Irian Jaya and North Sumatra.  International economic, political and military support for the Indonesian regime has enabled it to conduct campaigns of oppression in both territories, although admittedly on a lower scale than in East Timor, nor should we forget the numerous breaches of human rights within Indonesia itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1904" /> The iniquitous role played by Australia in East Timor is well documented, and in February of this year Australia was arraigned at the International Court of Human Rights for its collaboration with the Indonesian authorities.  Indeed, the role played by Australia in the East Timorese tragedy has been a particularly ignominious one.  In 1989, Australia and Indonesia signed the so-called Timor Gap Treaty, permitting Australia and other multinational oil companies to drill for oil off the East Timor seabed. It is estimated that the area off East Timor may yield several million barrels of oil, and oil, as we have witnessed before, counts for far more than human rights.</P>
    <P>I am aware that talks are currently ongoing between the Indonesian and Portuguese Governments under the auspices of the United Nations, and that negotiations are now due to start in June, having been postponed from April.  While I wish these talks well, I feel that there is also a role to be played by both the United Nations and the European Union in examining the various options in respect of sanctions should the current talks not result in a satisfactory resolution of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Indonesian regime, and its occupation of East Timor and other territories, is being shored up by trade.  It is my belief that trade &mdash; or the absence of trade &mdash; is also the key to ending the Indonesian occupation of East Timor and vindicating the East Timorese people's right to self-determination.  I have already identified the big players in the economic game being played between Indonesia and the rest of the world.  Unfortunately, there are also smaller players.</P>
    <P>I was surprised, and indeed disappointed, to learn from my colleague, Deputy Lynch, that the total volume of trade has actually increased from £16,277,000 in 1989 to £42,338,000 in 1993.  In just four years, trade between Ireland and Indonesia has increased over two and a half times.  The total volume of trade is, however, minute, if compared with traditional large trading <Col N="1905" /> nations such as Britain and France.  I understand the difficulty of imposing unilateral sanctions against third countries. but I do not believe that unilateral sanctions on their own work.  Portugal has had comprehensive trade sanctions in place since the Indonesian invasion in 1975, yet ten years on they have done little to dissuade the Indonesians.  I believe the time is fast approaching when we must press in international fora, both at UN and EU level, for selective sanctions to be adopted on a co-ordinated and monitored basis.</P>
    <P>If the current talks do not reach a satisfactory resolution, I believe that phased and selective trading sanctions should be introduced, starting with State and semi-State enterprises and joint ventures.  In this regard, I was disappointed recently to learn that the Irish electricity utility is engaged in two joint ventures with Indonesian utilities. The withdrawal of such co-operation, and similar joint ventures by other EU utilities, would, I believe, have a significant impact on the Indonesian military-industrial complex, while having few adverse effects on the civilian population.</P>
    <P>The merits of sanctions have often been debated.  Many argue that they are ineffectual and, indeed, one need only point to the oil supplies which continue to penetrate the blockade around Serbia to see how ineffectual unco-ordinated sanctions can be.  Others point to the effect of sanctions on non-combatant civilian populations and, in particular, children.  We are all conscious of the immense human suffering which has been caused by the US blockade of Cuba or the sanctions against Iraq. These side effects can be avoided by selectivity and careful monitoring by international agencies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross or UNICEF, as well as non-governmental organisations such as Christian Aid, Caritas or Concern.</P>
    <P>Sanctions have worked in the past and they can work again.  The co-ordinated effort to impose selective sanctions on South Africa led, it is generally <Col N="1906" /> acknowledged, to the release of Nelson Mandela, the unbanning of the ANC and the UDF and the democratic elections which took place on 27 April last year.  Had sanctions not been imposed, South Africa would probably today be either still in the grip of apartheid or in the throes of a bloody civil war.  We owe it to the people of East Timor to demonstrate the same international solidarity and resolution which eventually brought an end to apartheid.</P>
    <P>In 1996 Ireland will hold the Presidency of the EU and I hope the Irish Government will use its EU Presidency to put East Timor at the top of the European political agenda and to ensure that the EU adopts a resolute and unified position in this matter.  In particular, the EU as a whole should support Portugal in its efforts to find a solution to a problem which has so far left over 200,000 East Timorese dead and many more maimed for life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House for very long this afternoon.  I join with the other speakers in welcoming the opportunity to discuss East Timor.</P>
      <P>To many people, East Timor is at the other end of the world and questions might be asked as to why we take such an interest in it.  However, we all have consciences and we must express our abhorrence of the horrific attitude of the Indonesian Government to the rape of East Timor and the slaughter of its people.  The former President of Portugal put it well when he quoted from a poem by Santiago:</P>
      <P>Abandoned there at the ends of the earth in a land no longer our own.</P>
      <P>Slaves, now, we are guilty.</P>
      <P>Those who remain are dying slowly and every man there lives a truth.</P>
      <P>We die a little every day when we lose strength and freedom.</P>
      <P>There is no dying slowly in the East Timorese situation.  Over 200,000 people have been slaughtered by the Indonesians since they took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> The Portuguese have of late attempted to help in the resolution of the problems in that country but we must remember that they were the colonial power from 1702 until 1975.  They left behind, as colonial powers usually do, a country which was ready for raping by the invading forces of Indonesia. Another former colony of Portugal, Mozambique, is the third poorest nation in the world because of the lack of input by the Portuguese before they withdrew.</P>
    <P>The conference held in Portugal recently was important in forming world opinion in regard to the plight of the East Timorese people.  It was appropriate that it was held in Portugal but the Portuguese must work much harder than they have done in the past toward a resolution of the problems of East Timor.  Some 200,00 people have been killed, many of whom were tortured or raped first.  We must condemn the Indonesian Government for their actions in East Timor, and the Indonesian people for concurring with those actions.</P>
    <P>East Timor would not be important to Indonesia were it not for the fact that it is rich in oil and other natural resources.  Not alone have these natural resources been misused since the Indonesians moved in, but they have been misused to the detriment of the remaining East Timorese people.  There would not be much interest on the Indonesian side were it not for the value of East Timor's natural assets.  The international community has been very fast to move into other areas to try to resolve problems but because East Timor is a very small country and not of great international importance, nothing has been done.  However, East Timor is of great importance to the people who live there.</P>
    <P>We must condemn the attitude of the Australians because, without their help, the Indonesians could not have annexed East Timor to the same degree.  We can often be proud of what the Irish in Australia have done since the colonisation <Col N="1908" /> of Australia approximately 210 years ago.  If we are proud that 40 per cent of the population of Australia is Irish or of Irish descent, then we must condemn that 40 per cent of the population of Australia for not getting involved in an attempt to relieve the people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>Europe's arms industry has profited substantially by supplying arms to Indonesia.  It is suggested that these arms will not be used against the East Timorese people, but if one supplies arms to Indonesia, which is occupying East Timor, it is not possible to stipulate that the shipment of arms being sold cannot be used in East Timor but can be used for protection of Indonesia's own territory.  This naive view has been foisted upon us by certain people from the supplying countries.  The wishes of the East Timorese are not listened to by the European Union.  Even today members of the European Union are supplying arms to that part of the world.</P>
    <P>Does anybody take note when a debate like this takes place within the Houses of the Oireachtas?  I often wonder whether there is any real result from such a debate other than the fact that it gives the issue an airing and a little publicity.  A matter raised in this House does not get very much publicity.  It might get ten or 15 seconds on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, but it will definitely not be mentioned in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> It might be mentioned in <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> Publicity values are not what they should be.</P>
    <P>Genocide is a crime against humanity. An international day of solidarity with the people of East Timor is to be organised for December.  For many years one day in November has been recognised as a day of international support for the Palestinian people.  I ask our representatives at the United Nations to get involved in the efforts to have a day of international support for East Timor raised at United Nations level.  I ask that our Ambassador to the UN and the other people involved at a political level <Col N="1909" /> in our mission to the United Nations to fight very hard on this issue.</P>
    <P>Indonesia's power in the world is not of great significance but, having said that, it has been able to assimilate East Timor and kill a huge proportion of its people.  One wonders whether a trade embargo on Indonesia would succeed where everything else has failed; it would highlight the position of the East Timorese to a greater degree than at present.  If the Indonesians are hurt in their pockets they might be persuaded to withdraw completely from East Timor, which is what most people on the international stage want.</P>
    <P>The super powers &mdash; by which I mean the USA, Russia and the EU &mdash; should become involved and be much more active in their efforts to regularise the political system in East Timor and get the Indonesians out as quickly as possible. Our friendship with the Australian people must suffer because of their country's actions in this region.</P>
    <P>Thankfully the UN has never recognised the annexation of East Timor by Indonesia but it has not intervened as it did in Bosnia, Haiti and Iraq.  If there was a multinational effort on the same scale as Operation Desert Storm, the force which aided Kuwait, or the force in Bosnia &mdash; although that has not been successful &mdash; it would help the situation.</P>
    <P>Like other Members I agree with the motion.  The Tánaiste and our representatives at the UN and the EU should fight to have 7 December recognised as the international day of solidarity for East Timor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators and Deputies who participated at the conference, at which there was substantial representation from Ireland.  I listened with great interest to the points made by contributors this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all else, the situation in Indonesia and East Timor is a consequence of some of the worst forms of cold war politics.  If one looks at the history of that region in the context of the <Col N="1910" /> developments of the 1960s and 1970s, one sees that this is unfinished business from the cold war.  Professor Noam Chomsky almost single-handedly brought what happened there to the attention of the northern and western world.  He and the many journalists and media people who laboured long and hard to highlight East Timor deserve our thanks and commendation.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of why we should be interested in East Timor as we do not have a presence there, nor do we have a traditional missionary connection as would be the case elsewhere.  In that respect one has to congratulate the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Group, who took up the issue, informed public opinion and briefed Deputies and Senators over a number of years, to the extent that it is not merely Members of this House who feel a strong commitment to the case for human rights in East Timor.  I know that view is shared especially by many schoolchildren and students.  As with the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, we have taken this issue to heart and Ireland will continue to press at parliamentary, governmental and individual levels whenever we can.</P>
    <P>The Government can support the Lisbon Declaration which I understand was adopted unanimously.  The declaration appears to be in two parts and some subjects are mentioned in both, for instance, the question of an arms embargo is referred to in paragraph 3 of the first part and paragraph 11 of the second.  There are a number of items in the declaration which call for attention.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the declaration calls on the United Nations to ensure the respect for human rights in East Timor. This has been the cornerstone of Irish Government policy.  As Senators will be aware, the chairman's statement, adopted by consensus by all the participants, including Indonesia, at this year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in January, expressed deep concern over the continuing reports of violation of human rights in East Timor.  Reports would indicate that <Col N="1911" /> the situation has not improved since then.  I attended the commission session in Geneva where I spoke about East Timor and met its foreign representative.</P>
    <P>The chairman's statement records Indonesia's undertaking to invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit East Timor this year and to report to the next session of the Commission on Human Rights.  Indonesia has also undertaken to invite the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the working group on arbitrary detention to visit East Timor when it is necessary for them to do so in order to fulfil their duties.</P>
    <P>Indonesia's commitment to receive the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the relevant special rapporteur and working group is a positive outcome from this year's CHR.  The visit of the Commission on Human Rights Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, Mr. Bacre Waly Ndiaye, to East Timor in July 1994, and his subsequent detailed and severe report which was submitted to this year's CHR has certainly increased the pressure on the Indonesian authorities to address the situation in East Timor.</P>
    <P>It is important that this international pressure be maintained, and that Indonesia follows through on its commitment to allow access to United Nations representatives, especially the High Commissioner for Human Rights. I can assure Senators that the Government will continue to support any initiative taken by the UN to ensure respect for human rights in East Timor. We hope the Indonesian authorities are doing their best to comply with the terms of resolutions and the recommendations of reports adopted by UN bodies.</P>
    <P>As contributors have said, this is the 50th anniversary of the UN and its future role and relevance are being debate in many quarters.  I hold the opinion that the future of the UN will in large measure be judged by its <Col N="1912" /> capacity to come to grips with situations like East Timor, using positive and preventive diplomacy.  As part of our continuing and increasing contributions to UN multilateral agencies, we have, this year, substantially increased our funding for the work of the office of the Special Rapporteur and the various UN agencies which deal with torture.  It is important, in terms of our development budget, to contribute to that work because it is highly technical and specialised.</P>
    <P>The other issue which I regard as urgent in relation to the United Nations &mdash; it was referred to today &mdash; is that of a permanent international criminal tribunal for crimes against humanity.  The special tribunal in the former Yugoslavia and the work being done in the tribunal on the crimes of genocide in Rwanda show that the mechanisms of special tribunals are, unfortunately, slow and complex.  There is a need at UN level to establish an international criminal court.  This mechanism would speedily address issues such as East Timor.</P>
    <P>The declaration, which has been adopted, urges the UN and all Governments and Parliaments of the countries which have been selling arms to Indonesia to take measures aimed at enforcing an embargo to such trade condemned by the European Parliament and by the international community.  It also talks about a selective arms embargo.  The Government is well aware of the role which is played by the Indonesian military forces in maintaining control over East Timor and would fully support the taking of such measures.</P>
    <P>We also endorse the view of the Portuguese Foreign Minister who said at the Lisbon conference:</P>
    <P>I would like to underline the importance of mobilising opposition to the supply of military equipment to Indonesia, because it is the Indonesian military who have benefited from the occupation and exploitation of East Timor.  It is immoral to give <Col N="1913" /> them the means to continue that occupation.</P>
    <P>The Government calls on all countries supplying arms to Indonesia for use in East Timor to desist from this practice. The Government is prepared to raise the matter of the supply of arms with its partners in the EU.</P>
    <P>During the 50th anniversary of the UN one must recall that 85 per cent of the arms in the world are supplied by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.  The UN faces this moral dilemma in terms of its move towards change and reform of the organisation's role in today's world. There is no easy answer to this problem. Members spoke earlier about Ireland's moral authority as a neutral country to speak out.  We must address this area when we get the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>I now come to the case of Xanana Gusmao and Timorese political prisoners. The declaration demands the immediate release of Xanana Gusmao and all Timorese political prisoners held in custody in East Timor and Indonesia. The trial of Mr. Gusmao attracted widespread international attention and, when he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1993, there were protests from around the world.  The Tánaiste wrote to the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ali Alatas, at that time.  The response was to reduce his sentence to 20 years. I take this opportunity to repeat that it is essential that he and other political prisoners be released.  A number of Senators mentioned the possibility of our Ambassador visiting Mr. Gusmao in prison.  This could be examined, particularly in the context of the suggestion that an eminent group of persons would visit him.  I am prepared to ask the Tánaiste to consider our participation, if invited, in such a group.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes the second part of the declaration entitled, &ldquo;Suggestions for a Plan of Action on East Timor&rdquo;, which was adopted by the conference.  The Government supports the use of opportunities at whatever level and in whatever form to highlight <Col N="1914" /> the situation in East Timor.  The plan of action contains many useful suggestions on how this might be achieved effectively in Parliament and sub-national Parliaments in the United Nations and other areas.  These suggestions amount to a challenging and substantial programme of work which, as I have said, will further the cause of the people of East Timor and bring to bear a much more constant focus on it.</P>
    <P>The proposal for parliamentary missions to visit Indonesia and East Timor in order to inspect and report on the position of human rights, the rule of law and the demand for self-determination by the people of East Timor is welcome. It was good to see the Indonesian authorities reiterating their commitment to allow access to human rights, humanitarian organisations and international media to East Timor at this year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  However, it is clear that the Indonesian authorities are continuing to decide on what terms they will permit access.  It is important that international pressure be maintained on the Indonesian authorities to permit full, free and open access to all groups, including parliamentary delegations, to East Timor.</P>
    <P>The plan of action calls for the issue of East Timor to be raised in the organs of the European Union.  The Government regularly makes known its concern about the situation in East Timor to our partners in the Union and we will continue to do so.  As is done in the Lisbon Declaration, I also pay tribute once again to the patient heroism of the people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the all-inclusive intra-Timorese dialogue which, as Senators will be aware, took place in Austria from 3 to 5 June, almost coinciding with the Lisbon conference. It is a positive sign when two meetings such as these take place together.  These talks, at which Timorese, both those who accept and those who reject Indonesia's presence in East Timor, were represented had, in the words of the Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs, the potential to give an <Col N="1915" /> important impetus to the process of direct dialogue with Indonesia under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>At the end of the meeting the Burg-Schlaining Declaration was adopted by the 30 East Timorese delegates, representing a broad cross-section of political opinion from inside and outside the territory.  This declaration proposes to the UN Secretary General the holding of another intra-Timorese dialogue with a view to continuing the debate on issues discussed by the participants.  It suggests that such meetings should precede each round of talks between the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal which take place under the auspices of the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>In their declaration the participants reaffirmed the need to implement the necessary measures in the field of human rights and other areas with a view to promoting peace, stability, justice and social harmony.  They also reaffirm the necessity for social and cultural development of East Timor to be based on the preservation of the cultural identity of the people, including the teaching of the Tetun and Portuguese languages.  The declaration expresses the need to create the basis for the involvement of all East Timorese without discrimination of any sort in the development of East Timor in a climate of mutual understanding, tolerance and harmony.  Furthermore, the declaration affirms the importance of the ongoing negotiations between the Governments of Indonesia and Portugal under the auspices of the Secretary General which aim at finding a just and lasting peace.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that some time after the meeting had ended the pro-Indonesian side dissociated themselves from the last phrase containing the reference to UNGA Resolution 37/30.  This resolution spoke about the &ldquo;inalienable right of all peoples to self-determination and independence&rdquo;, to Portugal as the administering power in East Timor and to previous resolutions which were critical of Indonesia.  We hope that this development does not endanger the <Col N="1916" /> holding of future sessions of the intra-Timorese talks.</P>
    <P>The head of the UN team in Austria declared himself satisfied and happy with the result.  I understand that the Austrian Declaration will be discussed by the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers when they meet in Geneva on 9 July for the sixth round of the talks under the auspices of the UN Secretary General.  Like the meeting in Lisbon, the talks were another first, particularly because the role of the people of East Timor and their representatives has now been recognised.</P>
    <P>I can draw international comparisons by saying that many people thought there would never be any movement in South Africa and that Mr. Nelson Mandela would never be released.  In the context of the end of the Cold War, when there are no longer two factions who may be deemed to take specific sides with regard to conflict, we have space in which to move.  Within the additional context of this year at the UN, we have a specific and correct focus on questions of the universality of human rights and respect for the concept of self-determination.  Not only in the North of Ireland, but also between the Israelis and Palestinians there have been moves to talk.</P>
    <P>The whole question of opening, beginning and encouraging a dialogue must be seen as being of the utmost significance. It must be matched by appropriate international pressure which both commands and encourages the Indonesians to take appropriate steps to bring what has been an appalling situation and violation of human rights in East Timor to end.</P>
    <P>In addition, the whole question of the supply of arms, not just with regard to this conflict but on a world wide basis, must be addressed.  The Indonesian military is a powerful purchaser of arms. In terms of international development, one must question whether it is appropriate that countries such as Indonesia, where there has been rapid economic progress but where there is a huge amount of want and a large and growing <Col N="1917" /> population, should be encouraged by the military/industrial complex in western countries to buy more and more arms.  If we can address some of these issues and support the positive moves that are now being made, I am hopeful that within a relatively short period of time we will begin to make progress.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her contribution and the participants who attended the conference in Lisbon. They represented us very well.  I listened carefully to the full debate and recognise the progress made at the Lisbon Conference, small though it be in the context of improving the situation.  I introduced an Adjournment debate on this issue last week and wished the delegates from the House to the conference well.  I congratulate the Leader of the House in allowing this debate at such an early stage after their return.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's Government has killed, tortured and jailed its opponents at will for almost three decades under the guise of fighting communism and instability. For most of that time the international community has remained silent.  There is a simple reason for this.  From its inception, Indonesia's new order of government was seen as an important friend and ally to the west and has been spared criticism by its Asian neighbours and member states of the non aligned movement.  With the fourth largest population in the world, a vast store of natural resources and a huge supply of cheap labour, Indonesia has always been seen as an economic prize.  I welcome the fact that some Governments have now begun to voice concern with regard to East Timor and a handful have backed up their words with action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first major expression of outrage was over the Santa Cruz massacre.  A series of UN resolutions in 1992-93 and 1994 openly criticised Indonesia for its poor human rights record in East Timor.  Nevertheless, the response of the international community to Indonesia's human rights record leaves much to be desired.  Many Governments which express concern continue to supply <Col N="1918" /> to Indonesia military equipment which could be used to commit human rights violations.  The Minister referred to this in her speech.  In the past two year the UK has approved the sale of 40 jet fighters; Germany has sold three submarines and 39 other naval vessels, some with missile launchers; Switzerland approved the sale of ammunition and parts of anti-aircraft guns; Australian military conducted joint exercises and training with Indonesia's counter insurgency unit; and the EU Commission rejected proposals for an arms embargo.</P>
    <P>It is a brave thing to be a human rights activist in Indonesia and East Timor.  It can mean putting at risk the basic principles of the right to life, freedom from torture, freedom from hunger and the freedom of speech, association and belief for one's life and liberty. Thousands of people in Indonesia and East Timor have put human rights first. They need our support.  The best way to support them is to publicise the grave violation of human rights for which the Indonesian Government is responsible. In this respect I welcome this debate, one of many debates that have taken place in the House, as another way of publicising the grave violation of human rights.  I compliment the organisers and, again, compliment those who attended the conference in Portugal for work undertaken in this area.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that the international community has focused almost exclusively on the human rights problem in East Timor and, even there, only on the most dramatic incidents, such as the Santa Cruz massacre.  It is important that these are raised and that we focus on them, but not to the exclusion of everything else.  Grave violations committed by Indonesian forces throughout the area have gone virtually unnoticed or have been treated as isolated incidents rather than part of a pattern of close and systematic human rights violation which has unfolded over more than a quarter of a century.  Trade union activists are arrested, harassed and sometimes tortured.  Scores of trade <Col N="1919" /> Unionists were arrested during the wave of strikes in early 1994 and several were charged with political crimes.</P>
    <P>The Government does not depend on force alone to suppress dissent.  It also relies on a system of political control based on the state ideology, termed <i>pancasila</i>, the constitution and officially defined national goals, such as security, order and development.  Any opposition to these, however peaceful, is illegal and dealt with by firm measures.  Each year dozens of books, plays, lectures, films, meetings and poetry readings are banned.  Prisoners of conscience are serving long sentences because they were found in possession of banned books.  Farmers who resisted the appropriation of their land, writers who challenged the state's interpretation of history, Muslim preachers, labour activists, activists for democratisation of the system, human rights lawyers, advocates of independence for East Timor all risk accusations of being subversives, communists, terrorists or traitors.  They risk arbitrary detention, torture, imprisonment or death &mdash; a powerful deterrent to all but the most courageous.</P>
    <P>In this debate we should call on the Indonesian Government to resolve to provide redress for human rights violations, to investigate political killings and the disappearance of political activists.  All prisoners of conscience should be released and it should provide fair trials for or release of all political prisoners.  We should call on the Indonesian Government to compensate victims and their relatives and to bring those responsible for abuses to justice.  It should also introduce clear policies which will provide for the expression of human rights in East Timor, abolish the death penalty, prohibit extra judicial executions and torture and the use in the courts of East Timor of evidence obtained under torture, ensure that all detainees have access to lawyers of their choice as well as to doctors and relatives, and repeal the anti subversion laws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> What can the Irish Government do as part of the EU?  The EU must urge the Indonesian Government to invite the relevant UN bodies to visit Indonesia and East Timor.  We should also urge the Indonesian Government to implement the UN recommendations on preventing torture and extra judicial executions.  The Government should ensure that the human rights situation in East Timor and Indonesia is monitored under the auspices of the UN and we should demand that the Indonesian Government accede to the international human rights standards.</P>
    <P>The Government, through the EU, should also ask the Indonesian Government to ensure asylum seekers are not returned to Indonesia or East Timor if they are at risk of serious human rights violations there.  This should apply to all nations.  We should recognise that asylum seekers from East Timor or Indonesia risk serious human rights violations, torture and possibly death if they returned.</P>
    <P>Seven years is enough time for the rulers of any state to restore human rights and 27 years is far too long for those who have suffered such theft to have to defend and uphold their rights. The violation of human rights since 1965 must stop.  In that time hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed, their mutilated bodies sometimes left in a public place to rot.  Prisoners, both political and criminal, have been routinely tortured and ill treated, some so severely that they died or suffered permanent injury.  Following show trials, thousands of people have been imprisoned solely for their peaceful, political or religious views.  Scores of prisoners have been killed by firing squad, some after more than two decades on death row.</P>
    <P>Political killings provide the most dramatic evidence of the magnitude of the human rights problem in Indonesia and East Timor.  The wholesale slaughter which followed the 1965 coup, when between 500,000 and one million people were killed, appears to have established <Col N="1921" /> a precedent for dealing with political opponents in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Last week I acknowledged the Tánaiste's statements to this House in April when he expressed the great concern in Ireland at the situation in East Timor and at the gross abuse of human rights which has been reported from the territory.  International pressure must be mobilised to stop the persecution of the East Timorese people.  Evidence is still coming through of the continuing atrocities. I thank, as I did last week, the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign for giving us some information in this area.</P>
    <P>On 16 May a male nurse, in an interview with the Australian Associated Press, told of treating victims of torture, rape and heatings by Indonesian soldiers in East Timor while working there for three months this year.  Mr. Simon De Faux from Melbourne told the <i>Age</i> newspaper that he heard from locals that there had been six other massacres following the Dili massacre.  He said he was watched around the clock after arriving there in February and that he was hit by a soldier with a rifle butt when he tried to stop troops beating an eight year old boy.  The boy's injuries were so serious that almost certainly he would have lost an eye.</P>
    <P>Mr. De Faux said on another occasion an officer tried to shoot him after he took photographs of a village market place with a soldier in the background. A local nun stepped in front of the rifle and talked the officer out of it.  Mr. De Faux arrived in the East Timor capital, Dili, on 9 February after the Indonesian authorities would only allow him in as a health worker and not a nurse.  He said he found himself in the middle of a dirty war which was being fought on Australia's doorstep, but no one knew about it.  He quickly found out that the Australian Government did not care.</P>
    <P>He said he secretly treated victims of Indonesian atrocities brought to him. They included women who had been repeatedly raped, men tortured by being tied naked to a metal bed and having electric charges sent through <Col N="1922" /> their bodies, youths almost drowned in barrels of water and many victims who were badly beaten.  He said that in East Timor's south area the Timorese were being forced off fertile land to make way for Indonesian migrants.  The Church then moved him to the north, which he reached by hiding under pig carcasses in the back of a truck.</P>
    <P>On 8 March the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr. Alan Taylor, who was on tour at the time, met Mr. De Faux.  Mr. De Faux said that a member of Mr. Taylor's staff told him not to talk to the media about his experience.  &ldquo;The Australian was not interested in what I said and told me to keep quiet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I refer to a report from a source close to the Catholic Church in East Timor, which for obvious reasons must remain anonymous.  This was a briefing on East Timor by the Catholic Church.  During the past six months, since the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in Jakarta, the situation in East Timor has been extremely volatile with increased numbers of actions by the clandestine urban movement.  This has largely been in the form of demonstrations or mass response to violent or intimidating behaviour by the occupying military forces.  The common view is that this is evidence that the clandestine movement is not only still strong but able to change and adapt to meet the new demands and strategies of the occupying Indonesian forces.</P>
    <P>Two particular killings have had a strong impact in the past three months: the reported massacre outside the parish church in Baucau in January, and the killing of six civilians in the town of Liquicia in February.  The number of people killed in Baucau is unclear and, as yet, the justice and peace commission of the diocese has made no investigation. A number of sources report that the local Church officials are not happy about reporting this incident for fear of reprisals.</P>
    <P>In Liquicia the opposite was true, with effective reporting from the local parish bringing the killings to international attention and ensuring that the <Col N="1923" /> new Indonesian national human rights commission undertook an immediate investigation.  The report of the commission attacked the military's description of the incident as a &ldquo;military engagement&rdquo; and demanded the military take action against those responsible. Although little confidence in Indonesian national institutions is expressed by most Timorese, there was a positive response to the commission's report.</P>
    <P>In order to satisfy international opinion, it is likely that more severe penalties will be imposed on the officers responsible for the Liquicia killings than those given to the military responsible for the Santa Cruz killings in 1991. There are strong rumours that the present military commander in East Timor will be removed and there is some trepidation in regard to who will replace him.  With the clandestine network as strong as ever, any opportunities to demonstrate rejection of interrogation will continue to be taken and the military will not temper its brutality.</P>
    <P>The Indonesian policy of divide and rule and the application of a form of low intensity conflict is having a substantial impact.  The ninja gangs, groups of Timorese youths paid by the military to undertake terrorising gang raids at night on the houses of identified critics of Indonesian integration, have produced a heightened sense of fear.  Recruits for the ninjas are said to come from the increased numbers of youths involved in martial arts youth culture.  The development of martial arts clubs is heavily encouraged by the military and many of them take on a fanatical nature similar to the Alsa Masa militia group in the Philippines.  In the southern town of Suai a litany of ninja gang attacks is reported, although it is difficult to ascertain whether there have been fatalities.</P>
    <P>Since the retirement last year of the town mayor &mdash; a Timorese who had the confidence of the local population and who was replaced by a Javanese military officer &mdash; relations between the local <Col N="1924" /> government and Church have taken a downturn.  A priest complained that three times ninja gangs had trespassed on the parish church compound but when the police were summoned to give assistance they would not respond.  This is the Church's clear evidence that the police and military are behind the ninja gang activities.  Unlike Dili, no members of the ninja gangs in Suai have yet been caught and shown to be in the pay of the Indonesian authorities.</P>
    <P>The point I make is that nothing has changed in Indonesia despite what has happened in Australia and Portugal, which we recognise as a start.  We talk about the Santa Cruz massacres in 1991. It is now 1995 and nothing has changed. All the information from East Timor is to the effect that nothing has changed. There has been no improvement.  The massacres continue and we as a State must do everything we can to highlight the situation.</P>
    <P>I hope some of the proposals made by our delegates in Portugal will be actively dealt with by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate, particularly those who put their names to the motion on an all-party basis.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, for the tone of her speech and, in particular, the fact that she was unequivocal about the Irish Government's support for the Lisbon Declaration.  An integral of the declaration is the action plan from Justice Kirby, and the Minister of State also endorsed that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville is right to say we are only at the start.  Not a great deal has happened in 20 years to alleviate the suffering of the people of East Timor. With the freedoms we enjoy it is difficult for us to appreciate societies where those freedoms do not exist.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach had to try to control proceedings in the House earlier this afternoon and, fortunately, we are not at a stage where somebody marches in to take a Member away.  However, there are such societies and we are dealing <Col N="1925" /> with one of them in this case.  We should have no illusions about that: they do not even begin to understand the meaning of democracy and the right to dissent.</P>
    <P>When we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Holocaust and the liberation of Auschwitz I made the point that people believed such events could not happen again but they are happening and East Timor is one of the places where it is happening.  In relative terms the liquidation of 200,000 people is a holocaust.  There are similar things happening Rwanda and Bosnia.  Let us not deceive ourselves into thinking that society has advanced to the point where some of the events of history cannot recur.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House. An encouraging point that stayed with me was made in Lisbon by somebody who had experienced Portuguese dictatorship. They said that dictators do not survive.  The encouraging message is that dictatorships do not last but people last and will, ultimately, prevail.  It is our hope that will happen in this case.</P>
    <P>With regard to Portugal's colonial past, the Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs acknowledged in Lisbon the sins of the past.  Portugal's colonial past was in many ways more benign than some of the other colonial powers. Indonesia seized an opportunity to enter East Timor when Portugal was turning to democracy.  It says much about the peaceable nature of the Timorese people that there were no more than a few policemen and a small presence to prevent the invasion.</P>
    <P>With regard to Australia's role, I share the condemnation of the Australian Government.  However, I would make a distinction between the position of the Australian Government and the position of members of the Australian Parliament and the Australian press; it has been distinct from the overall Australian position.  Australian consciousness was severely jolted by the death of some of the journalists covering events in East Timor.</P>
    <P>I am glad the declaration has been supported in its entirety, including the <Col N="1926" /> various aspects I mentioned.  Senator Lanigan made a point about the authority we have as a parliament when we pass such resolutions.  In the scale of international events it is not of great significance. However, when one considers there were 35 countries represented in Lisbon who are part of the international community, if their voices are raised together they must have some effect. The Secretary General of the United Nations is only as good as the authority given to him by the international community.</P>
    <P>It is important we adopt this resolution. It has some authority and that is part of the authority which can be exercised by the international community.  I commend the work of the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign.  It has kept this matter to the forefront of Irish public opinion and has worked tirelessly without a great deal of resources to ensure we are conscious of what has happened in East Timor.  We continue to highlight it and we will continue to try to do something concrete about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes that the total Government aid to the Third World will amount to £89 million in 1995, the equivalent of 0.27 per cent of GNP, which represents an increase of £19 million &mdash; 26 per cent &mdash; over the 1994 figure and welcomes the commitment of the Government to increase the level of Overseas Development Assistance to bring us on a par with our EU partners by 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have pleasure in moving this motion on behalf of the Labour Party <Col N="1927" /> Senators and we fully accept and concur with the Fianna Fáil amendment.</P>
    <P>There are targets which we hope to attain in relation to assistance for developing countries and although they have not yet been reached, the 26 per cent increase this year is a big step forward. I hope we will continue on this path in the next few years so that the target involving the percentage of GNP for the developing world will be attained.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have proved themselves particularly understanding of the problems of developing nations.  They have also been particularly generous in donating in a private capacity to a variety of charities and causes relating to countries which are in much worse financial situations than Ireland.  These countries have suffered many crises and are underdeveloped, but there is no need to spell out that point.</P>
    <P>In many ways Ireland is ideally suited to development aid and work.  We have a historical understanding of what it is like to endure serious problems.  We suffered during the great famine and we experienced many other problems over the centuries.  We are not threatening to many countries in the way that other countries with colonial pasts might be threatening.  We can, therefore, sometimes play a role that other European countries are unable to play.  We can probably go to and be welcome in most places in the world and give whatever assistance possible, whether personal, in the form of people with expertise, or financial.</P>
    <P>The money in this budget is spent in a variety of ways.  The majority goes in bilateral aid to a number of different countries.  Certain places, mainly in Africa, have been prioritised this year, including Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda.  These countries will be assisted in a number of ways, mainly through co-funding and support for various programmes identified by the Governments there.  For example, assistance will be given in election monitoring and the promotion of <Col N="1928" /> human rights, including the establishment of a human rights unit in the political division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Another part of the budget goes to APSO, the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.  There is a target to increase the number of places this year to 1,250. APSO provides a way in which individuals can go and work in developing countries.  They can make their personal input with the support of the Government and they work mainly through agencies and Governments in those countries.</P>
    <P>Another part of the budget goes to emergency humanitarian aid.  This area probably receives the most attention and involves responses to crises, of which there have been many in recent years and most recently in Rwanda. This aid is given mainly to our agencies, such as Concern, Trócaire and Goal, and also to international agencies, such as the Red Cross and other UN bodies, including UNICEF.</P>
    <P>A fourth part of the budget caters for refugees who come to Ireland.  The money is spent in a variety of ways and also includes work on multilateral programmes. These are projects we work on in conjunction with other agencies and countries through the EU and the United Nations and its agencies.  A wide variety of aspects are involved in helping these countries in practical ways. Ireland's record is second to none in terms of our commitment and the generosity of ordinary people in supporting developing countries.</P>
    <P>Developing countries have many problems, such as natural disasters, extremes of climates and political instability; these are in addition to the general problems of underdevelopment. This means that they have not reached the developmental stages of other countries and they need assistance from outside. However, one of the major problems facing many these countries is huge debt, either to the World Bank, the IMF or various other outside agencies.  This problem must be addressed and Ireland <Col N="1929" /> should encourage a global response in whatever way possible.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs produced a report last April on Third World debt with particular reference to the role of the IMF and the World Bank.  Some of the statistics contained in the report are quite shocking. It states that the pressure to prioritise debt repayment has had devastating effects on the lives of people across southern countries and their environment, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  It makes the point that Third World Governments spend 50 per cent more on debt servicing than on health and education combined.  This is a shocking statistic.</P>
    <P>The report also states that debt servicing takes priority over food security and that often the best land is used for cash exports.  The most indebted countries are those which are deforesting fastest to increase exports and to earn foreign exchange for debt repayment. The most shocking is a UNICEF figure, which states that 0.5 million children die each year as a result of the debt crisis. The report also states that women in developing countries pay the highest price for the debt crisis with their time, energy and health in the labour force, on the farm, in the home and in the community.</P>
    <P>In terms of funding by Government or by agencies, the most important thing we can do is to act as some type of conscience, motivater and catalyst in relation to the debt crisis.  This must be addressed globally.  Countries with these huge debt problems must be assisted, whether in reorganising the payments or in having some of it written off, which is essential.  Some type of global package must be devised whereby human needs are put before the debt payment.  This recommendation is contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs' report.  This matter must be the majority priority, but priority must also be given to the funding through our aid and agencies.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the personnel in Concern, Trócaire, Goal and the many other <Col N="1930" /> smaller organisations working in Third World countries.  I have a particular knowledge of Concern, which has been there since the beginning.  It first went to countries in crisis such as Bangladesh and Ethiopia and later to other areas.  It stayed and, after providing initial humanitarian aid, carried out real development work on the ground.  It has aimed to work itself out of a job in particular areas by training local people in education, health and employment projects and building bridges, dams and wells.</P>
    <P>A small number of people, in comparison to the populations of these countries, have made a huge difference and the work of our development agencies in these areas is acknowledged across the world.  Their work has far outweighed their numbers on the ground.  The level of commitment on the part of the personnel of these bodies cannot be overestimated.  In a variety of countries, they have set up self perpetuating projects, whether in employment, hospitals, etc, which have made a real difference.  They have not just touched the surface; they have tried to deal with the real problems on the ground.</P>
    <P>We should listen to the people from those agencies and to their experiences in the countries in which they work because sometimes there are facile and simplistic solutions proposed to the problems of developing countries.  The solutions are never facile and simplistic. By trying to understand the problems and trying to play the particular role that we with our history and commitment can play, Ireland has a role in Third World development that is beyond the size of our population.  In proposing the motion, I am sure I will have the support of the House.  It is not a contentious motion but it is important to put on record that we are making significant progress in terms of reaching the goals we have set ourselves to assist developing countries.  I sincerely hope that any financial considerations in this country would not interfere in any way with our commitment to aid for developing countries because that has to <Col N="1931" /> be a major priority.  Any problems we have in Ireland are nothing to the problems of the countries we are dealing with in this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to second the motion.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Burton, to the House and thank her for the work she is doing in this field.  She has practical knowledge, having experience in the Third World already.  People like her can be of tremendous benefit when in Government, having the experience of work in the Third World behind them.</P>
      <P>When I was teaching geography in school, myself and the children had a stark reminder of what goes on in the Third World.  I remember that one day I asked the pupils to list some of the facilities they had in their own homes. They started off, first of all, with the television and then came things like the fridge, the washing machine and so on. They were surprised when I told them that they were leaving out some of the important ones.  The first thing I mentioned to them was water.  They had all taken water for granted &mdash; nobody listed water in the list they gave me.  A second thing they did not mention was food.  They were talking about things like the washing machine, the television, the radio, the record player, the carpet cleaner, etc. but there was no mention of the two essentials.  The pupils became aware that to have a proper water supply in a Third World country is important for the people and I am talking about having it only near at hand, not having it on tap.  When I brought this to their notice, when they saw, in the text book and on a slide, people walking with jugs on their heads, dragging pails and so on, and when I told them that people had to travel 20 miles for water every day &mdash; some of these pupils had come to school on the bus that morning &mdash; they began to realise the importance of water for these people.  If the aid that our Government is giving is helping to provide a water supply or a well, it is doing a terrific job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> There were other things that I mentioned to my pupils in the course of our discussion and one of them was the average income of people in these countries. I mentioned $300 per annum as an average income, which is a real figure for some of these people.  As Senators know, averages are dangerous because for every person that might have an income of $1,000 there could be many others with an income only $10.  Sometimes money is not used at all in these countries but instead they use barter and exchange.</P>
    <P>Another thing I referred to was the absence of light.  We can enter a room, turn a switch and a light comes on. These people have to live from dawn to dusk, because otherwise there is no light in poor countries.  These are points I felt were important to bring home to young people living in a developed country like our own to make them aware of the hardships that are suffered by people in the Third World.  Moneys coming from the Government, however small or large, will be put to terrific use in schemes in Third World countries by raising the standard of living there.</P>
    <P>Young people talk about going on holiday, perhaps to the next county or the seaside, but when they find out that young people in Third World countries never have an opportunity of even half a day like that, it makes them think. Through educational programmes in the schools, on television and otherwise, young people can be awakened to the need and respond by taking up collections locally, having a flag day or running a marathon.  Often it is only when tragedies such as that in Rwanda are highlighted on television that people start waking up.</P>
    <P>The importance of aid needs no comment, whether it is bilateral, multilateral or through NGOs.  Bilateral aid, with a country such as Ireland giving assistance to places like Lesotho or any of the other countries mentioned, is good because it results in a greater degree of contact, whereas sometimes with multilateral aid, with organisations like the United Nations or the European Union <Col N="1933" /> giving assistance to the Third World, the individuality can be lost.  I would like to support the tabled amendment on the non-Governmental organisations and the tremendous work they do, because it is only all three forms of aid combined that will make conditions in the Third World countries better through interrelationships and joint ventures.  An engineer going to a foreign country may be working under the Agency for Personal Service Overseas building a dam in an area so that there will be water all the year round in what may be a semidesert region.  The effect that will have on the lives of the people, animals and crops is tremendous.  If we can keep our shoulder to the wheel in a developing country like Ireland and increase moneys over a period of time to bring our contribution, as the Government has promised, in line with our European partners by 1997, we will have done a good day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;by 1997&rdquo; to add:</P>
      <P>&rdquo;; and recognises and appreciates the work of the dedicated volunteers of the non-governmental organisations such as Goal, Concern and Trócaire, and of the Irish missionaries in their efforts on behalf of the people of the Third World.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank the Government for accepting the amendment which is necessary to put on the record this House's appreciation of the work of the non-governmental organisations, their dedicated volunteers, missionaries and others who have been involved in this area for many years.</P>
      <P>A recent article in <i>Choices</i>, a magazine published by the United Nations Development Programme, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come to give all people &mdash; men and women, young and old, sick and healthy, rich and poor &mdash; the chance to live long.  productive and dignified lives... eliminating <Col N="1934" /> poverty, ensuring livelihoods for all, confronting the root cause of social disintegration, are challenges that look as daunting today as the abolition of slavery did a century and a half ago.  Yet slavery has been outlawed and largely eradicated from the face of the earth.  Why then should it not be possible to muster the necessary political will and resources to achieve social progress and the betterment of the human condition now and into the 21st century?  It is within our power to end the worst aspects of human deprivation.  We have no choice but to act.</P>
    <P>That quotation sums up in a very striking way the urgent necessity for a global partnership arrangement internationally and locally to tackle the daunting problems which are threatening the developing world at present.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years since we got our own finances in order, a genuine effort has been made by successive Governments to remedy the shortcomings which were apparent in Ireland's official development programme. Last year we were third from the bottom of the OECD list and just approaching the OECD average.  While there is cause to welcome the improvement that has taken place, there is, nevertheless, a long way to go to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP set down by the United Nations.  I reiterate the view expressed by Senator O'Sullivan that in any review of Government expenditure the greatest care must be taken not to damage that progress.  We must ensure not only continued support for the overseas development aid programme but also an acceleration of it to reach the UN aid target more speedily.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid, I initiated meetings with aid agencies which have been continued by my successors as Ministers of State, Deputy Tom Kitt and Deputy Burton. These meetings are aimed at organising a partnership response from all these organisations with the State to ensure <Col N="1935" /> that we get the best return for the resources we are spending.  They are also aimed at having an input from such agencies into the formulation of Government programmes, something they have sought for many years.  A formula has now been put in place involving regular meetings between the aid agencies, the non-governmental agencies, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister.</P>
    <P>No words of mine can describe adequately the cloud of despair that envelops the developing countries.  To fully understand the poverty, deprivation and need that exists there one needs to physically experience it.  I had the opportunity to visit the poorest of the poor in Tanzania, Lesotho and Zambia during my time as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid.  One would be overcome by despair and hopelessness were it not for the fact that in each area there were many people of great commitment working diligently day and night to find solutions to the problems.  They included local community leaders and others from community organisations, non-governmental agencies.  Government agencies and Departments as well as international agencies like the UN and the EU.</P>
    <P>A new developing partnership arose along with a visible willingness by thousands of people to work diligently to find solutions to these problems.  Over the years, many people have tragically lost their lives while engaged in overseas development work.  Such volunteers daily put their lives at risk in the developing countries.</P>
    <P>This year, total Government expenditure &mdash; which includes budgets for a number of Departments &mdash; is about £90 million, but it is well short of the UN target so there must be no let up in the Government's commitment.  The developing countries already contain three-quarters of humanity and will soon be home to nine people out of every ten on earth.  Despite this, a very small fraction of GNP is spent in the <Col N="1936" /> developing world and, in addition, a very small percentage of the world's scientists, technologists, engineers and other professionals work in these countries.</P>
    <P>The Third World's huge debts have already been well documented by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and have been outlined here by Senator O'Sullivan.  The world's population is now nearly six billion and will be increasing by about one billion every ten years.  The main part of this population increase is taking place in the developing countries.</P>
    <P>Hardship, deprivation, malnutrition and disease have put enormous tensions on many developing democracies resulting in conflict.  In many places poverty has been exacerbated by civil war. This is evident at present in the Sudan where a civil war has been going on relatively unnoticed by the international community.  In Nicaragua, 45,000 people died in the civil war which lasted ten years.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Sullivan said, the less well off sections of the community are hit hardest in such situations.  According to World Health Organisation figures. 500 million women suffer from reproductive tract infections and every year half a million women die from pregnancy-related diseases; some 99 per cent of these are in the developing world.  An international effort must now be made to resolve these problems by refocusing world attention on economic methods to help the poorer countries.</P>
    <P>When I met the President of Tanzania he made the point very plainly that if his country could gain access to Community markets for some of their produce, many of Tanzania's problems could be resolved.</P>
    <P>Budgets must be focused on eradicating poverty and productive opportunities must be provided for people. Poor nations must have the opportunity to develop trade, technology and information as well as attracting investment. They must also be helped to reduce their burgeoning debt levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> On behalf of my colleagues in Fianna Fáil I am glad to propose this amendment.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an leasú seo.  We sometimes forget the noble work that is done by the many voluntary organisations whose members go out to work in Third World countries. I wish to pay special tribute to our missionaries &mdash; our priests, nuns and brothers &mdash; who work in those countries. It is fashionable to attack them in this country at present.  However, in years gone by they were the people who provided education and health care in this country, long before the State could afford to do so.  They are doing the same now in Third World countries.  When I see organisations objecting and marching on behalf of animals' rights and so forth I often think it is a great pity they would not go to those Third World countries and use their energies and abilities to help the people there.</P>
      <P>I spent two weeks in Mozambique this year.  Regardless of what one sees on television or reads in the newspapers, one must go on site to appreciate the poverty of those countries and the conditions in which people live.  I am delighted that Mozambique has been added to the list of Third World countries that will receive aid.  Mozambique has experienced over 20 years of civil war.  There are millions of landmines in the ground and we do not know when the last one will be detonated.  One cannot leave the dirt tracks.  Hospital and health facilities are terrible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one station we visited we were told that a lady had fallen ill overnight. We took her to a little hospital that was nothing more than a shed.  Inside was an old stretcher and a sheet that was little more than a pocket handkerchief.  The lady suffered a miscarriage.  When we returned that night she was on her way home.  We brought her two or three miles of the way before she had to walk into the bush, carrying her little pile of belongings on her head.  She had to make that journey after suffering a miscarriage and having been seriously ill <Col N="1938" /> the night before.  I gave her a flashlight and I can still see its small light going through the bushes.  &ldquo;My God&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;when I think of the services we have in Ireland and people complain about them and then see what people suffer in these countries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For four days I lived on coconut juice because we could not drink the water. Yet, in the mornings we saw people getting water from what we would consider an old swamp hole.  The people carried that water for miles.  There was a little chapel made from twigs and branches where Mass was said on Sundays.  There was no seating and people had to kneel on the sandy soil.  We visited a town as large as Kinnegad and we were instructed to stay at a hotel there.  We stayed in a tent because the hotel had no running water or sewerage.  One would see better beds thrown on dumps here.  This was a hotel but there were no facilities.</P>
    <P>Mozambique is a poor country and it is only when one visits it that one appreciates the work of Concern, Goal, Trocaire and the missionaries.  I appeal for more people to give of their time and go there.  We have many unemployed in this country and it would be a great exercise for many of them to go there to do a month or two months voluntary work.  Then they would see the other side of life.</P>
    <P>I pay special tribute to the people who do not go to the Third World but who collect at home for medicines, clothes, food and other supplies to be sent there.  I particularly pay tribute to the lorry and van drivers who go to these war torn countries.  They are taking their lives in their hands because there is black marketeering and racketeering everywhere.  Often the aim of the black marketeers and the racketeers is to ambush the trucks, take the food and sell it at a profit thus preventing it reaching the people who really need it. The drivers go through great hardship and turmoil, enduring days and nights without sleep in order to guard their cargoes.  They deserve great praise.  We do not really think about what they do. <Col N="1939" /> We tend to think they are going on a holiday.  However, it is far from a holiday &mdash; they suffer a great deal.</P>
    <P>Debt is like a thief for many countries, including our own.  Third World debt is escalating at an alarming rate and some effort should be made to deal with it.  All countries could come together and organise some form of amnesty or write-off of much of that debt.  Third World countries will never be able to pay off the debts.  We should at least put the debts on the long finger for about 25 or 30 years and perhaps when the countries develop they will be able to clear them.  It is grossly unfair to expect poor countries to clear a debt with the money they should be using to till their land, produce crops, increase living standards and build schools.</P>
    <P>I visited schools in Mozambique. Children sat out in the open or sometimes under a shelter.  There were no blackboards or chalk.  Teaching was oral because there was nothing on which to write.  I brought a pile of pencils and pens and they were like manna from heaven to the children.  We do not realise how things are there.  I also brought plenty of sweets.  The children did not know what a sweet was.  I had to eat a sweet first to show them.  It was wonderful to see the smiles on their faces when they ate Smarties.  It is only when one sees the children crowding around for the sweets that one realises the poverty and hardship in those countries. It is sad.  I would love to go back again and do a few weeks voluntary work.  They are very nice people.  We should do all we can.</P>
    <P>I realise that this Government and previous Governments have done a great deal but we are doing little compared to the voluntary organisations. No money would pay them for their work, time and effort.  God bless their work.  I hope they will continue.  I also hope that more people will realise, as a result of this debate, that we have a great contribution to make in order to help Third World countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and the amendment proposed by Senator Daly on behalf of the Fianna Fáil group.  It is good to be able to commend the Government for increasing aid and for aspiring to increase it further and bring it on par with our EU partners by 1997.  The fact is that we are rich in expertise and poor in resources so it is commendable to aspire to making such an increase.  I hope we will achieve our target by 1997.</P>
      <P>We have a tradition of providing expertise to developing countries. Indeed, our record in that area is laudable and is recognised worldwide.  The increase in our voluntary contribution is welcome.  It is interesting and useful to analyse the nature of our aid in comparison with that of other countries. Our aid is disinterested: usually there are no specific conditions or ties attached to it.  That gives agencies, particularly in the case of bilateral aid, the freedom to use the aid in the best interests of the communities involved. Many countries that contribute to overseas development aid attach conditions. In many instances, it is linked to investment in products from the donor country and that is not necessarily in the best interest of the developing countries concerned. In other instances, for example, US aid, it might be tied to military interests.  That is the reality although it might not be the most commendable reality.  There is often a strategic reason for the investment of aid.</P>
      <P>We did quite well during the 1980s in increasing our ODA contributions. Unfortunately from 1989 onwards, the figures, as a percentage of GNP, began to decrease.  It is highly commendable that the figure is beginning to increase again and has been increasing for some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our ODA policy includes a commitment to increase bilateral aid.  About one third of aid is bilateral while the remaining two thirds is multilateral.  It is important that we focus on ensuring an increase in bilateral aid because it is important to work closely with the communities involved in the developing <Col N="1941" /> countries.  It is also important to do sufficient research before making the investment because throwing money at a community or a project is not necessarily the best thing.  It is important to assess the absorption factor of that community or project.  It is important to conduct the necessary research to ensure that what is spent is to the best possible advantage.  In some instances this may necessitate much work and expertise from a variety of areas, including the teaching, medical, accounting and construction professions.</P>
    <P>It is important that developing communities have built-in expertise in addition to that of the NGOs.  Governments, particularly our Government, should focus on ensuring that the local indigenous community can continue to sustain development once the ODA assistance ceases or is reduced.  Anything we do should be centred around the dignity of the people concerned.  It should build on the dignity, inherent intelligence, traditions and basic abilities of the people and provide them with the necessary skill to sustain their development subsequently.</P>
    <P>This country has a proud tradition of major international contribution.  It is true to say that, of all contributing countries and as a percentage of OECD, Ireland has the largest percentage of NGOs and that is highly commendable. That tradition goes back a long time and predates organisations such as Trócaire, Concern, Gorta and Goal.  Religious missionaries went out to developing countries and provided education, medical and hospital care.  We have a fine tradition in that area.  In recent decades these organisations have developed and the NGOs have done tremendous work.</P>
    <P>The particular advantage of these organisations is that they can move into an area and respond to an immediate crisis.  We have seen repeatedly in recent years how successfully they have done that.  We have equally seen how the Irish Government has responded by immediately making substantial financial contributions to some of these organisations and directly to some of <Col N="1942" /> the countries.  That is highly commendable and will hopefully continue in the future.</P>
    <P>At a time when there is talk within Government of reducing spending in a variety of areas, the Irish people would not appreciate this country reducing its contribution to ODA.  There is inherent in every Irish person the will to contribute to the under privileged and deprived.  When major international disasters have occurred and a call has come indirectly to the community, we make the highest personal contributions in proportion to our population.  I hope the Government will not make any cutbacks in this area because it should be above such consideration.  One is dealing with the dignity of the human person and respect for people.  This should be recognised and fully appreciated in every way possible, including financially.</P>
    <P>I hope there is not any attempt to make cutbacks in this area.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, on the work she has done since she took over responsibility for this area. She has directly examined a number of areas at first hand and is doing a fine job in the area of ODA.  I wish her success with her work in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Government motion and I also support the amendment proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party. I regret the fact that the Irish Red Cross was not mentioned as one of the groups which has done such tremendous work abroad.  The Irish Red Cross is part of the largest humanitarian organisation in the world.  I would like to have seen it identified, but I suppose that is bias on my part.  When Senator Daly was in charge of this area, he gave great support and help to the Irish Red Cross.  I remember him joining me at Shannon to see off plane loads of goods to the earthquake area in Armenia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing overseas aid, does the Oireachtas take enough account of long term programmes in various countries? Do we ensure our aid is focused on long term development?  I attended <Col N="1943" /> the international medical parliamentarians meeting before the Cairo Conference. Much of the conference addressed problems relating to development and poverty in the Third World which obviously require long term planning. I sometimes wonder if we put enough effort into thinking where best money could be directed rather than spending it on short term projects, worthy though they are, following both manmade and natural disasters.  We should give a little more thought to long term planning.</P>
    <P>The conference in Cairo on population and development has started to produce reports.  I recently received one which deals with the main issues of the conference.  It was decided that two of the most important topics which would affect both population and development in under developed countries were clean water and the education of women.  Any clean water projects must be set up on a long term basis and require an incredible amount of planning, but they constitute one of the most important facilities any nation can have.  My good friend, Dr. Kadar Asmal, has drawn the short straw in the South African Parliament because he has to deal with this incredibly difficult problem.  Even in a country with the riches and advantages of South Africa, it will be difficult just to bring clean water to the townships.</P>
    <P>When we send aid abroad we should specify major projects which should be helped in certain countries and send out experts if necessary.  We have done this on occasion.  We are fortunate in this country to have a large number of people with technical and professional expertise who are prepared to serve abroad, as indeed the Minister of State did herself.  We should focus more on long term efforts rather than on short term ones, which are worthy and which catch the headlines for a certain length of time.  Although the initial problem is dealt, long term problems remain as bad as in the beginning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" /> We should make greater efforts as regards women.  Delegates from this country are to go to the UN Conference on Women in Beijing.  I hope they will put forward our hopes for the improvement in the status of women in many Third World countries, because their efforts at an economic level can be of far more importance to the life of their family and their society than any dams or factories which may be built.  I remember someone said it would be better to send hoes rather than tractors because if we send tractors spare parts will be needed and the project collapses. We should focus on the need to educate women, to give them economic opportunities, to ensure that they get credit to start small businesses and to ensure that they are not discriminated against as regards schooling.  Of the millions of illiterate people throughout the world, I believe 70 per cent are women.  A greater proportion of female children do not get primary schooling.  Given the importance of the education of women to the health of their families and to the economy on a small scale, we should put thought and time into this area and promote it at international level when going to conferences like that in Beijing.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the area of reproductive health in Third World countries.  This was firmly addressed at the Cairo Conference.  There is an invidious situation in that countries with highest neonatal death rate, infant morality rate and death rate of children under five years are those with the greatest poverty.  At the same time such countries have the highest fertility rate which means that women are constantly child bearing or else they are involved in the care of small children.  Most children in the Third World do not die from malnutrition but from disease.  Healthy children can survive for a long time in disaster areas.  It was interesting to see that after the recent earthquake in Sakhalin small children recovered after five days without food and water.  In countries with a considerable amount of disease where children are constantly in a <Col N="1945" /> state of ill-health, they naturally succumb quickly to any adverse situation.</P>
    <P>Our greatest advantage, which is underlined by the amendment to the motion, is that there is strong co-operation between the non-governmental organisations and the Government. While they receive financial backing, they also receive the support of the people, which is always useful.  I am constantly astonished that so many firms give people, sometimes in key positions, leave of absence for a year or two to serve abroad and they are not praised often enough.  For example, when the Red Cross needed drivers, Telecom Éireann and the ESB provided them at once.</P>
    <P>As regards refugees, we do not look at internal migration caused by disruption and which may result in some people needing refugee status in other countries.  I hope the Minister will make this part of her brief.  We can sit comfortably here and praise the aid workers, but I hope this Government will look at things on a larger scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion and the amendment.  I pay tribute to many Members who have contributed in different ways both in terms of Oireachtas committees and by their work and visits to developing countries, not only as election monitors but to see various elements of the programme. A number of Members from both Houses are currently on a visit to Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda to look first hand at the Irish programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Labour Minister, it gives me particular pleasure to say that since the Labour Party has participated in Government there has been a substantial increase in overseas development assistance since 1993.  This year, as in 1993 and 1994, substantial extra funding has been made available for developing countries and I know that has been widely welcomed.  I am sure that there will be widespread support for the continuation <Col N="1946" /> of this trend in the coming years.  Total Government spending on ODA this year will amount to approximately £89 million.  This represents an increase of approximately £19 million over last year and more than double what was spent in 1992.  In allocating this record level of expenditure the Government is delivering on the promise to raise Ireland's official development assistance to the kind of level which our European partners allocate and to make steady progress towards the UN target of spending 0.7 per cent of GNP on official development assistance. This year's increase sets us well on the way towards achieving that target.</P>
    <P>In the years prior to 1993 Ireland's record had no been so good.  For some time we had been at the bottom of the OECD league table and our performance was the subject of criticism both at home and abroad.  However, our position is steadily improving.  Last year we were third from the bottom of the OECD list and this year will come closer to the OECD average.  It is heartening to see that we are gradually making our way up the table of donors to developing countries.</P>
    <P>The increases in ODA mean that the budget allocated for this purpose is now substantial.  It is of course very gratifying for me to be Minister of State at this time when the funding is on an upward curve.  But this in turn puts special responsibilities on me and my Department to ensure that all of the money allocated to ODA is well spent and fully accounted for.  Irish people support more assistance for developing countries and it is incumbent on us to ensure that the highest standards of accountability are maintained.</P>
    <P>Members of the House may wish to know that the OECD carried out one of its regular reviews of the Irish aid programme last autumn.  The report, which has now been published, indicated that the OECD was very satisfied with what it found.  This of course should not lead <Col N="1947" /> us to relax but rather encourage us to continue to ensure that only worthwhile projects are undertaken, that they bring real benefits to the recipients and that all spending is monitored and accounted for.  Last week, when I discussed the Estimates with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, I mentioned this as one of my primary concerns.  This applies to the aid programme itself but it also applies to those organisations with whom we work in partnership.  We are now channelling, correctly I believe, substantial sums of public money through NGOs such as Concern, Goal and Trócaire and through international agencies such as UNICEF and the World Bank and the European Union. I intend to insist on the highest standards of accountability in all of our partner organisations, whichever category they fall into.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid budget for bilateral aid at £39.2 million marks an increase of 59 per cent over 1994.  The bilateral aid programme is the principal channel through which long term assistance to developing countries is dispersed.  As Senator Henry stated, we must invest in development on a long term basis. There are no quick fixes.  The bulk of this money &mdash; almost £20 million &mdash; will go to projects in the six priority countries for Irish aid.  The long established ones are Lesotho, Zambia, Sudan and Tanzania.  In 1994 Ethiopia and Uganda were added to this list.  This year it is planned that Mozambique will become the seventh priority country.  As well as carrying out intensive activity in priority countries, increased funding means that we can fund development projects in countries such as South Africa and Zimbabwe, both of which are targeted for large increases this year.  We are also assisting the Palestinian Territories, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh.</P>
    <P>This year, for the first time, we are making provision for rehabilitation assistance, that is, aid that helps countries <Col N="1948" /> to recover from wars and disasters in the stage before long term development comes into action.  The clearest example at the moment would be the efforts to constitute and reconstitute a civil society in Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide which took place last year, and the almost total destruction of that country's infrastructure.  Long-term development cannot be discussed in the aftermath of such a disaster.  We can only talk about rehabilitation followed by long term development.  I believe we cannot stand aloof from the challenge of building peace with justice in such countries even though it will involve us grappling with many difficult problems. Countries which are scheduled to receive rehabilitation assistance this year include Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Ireland's aid programme has always attached fundamental importance to assisting the poorer developing countries. Our programme is designed to meet basic needs such as primary health care, education and clean water supply. With the growth of resources available under our aid programme we are also in a position to further develop areas such as our fund for co-financing of aid projects with non-governmental organisations. This is the fund used to give once-off grants, usually of a relatively modest size, to missionary orders and NGOs for projects such as building additional school classrooms and community centres, drilling wells or equipping clinics.  For example, I recently spoke to a sister working in Tanzania regarding her need for a modest amount of money to buy microscopes and a number of incubators for the rural hospital where she works.  This kind of assistance, which is small in scale but which meets very specific needs, is extremely attractive.  Another basic principle of the programme is to assist these countries in their efforts to attain long term sustainable development.  The increase in resources in our aid programme <Col N="1949" /> has enabled us to consolidate and expand the reach of Irish aid assistance through this fund to countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and to target aid in Asian countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the role of Irish NGOs in the developing world has become especially important over the last number of years.  This is reflected in the increased number of NGO activities in developing countries and in the fact that their contribution to development co-operation now extends to areas in which NGOs have not traditionally been involved, such as electoral observation, human rights monitoring, environment, population and particularly the role of women.  Irish NGOs have an impressive track record, not only in areas such as emergency humanitarian assistance which the media tends to concentrate on, but they are also involved in rehabilitation and long term development projects.  Irish public support for humanitarian NGOs has never been greater as evidenced by the extent of their role in crises.  The reputation for the dedication, courage and compassion of Irish aid workers and missionaries is known worldwide.  Many work in difficult and even dangerous situations.  We all need to be conscious of the risks that are taken.  The safety of NGO and missionary personnel, a number of whom have given their lives in recent years, working in crisis zones is always of concern to the Government who will continue to work closely with the UN and international agencies to ensure they are protected as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government is very aware, and deeply appreciative, of the work of the NGOs and missionaries who are also active in the much more mundane but equally important field of long term development.  The Government's relationship with NGOs is characterised by the notion of dialogue and partnership. The work of the NGOs complements Irish aid programmes in many <Col N="1950" /> areas, both within and outside the priority countries.  The 1995 allocation for the NGO co-financing scheme is £4.3 million.  If there are savings elsewhere in the programme by the end of the year, I will ensure that additional money goes to this scheme.  I would also like to achieve a greater awareness of the scheme and that those doing such work with the missionary orders in Africa, Asia and South America know that the NGO scheme exists and is available to fund worthwhile projects which meet certain criteria.  The new information officer, who will assume duty next month, will be asked to give priority to this area.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to maximising the number of Irish aid workers overseas.  The Agency for Personal Service Overseas &mdash; APSO &mdash; is the State-sponsored body responsible for the recruitment and training of Irish personnel in the developing world.  The Government has increased funding to APSO since 1992 and has provided an increase in funding of 21 per cent in 1995.  This is in line with the target of substantially increasing the number of APSO workers in the developing world. The ambition to increase the numbers of Irish development workers will not be at the expense of the quality of the projects they undertake.  It is a priority for APSO to identify skilled personnel who meet real needs and who can contribute to capacity building in the countries where we work in partnership.  The ultimate goal has to be to develop local capacity.  It is interesting to consider the education sector where traditionally Irish teachers have been taking classes. However, in the future, as local people become available, our role will gradually shift to advising curriculum development, for example, helping with teacher training, resourcing language skills and mathematics, where the Irish primary school curriculum is particularly admired.  Our role in education will continue but with a change of <Col N="1951" /> emphasis, as a resource assistance rather than replacing local capacity in any sense which is increasingly available.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there is an ever present demand for emergency humanitarian funding.  This funding is provided for relief operations to alleviate the effects of natural disasters, conflicts, famine and drought.  Humanitarian assistance is classically targeted at refugees and displaced people.  The demand for emergency assistance has grown in recent years with the increasing number of disasters in the world today, both natural and man-made.  The amount allocated for emergency humanitarian assistance is £5 million, a figure which takes account of emergencies arising. The allocation last year was £4 million, although additional funding had to be allocated during 1994 due to the crisis in Rwanda.  This is the reason we spent some £5.8 million last year under this heading.</P>
    <P>All the priority countries for Irish aid are parties to the Lomé Convention between the EU and the developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.  I am aware, from contacts with Ministers and others in our priority countries, how important is the help provided by the EU to their development. The EU is now the world's largest donor of development aid when EU assistance and the assistance provided by the 15 member states are aggregated. When considered in that context, this indicates a powerful and leading position for the Union in this area.  The Union is committed to providing 12,000 million ECU under the first five years of the Fourth Convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland's share of contributions to the funding mechanism under the convention, the European Development Fund, amounts to £7.8 million in 1995.  The amount fluctuates from year to year. Members will be aware that an eighth round of funding is currently under <Col N="1952" /> negotiation in Brussels.  Ireland supported the French Presidency in their request to substantially expand the amount in the eighth round.  Unfortunately, not all member states have yet been in a position to agree to this but I hope there will be some movement shortly.  Just as we measure the EU in terms of its response to the disadvantaged and excluded in Europe, so also we measure it in relation to its response to some of the poorest people in the world.</P>
    <P>Viewed from the perspective of the needs of developing countries, the EU is the single most important source of development assistance.  When we look at it this way, it is necessary that we address the question of the EU's effective delivery of aid, whether it is in emergency situations or over the long term, both in the run-up to our Presidency and during it.  I hope to organise an initiative this autumn in the area of food aid and food security, which remain major areas of concern for the developing world and where the EU plays a major role.  This matter was raised again and again by a whole range of organisations in their submissions on the proposed White Paper.</P>
    <P>Another area which merits particular attention is that of Africa generally, because sometimes Africa is in danger of slipping off the world agenda because of the focus on developments in Eastern Europe and because the scale of the problems in Africa appear to be so vast and increasing so rapidly that it is not possible to cope.  I think this is wrong and during our Presidency, given our traditional links with Africa, we should seek to have the EU look at its relationship with sub-Saharan Africa in particular.</P>
    <P>We are increasing our voluntary contributions to the UN development agencies from £4.5 million in 1994 to £5.5 million this year.  I know concerns have been expressed regarding the effectiveness and accountability of some of these <Col N="1953" /> agencies.  However, the activities of agencies such as UNICEF, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the UNDP are central to the UN's activities in the field of development co-operation. It should be borne in mind that our contributions to and involvement with these UN agencies enable our aid programme to reach a far greater number of people in the developing world than would otherwise be possible.  We propose to continue to play our full part in the ongoing UN reform process aimed at improving the effectiveness and accountability of these agencies.  It is intended that the subject of our role in this process will be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper on foreign policy.</P>
    <P>We must not underestimate the challenges facing us in our relationship with the developing world and we must continue to play our role in resolving crises and conflicts and promoting sustainable development.  We must continue to provide increased levels of aid and promote support for human rights while ensuring that aid is used to support those rights, alleviate basic needs and promote the ability of people in developing countries to help themselves.</P>
    <P>Other countries have taken notice of the fact that Irish official development aid is being expanded substantially and they have reacted very positively.  Our standing with the people in the countries we assist has been greatly enhanced; they know we are expressing a practical solidarity with them.  We are doing this as a country which has itself comparatively recently emerged from a process of development.  Sometimes our rapport with developing countries is put down to the absence of our having been a colonial power.  In many ways it comes from the involvement of our missionaries over a long period in sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The interest which many developing countries have in using some elements <Col N="1954" /> of our institutions and work as a model is because they are aware of the fact that we have come through an enormous process of development in the last three decades in particular.  They can see institutions in Ireland which have undergone the kind of growth, reform and expansion which they would like to see their own institutions undergo.</P>
    <P>The quality of Irish aid is expressed in the quality of Irish people who work as volunteers, technical experts and missionaries throughout the world.  The role members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána have played in a number of UN missions has been continuously remarked on to me at the highest levels in the UN.  They have brought certain particular qualities of peaceful dispute resolution to the conflicts in which they have been involved in a peace-keeping role.  These qualities are unique and highly appreciated and valued.  In that context I am happy that the Army is currently running in the Curragh the first school on peace-keeping, with participants from all over the world.</P>
    <P>I know, as Senator Taylor-Quinn said, a reassessment and re-examination of budgets is currently taking place. However, I believe our contribution to overseas development assistance is giving us increasingly a voice at international level and is leading to the participation of Irish people in many international fora and in many different countries.  Although we may not seek a material return, there is a very rich return for the country.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion and am glad the Government has agreed to support the amendment. Senator Henry said the Irish Red Cross Society should have been referred to in the amendment.  I do not think anybody would have any difficulty with this. However, the motion refers to NGOs. The Irish Red Cross Society is not an NGO, but was set up on a statutory <Col N="1955" /> basis whereas NGOs are voluntary bodies. There is this difference, but I do not think anybody would quibble about including a reference to the society in the motion or the amendment.  If I proposed this, would you second it?</P>

      <P>Overseas development aid has become a major part of our involvement in countries which are at the bottom of the league in terms of their ability to fend for themselves.  I have had the privilege, if one could call it that, of attending the summit on development in Copenhagen, but I had mixed feelings coming away from it. The overseas development aid programme which the Danish Government introduced last year was for £17 million. It spent £11 million of this on the organisation of the summit, which was a nonsense. It is reckoned Denmark benefited to the extent of about $500 for each delegate which attended the summit. If the money had been spent on development, a great deal more benefit would have been gained from the conference.</P>
      <P>World leaders attended the plenary sessions, made beautiful noises for 20 minutes and then boarded their executive jets to return home.  However, numerous parts of the conference were good, but these tended to be organised by NGOs.  Participants from these organisations were in a separate building from where the plenary sessions were held and there was an opportunity for people from all over the world, particularly the developing world, to get together to discuss their problems.  In workshops they had the opportunity to discuss the problems encountered in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad overseas development aid is rising and been doing so for the past number of years.  In a recent audit we emerged with flying colours.  This is an <Col N="1956" /> indication that the moneys we provide for aid are being used in a positive way and this has to be admired.  Too often a number of the wealthier NGOs are using aid as a political ploy.  Overseas aid is now as much a part of the international political scene as the sale of arms or the political structure.  It has been a major source of political mishandling and misuse in a lot of cases and there are major players in overseas aid from the bigger countries, particularly America, who misuse the huge amounts of money donated in ways that are of no benefit to the recipients.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that we are extending our list of priority countries for overseas development assistance.  I see that we will treat Mozambique, Ethiopia and Uganda in this regard.  Mozambique is third from bottom in the world table of earnings.  It has been ravaged by civil war and before that by the colonial Portuguese, who did nothing to bring it into the 20th century.  If we are to prioritise Mozambique, we must look, as has been said by Senator Farrell, at the removal of the mines there.  Mozambique may have more people who have lost limbs due to mines than any other country in the world.  The mines that were laid there are now being found at a ferocious rate and it has been suggested that it will take many years to clear them. Unfortunately, many of the mines are of the plastic type which are not capable of being found by the traditional methods that were used up to now.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that we are discussing giving further aid to the Palestinian territories, Cambodia and Vietnam.  Both Cambodia and Vietnam have had a horrific incidence of undetected mines and we should join with other countries in attempting to get over the problems relating to detecting these modern mines which have been laid in these countries.</P>
    <P>After the euphoria of the signing of the peace accord in the White House between the Palestinian representatives <Col N="1957" /> and the Israelis, the Governments who publicly said that they would donate money have not yet paid up.  This applies to the EU as much as Japan, Finland or the US.  Various excuses have been given for the non-payment of these sums of money.  Unfortunately, many lives have been and will continue to be lost if the moneys promised do not materialise.  It is easy at international conferences to make promises that will not be adhered to; they look and read well.  Unfortunately, it is not only in the Palestinian occupied territories that the international community has not lived up to the promises it has made.  It has also happened in other areas and is because the politics of the country do not suit the potential donor countries at some stage.</P>
    <P>In development aid, like anything else, there must be accountability and a realisation that there is no point in sending aid to an area if it will not be of long term benefit to it.  Aid has killed the economies of certain countries in the past.  At a time when starvation might be occurring because of a natural disaster, aid in the form of food may flow in. If the need for the imported food disappears &mdash; the rainfall might come back &mdash; and the farmer could grow his crops again, they cannot sell it because their country might be awash with donated foodstuffs.  There must be some monitoring of the amount of aid given. Unfortunately, the monitoring that does take place is not sufficient to ensure that the overflow of aid into certain areas does not kill the cash crops.  Therefore, people get into a long term cycle of poverty when there is no need for it.  No real monitoring of the amount of aid is done.  There is no overall co-operation between all the NGOs involved &mdash; sometimes they are in direct competition with each other.  One would imagine that they were fighting with each other rather than for the people in the countries in which they operate.</P>
    <P>Apart from the amount of money that <Col N="1958" /> have been put in through bilateral or multilateral programmes from the EU and the Government, one must say that the Irish people have been the most charitable in the amount of money given.  The fatigue that has struck other countries as far as Third World aid is concerned has not yet affected Ireland. Every time an emergency occurs in the Third World, the Irish people answer the call and they keep doing it time and time again.  The Government recognises this in the sense that it is increasing the yearly amounts allocated to bring us up to the percentage of GNP which the United Nations would suggest.  We should not be aiming to reach any targets the United Nations may set, but we should keep a close watch on the OECD league table and ensure that we jump up it as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and for her statements on this matter.  Nobody could be satisfied with what is happening at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I congratulate the Labour Party for bringing this motion forward and the Government for its &ldquo;aid package to the Third World, which will amount to £89 million in 1995, the equivalent of 0.27 per cent of GNP, which represents an increase of £19 million.&rdquo;.  I also concur with the Fianna Fáil addition &mdash; I do not think it is an amendment &mdash; to the motion.</P>
      <P>Overseas aid is an important aspect of the Government's work.  I empathise with the Minister when she refers to the sub-Saharan section of Africa and the problems there, which are enormous.  I have been involved for a number of years with Namibia and Zambia and have seen at first hand the problems and the need for assistance in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the 1980s, the least developed African countries became even more marginalised and fell further behind the developed and developing countries as far as living conditions were concerned, <Col N="1959" /> which deteriorated significantly.  Sub-Saharan Africa now has the world's lowest standard of living with more than half of its population in dire poverty. The income per head of its population has fallen to an average of about $200 per head, in comparison to Ireland's figure of about $13,000 per head.  Inadequate agricultural growth and industrial development are a feature of it. Irish people do not realise the difference in the standard of living.</P>
    <P>I have seen how people live in the townships in Zambia and Namibia. There are thousands of shacks &mdash; they are not even shacks but canvas or skins supported by timber frames &mdash; with a communal tap, if they are lucky, for ten, 15, 20, 100 or 200 houses.  There is no sanitation or footpaths.  Even in the better areas of Lusaka, where people are working and there is some sanitation and water supplies &mdash; even if it is only on a small communal basis in the townships &mdash; there are no footpaths.  People walk on the bare earth which leads to high levels of dust.  One sees nurses walking home from work to these hovels as even people who work have a very low standard of living.  We saw the houses of some of the people with whom we worked and, what they consider a reasonable standard of living, in the context of their people, would be the lowest standard of living in this country.  It is not possible to compare them with any group in this country.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what Senator Farrell said, as I travel to and work in Africa on a regular basis.  On the health area, I was touched by an incident when I was in a place called Opowu on the Angolan border last November.  We arrived in the afternoon and a group of the Himba tribe were adjacent to the mission where we were staying.  There were only four rooms where one could stay and there were three of us &mdash; a Kenyan, an American and myself.  The Himbas have not changed for thousands <Col N="1960" /> of years and still maintain their traditions and dress as they did then.</P>
    <P>One of them was assisting in the mission and he could interpret for us.  The Kenyan and I spoke to them and they were very intelligent people.  One of them began to communicate directly with me and I asked what she was saying. She was showing me that her child of about a year and a half had an open wound &mdash; a deep, ugly sore &mdash; on its body.  She said that she wanted me to purchase something so that she could take the child to the health centre &mdash; although she called it a hospital it was just a little health centre.  I gave her five Namibian dollars which is a little over one pound.  I thought she was making a collection.  However, she got up and walked quietly across the road to the health centre and returned with the child bandaged.  If I had not given her the money she would have had to wait for days or maybe she would never have got the opportunity to have her child seen to.  We do not realise how well off we are in this country &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; and how badly and differently other people live.</P>
    <P>Another side of that story is that although those people were very poor and were sitting on skins around the fire cooking maize &mdash; all the children and women were together &mdash; they still had a sense of humour and were having a good laugh at the two foreigners.  The only people who come there are anthropologists who want to study this tribe. They were laughing at us buying some of their trinkets and beads and were having a good joke about the Kenyan and me.</P>
    <P>A few days earlier I was in Ombalantu. Having worked with food in my time, we travelled to the market one morning when we had a few hours off and I was amazed to see endless tables of meat, which had been slaughtered that morning, outside in 30º and 40º heat.  When somebody came to buy it they pushed the flies off so that they <Col N="1961" /> could see the meat.  It was absolutely disgusting to someone from our background but it was normal for them.  I have discussed this with doctors who tell me that while there is resistance to that level of hygiene, it breaks down and that is a real health hazard, regardless of the resistance of the population.  We saw the meat at 8 a.m. and much of it was still there when we returned at 7 p.m.</P>
    <P>Although we can criticise the standards under which they have to live, they are quite happy people, especially in Namibia.  The level of violence is very low and I felt very safe in places such as Windhoek.  I would not say the same about Zambia where the level of violence is very high and Lusaka is quite a different area.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the aid programmes moneys have been allocated to HIV testing in Lusaka.  I learned in Lusaka last March that 25 per cent of the one million people there are HIV positive.  I work with the political parties and one of their objectives is to introduce &mdash; if they can get the money &mdash; a proper education programme on the whole area of health, HIV, AIDS and drugs.  I was pleased to see in the recent report &mdash; I think it was the 1995 report &mdash; that the Irish aid programme is contributing towards HIV testing, although not to education, in Lusaka.  There is very little evidence of this aid in Namibia. However, in the Caprivi area &mdash; which is the only area of Namibia which I have not visited, although it is near Zambia and is quite beautiful &mdash; the Irish aid programme has contributed to a teacher training college and to the whole area of education.</P>
    <P>In Lusaka, the Kamanga project was developed in the early 1980s.  In Kamanga compound 6,000 people were living in an area the size of St. Stephen's Green &mdash; it was an illegal compound. The Irish aid workers went in there and organised water facilities, worked with the people and were instrumental in <Col N="1962" /> having the compound legalised and bringing in a whole series of facilities.</P>
    <P>One has to go to the areas and see the results of what the aid workers have done.  US aid workers are also very active there, especially in Lusaka.  Like Senator Farrell, I was anxious to share some of my experiences.  Irish people must be told how much people benefit from what the aid workers, the Government and the voluntary organisations do, and how essential it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very informative and useful debate, particularly the contributions which many Senators, and the Minister of State, made from their own wide experience.  I single out the specific examples given by Senator Farrell and Senator Neville which illustrate the very basic needs which are being met of housing, food, education, health and so on, and the real difference which is being made to the lives of millions of people.  That came out very clearly in the debate, particularly from those two contributions.</P>
      <P>There was general agreement that it is important we ensure that the aid is effective and not just short term. Senator Henry, in particular, stressed the need to think about the long term as well as the short and medium term. We must also develop local capacity. Our workers can sometimes work themselves out of a job by handing on their skills to local people who in turn develop programmes themselves.  There is agreement on all sides of the House that it is important that the funding continue to grow and develop and I am glad the Minister is fully committed to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many problems have been identified as well as the basic ones we all know about.  Senator Daly referred to the problems stemming from the huge growth in population in many of these countries and the problem of access to markets was brought up by one of the Fianna Fáil contributors.  Several <Col N="1963" /> Senators referred to the fact that the provision of clean water is a major source of concern and to the need to concentrate on the provision of wells and basic water facilities.  The problem of Aids, referred to by Senator Neville, is a huge one in parts of Africa.  I welcome the points made by the Minister about organising an initiative on food aid and food security in relation to the particular problems of Africa.  Many of the individual contributions referred specifically to Africa and to the extension of the programme to Mozambique.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the ongoing reform of the UN and in aiming to improve the effectiveness and accountability of the UN agencies.  On television programmes and so on there has been much public criticism of aspects of what the UN is doing.  Everybody would agree that some things the UN does could be done better, so I am glad that we are playing our part in that as well.  There is no doubt but that the aid Ireland gives, whether through direct Government support, through APSO, or through the <Col N="1964" /> NGOs, is effective, practical aid.  We know what is being done with the money because we get the feedback. Senator Daly referred to the regular meetings between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the various NGOs. That is very important because it provides the kind of monitoring Senators have been talking about and ensures that we are as effective as possible in the countries where we have development aid.</P>
    <P>This debate has not been simplistic; it has gone into the various complexities of the issue.  It has been very informed and informative and I hope that what we have said tonight will encourage the Government to continue with the programme and to move up along the league table of contributors.  I welcome the commitment the Minister made in her speech.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
