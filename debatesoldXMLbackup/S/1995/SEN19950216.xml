      <P>I have notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to request the North-Western Health Board to cease the transfer of patients from St. Conal's Hospital to community based nursing units which is against the wishes of the patients.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Lanigan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the implications of the proposed closure of the military barracks in Kilkenny and other areas, the need for the Minister for Defence to make an urgent statement of clarification as to his own position on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to examine the growing delays in cases coming to court, with the resultant hardship to those seeking legal redress.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the up-to-date position regarding the proposed marina for Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to immediately include the towns of Bray, Arklow and Greystones in the proposed pilot scheme for the renewal of traditional seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to address the problem of homelessness in Ennis, County Clare, by the provision of accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment the proposals he has to deal with the unsatisfactory public sewerage system in Sixmilebridge, County Clare, whether funds will be provided for such works this year and if he has included the proposal for EU funding.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Maloney's and Senator Lanigan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items 1, 2 and 3 today.  It is hoped to complete Item 1 by 1 p.m. with the Minister called no later than 12.45 p.m. It is proposed that there be 15 minutes for the first speaker from each group and ten minutes thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. until 4 p.m.  It will not conclude today, it will be taken again this day next week. <Col N="2007" /> Everyone who wants to contribute on that matter should be able to do so. Again, I propose 15 minutes for the first speaker from each group and ten minutes thereafter.  Item 3 will be taken from 4 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.  We will take but not conclude Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I propose that at the conclusion of Item 1 we take an additional item &mdash; an hour devoted to statements on the disturbances and events last night in Lansdowne Road.  This is a matter of urgent importance which Members would like to address.  I propose five minutes per speaker to allow as many as possible to contribute.</P>
    <P>I ask for some flexibility in ordering business today.  The Taoiseach is taking Item 1 and because, as in this House, the time for the Order of Business in the other House is not fixed, there may be a slight delay.  We will see what happens but I inform the House of that possibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to flexibility in the Order of Business and I thank the Leader for taking the initiative to allow this House the opportunity to condemn last night's events.  We must focus on the minority involved &mdash; I will not call them fans.  I will not say more because we will have an opportunity to speak later. Some of us were at a rugby match in Lansdowne Road when three times as many English fans attended and it was a marvellous sporting occasion.  Today we must focus on the causes of the trouble created by that minority.  I take it that if events unfold on this issue we will be afforded another chance to discuss any inquiry that may be held and its results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest we allow seven minutes for the first speaker from each group on that item.  Finally, I ask the Leader not to forget the request yesterday for a discussion on the Price Waterhouse report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Leader for reflecting topical issues in our business today.  It is critically important that there is an appropriate forum to discuss issues such as flooding and violence.  It is also a useful occasion for us to show our maturity as a race by recognising our near neighbours as neighbours.  There should not be any comments which write off a whole race of people in the course of today's discussions. I look forward to an interesting day during which we will take the nation from a war footing and discuss football violence, draining the Shannon and giving legal aid to those who deserve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for the arrangements he has made for today's business.  Like other Members I wish to say something about the appalling events last night in Lansdowne Road but as time has been allocated for such remarks this is not the time to do so.</P>
      <P>It appears that the framework document could be published, according to newspaper reports, next week.  In that event can the Leader of the House assure us that we will debate Northern Ireland immediately after its publication, whether it be next week or the week after?  Since the beginning of this session there have been calls for a debate on Northern Ireland.  Given that this House has always taken a very balanced view on Northern Ireland and given the significance of this document, it is important that we debate it.  The mood in the House was that it would be preferable to wait until the publication of the document before we debated Northern Ireland.  Can the Leader of the House arrange a debate as soon as possible after the appearance of the document?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's call for a debate on the Defence Forces and on the reports by Price Waterhouse and the efficiency audit group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I called for a debate on the Price Waterhouse report during the <Col N="2009" /> term of the last Government who commissioned the report.  It was widely reported that eight barracks were in danger of closure as a result of the report.  I am happy to say that the situation has changed under this Minister; he has reversed that decision.</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on the Price Waterhouse report. I am glad Senator Belton was able to save the barracks in his area.  I hope we can save the Army Equitation School because it would be absolute madness to disband it particularly in the context of the horse industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the events of last night. I wish to make one comment now.  <i>The Sun</i> newspaper was widely quoted as being ashamed of the behaviour of the English fans.  That newspaper is one of the principal causes of such boorishness and if a finger is to be pointed at anybody it should be pointed directly at Mr. Rupert Murdoch for the way he has fanned the low element in British fans.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the banter on the other side of the House.  Far be it for me to curb the amusing excesses taking place.  On yesterday's Order of Business references were made by the Leader of the House <Col N="2011" /> and other Senators to the broadcasting committee and the debate on Auschwitz last week.  There were criticisms of RTE which, in the circumstances and in view of the comments that were made, would have a certain justification.  However, it should not have stopped there.  The general reporting of that incident in the printed media fell far short of what I would have expected, particularly in the newspaper of record, <i>The Irish Times</i>, which is the only newspaper that reports regularly and consistently on proceedings in this House.  It appeared to be very selective on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Magner said, correctly, that these matters should have been discussed by that committee.  I appreciate that the change of Government could have delayed meetings of the committee.  However, a delay of two and a half months is excessive in the circumstances especially as several other issues relevant to the broadcasting committee should be discussed.  There was much comment on the transmission of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which attracted huge television audiences.  It was said that the coverage under the existing rules was extremely restrictive.  That matter and others should be examined.  I would be grateful if the Leader of the House would convey to the Taoiseach, who has ultimate responsibility for these committees, our wish for the broadcasting committee to be back in business as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House indicated a fortnight ago that he would make copies of the Programme for Government available to Members of the House.  I again ask him to make them available.  We are anxious to know the Government's plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has wisely made the decision not to discuss the framework document until after its publication. I strongly support Senator Dardis' request that we discuss the document in this House as a matter of urgency as soon as possible after its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members on the other side of the House for their co-operation today.  It is important that our debate on the events of last night should be measured and should focus on the root of the problem.  To say that Irish football or the Irish people were shamed last night is totally untrue.  The face of Irish football last night which was beamed around the world was the face of the young boy who stood in total amazement, bemusement and sadness. That was the true face of Irish football and the genuine supporter rather than any other image.  We had nothing to be ashamed of in this regard and I look forward to our debate.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Price Waterhouse report, I understand from the Minister for Defence that parts of the report contain sensitive military material.  A report is being prepared with some urgency which will combine the main elements of the Price Waterhouse report and of the efficiency review document.  The Minister hopes to have that report published in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the framework document is a document for discussion among politicians I hope we will have a full debate <Col N="2013" /> on it as soon as is appropriate following its publication.  I will make every effort to see that such a debate will take place.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton's contribution was helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Not deaf ears.  There has always been a great tradition of support for the Army Equitation School. Senator Magner also made a point in this respect.  The points made by Senator Mooney on the question of the media are well taken.  My understanding is that the committee in question has not met since the beginning of this Seanad, not the Government.  Perhaps it has done so.  I will pass on the Senator's concerns and ascertain if it can meet again as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Programme for Government, I apologise to Senator McGennis as I forgot to distribute it.  I will rectify that today.</P>
      <P>Again, Senator Wilson's point is one which agrees with that of Senator Dardis.</P>

    <Title>Lifting of State of Emergency: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann hereby resolves, pursuant to subsection 3º of section 3 of Article 28 of the Constitution, that the national emergency created by the armed conflict referred <Col N="2014" /> to in the Resolutions, pursuant to the said Article, of Dáil and Seanad Éireann of the 1st September, 1976, has ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>In moving the motion I welcome the Taoiseach on his first visit to the Seanad as Taoiseach.  I hope he will have many such visits and I know that he shares the concern of all Members of this House that the Seanad be made as relevant to the needs of a Parliament of the new century as is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House stole my thunder, but I wish to again welcome the Taoiseach to the House on his first visit as Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than seven years since I spoke in this House and I am happy that the opportunity arises for me to propose something which I have no doubt has support across both this House and the other House and which stems in no small way from the work of my predecessor.  The fact that we are in a position to propose the lifting of the state of emergency is in major respect due to work done by my predecessor, Deputy Reynolds, and others to bring about the ceasefire by both the Provisional IRA and the Loyalist organisations. It is important that I should start my speech by paying tribute to the work of others in this regard.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that it is my intention to work on what has already been achieved.  I see this process as being essentially a two stage process and the two stages are quite felicitously identified in the title of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  There are two elements here &mdash; peace and reconciliation. The first stage, peace, is an absence of violence.  Reconciliation, however, is what is necessary if we are to make sure that the peace is permanent and not just a truce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reconciliation that we are talking about here is a reconciliation between the two traditions which exist on this island, unionism and nationalism.  It is important for us who come from the <Col N="2015" /> Nationalist tradition to understand what unionism is.  Unionism is a sense of being British.  People who are Unionists feel that they are British.  They are not some form of aberrant Irish people who have a slightly different and antique interest in certain ceremonies such as Orange parades and such like and who just need a little bit of jollying along and polite talk for them to fully realise that they are not British after all but are in fact slightly misled people who belong to the same one true understanding of Irish nationhood which we have.</P>
    <P>They have a very different sense of their nationhood.  They feel a genuine sense of being British and until we come to understand what they are and how they see themselves there will not be a full and true reconciliation.  Equally, of course, they have got to come to understand the sense of loyalty, the sense of Irish loyalty that is felt by their neighbours and friends on the Falls Road, in Newtownards, in Lisburn, in Portadown and in all the towns which they tend to see as their own but which they share with people who have a very different loyalty to theirs.</P>
    <P>Both sides have to fully understand the loyalty of the other.  It is not sufficient for Unionists to say that everything would be fine if only the Nationalists would fully and completely accept being part of the UK, in a spiritual sense as well as a legal sense.  That is not possible, because for that to happen the Nationalists in question would have to deny, in a sense, their Irish nationalism.</P>
    <P>However, if that is an unreasonable request of them to make of Nationalists, it is equally unreasonable for us to demand of Unionists that they in some way, depart from their sense of being British.  The task we must set ourselves in building from the stage of peace towards that of reconciliation is one of coming to understand the other point of view more fully than we have done in the past.</P>
    <P>That is the context in which I attend the Seanad today to ask it to agree to this motion, which has already been <Col N="2016" /> debated and agreed in the Dáil, in order to bring an end to the national emergency resolved by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 September 1976.</P>
    <P>An end to the national emergency at this point in time is not just significant in terms of its legal effects.  It has very great political and symbolic significance also.  It is appropriate, therefore, that I should recall the events which have brought us to this moment in history.</P>
    <P>Effectively, this country has been under a state of emergency since 1939. The emergency declared at that time, in accordance with Article 28 of the Constitution, was in response to the outbreak of World War II.  It remained in place until 1 September 1976 when both Houses of the Oireachtas passed resolutions bringing it to an end.</P>
    <P>A new emergency was resolved to exist at that time arising out of the armed conflict then taking place in Northern Ireland and against the background of a number of violent incidents in this State in the summer of that year, 1976.  The horrific murder of the then British ambassador, Mr. Christopher Ewart-Biggs, and of Miss Judith Cooke, and the detonation of explosions at the Special Criminal Court, represented disturbing new elements which presented a direct challenge to the authority of the institutions of the State and their continued ability to discharge the functions entrusted to them under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the face of that challenge the Government of the day was compelled to act to secure the public safety and preserve the vital interests of the State. The ending of the national emergency is therefore a matter of great significance. I have great hope that it will serve as a marker in the chapter of our history, recording the lifting of a threat and the beginning of new era of peace for the people of this island.</P>
    <P>The importance which the Government places in the development of the peace process is evident in the programme. <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>  In that programme the Government has made the consolidation of the process <Col N="2017" /> towards peace and reconciliation on this island its primary task.  To that end the Government has committed itself to a number of important legislative measures, of which the lifting of the national emergency is the first.  Other measures directed to that objective will include the introduction of legislation to give effect to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the review of all legislation and court arrangements associated with the management of the conflict in Northern Ireland in the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House gives effect to the first of those commitments. A decision to move such a motion was signalled by the former Government on 25 October 1994, but had not been acted upon prior to the change of Government. The ending of the national emergency will help to signal our confidence in the developing peace process and our continuing determination to harness the opportunities for a just and lasting peace which have emerged in recent times.  Declaring the end to that emergency will, moreover, help underline the return to normality which the developments of recent times represent and the new hope and opportunities that they mean.</P>
    <P>The ending of the national emergency will have more than symbolic meaning, however.  It will have legal consequences also.  The Emergency Powers Act, 1976. enacted immediately following the declaration of the national emergency in 1976, will, in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of that Act, automatically expire on the passage of this resolution by this House today.  Moreover. section 15 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976. which empowers members of the Defence Forces to arrest and search in certain defined circumstances when acting in aid of the civil power, will also cease to have effect.  That is because that section has effect only as long as the Emergency Powers Act, 1976, is in force.</P>
    <P>The powers conferred on the security forces of this State by those legislative provisions are, of their nature, exceptional <Col N="2018" /> in our or, indeed, any legal system. That is evident from the fact that the extended period of detention for up to seven days allowed by the Emergency Powers Act was allowed to lapse in 1977, although the possibility of bringing it back into force was preserved.  It is right, therefore, that they should go now.</P>
    <P>Ending the national emergency and the consequent expiry of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976, will equally represent an early response to the comments made by the United Nations Human Rights Committee on Ireland's report under Article 40 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The committee recommended, among other things, that the State &ldquo;critically examine the need for the existing state of emergency&rdquo;. We have done so and acted upon it.</P>
    <P>The ending of the national emergency is, as I have already indicated, the first in a number of legislative steps which the Government proposes to take to consolidate the peace process.  The Government will also be acting quickly on the commitment in its programme to introduce legislation to permit the country to ratify the Convention of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>
    <P>While the ending of the national emergency has no direct implications for the continued operation of the Offences against the State Acts, 1939-85, the Government, nevertheless, intends to review that legislation as well, in accordance with the commitment contained in its programme to review all legislation and court arrangements associated with the management of the conflict in the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>The economic and social consequences which a lasting peace presents to the people of this island should not be underestimated.  The effects of the cessation of violence are already evident in terms of increased cross-Border traffic and trade.  The reopening of Border roads is also having significant effects in terms of the reintegration of Border communities which <Col N="2019" /> have been physically divided for a long number of years, especially since the commencement of violence.  The social and economic benefits of an increased level of cross-Border commercial activity and economic co-operation are incalculable.</P>
    <P>Consolidating the peace process will also create significant new opportunities for using those Garda resources which have until now had to be committed to security related duties arising from the situation in Northern Ireland.  I have no doubt that Members of the House will have many suggestions on where these gardaí might be deployed; I might have a few suggestions of my own.  Peace holds out the opportunity to use a proportion of those resources to address other pressing needs in our community such as the fight against drugs and organised crime.  Changes in that regard are already under way.  I am optimistic that a worthwhile redeployment of resources will become increasingly possible as peace is consolidated.</P>
    <P>I want &mdash; as I am sure all Members of the House will want &mdash; to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the security forces of the State for their dedication and professionalism in safeguarding our security during what has been a troubled and difficult period in our history. When I spoke in the other House I mentioned by name each of the members of the Garda Síochána, Army and prison services who lost their lives in the last 25 years.  I will not do so again but it is appropriate that this House should remember the supreme sacrifice which these people have made over that prolonged period.  We hope that a similar roll of honour will not have to be recorded at the end of the next 25 years. We remember at this time, in particular, those members who made the ultimate sacrifice.</P>
    <P>The IRA and Loyalist ceasefires marked a turning point of enormous significance. Each new day of peace increases the prospects that violence will never again be used in pursuit of political aims.  The lifting of the national <Col N="2020" /> emergency is an expression of the Government's confidence in this new era and signifies in a very concrete way our determination to advance the peace process.  It also symbolises the readiness across the political spectrum here to respond in an imaginative way to this new era.</P>
    <P>Peace has transformed the climate for political dialogue towards an agreed settlement.  The Irish and British Governments have been working closely together for some time now to assist in the process of building a better future on this island.  We want each tradition to feel a real sense of security and belonging.  We know from past experience that the achievement of this requires accommodation instead of isolation, agreement instead of imposition, consent instead of coercion and parity of treatment instead of domination. These realties have guided all our work in the joint framework document negotiations.</P>
    <P>I wish to again record my appreciation of the detailed and painstaking work which has been done on the framework document, particularly by the Tánaiste, who has been working on this matter over his entire term of office as Minister for Foreign Affairs with his officials.  He has brought this document to a very advanced stage and each time a meeting takes place between him and his counterpart, Sir Patrick Mayhew, or between his officials and the British officials, further progress towards the conclusion of this document is made.  I also wish to pay tribute to the officials on the other side who have helped us so much in this process.</P>
    <P>However, we should not overstate what this document is.  This document is not a blueprint to be imposed on anybody. It is simply a statement of the understanding about the position between the two Governments, creating a foundation or framework within which the people of Northern Ireland, through their own political representatives with the support and understanding of the two Governments and the two communities south of the Border and in <Col N="2021" /> Britain, can build their own future.  It is a matter for each community to have confidence in its own political representatives that they will be able to build on the framework document.  If they have reservations about the document, let them talk about those to the Governments and to their partners in dialogue across the community in Northern Ireland.  Let them not withdraw from discussion because it is very important that we learn the lesson of 25 years of violence, which is that it is through dialogue that problems are solved.</P>
    <P>It is also important for us on this side of the Border to recognise that 25 years of violence leaves a scar.  If it took the IRA, the Provisional Sinn Féin movement, approximately eight years &mdash; from the publication of the book <i>A Path to Freedom</i> in 1986 to last year when they eventually gave up violence &mdash; to adjust their thinking to understand that violence was not the way to advance their views, we should not expect other communities to respond in eight days or eight months.  This process of recognising that the threat is over and that a new process of reconciliation is needed will take time.  The Government and I do not expect that the day after the framework document is published everybody will embrace its provisions and say that everything in it is fine and to agree new arrangements based on it. I do not expect anything of the kind.</P>
    <P>I know that a painful and difficult process of reassessment is required in both communities.  I would be disappointed, in some senses, if people did not find something in the document to complain about because that would be a sign that the document was not challenging them.  As the Tánaiste has said elsewhere, it is important that this document should be seen to challenge both communities to revise their thinking. However, they will revise their thinking &mdash; and, perhaps, help to revise the thinking of the Governments if that is what is needed &mdash; through dialogue; they will not do so by absenting themselves from dialogue.  I ask all those who have views about this matter to have <Col N="2022" /> confidence in themselves, the validity of their views and the quality of their political representatives and to encourage those political representatives to engage in the dialogue which will advance their views within the context of a peaceful settlement for which the framework is just a framework.</P>
    <P>The violence of the past 25 years has brought into clearer focus the fundamental need to achieve a political balance across many issues.  It will comprehensively reflect that need and thereby greatly assist a new political beginning. The document should be viewed as a facilitator of dialogue and not as a political settlement in itself.  The final outcome of such dialogue will be put to referendum and the principles of political agreement and popular consent will apply.</P>
    <P>This is a very important point.  Each tradition has the ultimate right to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; because both parts of Ireland must vote on the settlement which emanates from the framework document.  If the Unionist parties are ultimately unhappy with what is agreed or what is on offer, they can say &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum. Equally, if the Nationalist community is unhappy, it knows that the people of this State will say &ldquo;No&rdquo; in their referendum and the matter will not proceed.  There is no reason for either community to be tardy in entering into dialogue because ultimately they know that the people will have the final say. They cannot, therefore, be in any sense isolated in making compromises because there is the reference back to the people at the end of the process. This should give the politicians concerned more confidence to compromise because they will not have the last word.</P>
    <P>The work of the two Governments on the framework document is almost complete at this stage.  I urge all to exercise patience and restraint until its publication. This, in my view, is a reasonable request when set against the background of violence over 25 years.  The final document will contain a complex of balances to reflect the sensitivity of the many issues involved.  It will <Col N="2023" /> reassure and challenge the two main traditions on this island.  Reassurances will be given in respect of identity and convictions. At the same time the document will challenge both traditions to rise above the constraints of the past and forge a new political destiny for all on this island and between this island and its neighbour.  In essence, it will offer real hope for a durable political settlement, yet demand realism and generosity on all sides.  When the document is published, it will, I believe, become clear that it is manifestly fair to both the Nationalist and Unionist traditions on this island.  In the meantime, I ask all concerned to withhold judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I welcome and support the motion.  I assure the Leader of the House and the Taoiseach of our total endorsement of it.  I also welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has dignified the Seanad by coming to the House to introduce the motion.  It is consistent with his attitude to parliamentary democracy, which I have been privileged to recognise over many years.  It is most significant that the Taoiseach of the day chose to come to the Seanad and use the occasion to make a significant statement regarding the prelude to the framework document, which will be published soon.  On behalf of my party, I welcome him and his recognition of the role of the Seanad by making such important and sensitive comments at this crucial time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the Taoiseach's generous acknowledgement of the role played by the former Taoiseach.  This type of not just bi-partisanship but quad-partisanship will be essential if we are to move forward in a sense of common purpose and unity towards the reconciliation we want to achieve after peace has been established.  This is not to say that there will not be differences regarding nuances and pace, but, in terms of the common purpose we are all trying to achieve at this time to secure peace through reconciliation, the House <Col N="2024" /> greatly appreciates the Taoiseach's presence this morning.  We assure him of our support and also of our critical analysis from time to time because it is a reality that the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, has the main responsibility at all times in all these areas.  I greatly welcome his recognition of the Seanad's role.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the constitutional committee in 1966 which was set up by the late Sén Lemass &mdash; the man I admired most in Irish political life and who was a man of peace and reconciliation through pragmatic co-operation. This committee proposed that the declaration of emergency should be reviewed at least every three years.  We saw then that the need for emergency powers was not consistent with the functioning of normal democracy.  It is important to recognise that the emergency which existed in times of war, armed conflict or armed rebellion, as it was called under the Constitution, terminated after the end of the war. Great sacrifices were made by all our people and there was a great sense of common purpose and cohesion on the part of those who were thrilled and privileged to serve in what was called the Emergency.  We should not forget those people, rather recognise the great national fervour and dedication which was a feature of that period.  However, emergency powers belong only to emergency periods.  I am very happy that the declaration of the emergency is being terminated.</P>
    <P>I am also happy, as the Taoiseach indicated, that it is the Government's intention to review the Offences Against the State legislation, which will not die with the ending of the declaration of emergency.  We must recognise that the powers under this legislation are not characteristic with the normal exercise of democracy.  It is not appropriate for me to go into all the details now of where this is the case, given the time available to me.  However, as was pointed out in the Lower House, it was never intended that Offences Against the State legislation could be used <Col N="2025" /> against vocational organisations, such as the Irish Farmers' Association, which happened in its time, and many others.</P>
    <P>The only emergency Ireland has experienced in recent times was the events last night.  It had nothing to do with the events we are discussing here. It is important to recognise that some of the comments made this morning about the Garda Síochána are totally inappropriate. I completely reject those comments, particularly in view of the fact that they comport themselves so well. Should we be responsible for the fact that there are elements in society elsewhere who are mindless and violent? Should our police be blamed for that? This would serve no purpose in the common understanding we want to reach with the British people and Government.  It is significant that the British media did not attempt to blame us or our police but some of our people want to use this occasion to blame the Garda, who will police the State when there is not an emergency, for events for which they have no responsibility whatsoever. The events occurred at a sporting fixture and involved people who were hellbent on trouble.  It is a distortion of reality to state that it involved only 40 or 50 people.  This does nothing to encourage the relationship between us.</P>
    <P>Now that Ireland is getting rid of emergency legislation, I suggest that we nudge our partners, the British Government, to get rid of some of its emergency measures &mdash; for example, the powers under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  I must be unique in parliamentary representation as the only one who was detained under that legislation.  I was detained&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I indicated honestly on the form I signed that I was to address the British Irish Federation's annual meeting, held outside Birmingham.  I also stated that I was to have political discussions in Westminster, <Col N="2026" /> although I did not say with whom. It happened to be with David Owen and David Steel and I was detained for that. If we want to encourage harmonious and proper relationships we are now free to ask the British Government to look at its emergency powers which should not be a feature of the relationship that should exist between two mature friendly states.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has rightly addressed the Unionists' sensitivities which have been expressed pretty freely these days. I recognise the Unionist people as a legitimate element of our country who have made a major contribution.  My frustration over many years has been that the contribution they can make in confidence, as distinct from a caged position, has never been released.  I hope we are on the way to doing that, but the risk is that they will be out flanked by peace, as has been said. Surely an opportunity which will come with the publication of the framework document cannot be rejected by people who would claim to represent the interests of a community where we can work together in harmony and common purpose for economic development, cultural understanding and vigorous pride.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Taoiseach in relation to a recognition of the British identity of the Unionist people.  It is their instinct.  They must equally recognise our instinct.  We cannot have, and both Governments have said this, the kind of domination by one tradition over another which was, unfortunately, a feature of Northern Ireland for so long.  There is a belated recognition now that each has the dignity of their own inheritance; each has a level of intelligence and intellectual capacity which was not always recognised, and that is a sad reflection of the events over 50 years up there.  In common purpose we can achieve so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be dealing with constitutional positions when we see the framework document.  I have always found it unacceptable that there was an impression in the constitutional position as it is under Bunreacht na hÉireann <Col N="2027" /> that this was a claim by us on them. Anybody who represents the existing Articles 2 and 3 as a claim by the South on the North is making a total distortion. We have no right to make such a claim; we have no wish to make such a claim.  Those who framed the Constitution were not making such a claim.  It was a statement of territorial integrity, pending the reunification of which the laws were to be confined to the 26 county jurisdiction.  I do not see that as a claim by one on the other.</P>
    <P>If the discussions are to elaborate that point and bring it out in a reassuring way, I will greatly welcome it.  I have been involved for one reason or another in the course of my parliamentary career and I am happy to be spokesperson on this area.  Over many years, as spokesman or Minister dealing with relations with Britain and Northern Ireland, I could never allow that impression of the relationship even under the constitutional framework that exists at present.</P>
    <P>The existing framework is under the Downing Street Declaration.  I am privileged to be a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  It has done considerable work; contact in itself brings about understanding and common purpose.  Is it not sad that the Unionist representatives in Westminster, who want to have a role and a say, are deliberately absenting themselves, depriving themselves from the opportunity of making that contribution to the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body?  I do not think that any Conservative MP can speak for them; I certainly do not claim that I can.  I do not think that anyone at that body can speak for them; they should speak for themselves but they are depriving themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we have a framework in place in the conditions now brought about by the ending of the emergency here and, hopefully, consequent declarations elsewhere, they will play a full and vigorous part in the confident expectation that the response from all sides here will be reassuringly <Col N="2028" /> welcome and helpful.  The divisions of the past have no right to cut across the promise of the future.  I welcome the motion which helps us to move forward to a new common purpose and intention.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that it is a sensitive period in British politics.  It has been sensitive in British politics for many years in terms of the role which the Unionist representatives can play in the survival of the British Government. Twice in my own experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs I saw a Government in Britain &mdash; the latest of which was James Callaghan's Government with Roy Mason &mdash; when we were in negotiation with them look more to their own stability in government in the arrangements they made with the Unionist MPs which had nothing to do with the proper direction and purpose required at the time.  The priority was survival.  It happened previously under former Prime Minister Harold Wilson; so much for those who would suggest it is only a matter of concern under the Conservative Party.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note in recent times &mdash; and I do not say this as being a signal from government to any Unionist representatives there that it will throw them aside &mdash; there seems to be on the part of the present British Government a determination to proceed in accordance with the understandings which emerged in the Downing Street Declaration and are now about to be incorporated in the framework document.  If others choose to react to that in the way one would wish they did not, it is for them to reconsider their position.  I say to the Unionists that the right of veto is never a guarantee of recognition, respect or achievement.  I am happy to note that the current disposition of the present British Government is rather different from that which I experienced from time to time as Minister.</P>
    <P>In that the motion gives us the opportunity of creating the background and foundation for the return to full, vigorous and normal politics and understanding between our two countries, Governments <Col N="2029" /> and, above all else, between the peoples on this island.  I enthusiastically endorse it.  I thank the Taoiseach for doing us the dignity to come here to give us the flavour of his views and sensitivities on this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contribution the Taoiseach characteristically and generously paid tribute to his predecessor. Apart from being well merited, that tribute underlines an important point for all of us, that nobody owns the peace process.  Nobody has a monopoly on the desire to help resolve the problems in Northern Ireland.  There is a continuum and, whether past Governments and Leaders have been successful, it is important to say emphatically that all have sought to get to the position we are in today and all would seek if in that position to move the process on with the resolution which the present Government, Taoiseach and Tánaiste are showing in an attempt to make permanent what we have now experienced in a perhaps temporary capacity over the past months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is also an opportunity for me, as Leader of the House, to say that over the years the Seanad has produced many people who have played their part in trying to move the peace process on and to bridge the gaps of understanding and misunderstanding.  I recall surgeon John Robb who, for many years using the platform of this House, sought to bring about practical, thoughtful and principled reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  Séamus Mallon, who was a Member of this House in the early 1980s, is one of the great unsung heroes of Northern Irish politics; a man who has undergone tremendous privations and suffered greatly in his work for peace and reconciliation over the years. He is a man who has had the courage to change his views, to move along and to adapt, all in the interests of peace.  We have had Professor John A. Murphy who was always prepared to push the frontiers forward in thinking about Northern Ireland, as is my own colleague Senator Ross, who was and is <Col N="2030" /> prepared to state views which were not always popular in this House and to speak out with an understanding of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland &mdash; people who needed a voice in this House to speak on their behalf. The present Chairman of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was a Member of this House who, in her time here, also said and did useful things on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are two other people I would like to mention.  Senator Wilson has shown by example the true meaning of reconciliation in Northern Ireland; he has inspired people and has been part of the ongoing peace process.  Senator Haughey, who recently joined this House has, in a very quiet and practical way, sought both to benefit the economic underpinning of peace in Northern Ireland and to bring the two communities closer together.  In its own way, this House has been trying to give its lead in helping to bring the two communities together in a constructive and principled way.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, the Taoiseach mentioned the circumstances which brought about the need for this legislation: the murder of the British Ambassador and one of his staff in 1976. All of us remember that day.  It was one of those moments when we all remember hearing the news and the shock and incomprehension that this could happen. At a time when it is easy to get into anti-English or anti-British stereotypes given the events of last night, it is important to pay tribute to the long line of British ambassadors, all of whom have sought to serve their country and all of whom, since the death of Mr. Ewart-Biggs &mdash; his wife who devoted the rest of her life to the cause of peace and reconciliation on this island &mdash; have been people of peace who sought further understanding between our two countries.  It is important to make these points today on what should be a historic and hopeful day.</P>
    <P>We all know how long and how difficult the road may yet be but we are in a position nobody could have thought <Col N="2031" /> possible just one year ago.  We are in the position where the democratic underpinning of whatever settlement is reached will be essential.  The principles of consent and consultation which are built in should remove any sense of fear, any sense that we are trying to pull a fast one, any sense that we have imperial ambitions, any sense of anything other than our &mdash; when I say our I mean all parties in this House &mdash; total <i>bona fides</i> in seeking to resolve in a permanent way the problem that has been Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, very rightly, paid tribute to the security forces, and not just to those who paid the supreme sacrifice. Those of us who have lived all of our adult life through the Troubles will remember the shock and horror we all felt in the early days when a soldier or a policeman was killed in the execution of their duty, the shock we all felt when our late colleague Billy Fox was murdered back in the 1970s.  The awful thing was that, as the Troubles progressed, the shock became less and less; it became a daily, routine act of horror. The names which were branded so vividly on our minds in the early days soon became just other names.  Today we can, in some small way, pay tribute to the security forces, the Garda and the Army who, in a very unglamorous and difficult way over all those years, have carried out their duties so honourably in the national interest.  That is something we must never forget.</P>
    <P>The presence of this legislation and of the state of emergency raises fundamental questions, some of which were touched upon by Senator O'Kennedy. There is the question of balance in a democratic, plural society, how we can balance the need for civil liberties in the fullest possible way, ensure that police powers will never be used in an arbitrary fashion, ensure that rights will not be eroded bit by bit through the use of legislation which was never intended to be used in that particular way, and how all of that can be reconciled with the overriding principle of the safety of the <Col N="2032" /> people &mdash;<i>salus populi</i>&mdash; the first duty of any Government.  This has faced every leader of this country over the years.</P>
    <P>In the 1920s, the Government of W.T. Cosgrave had to take harsh, terrible decisions.  It did so because it believed that the safety of the people and the survival of the State were at issue.  In the 1930s and 1940s.  Mr. de Valera was faced with equally difficult decisions.  He believed, in his best judgment and on the best advice available to him, that the safety of the policy of neutrality, which had the overwhelming support of the majority of the people, was at risk and he took the appropriate action.  Likewise in the 1950s Taoisigh John A. Costello and Éamon de Valera were faced with similar situations as were Taoisigh right up to our own time, during the 20 plus years while this legislation has been in effect.</P>
    <P>When we look back on the 70 years of independent statehood, we see that on balance, this State had been judicious, careful and prudent in the way it has used these powers.  There have been abuses; there have been excesses.  It would be wrong to say that there have not.  On balance, any reasonable historian looking at these years in a dispassionate and fair-minded way will say that the abuses and the excesses have been few and that Governments, once aware of them, have sought to redress them, maybe not as quickly as they should have.  It is not always easy to redress a situation like that.  We can say that there has been an attempt to ensure that a proper sense of balance was kept.</P>
    <P>It is important to make this point because we have seen in the last 50 or 60 years that a democracy that cannot defend itself is hardly worth the name of being a democracy.  We saw it most vividly in the history of Weimar Germany where the new democratic institutions proved themselves totally incapable of withstanding the excesses of right and of left; how quickly the democratic freedoms withered away; how quickly totalitarianism took root. <Col N="2033" /> That was largely because in the German state of the 1920s and 1930s the democratic institutions were not capable of defending themselves.  When we look to the modern German constitution, we can see a very deliberate attempt to learn from the mistakes of the past, to ensure that civil liberties, civil rights and democratic rights are respected, but also to ensure that the state is strong enough to fight against and withstand the attacks of those who would use democracy to subvert democracy.  We must never forget that.  We must never forget that this is the balance which every government must be in a position to judge and to recommend appropriately.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this is a happy day.  It is a hopeful day, it is the beginning on the road, hopefully, to a solution that will find agreement in spite of all the difficulties.  We should recognise the needs and the rights of a state to defend its own institutions.  I believe that, on balance, the judgment will be that the extreme powers given to successive Irish Governments have, for the most part, been used in a democratic way within the law and have not been abused.</P>

      <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate.  The first issue which has always confused me about this declaration of an emergency in the legislation is that there is a type of internal conflict in the Constitution which gives the authority and responsibility for declaration of war to the Dáil, but requires the Seanad to participate in the declaration of an emergency which would arise from that.  I often wondered about that and I would like to hear the Taoiseach's views as to whether that area of the Constitution needs to be tidied up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased with the view expressed by the Taoiseach on the security forces. Over the past 25 years we have all been <Col N="2034" /> aware of the situation developing where people lost their lives.  I knew two of those people, one was a sergeant in the Taoiseach's constituency and the other was Dick Fallon, who was shot on the quays here in Dublin and whose widow died suddenly six months ago.  The people I knew, the gardaí in particular, were decent, hardworking, committed, everyday heroes who protected the public. It is appropriate that the Taoiseach used today's speech to reemphasise their role because their families need to know they are not forgotten and that their contribution was important.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased the Taoiseach spoke about Northern Ireland.  The words he used were well chosen and crucially important.  Without being patronising, I hope those words will be reiterated by Government Ministers and politicians over the next two weeks before the publication of the framework document. The most worrying aspect of it is that there is a belief, especially in the North, that the solution to our problems lies in that document.  The first reaction to it will be axiomatically negative.  A friend of mine from Belfast, on whose wisdom I put great store, has a great saying when discussing the North and arguing for and against issues.  He says, as is our way in the North, that arguments against tend to hold sway on the day. We must be careful in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would have welcomed a discussion before the publication of the framework document, although I am aware of the arguments against it.  By asking people now what they expect, want and hope for in the framework document, they are put in a frame of mind which by its nature must be constructive.  They are starting off from a blank sheet and must give their views, outline their expectations and argue from that point.  When people pick up the printed document next month their first reaction will be negative and I am concerned about that. We must put something in place before that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about reassurance and a challenge.  Over the past six months I have tried to encourage movement <Col N="2035" /> in a quiet way in the educational area North and South, but it is impossible. In yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i> the headline &ldquo;Fouled by the INTO&rdquo; appeared in the Tuarascáil column.  I will explain what the foul was.  When trying to look at a new Ireland in our contribution to the Forum and what we would do with the Irish language, while taking on board that Mr. Paisley from Ballymena might be less than enthusiastic if his children were forced to learn the Irish language, we put together a proposal about how schools would deal with the language.  There would be all Irish schools, schools where Irish would be a compulsory subject and other schools where it would be optional. Attention has now focused on me.  I read the word &ldquo;foul&rdquo; in the Irish language newspaper on Sunday and again in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i>, that that proposal is an unacceptable sell out of the Irish language and will undermine our culture.  I will defend myself in the appropriate forum, but this is a classic example of how little people will move and it worries me.</P>
    <P>More than most Members I have a lot of interaction with people both North and South because of the INTO's base in Belfast.  Although this may seem patronising, people in the North, no matter what side of the spectrum they are on, have lost 25 years of social, intellectual and philosophical development.  Whenever I say that to people in the North it leads to a row, although I do not mean it in a demeaning way.  People in the North worried for their lives, their children and their safety and security; they have not been able to have polite discussions on social and other issues which we have had over the past 25 years.  When the document is published in the next few weeks and if there appears to be a strong negative reaction from the North, I appeal that it should not be described as uncaring, Neanderthal, etc., because we are talking about one million people who have not had the opportunity to live ordinary, peaceful lives over the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> I believe the most difficult part of the peace process &mdash; and this is critically important in regard to the forum &mdash; is that we must bring people through those 25 years.  For example, I told this House about visiting the site of a school which became a crater one day later, or visiting the home of a teacher who had been shot in his classroom.  When in Belfast last weekend somebody disagreed with a point I made and asked me, from a teacher's point of view, if I knew what it was like to be locked up in my staff room by paramilitaries while they taught children how to make bombs in the classroom.  That is what these people have had to live with.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow in Belfast I will attend a meeting of the ICTU executive council, the TUC executive council from England and Wales and the Northern Ireland Congress of Trade Unions to look at how we can move forward while ensuring that the British Government continue to invest the same level of resources in Northern Ireland now that there is peace.  There is also a need for a complementary approach to laws North and South.  Much was made of a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> about somebody driving through the North who committed a minor traffic offence but who was held in a police station for hours because he was from the Republic.  The House should know about three friends of mine travelling from Portadown to a conference six months ago who drove over the white line on the Dunleer by-pass.  They were brought to the Garda station in Drogheda and were not allowed to leave until they each went out to get £50 from the local banklink machine.  This incident shows that this is not happening only on one side of the Border.  In fact, one of the more disadvantageous responses to the peace process is that those of us who drive in Northern Ireland are more likely to draw attention to ourselves more regularly.  Last Saturday afternoon a member of the RUC explained to me that he could hold me overnight.  I told him I was aware of that.  There is a need for legislation <Col N="2037" /> to ensure that those involved in minor traffic offences, including speeding, North or South, should be allowed to continue their journey.  I was glad that I shared my problem with a member of Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something which we need to look at.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly subscribe to the Taoiseach's views about the recognition of the tendencies towards unionism and nationalism.  However, I have one criticism. I passionately ask the Taoiseach to ensure that members of his Government do not use the words &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;republicanism&rdquo; as synonyms for each other.  They are two quite different concepts. Presenting republicanism as being nasty or unacceptable is giving ground to the paramilitaries.  A pluralist society is, by its nature, republican.  What we are referring to here is the negative side of hard core nationalism.</P>
      <P>The issues of being Irish and British and Irish and Nationalist need to be discussed; words are important.  That is why I would have liked to have a discussion before the publication of the framework document, which would have given an opportunity to people to put their views forward.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach for his work to date in this area after taking over from his predecessor.  I wish him every luck and hope that the process works properly.  If we are to change this island it will happen in the sub-political structures, guided by political decisions, and we will have to look at those structures carefully.  A discussion where people must put their views forward before they are allowed to react to matters could also be useful in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my gratitude to Senator O'Toole for providing me with this opportunity to contribute.  I would very much like to welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  I am sorry that it has been seven years since he has been <Col N="2038" /> here and I hope there will not be another seven year gap.</P>
      <P>One of the things which struck me very clearly about the Taoiseach's initial contribution was the generous tribute that he paid to his predecessor, Deputy Reynolds.  That is important because there must be a bipartisan approach.  I think that this is a kind of rolling and developing situation in which Deputy Reynolds was an essential catalyst. However, I am glad that Deputy Bruton is now Taoiseach because he is adding something new that was perhaps not present in the Fianna Fáil approach, as I experienced in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation at Dublin Castle. The Taoiseach clearly demonstrated in his unscripted introduction the capacity to make the imaginative jump to understand what the Unionist position might be.  That is something that I felt, generally speaking, was lacking in the forum. It is a great pleasure and relief to me to hear it enunciated so clearly from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I produced a paper analysing the Fianna Fáil submission at the forum; I am not going to go into it in detail, there would not be time.  During the discussion I noticed that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was asked about parity of esteem and to give examples.  He gave four: the Border roads to be reopened, respect for the Irish language, the removal of the British Army from the GAA pitch at Crossmaglen and one other example which I cannot remember.  The interesting point about those was that while they were all reasonable requests, every single one of them came from the Nationalist perspective.  There was no suggestion, for example, having mentioned the GAA, that it might be encouraged officially, even if discreetly, to remove the ban on serving members of the RUC from playing GAA games.  I very much doubt if there is an enormous queue of RUC people dying to play hurling. Perhaps there is, but I have my doubts.  But it would have shown some degree of sensitivity if parity of esteem had not been totally one-sided and if <Col N="2039" /> there had been an attempt to understand what perhaps might make the Unionist people feel more comfortable with co-operation.  It is perfectly clear that what we will get in the intermediate and medium term is co-operation and not a united Ireland.  It is clear that even the Sinn Féin people have admitted that this is not an immediately realisable objective.</P>
    <P>What the Taoiseach said this morning is interesting because those of us who heard Mr. Garland, a former Unionist councillor, speak at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation &mdash; the Independent grouping was ably represented on that day by my colleague, Senator Quinn &mdash; would have been struck by the remarkable difference between his contribution and all of the others.  He spoke in a kind of nonconformist way.  He was giving witness.  To be honest, some of us who might be a little more hardened politically could have found it a bit tedious because it was so personal.  At the same time it was interesting because it gave us an indication of the way the northern Unionist mind works.</P>
    <P>We are, by and large, a tolerant society.  We need to extend that tolerance and understanding to the North of Ireland, which is where we will be challenged. When we criticise the Unionists for their undoubted elements of misrule, one often forgets the fact that what one has down here is a very biddable, amenable and mealy mouthed Church of Ireland minority.  I am part of it; I know exactly how mealy mouthed, biddable and humble they are.  But they are also well heeled and influential, so it suits our authorities not to push them around too much.  But if we were not 3 per cent of the southern Irish population, if the percentage ratio was 40/60 and those in the Church of Ireland were waving Union Jacks, saying that they did not recognise the courts and singing &ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo;, I wonder if we would be able to congratulate ourselves so fulsomely on our tolerance?</P>

      <P>I very much welcome this motion.  I would also like to join with the other Members who have welcomed the fact that the Taoiseach came to the House to present the Government's position.  He stayed with us for most of the debate.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the way in which the Taoiseach presented his comments; this has been referred to by other Senators.  He presented the House with the balanced position we are currently in with regard to the framework document. As Senator Norris said, there is a need for us to make that leap of understanding of the Unionist community's position and the need, as the Taoiseach said, to give them time to absorb the position in which they now find themselves. Senator O'Toole referred to what I would describe as a habit of negativity in the Unionist community. They have seen themselves in the position of always having to defend their <i>status quo.</i>  Therefore, they have not been able in some ways to look into the future in the way we have done.  It will take time for them to accept the present position and to work out ways in which they want to move forward with their Nationalist neighbours.</P>
      <P>It is important, as the Taoiseach said, that the framework document is seen as a basis for discussion.  It is the basis for people to come to the table, talk to each other, put their position forward and argue it in a democratic framework.  It is not in any sense a final document, but merely a document for discussion.  I sincerely hope and add to the pleas of others that the unionist leaders would see this document in that light and for what it is.  I would hope that they would not absent themselves from the discussion, show the leadership that is needed and bring their people to the table to take part in the discussions that will lead us to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> In many ways, as the Taoiseach has said, the removal of the state of emergency is symbolic of the ending of the 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland and of a new time when violence has ceased.  People have seen that violence has not brought any prospect of reconciliation but in fact has obstructed the possibilities of reconciliation.  That is in many ways why northern society, as Senator O'Toole described, has not had the opportunity to have the kind of normal dialogue and discussion that occurs in other democracies.  They have had to live under the threat of violence in all of that time and have had to live in that unnatural society, which is exemplified in the emergency legislation that was brought into this country in 1976.  It is important to allow people that kind of space and time to come to terms with the possibilities of peace and to take that leap of hope which was presented to the Northern communities in the cessation of violence last year, in the setting up of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and, more particularly, in the framework document, which we hope will be before us next week and on the table for discussion.  In some ways we in the South must also accept the that we have not always understood the complexities of and have isolated ourselves from the realities of society in the North.  As a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation one of the things I have learned in the past few months is the complexity of Northern society.</P>
    <P>What is often described as the third strand are people who do not see themselves as being in the hard line of nationalism or unionism.  There are many overlaps and many other ways of looking at society.  There is no way that the hard lines of nationalism and unionism can achieve their aims because we cannot possibly have both a united Ireland and complete integration with Britain. We are looking for reconciliation between those extreme viewpoints and a way forward in which both communities can work together and in which we <Col N="2042" /> in the South and the people in Britain can play our parts.  I hope we are looking to a pluralist society which will embrace different viewpoints and that the opportunity for building such a new society will be provided.</P>
    <P>There is the ultimate democracy of a referendum at the end of this process, as the Taoiseach said.  Nobody will be coerced into anything, it will be put to the people, North and South.  There is also the principle of consent as the bedrock for all discussion.  I hope the Unionist leaders will realise they are safeguarded by those principles and take the framework document in the spirit it is intended and come to the table.</P>
    <P>In some ways I see the original emergency of 1939 through sepia coloured photographs of people coming together against an outside threat.  It is much easier to deal with an outside threat than with something which is part of one's own community.  This is the difference between the emergency of the Second World War and the one since 1976.</P>
    <P>There are lessons to be learned from Europe, to which other Senators have referred.  In Europe structures and institutions were put in place which ensured such conflict could never occur again. We must learn to put those kind of structures into place.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to other lessons, particularly allowing the State to defend itself without transgressing on civil liberties in an unreasonable way, allowing it to defend itself against internal threats and ensuring that those kind of fascist tendencies can never again gain sway.  In dealing with legislation, the Constitution and the courts we must keep this balance.</P>
    <P>Other Senators referred to the situation which existed at the time of the 1976 declaration of a state of emergency. There had been the murder of the British Ambassador, Christopher Ewart-Biggs and Judith Cooke, the Kingsmill massacres, the murder of a garda, the explosions in the Special Criminal Court and other acts of violence. There was an atmosphere of a real threat to public peace.  The state of <Col N="2043" /> emergency was introduced in response to something which was very real.  Over 3,000 people have lost their lives in those 25 years of violence.  We are now in a very different situation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that this is only one of a number of measures which will be taken, including examining the Constitution and other legislation, such as the Offences Against the State Act, and the intention to introduce legislation so that we can ratify the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners.  All these measures can and need to be taken as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In the North many measures also need to be taken.  Some have already been taken, such as the removal, to some extent, of troops from the streets. There is a need to take action on policing and this has occupied a great deal of the discussion in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  A bill of rights is another necessity which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Punishment beatings are, unfortunately, an aspect of violence which is still with us.  It is intolerable that this so called method of justice should be used. The opportunity must be taken for all people who have embraced democracy and believe in the democratic process to condemn punishment beatings.  Dragging a man's legs through railings and holding him down while his bones are being broken is no way to administer justice.  There can be no double think on this.  There has to be not just a very clear condemnation but a willingness to do whatever can be done to stamp out this process.</P>
    <P>With regard to the peace dividend in terms of economic and social progress, a great deal of money has been committed from the United States and the EU and money is continually poured into Northern Ireland by British taxpayers. One of the concerns I have is to ensure that this dividend spreads to all sectors of the community and that the have nots are included in the equation.  Sometimes the people who need economic and <Col N="2044" /> social assistance most do not have a very strong voice and are not always able to argue as coherently and as strongly as the better off sections of society.  This issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate, that our state of emergency can now be ended and that this is supported by all parties.  The peace process is not the possession of any one party and it is seen as the duty of all of us to take part in any way we can.  I am pleased this debate has taken place and that the Taoiseach came to the House to lead it.  I hope it signals and is a symbol of a peaceful way forward for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support this motion.  Conflict has existed throughout our nation for hundreds of years.  From the formation of this State politicians and well wishers have worked diligently and with enthusiasm to build a country worthy of international investment and to create an environment where such investment was secure.  Our record of achievement is good in this respect.  We are a young country.</P>
      <P>Just one generation ago our politicians and civil servants were pioneers in developing incentives to encourage investment.  While the conflict in Northern Ireland inflicted a heavy financial burden on our State due to the cost of increased security, thankfully it did not crucially tarnish the image of this part of the island as a good place to invest. We must acknowledge the good work of the IDA and other institutions throughout this time for the supreme effort they have made to support and sustain the image of this country as a credible location for producing a good return on investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the initiative of the last Fianna Fáil led Government when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, pledged to end the state of national emergency.  This was a proper response to the ceasefire declarations of the IRA and their Loyalist counterparts. It has to be said that any serious investor who has been examining a <Col N="2045" /> location to invest could not ignore the requirements for such measures to maintain democratic Government and the removal of the state of emergency is a positive signal that permanent peace is with us and that differences of opinion will henceforth be dealt with democratically within the State.  No doubt the dilution or removal of the emergency provisions legislation in Northern Ireland will similarly have a substantial impact on the perception of Northern Ireland abroad, as well as helping to increase inward investment, job opportunities and political harmony in the North.  As this legislation is reviewed annually, I hope that the circumstances will soon prevail when the British Government feels it is no longer necessary.  Perhaps the time is right to take a new look at legislation and what it does to society.</P>
    <P>In the past it has always been used as an instrument to regulate and was removed when such regulation was not required.  Maybe here its removal could be used as an instrument to create harmony. The eyes of the world are upon us and opportunities await us.  To avail of these opportunities courage is needed which entails some degree of compromise, sacrifice, trust and, most of all, a high degree of understanding.</P>
    <P>History has not been kind to us.  On two occasions past governments have found it necessary to declare a state of national emergency.  The last occasion was to deal with internal threats rather than external ones.  Because of its wide powers, emergency legislation is usually required only for short periods, and should only be in force when absolutely necessary.  We cherish our Constitution and the freedoms it confers upon us. Although we are a young country our institutions have prevailed in all circumstances. Our thirst for freedom and justice is legendary.  Surely no one could wish to retain, unaltered, constitutional provisions which would allow our general freedoms under the Constitution to be fettered indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Far better that the Constitution be altered to provide that a declared state <Col N="2046" /> of emergency should lapse unless periodically reviewed, provided by resolution of the Dáil and this House. Apart from the internal benefits which such a constitutional change would bring, there are the benefits of an altered perception abroad.  In foreign countries where a state of national emergency perpetually prevails, the situation is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as a tool of oppression against the opposition and smacks of political instability.</P>
    <P>A country as young as ours, with democratic institutions of the quality that we have, must overtly show its pride in these institutions to hold its place with the great free democracies of the world in order to attract inward investment and international trading in the face of fierce international competition.</P>
    <P>The Irish are a proud people.  We do not seek charity but offer good commercial deals to any investor who puts forward a good business plan.  We offer him a stable democracy, an educated workforce, a work ethic and a place in Europe where our laws and institutions are at the very peak of righteousness. We are vigorous in our enactment of European directives and implement European standards with the same vigour. Our officials are held in the highest regard.</P>
    <P>Now that we are in a mode of reconciliation we must make a greater effort to understand the work of our fellow countrymen in Northern Ireland.  We must enhance our mutual trade and work as one commercial unit.  Four and a half million people constitute a better commercial unit than three million.  We travel abroad and are known as Irishmen and women whether we are from the North or the South.  We meet abroad and our political and religious differences become insignificant.  It would be a great psychological boost if emergency legislation could be made redundant both North and South, apart from the tempering effect it would have on those who are subjected to it.</P>
    <P>When the framework document is tabled I hope that all parties will sit <Col N="2047" /> down together to air their differences, and will endeavour to reach an accord in the interests of all the people of this island.  If this cannot be obtained perhaps agreement could be reached in a commercial manner so that all our people will have an opportunity to earn a better standard of living and provide a good education for their children, with mutual respect for each other.  That is of great importance.</P>
    <P>Commerce spans religious and political divides while poverty creates dissention which in turn generates jealousy and distrust.  It is in this environment that the need for a state of national emergency grew.  I support the abolition of the state of emergency.</P>

    <P>Exceptional events took place in 1976 and exceptional powers were needed to deal with them.

    <P>With the lifting of the emergency and, consequently, the greater availability of Garda resources, we hope that other problems, such as organised crime and drugs, can be tackled more effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's decision to end the 55 year old state of emergency is just one step of many needed to bring us into conformity with internationally accepted human rights practices.  The Programme for Government commits this Government to ensuring that people in this State enjoy the rights taken for granted in most democratic jurisdictions.  These rights range from freedom of information to comprehensive legal aid.  It is therefore fitting that the Government should take the long awaited step of ending what must be the longest state of emergency in a democratic country.  For 56 years, a state of emergency has been the norm and the time it should have been ended is long past.  There is no cause for complacency. The threats which gave birth to emergency legislation, the external threat posed by World War II and the internal threat posed by paramilitaries, have been removed but they have been replaced by new threats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night we saw the havoc which a small organised group of thugs could pose to civil society and their fellow football fans.  Of course we have our own home grown thugs.  It could be argued that organised crime poses a great threat to civil society as did paramilitaries. Let us be clear about it.  Guns and violence have not been removed from Irish or European society.  The new threats demand new responses which must concentrate on prevention, <Col N="2049" /> detection and punishment but do not of course dilute the civil liberties of the individual.</P>
    <P>The lifting of the state of emergency heralds both opportunities and dangers. It gives us the opportunity to construct a truly civilian security service in which the powers of the Garda and the Army are entirely separate and the Garda are seen as the prime guarantors of internal security and freedoms.  I was very interested to hear in the Taoiseach's speech:</P>
    <P>Consolidating peace will also create significant new opportunities for using those Garda resources which have until now had to be committed to security related duties arising from the situation in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>A thorough review of the Offences Against the State Act is required.  I have held that view for a long time.  I urge the Minister to consider reforming or indeed abolishing the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing us is to ensure that our administration of justice conforms to the minimum standards taken for granted in a democracy while still ensuring that the public is adequately protected against emerging threats.  As everybody here knows in rural Ireland at this time people are living in fear because of the policy of closing rural Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I read in a local paper last week about a man &mdash; I will not mention the case specifically &mdash; who went to town to do his business, drove home and awaiting him were thugs who murdered him in his own home that evening.  It only got a small paragraph in the papers the next day and it is probably forgotten now.  I am stating clearly and will continue to demand the redeployment of gardaí who are relieved from duties in the Border to man rural Garda stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave and Senator Sherlock for allowing me two minutes.  I had not intended to speak this morning.  I, foolishly as it turned out, thought the debate would be on the ending of the national emergency which I totally support.  As the morning has progressed, having been started by the Taoiseach, we got into a general discussion about the framework document and the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>While I have nothing prepared and do not have the easy facility of speaking off the cuff, I believe I should say the following. I appeal most earnestly to the leaders of the Unionist community to sit down and talk.  The cessation of violence continues and each day it lasts with no bombs or people killed has to be a good day for Ireland and particularly for Northern Ireland.  I ask them not to reject it out of hand but to sit down and talk.  The vibes I get from people in the grassroot Unionist Protestant community are that they want to talk and hope their leaders and politicians will talk.  I simply want to say to the leaders of the political parties, and particularly the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland, to sit down and talk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I thank the Taoiseach for his attendance this morning and for staying for an extended period.  Everybody in the House would agree with the sentiments in his speech which were finely expressed.  It is important that each party and group in <Col N="2051" /> the House be given the opportunity to endorse what the Taoiseach had to say.</P>
      <P>May I say to Senator Wilson, without wishing to sound condescending, that frequently what he says off the cuff is far more eloquent than what the rest of us say in scripts?  Perhaps he should be encouraged to speak off the cuff.</P>
      <P>As the Leader of the Progressive Democrats said in the Dáil, it is incredible and bizarre that since the establishment of the 1937 Constitution, we have lived in a state of emergency.  For much of that time we have not been under threat from either internal or external aggression or subversion.  It is good that we now abolish this legislation.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Wilson I assumed the debate would concentrate on the abolition of the legislation but it has strayed into other areas which I will mention briefly.  My party welcomes the motion to rescind the emergency legislation of 1939.  As a general principle, if we require powers of this nature in the future &mdash; and I hope we do not &mdash; I support what Senator Haughey said in his fine maiden speech, that such legislation should have a defined timescale and not be open ended.</P>
      <P>It is open to the House to come back to the Houses to renew such legislation if necessary.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should be given that opportunity because there is always a possibility that the freedom and rights which exist in a democracy such as ours can be infringed and maybe even abused by people who do not use such legislation prudently and fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that repealing the legislation does not affect the Offences Against the State Act or the Acts from 1939 to 1985. I would not go as far as Senator Sherlock and seek the abolition of the Special Criminal Court because in incidents such as the Brinks-Allied robbery, there is always a possibility that witnesses will be interfered with and the court may not be able to operate effectively. For that reason a court of this nature is necessary, however reluctantly one might agree with it.  I was encouraged <Col N="2052" /> to hear the Taoiseach say that he would review the Offences Against the State Act.  That is to be commended.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is nothing to be feared from the framework document. It is almost certainly to be within the context of the Downing Street Declaration and there is nothing in the latter to which one could object.  The Taoiseach did say that it should be viewed as a facilitator to dialogue and not as a political settlement in itself and I wholeheartedly agree.  I do not think we are imposing anything on anybody but we have to accept that there must be full and absolute equality of rights for each of the communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Parity of esteem is something about which those of us who are fortunate enough to serve in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation have heard a great deal.  However, much of the time what one person means by parity of esteem is not what somebody else means.  We had a good example of that last week when Mr. Garland spoke to the forum.  He was very courageous.  It was good of him to come because unless that perspective is given to us at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I cannot see how the forum can operate to its maximum effect.  He sat there for an hour and a half and answered our questions patiently and well.  What he or a Unionist might have meant by parity of esteem is not what a Nationalist might have meant by it, in that the Unionist tradition and perspective are institutionalised in the flag, in the seats in Westminister and in the apparatus of the state.  The question which arose was how could one institutionalise the nationalists' right to their identity in that framework.  I found it difficult to find that the question was answered satisfactorily, and that is not to criticise Mr. Garland.  He was courageous to come and it is my fervent wish and hope that other parties, particularly the parties which have reacted sensibly and sanely over the past few months, such as the Progressive Unionist Party, will also find a vehicle by which they could be represented at the forum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> There is all the difference in the world in terms of parity of esteem between saying we are sorry for what has happened in the past and we will ensure that these complaints do not arise in the future and saying we will institutionalise your position in the State.  That task applies equally in the Republic as in Great Britain.  It comes back to confidence in the validity of diverse views, which the Taoiseach referred to.  I support what Senator O'Sullivan said about the complexity of the issues involved.  Perhaps the forum has helped us to understand that it is a complex issue and not one which we can regard as simple.</P>
    <P>Last week we marked the 50th anniversary of Auschwitz and during the debate a statement was made that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. That applies to this State.  We must always be careful about how power is used and applied by the Executive.  We have a debt to the custodians of freedom, the people who gave their lives over the period, and we must cherish and nurture that freedom.  Throughout our discussions on how to arrive at a settlement on this island we must always remember the people who died in Shankill, Loughinisland, Greysteel and Enniskillen.  It is that memory which must drive us to ensure that nothing like that happens again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak and I thank Senator Dardis for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, to the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a proud day to be here and I am stunned by the fact &mdash; many citizens do not realise this &mdash; that for 55 out of 57 years we have lived in a state of emergency. It is a weight off our nation's shoulders to remove the state of emergency. Senator Dardis referred to Auschwitz and he mentioned that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.  We must ensure that we do not abuse the opportunities we now have in our democracy.  When we talk about parity <Col N="2054" /> of esteem &mdash; the words used by Senator Wilson when he urged Unionists in the North to talk &mdash; we must ensure we all talk; but, even more so, we must all listen.  I was in South Africa on I September when the ceasefire was announced and great interest was shown in peace for Northern Ireland.  There was also great enthusiasm for the future of South Africa, four months after a solution had been found to its problems. There is optimism for the future if we listen more than we have done in the past.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the Taoiseach's words today.  I also listened to Senator Sherlock, who talked, as the Taoiseach did, about considering the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  We must ensure that when we remove the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as I hope we will, there is a substitute for the protection of citizens.  We have not yet reached the level of democracy where we recognise that all the threats against our State do not necessarily come from outside or from traditional subversives.  Senator Dardis referred to some of those threats, which we experienced last night and a few weeks ago in the Brinks-Allied robbery and which we experience regularly on our streets.  I am not sure that we as a democracy are aware of how to handle these threats. It would be great to remove the Special Criminal Courts, but only when we have found a substitution.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that when we remove the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, particularly section 30, we have found a substitution in order to maintain our democracy against those threats which come from inside our State.  I am particularly concerned about interference with witnesses.  This has always been a threat and we must ensure that we protect ourselves against it in future. We have a democracy to be proud of and which we want to maintain, therefore we must not fear making a substitution which will help to maintain that democracy.  It is the job of the Minister for Justice and of the present Government to maintain internal peace.  I fear <Col N="2055" /> a peace which is instituted under a state of emergency or under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which is regarded as undemocratic on occasions; but I also fear removing it without a substitution.  We should be vigilant and we should protect our democracy with pride.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite everyone. We enacted a fine Constitution in 1937 and it has become fashionable, almost politically correct, to question it now.  The Constitution was a treaty, like all other constitutions, by the people for themselves.  It not only outlined the rights of the individual, but it did so in a specific way.  It provided for a balance between the people and the State and it provided that the people were the sovereign authority in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that only two years later, after enacting what was at that time a progressive and forward looking Constitution, we declared an emergency which placed a limit on the personal rights enunciated in the Constitution. We declared an emergency which permitted, and has since permitted, actions by the institutions of the State which would otherwise have been questionable from a constitutional standpoint.  In our case the Constitution makes the people the sole sovereign authority.  The Oireachtas makes the laws, the Executive implements them and the Judiciary <Col N="2056" /> adjudicates.  The emergency powers upset that fine balance in theory and in fact.  I fully accept that the circumstances which existed in 1939 were such that there was a real feeling of an external threat against the nation and of an emergency.</P>
    <P>I have never been happy with the view that a similar emergency existed from 1979 onwards.  I agree with Senator Sherlock's analysis of that situation. Notwithstanding the revulsion that was felt throughout this State at the murder of the British Ambassador and at the militant reaction to the deepening crisis in the six north-eastern counties, I could not feel comfortable with the concept that for the past 15 years we were living through an emergency which could not have been handled through existing laws.  I accept that the circumstances of the past 15 years were such that they placed pressure on existing laws, but the Oireachtas should have resolved that through normal legislation rather than emergency legislation. Other European states faced the same type of violence, although perhaps, not on the same scale, as we did during that period and their reaction was more measured and less hysterical.  For these reasons I was pleased when the Government made clear last October that the state of emergency would be ended.</P>
    <P>Another reason I am pleased to support this measure is that, as the Taoiseach said this morning, it sends an important message about the peace process. It is vital that the Governments here and in Westminster are seen to be courageous in their response to the peace initiatives.  I agree with the Taoiseach that this measure signals our confidence in the deepening peace process and helps to progress it.  This point was also made by the Taoiseach's predecessor last October.</P>
    <P>I hope our example in this matter will be watched closely and followed by the British authorities.  Their Emergency Powers Act is a source of dissension and has rightly been seen as a source of the gravest injustice against people of Irish extraction in Britain.  In more recent <Col N="2057" /> times civil libertarians in Britain have also seen that legislation as the basis of an attack on the liberties of Afro-Caribbeans and Asians.  In addition to striking a blow for civil liberties the British authorities could provide a powerful support for the peace process if they took measures such as the Government and Oireachtas are taking now.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to all the contributions made this morning.  They were diverse and covered the issue from an interesting variety of viewpoints.  The Taoiseach's contribution was well thought through and an interesting expression of where the Government and all parties in this State stand at this time.</P>
    <P>I was particularly struck by the contribution of Senator Haughey, who brought a novel perspective to the issue. We often pose the rhetorical question as to how others see us.  Debates on so-called &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; issues are liberally laced with queries about how the world sees us on a given issue.  I doubt if the citizens of France, Germany, the US, Russia, Hong Kong or Timbuktu spend a great deal of time considering where we stand on any issue; but I agree with Senator Haughey's suggestion that imposing a state of emergency, which supersedes certain liberties we have given to ourselves, makes a conscious statement about our capacity to handle our affairs.  He was right to say the action of lifting the state of emergency sends not only an interesting message about the peace process but a more general message about our capacity to conduct our business.  Senator Haughey's pragmatic appraisal of the impact of this measure in his maiden speech was most interesting.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made clear this is one further incremental step on the road to normality.  With this hurdle behind us, one hopes we will cross the many other obstacles we face and do so in a more rapid measure.  We are taking steps which will cause change.  As Senator Quinn has said, it is an important day in the life of the nation.  We are witnessing a transition from abnormality to what <Col N="2058" /> we hope will be the norm for the Irish people in the years ahead &mdash; peace without special measures.  In the not too distant future I hope, as Senator Sherlock does, we will be looking at other measures which were always regarded as emergency provisions but which undermine civil liberties in the State.</P>

      <P>No, indeed.  I am pleased at this my first opportunity to speak in the Seanad as a Minister.  I am especially pleased to be speaking on this issue.  As Members of democratic institutions we must be vigilant of the rights of the citizen.  It can be easy for the institutions of the State to take a blase approach to rights and freedoms because we think we personally pose no risk to rights.  However, we cannot guarantee who may come to power at a given time and must ensure the laws are such that they can be challenged by and protect the citizen and that as far as possible our Constitution is not breached and is adequate to protect citizens in the modern age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke in the Dáil on this issue, raising a number of questions about the Offences Against the State Act and the Special Criminal Court.  There is a need to look at the manner in which an emergency is declared and, once declared, the manner in which it remains in place until it is suspended by the Legislature. We should examine ways of ensuring an emergency will cease to be effective <Col N="2059" /> after a period of years if it has not already been set aside.</P>
    <P>I also discussed the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  It was put in place just before the Second World War.  This legislation can be used by the Garda with or without a declaration of emergency. People can be charged with not accounting for their movements &mdash; an offence of which I fell foul when I was a young man.  The power to intern can be given by the Government; it does not have to come before the Dáil or Seanad and there is no obligation to bring it before the Houses for review once the decision is made.  Again it is a matter for the Government to decide when it is introduced and removed.</P>
    <P>Given the way citizens' consciousness of their rights has evolved since our Constitution and the Offences Against the State Act were put in place, there is a need to review the powers held by both the Government and the Legislature. I am pleased the Programme for Government has a commitment to review the Constitution and the laws used in the course of the conflict during the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>This obviously will include a review of the Special Criminal Court.  It has been argued that that court's remit should be extended to deal with organised crime.  I am of the view we should be reluctant to extend the use of an existing institution, put in place to deal with political crime, to organised crime. If it is felt by citizens and the Dáil and Seanad that our civil laws are inadequate to deal with organised crimes, we should see how those laws can be improved to protect citizens going about their lawful business.  We should resist the temptation to transfer organised crime into courts which were not established or intended to deal with such matters.  I recognise that there is public demand for us to deal effectively with organised crime.  We should look at that issue now before the situation reaches the point where it will be impossible to deal with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> States in Europe and elsewhere failed in the past to deal with the emergence of organised crime and they are paying the price.  I do not intend to offer any examples but we are all aware of situations in Europe where organised crime has reached into governments themselves. It is necessary and opportune for our society to look at the issue of organised crime, how we can deal with it effectively and how we can prevent it becoming institutionalised.</P>
    <P>The cessation of the state of emergency is important in the context of the peace process.  We are all conscious of the period of freedom we have enjoyed from daily reports of people being murdered by bomb and bullet, and we are conscious of the importance of seeking to maintain that peace and making it permanent.  In that context I appeal to all politicians, North and South, to exercise a degree of responsibility &mdash; which we might not be inclined to exercise in the normal cut and thrust of political life &mdash; in relation to the work under way on the framework document.  Peace is too precious to be squandered in pursuit of some short term gain.</P>
    <P>It is particularly incumbent on politicians in Northern Ireland to be conscious of the fact that neither the British Government nor the Irish Government, in putting this framework document together, has any intention of enforcing a solution that is not wanted on the people of Northern Ireland, whatever their persuasion.  The document is intended to be an agenda for discussion to ensure that at some point &mdash; we hope in the near future &mdash; decisions can be made by the people of Northern Ireland about the government of Northern Ireland and about the relationship they wish to have with the Republic of Ireland and with Britain.</P>
    <P>The framework document is not a solution; it is not intended to be a solution; it is not intended to be an enforced agenda.  We are seeking to create a situation where people with different loyalties in Northern Ireland can co-exist in peace without feeling themselves, their loyalties or their identities to be in any <Col N="2061" /> way threatened.  Obviously, that will require compromise.  No solution &mdash; when it is achieved eventually &mdash; will deliver 100 per cent of my aspirations or the aspirations of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Labour Party or the Ulster Unionist Party or the Provisionals. There will be criticisms from all sides of either the agenda in the framework document or whatever solution is eventually achieved.  However, the bottom line for all of us &mdash; and I am addressing politicians in Northern Ireland in particular &mdash; is that the solution will be democratic, will be accountable to the people and there will be no question of coercion.  The bottom line is democracy and consent.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Offences Against the State Act earlier.  There is a number of anomalies in that legislation.  There is a provision in the Act, for example, which prohibits newspapers &mdash; presumably that now includes radio and television &mdash; from referring to the names of illegal organisations.  Obviously, for the last 25 years our newspapers, radios and televisions have been referring to the Provisional IRA, the Official IRA, the UVF, the UDA and so forth.  It is clearly ridiculous to have such a restriction in our law and to expect newspapers not to use those terms.  There is a need to look at the Offences Against the State Act.  There are also provisions in that Act for military courts.  I understand that if somebody is brought before a military court &mdash; and that decision need not be agreed by either House &mdash; and is found guilty the only sentence that can be imposed is execution.  It is clearly a law that requires radical overhaul particularly as this State is not in favour of capital punishment in any but the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Senators for their warm welcome.  I hope this is the first of many opportunities for me to speak in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to express one's feelings about what happened yesterday. The scenes we saw on television were frightening, even life threatening. It is difficult to comprehend how one would respond to it.  The game of soccer is as good a game as one could get and this was a slur on a fantastic game and everything which surrounds it.</P>
      <P>The people I feel most sorry for are the English fans who came over to see a good game of soccer, who appreciate their game, travelled to enjoy themselves and are now tarred with the same brush as the thugs who came, not to see a game, not to enjoy themselves, but to cause trouble and carry on a campaign which they have been undertaking in England and which has nothing to do with soccer or sport.</P>
      <P>I spoke with some English fans last night who were over for the game and they were appalled and ashamed.  They were, however, complimentary towards us, because, given what happened, we were prepared to talk to them.  This is a frightening situation for decent people in their neighbouring country and it arose because of the slur which has been brought on the English fans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hooligans disgraced themselves. They are not interested in soccer.  Some of them have been identified with and are known members of the National Front.  We are aware that the agenda of this organisation is to destroy society as we know it.  It is a racist organisation in the worst sense, and it is a sad reflection on British society that these people can, as it would appear to us, thrive, develop and promote themselves.  Let us hope that Irish society never becomes like that.  In this respect there is a marker here for us.  We must be thankful for what is good on our society and must <Col N="2063" /> ensure that we do not go down the road which some sections of British society have taken.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the State and the authorities were not ready for this.  We are a civilised society.  Should we be expecting this every time we go to a game?  Questions must be answered and investigations must take place, which we know and accept.  However, to assume automatically that every time there is a friendly game one must be ready for all kinds of violence would mean becoming an intolerable society. It is almost akin to saying that there should be a police state, whether it be for a hurling match, a football match, a soccer match, a rugby match or whatever. Should we be ready for all this? There were signs of it yesterday, and perhaps it will emerge in the investigation, which I do not wish to pre-empt.</P>
    <P>This is a tragedy for the Irish fans who are known throughout the world as among the best.  They enjoy themselves, they sing, they go to their game, they have their chants, they are friendly and there is never a hint of any problems. However, there is tarring from the fact that these incidents happened in Dublin. I note from one of the British papers that some Irish were arrested also. Some Irish probably reacted and got into trouble, and who would blame them?  It is a pity that there is some slur on the Irish fans, who are the best fans of any nation.  We should always compliment them on how they behave themselves abroad, and long may it remain the case.</P>
    <P>I compliment the gardaí of whom there has been some criticism.  From what I saw on television they moved decisively and controlled the situation. They contained the people who were creating the problems and they got them out of the country without causing further havoc.  They were contained within the pitch and the decent fans were allowed to go their way.  Think of what would have happened if they were not contained, and if those people got loose on the streets of Dublin last night. <Col N="2064" /> Then we could criticise the gardaí, but they contained them and removed them from the country without causing any other problems, and they should be complimented for this.  I heard some BBC commentators complimenting the gardaí last night on how they handled the situation, and how decisive they were.  Somebody hinted about police brutality on one of the foreign stations, and the other panellists turned on him, pointing out that it was time to handle situations like this in such a manner and they complimented the gardaí in the way the carried out their work.</P>
    <P>English soccer must put its house in order.  There is a problem.  Tickets were obtained by those who were known to the British authorities as people not interested in the game but only in hooliganism and the destruction of society.  A substantial number of these people were able to get tickets through their English contacts, through the FA and so on. Questions must be answered as to how this was achieved, and questions must also be answered here as to what should be in place to recognise those people entering the country.  Hopefully there will be an opportunity to discuss the report when it is published, and I will not pre-empt the outcome of it.</P>
    <P>Soccer is a great game of skill.  Some great people follow it and many people derive much enjoyment from it.  I have a young lad aged nine years who is fanatical about Liverpool.  I cannot get him to study, because he will not need points to become a professional soccer player with Liverpool.  Coming from a hurling country, soccer is perhaps my second game, but it is enjoyed by people of all ages, and long may it continue.</P>
    <P>The sooner the hooliganism is handled by those who should be responsible for it &mdash; and this is, primarily, the FA and the British people &mdash; the better. However, we must be conscious that if the English team are visiting this country we may have problems.  I understand that Scotland and England cannot play a soccer game between themselves because of the likelihood of violence.  I heard this last night and I was amazed <Col N="2065" /> that in a civilised western society two teams, under the one umbrella of Britain, cannot play a game.  Perhaps there might be good reason for Cork and Limerick, in a hurling match, not to play.  That is a joke, a Chathaoirligh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident, a Chathaoirligh, that you and other Members of the Seanad will join with me in condemning out of hand, and in the strongest possible terms, the unprecedented violence, hooliganism and mayhem which we all witnessed last night at Lansdowne Road.  I thank the Leader of the House for having the flexibility to allow these statements to be made.  I wish, at the same time, to express regret that the Minister for Justice is not in the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most serious matter because it is a core obligation of any State to provide a police service and to provide for law and order in all situations.  I would not be overstating it if I said that there is deep disquiet at the events of last night, and the fact that a relatively small number &mdash; the papers put it at perhaps 150 to 200 people &mdash; a hard core of 200 thugs could reduce an <Col N="2066" /> important international and what should have been a joyous sporting occasion into a recipe for disaster and mayhem.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, and of course the Minister is not to blame for this, we have been witness in recent times to a whole series of violent and criminal acts, such as the Brinks-Allied incident and the recent murders which have taken place.  People are beginning to wonder when the lawlessness is going to come to an end, and when are we going to come to grips with it.</P>
    <P>In terms of last night, there is little doubt as to the real cause of the violence. It was a small number of hard core thugs from England who travelled, not to enjoy a football match, but with the deliberate intent of disrupting a major soccer event.  Some of them may have been politically motivated.  It is correctly said that this is in sharp contrast to the excellence of the Irish fans who have achieved a worldwide reputation of being good humoured, loyal, friendly and joyous, which is how fans should be.</P>
    <P>Obviously, a number of questions arise as to how these people were permitted to travel in a group, secure a number of tickets so as to remain together, gain admittance to Lansdowne Road and create chaos.  These questions are all the more serious for us because we are not used to football violence; we are not used to violence from our rugby, Gaelic or soccer fans or any other fans who attend our matches in Ireland or abroad.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this is not the case with the English supporters.  We know of the events in West Germany in 1988 concerning English fans, Stockholm and Poland in 1989, Italy and Dublin in 1990, Malmo in 1992 and Rotterdam in 1993.  There is an absolute, clear and unequivocal record of English thuggery and hooliganism over a number of years.  The Garda have admitted they were in contact with their English counterparts.  If we had all this foreknowledge, why were we not better prepared? That is a most serious question <Col N="2067" /> which should be answered in this and the Lower House.</P>
    <P>There are three sets of questions for three sets of people &mdash; the Football Association of Ireland, the Garda Síochána and the Minister for Justice.  In relation to the FAI the question arises as to how these people got tickets in the first place.  Why were they not properly vetted by the Football Association in England?  Why were there not proper searches at the stadium in Lansdowne Road?  Who designed the seating arrangements whereby there was no segregation of the Irish and English supporters? Those are three very serious questions which the FAI will have to answer to the inquiry when it is set up.</P>
    <P>It has become fashionable in certain parties &mdash; not in mine, I hope &mdash; to criticise the Garda Síochána.  I admire the dedication and commitment of the gardaí last night who, in very difficult circumstances, risked their safety for our welfare.  They also risked themselves on the streets of Dublin after the match.  They did a good job in the stadium.</P>
    <P>However, who was responsible for overall security?  The Garda was in touch with its English counterpart on an hourly basis in the last few days and before that on a daily basis.  Why did it not take different steps to ensure that this would not happen?  Why were the thugs not filtered in some kind of screening process?  How was it that the leader of our party.  Deputy Bertie Ahern, could have thugs from the National Front pointed out to him in the stadium by an official of the Football Association?  Why were these people allowed in by the Garda authorities?</P>
    <P>This raises serious questions for the Minister for Justice.  It would not be fair to allege that she takes entire responsibility for yesterday.  However, she should be here to answer questions.  Did she have any meetings with the Garda Commissioner to discuss security arrangements in advance of this match? Was she informed by the Garda authorities that there was likely to be a problem <Col N="2068" /> at this match?  If she was not informed, why was she not, and will she take steps to ensure that she will be informed in the future?  If she was informed, what plans did she put in place to make sure this would not happen?</P>
    <P>We are lucky people were not killed last night and that it was confined to injuries.  I ask the Leader of the House and Senator Neville, in the Leader's absence, to ask the Minister to come here as a matter of urgency to debate these most important issues with us.  If the Minister does not come here to fully explain this to us it will be difficult for us to retain confidence in her as the person in charge of security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo many of the remarks made by Senator Mulcahy on this matter.  I was in the west stand last night and it is a miracle people were not killed as there was a great deal of panic and distress.  If there is one reputation known throughout the world, from darkest Africa to Florida, it is that of English so-called football fans.  They constitute a unique segment of followers in so far as they bring with them violence, mayhem and sometimes death wherever they go.  Condemnation is one thing but the lessons we learn from it are another.</P>
      <P>Last night's actions by the Garda were some of the bravest acts I have seen by unarmed people dealing with thugs.  That bravery deserves effective leadership and management, something the gardaí did not get from their superiors.  Questions have to be asked about that.  The gardaí were unarmed or armed only with batons &mdash; no match for the iron bars being wielded on the west stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gardaí in that stand or on the pitch yesterday, cannot be blamed because things moved rather slowly. Many chairs sailed over that balcony last night before the gardaí were able to advance.  There is no question in my mind that the bulk of the English fans in that section were not corralled as they <Col N="2069" /> ought to have been by a substantial force of police.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions which should be asked, the most pertinent of which were mentioned by Senator Mulcahy.  Tickets were given to known thugs &mdash; how did they get them? It was vitally important that the English and Irish police liaise and that intelligence was gathered and exchanged.  The authorities knew prior to the match that there would be violence, although not the dimensions of it, and yet these people had tickets.  It struck me forcibly at the time that the touts should have been arrested on the spot.  If the system could be defeated by ensuring that touts did not get tickets in the UK, why do we allow touts on the street?  Touts were selling tickets outside the stadium last night while people, including gardaí, looked at them.</P>
    <P>Why were the fans mixed?  Some of the English fans were members of the National Front who do not play around. Dogs would not be put with some of them, never mind ordinary people, and yet the fans were mixed.  That was idiocy for which there is no excuse.  They were put into the top tier of the stand which is probably the most inaccessible part of the west stand.  The trouble could have been stopped fairly quickly when the first chair sailed onto the pitch if they had been on the bottom of the stand. Why were the FAI allowed to use such a seating arrangement?</P>
    <P>The tributes which have been paid in this House to the Garda are well merited. They were extremely brave and effective.  However, behind the west stand, these so-called fans or thugs, were baying.  It was only then &mdash; and I saw it myself &mdash; that the police vans rolled in with the riot squad equipped with batons and shields.  They were not in the stadium when the riot happened. They had to be called in.  This is a matter of management and of less effective policing than one ought to see in such a situation.</P>
    <P>I thank and praise the gardaí who were on the ground, the stewards who were extremely good and effective, and <Col N="2070" /> the announcer whose calm, measured tones throughout the melee had a most calming effect on people.  I also thank the Irish public.  Many people there would gladly have gone to the aid of the civil power in this case but common sense took over.  They too deserve the thanks and applause of the House.  I look forward, as Senator Mulcahy does, to an investigation and a response from the relevant authorities, including the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to say that one is glad to take part in this debate because the events which prompted it are so disgraceful.  My father was English and I consider myself half English.  I will not say that I am ashamed to be half English but I am bitterly ashamed of the behaviour of those people.  They have brought great discredit to the English people.  It is so serious that I hope a protest will be made to the British Embassy about the behaviour of British citizens in this country.</P>
      <P>I wonder what has happened to the much vaunted sporting spirit of the British, where the game was more important than winning.  However, I do not think this is about sport or soccer. These people were not soccer fans.  It was a small orchestrated group which operated quite deliberately to disrupt the game for political motives.  I do not think their political intelligence is particularly good but they were attempting to do this because they have previously come out in support of extreme unionism.  The Combat 18 group is an offshoot of the infantile National Front movement, which is growing in Britain.  They deliberately, over a comparatively long period of time, orchestrated and planned this event and they were facilitated by the lack of proper monitoring by the English FA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole ethos of Britain is called into question by this event.  It is not just soccer hooliganism.  I was interested to hear the remarks of the soccer correspondent of <i>The Sun</i> newspaper read <Col N="2071" /> out on RTE radio, in which he said he was ashamed to be English.  He should not be ashamed to be English but he should be ashamed to write for <i>The Sun.</i> If there is any force in Britain that has demoralised the British and brought out the worst and the most loutish, immoral and unprincipled behaviour it is <i>The Sun.</i>  It has consistently targeted and vilified groups.  It has led to an increase in xenophobia.  It consistently lies, libels and slanders and does not mind picking up the libel bill because it increases circulation.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the behaviour of these so-called fans, I have been on the receiving end of the Prevention of Terrorism Act entering or even passing through Britain.  Although I am a peaceable man, a public representative and a citizen of a decent country, I have been interrogated and aggravated by this.  Do we have such legislation?  Should we not have something to prevent the type of terrorism we saw yesterday?  I note that some people were scooped up the previous day after they seriously wounded a barman in the centre of Dublin.  If these people are sentenced to terms in jail, the Irish taxpayers will have to pay for their bad behaviour.  I very much resent this.</P>
    <P>There were a number of problems, to which previous speakers referred, about the allocation of tickets.  It is quite extraordinary, given that tickets are numbered and distributed through FA travel clubs and they are supposed to have the photograph of the recipient on them and be signed by a senior official.  How did they get into the hands of these known thugs?  It was known for several days that these people were travelling in a small group, I understand of about 50, to this country.  This information was passed on, by the Manchester police in particular, to the Garda and it is a pity it was not acted upon.</P>
    <P>I spoke yesterday about the family in terms which suggested that I took a certain critical view of the family. However, the difference in character of the Irish fans relates, to a certain extent, <Col N="2072" /> to the fact that going to these soccer matches is a family excursion.  People come with their children and younger family members.  Due to a type of Irish ethos &mdash; and the Irish fans behaved extremely well &mdash; if there are one or two drunken louts, who can turn up in any contingent, they are effectively policed and subdued by the surrounding attitudes and behaviour of the remaining Irish fans.  What seemed to happen last night, from what I saw on television, was that a small group of people were able to ignite the rest so that rather than subduing them, they helped to inflame them.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot exonerate ourselves completely.  I note that one of the newspapers said the British national anthem was played and this caused resentment and booing.  We really must grow up.  It is not acceptable that the national anthem of a neighbouring country should be booed.  I remember a time when the RDS was afraid to fly the Union Jack.  The Union Jack and the British national anthem have been disgraced by British soccer fans but there are many decent people in England. These are also their national emblems and they should not be insulted in our country.  This type of behaviour is not appropriate on our part but it certainly was not sufficient to spark off the type of near riot which took place.</P>
    <P>Although I have reservations about the planning, distribution of tickets and the location of pockets of fans on a balcony, where they were virtually impregnable, could rip up seats and throw stuff down, the police behaved extremely well.  The dangerous situation was contained and the clear evidence of this is that so few people were seriously injured.  I express my sympathy to those who were injured but it is remarkable that so few were hurt in what was an extremely dangerous and regrettable situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House and the Acting Chairman.  It is quite extraordinary that the House is discussing a soccer match.  It displays the depth of disbelief regarding what took place last night in Lansdowne Road.  We are all greatly disturbed by what we saw on the television and by what people there saw. A debate was taking place in the House at the time.  A Senator came in and whispered that the match was abandoned. The first reaction was to wonder how it could possibly be abandoned &mdash; perhaps somebody was killed on the field or broke their neck.  It then transpired that it was as a result of these events and there was absolute disbelief that it could happen.</P>
      <P>I watched the pictures on television with utter disbelief last night when I went home.  It is absolutely astonishing that such a small group of people in a crowd of more than 40,000 could wreak such havoc and devastation and that there should be such manifest viciousness. From late last night and early this morning &mdash; it started before &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on radio &mdash; the media gallop has been to find someone to blame. However, I did not hear the point until late last night on television that the thugs were to blame, not the FAI, the Garda or the FA.  I subscribe to what has been said by Senator Mulcahy in respect of the questions that arise as a result of the incidents, but let us not forget that the incidents were caused by the thugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dispute Senator Mulcahy's point that it is fashionable in certain parties to criticise the Garda.  I do not know of any party which regards it as fashionable in this democracy to criticise the Garda. One might at times wonder about certain <Col N="2074" /> operational aspects of their work, but nobody criticises their capacity or bravery or that they had to intervene last night and did so effectively when called upon.  Perhaps there were good operational reasons for not having gardaí so visible in the ground at the start of the game to try to defuse the situation.  Let those matters be teased out; let us have explanations.  I agree with Senator Mulcahy that the Minister should be here to give us her views on some of those matters.</P>
    <P>The primary responsibility is with the thugs and the only sure way of avoiding this happening is not to have the fixture. It is easy in hindsight to say that there should not have been a fixture but I am not in favour of modifying every stadium, having a ring of steel and people escorted from the boat, brought in convoy to the ground and brought home again.  These are being used as excuses to have the matches and that is not the response.  If those people want to behave like that, do not have the match. That is the reason there is no Scotland and England matches.  Are we expected to create stadia that accommodate these people in a secure location at enormous expense so they can carry on in the way they do?  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Norris that what we saw last night was political.  I want to draw a connection which is not as tenuous as might appear.  Last week when we marked the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz I said that it could happen again.  It must not happen again, but what we saw last night is the manifestation of what brought about Auschwitz.  It is such activity that created Auschwitz and it is still there. There is no doubt that it goes well beyond trying to break up a stadium or trying to discommode people.</P>
    <P>If one wanted an image of the disbelief at the incidents we saw it on every television bulletin last night and I am sure it went around the world.  It was the picture of the young boy in Lansdowne Road looking up at the stand and failing utterly to comprehend how something like this could happen.  I am sure his <Col N="2075" /> father also failed to comprehend it as did we all.</P>
    <P>Everybody is looking for people to blame.  Perhaps the media should look at themselves to a degree.  On the ITN &ldquo;News at Ten&rdquo; last night the reporter from Lansdowne Road speculated what might happen in the city afterwards, that this might spill over into the streets of Dublin.  We were apprehensive that there would be trouble but that in itself is creating an atmosphere.  Thankfully, when the Garda intervened it got rid of these people and we did not have chaos in Dublin last night.  For that it is to be thanked.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Norris's remarks about <i>The Sun</i> and newspapers of that ilk.  Look at some of the headlines that have been published over the past years about French people and what they call them, continentals and what they call them, and, probably, Irish and what they call them.  That foments the hatred, xenophobia and racism which led to Auschwitz.</P>
    <P>The late Bill Shankly said that soccer was not a matter of life and death, it was much more important than that.  Last night we nearly saw it as a matter of life and death.  We should record our sympathy to those innocent bystanders who were caught up and injured.  One person had a heart attack, perhaps as a direct result, leaving the ground and the House should record its sympathy to that person's family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the House in condemning last night's incidents.  It was an incredible example of hooliganism that interrupted an ordinary sporting occasion.  One wonders what the definition of sport is these days.  I had personal experiences on the terraces in England.  My son is a fanatical supporter of Manchester United and on his 12th birthday I visited Old Trafford with him, the match was against Liverpool.  It was my first experience and very frightening. I came away with the feeling that there is an underlying violence in soccer. What I saw from the body of people <Col N="2076" /> at that match was violence from one group towards another.  When the match was over the police insisted that the Liverpool supporters remained locked up for 45 minutes until everybody left the area.  They were then shepherded to the trains and sent home.</P>
      <P>I got an insight on that occasion that I did not enjoy.  I thought it a disgrace that my 12 year old son should see that happening.  We waited around and visited parts of the stadium we could not have seen before the match.  He was interested in looking at what he considered the Mecca of football.  However, for him to come away with such an experience was degrading and unworthy of sport.</P>
      <P>Sport is much the same the world over.  It is intended as a relaxation and a pastime.  Supporters are partisan people and that is understandable &mdash; one shouts for one's team.  We regularly attend matches and the terraces are peaceful; people shout for their own team standing side by side with supporters of the other team.  Rarely does one see any violence; only occasionally when people are a bit hot under the collar.</P>
      <P>However, what we saw last night was anarchy.  In England, as in Germany, there is an underlying trend towards anarchy.  The British authorities are well aware of that and I cannot understand how these people are allowed on the terraces weekend after weekend.  When I became aware of the full details of last night's episode I said that the British authorities should try to take steps to prevent these people leaving the country for matches.  I understand that the British authorities and the police were aware that these people were travelling to Ireland.  I also understand that message was not delivered formally to the Garda.  If they were aware that they were travelling here and aware of their potential and their intention for destruction why did they not take steps to prevent them leaving the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a blacklist of these people.  The police in England seem to know them.  They should not be allowed <Col N="2077" /> on the terraces on weekends; they should not be allowed to go to matches in other countries because they always do what they did last night.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to an English industrialist recently about industrial development in Ireland and in an aside to the conversation he mentioned that people working in animal research in England are afraid of their lives.  There are people who will do anything to further their cause.  They have threatened people with loss of life.  Such an anarchical trend exists in England and it has to be dealt with, and that is what happened in Lansdowne Road last night.  Those people were let loose in the midst of a crowd enjoying its football and it had disastrous consequences.  Instead of putting the blame on the FAI, the FA and everybody else, we have to suggest that English society has a problem to deal with and English society will have to tackle it.  I hope the English authorities do come to grips with it at some stage for the benefit of everybody on the globe.  Sport is sport, we enjoy it and we need to be able to continue to enjoy it.</P>

      <P>I, like the other Members, am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this matter today. I do not think we should put the blame on the FA, the FAI, the Garda or the authorities.  As has been said, it was the thugs who were to blame.  What happened last night did not happen in isolation. On 5 February, 40,000 soccer matches in Italy were cancelled because of the violence that has been happening at the soccer matches in that country. The day of Reflection of 5 February was called because a fan died in Genoa as a result of soccer violence.  I have travelled to many places to sporting events. I have been to matches and athletics events but the only time I have ever felt apprehensive was at a soccer match.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, before the match, I was walking down Lansdowne Road at 6.15 <Col N="2078" /> p.m.  There was a crowd of hooligans in front of me and their language was abominable.  They were not British thugs; they were Irish thugs.  I tried to get to the gardaí to ensure that these people would not get into the stadium because they were definitely going to cause trouble, wherever they were going.  Before I got to the gardaí, an Englishman said something to them and a melee started.  Three or four of them were hauled away by the gardaí &mdash; and this was before the match.  They were carrying tricolours and wearing Glasgow Celtic badges and insignia.  Even before the match, I was apprehensive that there was going to be trouble.</P>
    <P>My normal place in Lansdowne Park is on the west lower stand but because of the English fans, some of us were put over on the other side of the stadium. In the beginning, I was a bit annoyed but having seen what happened later, having an almost kaleidoscopic view, I must say that what happened was preventable; there is no question but that it was preventable.</P>
    <P>Why should we turn our stadia into armed fortresses?  If we have to do that, let us forget about the games altogether because the end game would not justify the means.  I am glad we did not have a ring of armed policemen or of riot forces around the park before the match because that could have incited people to violence.  I do not want to be in any stadium where we have to be protected by the military, armed gardaí or riot forces.</P>
    <P>Somebody will have to talk to the Irish fans because there was a definite intimidation among the Irish fans when they started pointing the fingers in the air: &ldquo;You'll never beat the Irish&rdquo;.  I was in the second last row of the east stand and I found it frightening for me because there was venom and hatred there.  This was not a &ldquo;Mexican Wave&rdquo; type of demonstration.  It was, in a lot of cases, hatred.  That type of intimidation is what the FAI will have to try to stop. They have been very good at stopping incidents inside and outside stadia in the past.  This carry on reminds me of Mexico <Col N="2079" /> when the Americans, after winning Olympic medals, punched the air with their fists in a racist manner.  It is fascism, it is blackshirt thinking; it is blue-shirt thinking and it should not be allowed in any stadium.</P>
    <P>The gardaí, male and female, did a tremendous job last night.  They did their best to control the situation.  I do not think they should have rushed in immediately the trouble started because it might have escalated it.  To say that the FAI or the gardaí should have known how to deal with this small group of thugs who came over from England is a fallacy.  They should not have been let out of England.  If the monitoring group in Manchester knew who these people were and knew they were going to Ireland, how did they get out of the country?  There were only two boats and the few planes they could board?  I have seen soccer fans at King's Cross Station, going off to international matches with their Union Jacks draped about them. The hatred displayed before they got on the trains at King's Cross Station would have to be seen to be believed.  The English authorities will have to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Thuggery is on the increase in British sport.  Soccer is no longer a British sport.  Professional soccer is a very professional business and the players themselves occasionally create the atmosphere which leads fans to go astray.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to condemn the actions of the thugs who where in Lansdowne Road last night.  What was shaping up to be an excellent match turned very sour at the end of the day. We have to extend our sympathy to the Irish footballers and the English players who were there to make a match of it, and also to the people who were injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been very involved in football all my years and I have travelled to matches before the Troubles started in Northern Ireland, when Derry City would have been part of scene in Northern Ireland and used to travel to Belfast. <Col N="2080" /> You had the religious conflict there of Catholic versus Protestant.  I remember Linfield coming to Derry to play matches.  The train would come into the station at Derry and the fans were met by the police.  They were taken straight to the ground, put into a specific part of the ground and then taken straight back to the station.  It was organised, unlike what we saw yesterday.  Yesterday was definitely not organised.  There were massive mistakes made.</P>
    <P>We used to travel to Windsor Park in Belfast during the height of the Troubles to see matches.  You would never have seen there what we saw in Dublin yesterday.  There was hatred there but it seemed to be contained because the authorities and the Football Association seemed to be working together to make sure that we did not get type of violence we saw last night. Violence seems to be part of the football scene, not only in soccer but Gaelic football as well.  I read some time ago about a referee who was beaten and put into the boot of a car.  We cannot ignore the fact that this type of nonsense does happen.  I remember a young man from Donegal being kicked to death in Dublin on the night of the All-Ireland Final in 1992, when Donegal beat Dublin. There seems to be an attitude of win at all costs.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan talked about the attitude of the Irish supporters; it is not good.  There are thugs on all sides and we cannot ignore that fact.  Look at the scene in England.  It is unbelievable as far as violence is concerned.  To give them their due, the authorities in England have tried to contain it.  We see people going to matches on Saturdays to support the Chelseas of this world, wearing their three piece suits and they turn out to be the biggest fascists.  When they get together, they are a danger to society.  Look at the scene in Scotland when Rangers play Celtic.  It is altogether unbelievable.  The violence has been there down through the years.  The language is there.  People do not take their children to those matches any more; they would be foolish to do so. <Col N="2081" /> Senator Lanigan touched on the Italian situation.  I heard Gay Byrne talking this morning about the great relationship there was between the Irish and the Italians. The knifing to death of a young man in Genoa recently is an example of the violence in that country.  We cannot get away from it.</P>
    <P>Somebody will have to carry the can for what happened last night.  I was listening to the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for sport and to Deputy Ahern, talking on the field.  Sadly, I did not agree with what they said.  Mr. Johnny Giles said they were talking nonsense and I think he was right.  It was a case of blame society; blame the English FA; the European Championships should not be held in England.  It is not for us to tell them that.  We should get our own society in order.  Mistakes were made yesterday in allowing those people to travel and positioning them in the top tier of the west stand.  It was wrong and badly organised.  Although warnings had been given, they were ignored.</P>
    <P>We have seen much violence in football recently, including the incident involving Eric Cantona.  The attitude of newspapers, including <i>The Star</i>, which called them scum, and <i>The Sun</i>, is another example of this.  At times the media goes over the top on such issues. When people were being killed in Northern Ireland, those newspapers did not condemn those who murdered them yet they call these English supporters scum; they are not good people, they are thugs.  We should not go over the top.  What happened last night was unfortunate and an inquiry must be carried out by the Department of Education, which has responsibility for sport, and the Department of Justice to find out what went wrong.  Mistakes were made and blame must be attached somewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. Chairman, for your kind and generous remarks.  It is nice to be back in my <i>alma mater</i> where I began my Oireachtas career.  I had a happy four years and eight months in this House and many of those who were Members with me in the early to mid 1980s are still Members.</P>
      <P>It is with rather mixed emotions that I come to address the House today.  It is, of course, an honour to address the House on such an important subject as the recent flooding and I am delighted to have the opportunity to do so.  I am, however, very conscious of the hardship that has been caused to a great many people all around the country by the flooding and I take this opportunity to assure them of my concern and that of the Government for their plight.  I also feel a serious responsibility to do all in my power to ensure that everything possible will be done to protect those worst affected in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent a considerable amount of last Monday in the south Galway area where I saw the devastation and hardship that has been caused by the flooding in the wake of the recent bad weather.  I have always been a believer <Col N="2083" /> in the benefits of river drainage, but I came away from south Galway last Monday more convinced than ever of the importance of having a sensible policy towards river drainage and of the necessity for a coherent programme of work to try to prevent flooding.  The Government decided last week to establish an interdepartmental committee to co-ordinate its response to the effects of the recent severe flooding in both urban and rural areas.  The collection of the necessary information to enable the committee to perform its task effectively has already been initiated.</P>
    <P>It will be my privilege, as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, to chair that interdepartmental committee. The members of the committee will be drawn from the Departments which may have any role to play in the delivering of an effective response to the hardships and losses sustained by a great many people in recent weeks.  I am determined to ensure that the committee will be effective, will also be seen to be so and that it will produce results quickly in so far as that is possible.</P>
    <P>I want to assure this House that, as stated in the Dáil, the Government is extremely concerned at the whole range of problems experienced by people living in areas affected by flooding in recent weeks.  Everyone will have seen the pictures in the newspapers and, most graphically, on television of the areas covered in water, houses and business premises flooded in some cases to very considerable depths, impassable roads causing tremendous inconvenience and, of course, sizeable areas of agricultural land inundated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan, when Minister of State at the Department of Finance, visited some of the worst affected areas with Office of Public Works officials to see the problem at first hand.  Indeed, as early as Monday, 9 January, he visited Newport, Cappamore, Sixmilebridge and Gort, all of which were badly affected.  As I mentioned, I, and my colleagues in Government, have been kept fully appraised of the situation around <Col N="2084" /> the country by Deputies and Senators from the areas affected.  I have also had the advantage of a briefing from my officials on the situation based on preliminary reports from their regional offices and on the situation outlined by Deputies in the Dáil during Private Members' Business last week.</P>
    <P>Three fundamental problems can be identified.  The first is related to the capacity of our rivers to discharge very heavy and intense rainfall.  The second is the addition of the effect of high tides and prevailing winds on such discharges. The third relates to the unique problems of the south Galway area where the karstitic limestone with swallow holes is unable to discharge the rainfall.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided, in the light of all the information that has been made available, that it is necessary at this stage to have a coherent co-ordinated response to the problems now facing individuals and communities in the aftermath of the flooding.  The interdepartmental committee which I will chair is the vehicle which will oversee that response and will co-ordinate the inputs from the various Departments and agencies which have responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>I want at this stage to pay tribute to those who have, so to speak, been in the front line dealing with the immediate impact of the flooding.  Many people from a whole range of services have responded magnificently to meet the needs of those affected.  While it is probably invidious to mention any particular group.  I feel it is only fair to acknowledge the sterling work done by the staff of the various local authorities at all levels, the Garda, the fire services, the Civil Defence, the Army and Air Corps and, of course, the invaluable assistance lent by the many friends and neighbours to those less fortunate than themselves.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the work which the interdepartmental committee will do in the coming weeks and months.  There are two aspects of the flooding that must be considered; compensation where that is appropriate and the implementation of measures to try to mitinate <Col N="2085" /> gate, wherever possible, the effects of flooding due to adverse weather conditions in the future.  I am happy to assure the House that the Government will seek funds to assist those who have suffered losses from noninsurable risks as a result of flooding.  I intend as a matter of urgency to approach the EU Commission to seek assistance from the fund which is being established to assist victims of the flooding which recently occurred throughout the European Union.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that a provision of £2 million was made in the budget to deal with the effects of the flooding in the agricultural area, particularly loss of fodder and livestock.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has indicated that he is having comprehensive reports on the situation prepared by his advisers.  The Minister also issued an open invitation to farmers who were experiencing problems to write to his Department and promised his full personal support and that of the Department for the work of the inter-departmental committee.  The damage to county roads was another issue which emerged clearly as a cause of concern in the debate in the other House.  Here again the House will be aware that the measures announced in the budget included funding to deal with this aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>I hope the establishment of the inter-departmental committee, with the financial provisions which have been made and to which I just referred, will be seen and acknowledged by all sides as demonstrating the Government's awareness of the seriousness of the situation and an indication of its genuine care and concern for those who suffered and continue to suffer.  It is my intention, through the work of the inter-departmental committee, to deliver a flexible and imaginative response to the undoubted problems caused by the flooding.</P>
    <P>It is vital, in addition to dealing with the immediate aftermath of the flooding, to also take steps to try to prevent a recurrence of at least the most severe <Col N="2086" /> aspects of the kind we witnessed in the past month.  While precise data is not yet available, preliminary returns make it clear that in many areas rainfall for January was close to or above twice the normal levels for the month.  Rivers in many cases have been unable to cope with the exceptionally large volumes of water which have been discharging into them, with the result that lands and premises have been inundated.</P>
    <P>While the exceptionally heavy rainfall has clearly been the main cause of the recent flooding, it is also clear that the accelerated rate of run-off water from hard surfaces associated with development has been a contributory factor. The fact that in some cases houses have been built below the flood level of nearby rivers has also given rise to flooding on this and previous occasions. We must look closely at all the factors which have contributed to the recent flooding to see what lessons need to be learned for the future.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning that areas which have benefited from drainage works under the Arterial Drainage Act. 1945, appear, by and large, not to have been affected by the flooding and where they were the floods subsided much more quickly than elsewhere.  There are those who see no merit in drainage work but this most recent experience provides an effective answer to such sceptics.  I am satisfied there is a valuable role for prudent drainage work.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Office of Public Works is empowered to undertake drainage works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  This Act has always been interpreted as only conveying power to deal with drainage on a complete catchment basis.  The Act was introduced in response to the findings of the Browne Drainage Commission which sat from 1938-40.  Among its many important findings, the Browne Commission found that much of the drainage work which had been undertaken previously on a piecemeal basis merely shifted the problem from one area to another because of the failure to take account of the effect of the <Col N="2087" /> improvements elsewhere throughout the river catchment.</P>
    <P>It recommended that future schemes to be designed should take into account the effect of works throughout the entire river catchment.  To date that has been done by draining entire catchments. I am satisfied that the key recommendation of the Browne Commission can be observed while at the same time undertaking more limited localised and, therefore, less costly schemes.  Proposals have been prepared by the Office of Public Works which will achieve that objective and create a more realistic possibility of undertaking viable drainage work where it is vitally necessary for the future.</P>
    <P>Since the enactment of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, 40 schemes have been completed.  The major benefit from catchment drainage schemes has arisen from the improvement of agricultural land either through bringing additional land, previously unusable because of the extent of flooding or waterlogging, into production or increasing the productivity of land through improved drainage.  It is an unfortunate reality that the current EU policy of limiting or discouraging production of many agricultural products, which are already in surplus in the union, has had a drastic effect in reducing the value of increased agricultural output and as a consequence there is at present little prospect of devising a catchment drainage scheme which will give a positive or even a break even cost-benefit ratio when it is subjected to economic analysis.</P>
    <P>This difficulty is graphically illustrated by the fact that schemes recently designed for the Mulcair river in counties Tipperary and Limerick and the Arrow and Owenmore rivers in Sligo have so far proved to be economically unviable despite the closest consultation between the Commissioners of Public Works and the local drainage action committees to ensure that all possible benefits are included in the assessment. The Commissioners of Public Works <Col N="2088" /> have always acknowledged that, despite the outcome of the economic analysis, there are areas within both catchments where there are unacceptable levels of flooding on a regular basis.  This point was very dramatically underlined in the most recent flooding by the problems experienced in Cappamore, County Limerick in the Mulcair catchment.  The situation there is unacceptable by any standards.  Regular flooding of houses in particular is unacceptable and I am anxious that steps are taken to minimise its incidence.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are powerless at present to undertake work for the relief of localised flooding, which the most recent events have clearly shown to be necessary.  Local authorities have some statutory powers in this area but for a variety of valid reasons only fairly minor schemes have been undertaken by them.  Many river catchments cross county boundaries. Consequently the effect of any remedial measures to deal with flooding problems generally impact on several local authorities' functional areas, making it virtually impossible for a single authority to take effective action.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has the expertise and the countrywide organisation required to undertake effective schemes to alleviate the worst effects of localised flooding.  Proposals have been prepared by the Office of Public Works for the amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to provide it with the necessary powers to undertake work for the relief of localised flooding by rivers. I met the Minister for Finance today and I am confident that the proposals will shortly be cleared by him for submission to the Government.  It has of course been agreed by the Government that there will be a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works in 1995 to deal with expenditure on works and investigations to deal with the relief of flooding.</P>
    <P>I want to refer specifically to the situation in south Galway, which is unique in at least two respects, first, the geological formation of the area and, secondly, <Col N="2089" /> the likelihood that the flooding will remain for a much longer period than elsewhere with the result that people will remain evacuated from their homes and continue to experience the various hardships associated with flooding.</P>
    <P>As I said, the geological formation here is unique, involving a system of swallow holes, turloughs, rivers that suddenly disappear underground, where their course subsequently is sometimes uncertain, and lakes which disappear and reappear.  There is no clear river course which can be studied as in a normal situation to identify where blockages occur, the appropriate remedial action and its consequences.</P>
    <P>The area has been the subject of much study for a variety of reasons but, to date, no reasonable solution to flooding has been devised.  I am determined, having seen the widespread problems in the area, to try to establish once and for all whether there is a viable solution to these problems.  I have, therefore, decided to commission, as a matter of urgency, a major engineering, hydrogeological and environmental study of the area to determine, if possible, the causes of the problems and to identify and evaluate potential solutions.  There will be general agreement that this must be approached with a view to finding long term solutions.  A quick fix is unlikely to suffice.  The wrong solution could threaten the ecological balance of the area.  Recent experience of flooding in Europe has shown that some local solutions may store up problems for areas downstream.  That is very much in evidence in Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of flood relief the first thing that must be done before an effective scheme can be designed for flood defences, or indeed for any purpose, is the collection of relevant data to define the nature and extent of the requirements.  The Commissioners of Public Works, as part of their remit, collect a sizeable amount of data.  Other information is available from local authorities and the Environmental Protection <Col N="2090" /> Agency.  The Commissioners of Public Works, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, have compiled a list of 90 urban areas known to experience periodic flooding.</P>
    <P>There is insufficient data in respect of many of these areas or in respect of some rural areas which are subject to flooding where flood defence works might be an appropriate solution to enable definitive decisions to be taken or where appropriate designs are to be prepared.  The Commissioners of Public Works are examining as a matter of the utmost urgency the steps necessary to collect the data required.  The data would be used with other relevant criteria to draw up a priority list of works which could form the basis of a flood defence scheme programme to be implemented on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>I realise that the prospect of drainage works being done throughout the country would cause concern to some people who would regard some of the arterial drainage schemes undertaken in the past as having been, to say the least, environmentally insensitive.  I assure anyone who feels such concern, that any works carried out would be to the highest possible standards and would enhance, rather than detract from, the environment.  I invite anyone having such concerns to look at any of the work undertaken by the Office of Public Works in recent years and to see the standard of excellence to which that office aspires.</P>
    <P>I know that fisheries interests in particular become nervous at the mention of engineering works in rivers and waterways, but I have no doubt that such interests, too, will be fully reassured by the excellent track record of the Office of Public Works in recent years where, in conjunction with the central and regional fisheries boards and local angling clubs, their schemes are invariably tailored to enhance rather than impair fisheries.  The work of the Office of Public Works in rehabilitating fishery stretches in rivers is recognised as being of the highest quality.  I am confident that angling and other interested <Col N="2091" /> bodies will have no difficulty in working with the Office of Public Works to ensure that their views are taken into account in the design and execution of schemes.</P>
    <P>I am realistic enough to appreciate that, given the complexities of the problems now facing us, there will be areas where we may be able to offer little or no assistance.  There may be other areas where we will not be able to meet the full aspirations of individuals, communities or interest groups.  Indeed, we may even have to grapple with conflicts of interest as our work progresses.</P>
    <P>At this stage I simply want to assure the House and everyone who has suffered hardship as a result of the flooding that the Government is concerned about the problems and is anxious to respond to them as effectively as possible. It will now be my task and that of all Departments participating in the interdepartmental committee to try to find solutions that will reflect that deep sense of care and concern, and will at the same time be prudent and realistic while also being speedy, flexible and not unduly restrictive.  It is indeed a very complex, multi-faceted and difficult task we are undertaking but I am confident that with the full backing and support of the Government we can achieve worthwhile results for the victims of the flooding.</P>
    <P>In summary, I propose four measures in response to the recent flooding.  First, to deliver a satisfactory response through the inter-departmental committee; second, to undertake a major study in the south Galway area; third, to expedite the proposals to amend the Arterial Drainage Act; and finally, subject to the enactment of this legislation, to commence a number of schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the new Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  From my experience of dealing with the Office of Public Works' personnel, the Minister can be assured of having a very competent and reliable staff at his disposal.  The Minister can <Col N="2092" /> also be assured that, with our support as well, we can get satisfactory solutions to some of the problems that have now arisen.</P>
      <P>Recent extreme weather conditions have starkly focused public attention on the necessity of dealing with a variety of problems, including flooding and erosion, which to a large extent have been awaiting action for a number of years. While the Minister has given assurances, the general public wants to see immediate, speedy action to deal with these problems.</P>
      <P>While this committee is a welcome development and will certainly co-ordinate activities between various Departments, the time for committees is long past.  The time has come for action to deal with problems that have created hardship, misery and inconvenience for thousands of people suffering severe losses in many parts of the country, some of which have been flooded successively over a number of years.  Many communities in the areas affected feel that the Government has totally neglected their problems.  They feel hopeless and abandoned.</P>
      <P>I have some photographs which I will give to the Minister afterwards and which show the damage done along the west coast of Clare.  The Minister is fully aware because his colleague, the previous Minister, visited Sixmilebridge and knew what was happening there.  In addition, the problem of coastal erosion extends to Ballyvaughan and the Shannon estuary.  Up to 100 areas have been seriously affected by severe flooding of short duration, and their communities feel that the problems can only be resolved by Government action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first matter that needs to be dealt with, and which the Minister referred to in his contribution, is the desirability of clearing up the uncertainty over responsibility for these incidents.  In the past when flooding took place there was a lack of acceptance of responsibility by many agencies and local authorities. Some of the schemes which were damaged and resulted in flooding were carried out under the old Local Authorities' <Col N="2093" /> Works Act.  Others were undertaken by the Land Commission in partnership with the farmers.  The Minister is aware that things have changed.  The Land Commission has been abolished and changes in the rating system have effectively left local authorities with insufficient funding to enable works to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 needs to be amended urgently thus giving the Commissioners of Public Works power to relieve and prevent flooding in particular areas.  Because of my experience as a former Minister responsible for the Office of Public Works, I have been able to draft a Bill with the aid of my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party &mdash; which I have now tabled &mdash; to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  This would give the necessary authority to the Commissioners of Public Works and would clear up misunderstandings and the inability of agencies, and public bodies to accept responsibility and it will provide the Commissioners of Public Works with the statutory authority to take special flooding precautions and provide measures to deal with the localised flooding within a catchment area.</P>
    <P>The Bill I have tabled, for which we will be seeking Government time, includes a provision that the commissioners would take account of the impact which measures to relieve flooding would have on other areas.  The Minister also referred to that.  It must be taken into account because too often when action was taken, it had an adverse effect on some other part of the catchment.  It is important that commissioners take account of the full catchment area.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that provision is made for the payment of compensation to people who have been seriously affected by the recent damage.  The Bill I have tabled provides that people would apply to a committee.  I hope we will have an opportunity to debate that Bill here.  The committee would examine applications from individuals who claim loss or damage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" /> The Minister announced that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been given £2 million to deal with problems in the agricultural area. However, a number of householders who did not have insurance or were not adequately covered find themselves in a serious position following damage to property.  The Minister is aware of this. I am sure he is familiar with cases where people had to move out of their homes. Some of them are still in bed-and-breakfast esbalishments and do not have alternative accommodation.  As mentioned, the foundations of the houses are now threatened by the continuous flooding especially in areas such as the Burren and other areas in south Galway about which Senator Fahey will speak.</P>
    <P>My Bill also seeks to ensure consultation with the Minister for the Marine in the matter of avoiding damage to fisheries which are important and have a big impact in many local areas.  The Bill also seeks to ensure consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is becoming increasingly necessary to keep in mind the impact that schemes of this nature have on the environment.</P>
    <P>I must put on record that in the past, while the Commissioners of Public Works did not have to comply with the Fisheries Acts, they always took account of the environmental impact and of the impact any of their arterial drainage schemes would have on fisheries. They were careful and conducted close consultations which they want to see continued.  In local areas where immediate remedial action is required, it is necessary that consultation continue at the closest level between the Minister's Department, officials from the Department of the Marine and its Minister and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>An acute problem which I endeavour to address is the inadequacy of the old local authorities works legislation which dates from 1949.  It was mentioned by the Minister but has not, to a large extent, been used.  The Coastal Protection Act gave responsibility but not <Col N="2095" /> power to the Minister for the Marine. While I appreciate that it would involve an amount of work, there is a real urgency in coastal areas.  The Board of Works must be enabled to undertake small remedial works on sluices which have broken down and an old culverts which are damaged due to flooding and extreme weather conditions and which have caused untold hardship for people.</P>
    <P>Work on embankments and other localised developments were undertaken in the past by the Land Commission mainly in co-operation with the farming communities.  These are now neglected because the Land Commission no longer exists.  They are likely to be more damaged in the next year or two.  If the extreme weather conditions experienced this year are repeated for a further two or three years, it is possible that the bill for the damage caused by the flooding of private dwellings and farms, especially in the most isolated coastal communities, will run into millions. Remedial action must be taken soon to deal with these problems.  I urge the Minister, in dealing with these matters, to look carefully at the problems of the coastal communities.</P>
    <P>Estuaries have been badly damaged. I can indicate places such as Leadmore in the Shannon Estuary where whole fields were washed away because protective walls built in the 1930s and 1940s were not maintained.  The councils cannot maintain them as they do not have the finances.  The resulting damage will be multiplied to such an extent that it will be almost impossible to deal with it. It will cost hundreds of millions of pounds to carry out work which could be done now at a relatively smaller cost. It is necessary to clear up the question as to whose responsibility this is.  The body with the most legislative powers to deal with the problem is the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Commissioners of Public Works have the valuable hydrometric data, regional offices and staff who are familiar with the problems.  They have been dealing with them on a catchment basis.  The <Col N="2096" /> Mulcair, for instance, has not been drained because of the cost benefit analysis problem.  Nevertheless officials and engineering staff of the Commissioners of Public Works are fully familiar with flash flooding on the Mulcair.  That body is best suited to this work.</P>
    <P>Changes are taking place in the arterial drainage system.  The arterial drainage legislation was originally designed for a huge catchment area. Undertaking a major drainage project increased the agricultural value of property at a time when, at both national and European Community level, the tendency was towards putting down a marker in relation to further development in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The existing expertise, talent, professionalism and legislative framework coupled with the Bill I am tabling today would enhance the commissioners.  They would be in the best possible position to deal with the problems we have had. The issues raised over this winter were to a large extent focused because of extreme weather conditions.  However, it is an ongoing problem which needs remedial attention and urgent Government action.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his work. He indicated that a Supplementary Estimate will be introduced.  He might indicate how much will be allocated.  I am not happy about setting up a further priority list.  I deliberately decided in the Bill I circulated not to include a priority list or Schedule.  The Commissioners of Public Works in consultation with the Minister are in the best possible position to decide the priority, and to a large extent the priority will be determined by weather conditions or the urgency of a particular problem.</P>
    <P>We had an unsatisfactory experience with the old Schedule and priority list under the arterial drainage legislation. We should get away from that and leave out any consideration of a schedule of specified identified areas because there will always be something that will not be covered in a schedule.  For instance, the problem of the washing away of a <Col N="2097" /> whole road in west Clare could never be identified in a schedule.  We all know there are problems from Youghal to Donegal and from Arklow to Ennis.  It would be unwise to identify these in a schedule or on a priority list because that would tie our hands and we would not be in a position to deal with urgent problems at any location.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister of our support but the people are unhappy.  More action was taken in the 1930s and 1940s to deal with flooding than has been taken today.  This is shameful, particularly when more revenue and machinery are available and there is good will in the communities to co-operate with the local authorities and the Minister. They expect more than they got from the Minister this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, to the House.  He spent a few happy years here and I am sure he does not hope to come back.  I wish him well in his new portfolio. I spent many years on Mayo County Council with him.  I know his capabilities and he will do an excellent job.  He has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, a position which the late Mr. Henry Kenny from Mayo also held.  I have no doubt the Minister will excel in that area.</P>
      <P>I congratulate him on the fact that he visited the different flooded areas so soon after his appointment.  He said he had visited south Galway, which was featured on the television over the past number of weeks.</P>

    <P>He said that when he visited the Galway area he became convinced of the importance of having a sensible policy towards river drainage and of the necessity for a coherent programme of work to try to prevent flooding.  The Government's response to the effects of the recent severe flooding in both urban and rural areas is to establish and interdepartmental committee.  The Minister said that its members would be drawn from all Departments which may have a role to play in delivering an effective <Col N="2098" /> response to the hardships and losses sustained by many people in recent weeks. I welcome this development.  I have no doubt the Minister has his finger firmly on the button, although he is in the Department such a short time, and that he knows the problems in those areas through his experience as a member of the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We must acknowledge that flooding is not new, that it has not only happened this year or this month. Flooding has occurred for a number of years and has had disastrous effects on parts of the country during the mid-1980s and early 1990s.  It is heartening to note that the Government has decided, in the light of all the information available, that it is necessary at this stage to have a coherent co-ordinated response to the problems now facing individuals and communities in the aftermath of the flooding.  The interdepartmental committee, which the Minister will chair, is the vehicle which will oversee that response and will co-ordinate the inputs from the various Departments and agencies which have responsibilities in this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that the inter-departmental committee will consider two aspects of the flooding over the coming months, compensation where appropriate and the implementation of measures to try to mitigate, wherever possible, the effects of flooding due to adverse weather conditions.  These people must be compensated and the Minister is right to address these issues.</P>
      <P>People in many areas are suffering great hardship.  When property is flooded it can cause severe problems for families who may have to move into caravans or other temporary accommodation. The Minister must be complimented for addressing this issue but he must have a long term strategy to alleviate flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He pointed out the disaster areas and told us about his visit to south Galway. <Col N="2099" /> A number of areas in County Mayo need attention.  There is an ongoing problem in the Ballinrobe area in particular which has been addressed to some extent by Mayo County Council.  I am sure the Minister will look at the south Mayo area and I ask him to consider McHale Road in the Castlebar urban area where there has been flooding recently.  This has caused hardship to the people living there.  However, this is a new flooding area, and I would like the Minister to consider these two areas of County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated his intention, through the work of the interdepartmental committee, to deliver a flexible and imaginative response to the undoubted problems caused by the flooding.  He also said that the Office of Public Works has both the expertise and the countrywide organisation required to undertake effective schemes to alleviate the worst effects of localised flooding. Proposals have been prepared by the Office of Public Works for the amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to provide them with the necessary powers to undertake work for the relief of localised flooding by rivers.</P>
    <P>He said he met the Minister for Finance today and that he is confident the proposals will shortly be cleared by him for submission to the Government.  It has been agreed by the Government that there will be a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works in 1995 to deal with expenditure on works and investigations to deal with the relief of flooding.  I welcome this development and I am delighted with the proposals to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. The Minister is right to say that the Office of Public Works has the expertise to carry out these works.  However, it should work more closely with local authorities because their engineering force has the expertise and information on areas affected by flooding.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that he has decided to commission, as a matter of urgency, a major engineering, hydrogeological and environmental study of <Col N="2100" /> the area to determine, if possible, the causes of the problems and to identify and evaluate potential solutions.  I also welcome this move because there is no short-term answer to flooding.  This problem has been raised at local authority meetings throughout the country and is a part of political life.  The Minister pointed out that there is no short term solution to this problem.  I am glad a committee will be established to carry out this study and to evaluate the solutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he has four ideas to put forward: first, to deliver a satisfactory response through the interdepartmental committee; second, to undertake a major study in the south Galway area &mdash; Senator Fahey will be delighted with that and probably more will accompany it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;third, proposals to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, which is also welcome; and fourth, the enactment of legislation and preparation of a number of schemes.  Any scheme will be appreciated, wherever it is started, because it will take another area out of trouble.  Rome was not built in a day and it will take a number of years to alleviate all the flooding.</P>
      <P>We can talk as long as we like about flooding in the length and breadth of the country but we should draw attention to the county roads.  Undoubtedly over the last weeks and months severe damage has been done to the structure of the county road network.  We are not receiving major funding for those roads, unlike the national road network for which money is available from Europe. Remedial funds should be dispersed through the local authorities so that immediate repair works can be carried out to the county roads to prevent further damage.  Many of them are in a deplorable state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an urgent matter and the Minister is aware that in our county the state of a number of roads need tackling <Col N="2101" /> immediately.  Some have been washed away by the floods and severe damage has been done to others.  Funding is required over and above the normal allocation.  I ask him to provide funds for my county as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new portfolio.  I am delighted with his immediate response to the problem caused by the severe flooding.  He has acted responsibly and with haste.  If he continues in that vein he will do an excellent job.</P>

      <P>I join with the other Senators in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, to the Seanad and I wish him good luck in his post.  I know he will do a good job because he is a concerned person.  Deputy Hogan deserves credit for the enthusiasm with which he started this work, and I am sorry he had to resign as he did.  I hope he returns to high office before long.</P>
      <P>The Minister said a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works would be introduced in 1995; that is welcome. Can he say what size that Estimate will be or if that has been decided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people I represent in south Galway say the water level is up to their kitchen tops, they have had to leave their houses for the last three weeks and may not return for up to ten weeks.  This is the third time this has happened to some people in the last number of years.  Farmers have been completely cut off and have land underwater since before Christmas &mdash; last year it was submerged from January to July and the same will probably happen this July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to express the frustration felt by those people but the Minister and his officials in the Office of Public Works are limited in what they can do to respond to those problems.  I expected the Minister to be more forthright and <Col N="2102" /> to tell those people specifically what will be done and I ask him to do that now.  I hope he can tell those whose houses are underwater for six weeks and cannot get insurance because this is the second time it has happened, that they will be compensated in the package of measures he will bring forward.  As to those farmers whose land was underwater for many months last year, and are again, surely the Minister should give them compensation over and above the limited criteria outlined in the budget.  If a person from our party was sitting in the Minister's seat, I would say the same.  I wish to be fair because this is far too important an issue with which to play politics.</P>
    <P>Since last April I have worn a path to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works to get some action in response to what happened last year.  The Office of Public Works officials were most understanding and anxious to help but the response from officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was the exact opposite.</P>
    <P>I brought three deputations from the IFA in south Galway to that Department. I received a commitment from the Minister for Finance to give money to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in an Estimate if that Department made a proposal in that area.  The officials in that Department refused to help alleviate the problems. We were given excuses, such as that last year's rain was part of a 500 year cycle so it would probably not be as bad for another 500 years.</P>
    <P>This is a new Minister and he should be warned that if he tackles the problem the Civil Service way he will get nowhere.  I ask him to take the initiative. He has outlined a number of steps but forming a committee will not help solve the problem.  I appreciate there must be co-ordination but I ask him to give the committee one month to come up with proposals.</P>
    <P>He told us he is prepared to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  That is <Col N="2103" /> a welcome development and we realise that must be done before he can take further action.  In an all-party spirit I ask him to introduce the legislation in the Seanad next week or alternatively allow the Bill Senator Daly has circulated to progress to Committee Stage.  Whatever amendments or further proposals are needed can be introduced as we go along.  This must be done immediately and if we wait for legislation to take its normal course we will not make much progress.</P>
    <P>I agree the planning of works must be done carefully but the Office of Public Works or the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will not solve the problems in south Galway. The only people who will solve the problems in south Galway are the farmers in that area with the support of the Office of Public Works, the local authority and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The way forward is in line with the proposal made by the south Galway IFA last year &mdash; that money be made available for a local co-operative effort, involving local farmers and landowners, to carry out remedial works to tackle the worst effects of the flooding. It is vitally important before any such work is carried out that it be properly planned, that people who are affected would be consulted and that agreement is reached among all concerned.</P>
    <P>There is controversy at present in south Galway about work that is being carried out.  While I support that type of initiative, we must first plan such work; it must be agreed by the people concerned and finance must be provided for it.  Was that done in this case?  Has money been provided for the works, because we have been told by a member of the Minister's party that the Government has approved the provision of the money required?  It is not good enough to commence work in the hope that money will become available and in the hope that the work being carried out will be successful, that is, that it will <Col N="2104" /> drain all the land and not drain some land and flood other land nearby.  I would like to be given confirmation regarding the situation of those works, whether moneys have been approved for them or if they are simply a stab in the dark.  I support the initiative.  It has alleviated flooding in one area.  If it could be continued and if the rest of the work is planned and carried out properly, it would certainly be a good initiative.</P>
    <P>Another study in south Galway is not necessary.  A study was carried out by Donal Daly &mdash; the geological survey of south Galway &mdash; under the auspices of the Department of Energy a few years ago.  A comprehensive study was also carried out by an engineer from the Office of Public Works last year. Michael Collins did an intensive study of last year's flooding in south Galway for the 1994 report and he suggested a number of solutions.  While we will need further hydrological studies, we already know what is necessary in south Galway. The swallow holes and the water courses must be cleaned.  This undoubtedly would reduce the level of flooding. There is a major swallow hole close to my home and one can see around the trees where the flooding was at its highest. Plastic bags and other debris caught up in the flood are being carried into the swallow hole.  The efficiency of the swallow holes in absorbing the water has been seriously impaired.  Michael Collins said in his report last year that superficial cleaning of the swallow holes would vastly improve their efficiency.</P>
    <P>What is needed in south Galway is money.  The Office of Public Works must be given the power to be supportive of the local authority and the local community getting together to tackle this job.  If the bureaucracy has anything to do with this I will be standing in this Chamber again this time next year with nothing done.  I ask the new Minister, without any disrespect to his officials, to take the bull by the horns on this matter. I hope he will be back here next week to initiate this legislation.  He cergeologica <Col N="2105" /> tainly will receive support from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I thank the engineering staff and the workers of Carlow County Council for the wonderful work they did during the flood.  It was appreciated by everybody in Carlow town.</P>
      <P>Flooding is not new.  The recent flooding was the result of abnormal rainfall in December and January.  The amount of rainfall in those two months was almost double the normal amount. In the past few years serious flooding has occurred in Carlow town and in Leighlinbridge.  A number of farms in the area have also been flooded.  The N80, which brings traffic from the midlands to Rosslare, has had to be closed on several occasions and the alternative roads used by the heavy lorries are not suitable for such traffic.  That is causing terrible problems.  The traffic problems will be rectified when the proposed new bridge, over the Barrow at Sleaty is put in place.  While many people have been talking about this bridge, it is worth mentioning that Deputy Harney held up its construction for two years when she established a committee.  Deputy Michael Smith delayed its construction for another two years &mdash; he refused to sign the order.  I understand that the present Minister, Deputy Howlin, has signed the compulsory purchase order for the provision of the bridge and that the provision of this bridge is now a priority for the National Roads Authority. In the interest of fair play, if Deputy Howlin does not make significant progress in two years I will add his name to those of the previous Ministers who delayed construction of the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of flooding in Carlow can be solved, but it will cost a lot of money.  The county engineer prepared a report which is at present with the Department of the Environment.  It contains proposals for retaining walls and other small works which would prevent small floods and would lessen the effect of large floods.  That work would cost <Col N="2106" /> approximately £200,000.  The proposals should be considered as a matter of urgency.  To deal with the problem properly a storm water system for Carlow town would be required.  This would cost approximately £5 million.  Proposals for such a system are with the Department of the Environment.  I call on the Minister to examine them as a matter of urgency in the context of EC moneys which might be made available.</P>
    <P>It would appear that there is a build up of silt on a stretch of the River Barrow between Bessfield and Milford.  The silt is almost four feet deep in places.  It is causing a hump on the bed of the river and is one of the main causes of the flooding in Carlow.  Many people say that they know what causes the silt, although I do not know.  It will be a major job to remove the silt.  I understand that discussions are taking place between Carlow UDC and the Office of Public Works about this problem and that there might be some results of those discussions in the near future.  The Office of Public Works has recently spent a great deal of money on interpretative centres, although we hear that people did not want or like such centres.</P>

The Minister's immediate predecessor, Deputy Phil Hogan, who is an excellent TD for the Carlow/Kilkenny constituency, visited the area during the flooding. As a result people in the area believed that he understood the problem and that he was prepared to use his clout to do something about it.  I ask the Minister not to shatter their expectations.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins, to the House and congratulate him and wish him well in his new portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" /> It has taken approximately four weeks of effort in the House to hold a debate on this issue.  This is no fault of the Minister, because he was not in his present position when I first raised it in the House.  Now that a debate on flooding is taking place, it is important that we outline our views on what should happen.  That is what I intend to do, and it is also my intention to bring to the attention of the Minister the serious situation that exists in the Shannon and Suck basin.</P>
    <P>In the report from the Minister today and in his address to the House today, there is no mention of this basin, which is a mistake.  While I do not wish in any way to take from the areas which have been and should be mentioned and where serious problems exist, I must remind the Minister that there is a very severe problem in the Shannon and Suck basin, one that has been with us for years and years.  It is a problem that has been highlighted every time there has been a flood.  On this occasion there is even more reason for highlighting the problem, because I have received confirmation from Bord na Móna that at their measuring point at Shannonbridge they have measured the highest flood ever, that is, three eighths of one inch higher than even the 1954 flood.  These are the figures from the regional manager of Bord na Móna in respect of the entire Blackwater-Derrynafada works area.</P>
    <P>This indicates that we have a very severe situation in this area; and, to outline its severity, I would point out that people with farms of 40 or 50 acres are now reduced to three or four acres.  All of their stock have been brought onto three or four acres, which is the sum total of the lands on which they can have stock resting at present.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detract in any way from the situation in south Galway, Clare or Carlow.  But it is the responsibility of every representative to put forward the best possible case and to get the best possible attention for the territory they represent.  Indeed, the Minister <Col N="2108" /> must represent all areas, and I wish to impress on him that there are very serious problems in the area about which I have been speaking.</P>
    <P>Part of the seriousness of the problem stems from the isolation of the area between the Shannon and the Suck, the south and mid-Roscommon area.  It is an unfortunate area in so far as the Shannon, which is a major river, lies on the east, while the Suck lies on the west.</P>
    <P>The Shannon has been the subject of major debate and concern over the years on the basis that, first, it causes much flooding, and, secondly, that, to some extent at least, there is no regulatory authority over it.  There are so many vested interests in the river, whether it be the ESB, the Office of Public Works, the navigation board, fisheries or whatever, who all have their own patch with regard to responsibility; and therein lies some of the problem.</P>
    <P>When a list is established of areas where a response should take place, maintenance on that section of the Shannon and of the Suck is of vital importance.  The reason for that is this. Fifty thousand acres of bog are drained into the Roscommon-east Galway area, which has to eventually drain into the Shannon from the River Suck.  The figure used to be 30,000 acres, but in recent years 20,000 acres were added. This takes place without as much as a shovel, a drag, a spade or a machine being put on either of the two rivers at this point in order to undertake one yard of maintenance.</P>
    <P>There is serious silting in the Shannon, right down to Meelick weir, and in the Suck right up to Athleague.  There is a responsibility on the Office of Public Works, under the Minister's new proposals to undertake maintenance work in this area.  The new Bill proposed by the Minister can allow for this.  I have always believed that it could be done one way or another, because if Bord na Móna could drain that amount of bog into a river, surely the people who have responsibility for the nine miles of the last section of the Suck and the whole <Col N="2109" /> of the Shannon could carry out maintenance on their own section.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals to amend the arterial drainage legislation, this area should be included with the other high priority areas for certain works to be undertaken.  I compliment Senator Daly for introducing proposals with regard to this.  He has displayed initiative in bringing forward a Bill to amend the arterial drainage legislation which he hopes to have debated in the House next week. He has the support of our group on the House on this matter.  Hopefully, there can be all party agreement either that his Bill is taken and amended by the Government or that there is a joint approach to this matter.  In any event, we must get a Bill onto the floor of the House in as short a time as possible to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There must also be maintenance of our rivers as distinct, to some extent, from drainage works.  In certain areas silt has dug into the fords, the rock basins and sand basins requiring the necessity for digging.  However, we cannot continue with a situation where practically all of the midlands and the area to the west is being drained into the Suck and the Shannon and we do not undertake as much as one hour's drainage work on either of the two rivers.  This cannot continue as it is a recipe for disaster in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of things will happen as a result of remedial action not being taken.  The first is that we have now a major back-up of drainage problems. This is apparent if one speaks to the older engineers or to the older farmers, especially in the areas of mid and south County Roscommon.  They will advise that the turloughs are higher now than ever before.  These people are experts in so far as they have seen this situation over a lifetime of 70 or 80 years.  Their honest opinion is that the natural drainage outlets in both of those rivers have been blocked up with silt which has got in through the eskers, the swallow holes and so on.</P>
    <P>At this stage the finest of upland is being flooded.  Water is coming up out <Col N="2110" /> of the ground, out of the turloughs, and spreading out over vast areas of excellent upland which never had flooding before.  This all derives from the basin of the Suck and the Shannon.  There is now a responsibility on the Office of Public Works to enter into negotiations with Bord na Móna and, if necessary, Bord na Móna should make a contribution towards the maintenance of the two rivers.</P>
    <P>The Minister always has been a very strong voice on his own territory and on matters of importance to the west, and I compliment him on this.  The case I put forward is in respect of a genuine situation. It is no scare situation; it needs the attention of somebody like the Minister, or some body such as the Office of Public Works.  Those in the Office of Public Works have the expertise; it is a well established organisation with the engineering back up and the necessary knowledge to proceed.</P>
    <P>The provision of compensation for farmers and money for roads is important.  I hope that, with the funds the Minister of State will get in the Supplementary Estimate and the £2 million being provided, he will be able to give relief in that area, and that the Minister for the Environment will be able to help out as regards the roads which have been damaged.  I ask him to keep as a matter of priority the maintenance of the River Shannon at that point and the River Suck where it meets the Shannon. Therein lies the contributing factor to the problem of major flooding in the south and mid-Roscommon area.</P>

      <P>I join with the other Members in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, on his appointment and wish him every good luck and success.  He is committed to the development of rural Ireland and I have no doubt that he is ideally suited for the post to which he has been appointed.  I wish to thank most sincerely the Leader of the House for giving us the opportunity for this today, which is timely and appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> As has been pointed out, due to the unprecedented rainfall in January we have unprecedented flooding.  Only once &mdash; in 1953 &mdash; since records on the River Shannon began has the level been as high as it was in February.  On 2 January 1995, it was 38.57 metres, which was just below the level of 1953.  That flooding has caused untold hardship and damage in the Shannon and Suck valleys. I wish to reflect the views of farmers and residents in that area, as did Senator Finneran who comes from that area.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the damage which has been done in south Galway, Clare, Carlow and other areas by the high levels of rainfall which have caused unprecedented problems in this country and throughout Europe.  Assistance will have to be provided to try to alleviate the major difficulties of households which have been flooded and perhaps cannot get insurance because of a history of flooding, or landowners who have suffered drastically because of the loss of their lands and the fact that they can no longer put fertiliser on those lands will inevitably cause major hardship down the line and, of course, the loss of livestock.  Those people will have to be considered when a compensation fund is set up.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to provide £2 million in the Estimates to alleviate some of the problems which have arisen.  I note that the Minister of State's predecessor had committed himself to making an application for additional funds from Europe &mdash; and I am sure that the present Minister of State will follow that up.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that a departmental committee has been set up which will, I hope, grapple not just with the problems of this current flood but the problems which already existed but nothing was done.  Senator Fahey made the point very forcibly that over the last few months he had been to various Ministers and Departments but was unable to get assistance for people who suffered from the severe flooding last year. <Col N="2112" /> We have the same situation in the Shannon and Suck valleys where untold damage has been done over the years.</P>
    <P>Funnily enough, floods during the winter do not cause major problems for those farmers, although they cause major inconvenience.  However, a late spring early summer, or early autumn flood causes untold damage where meadows and grass land are flooded, as happened in 1993.  Unfortunately, the Government of the day decided to ignore the problem and did not give assistance to those farmers, many of whom were facing financial ruin.  This has been an ongoing problem for many years.</P>
    <P>As Senator Finneran pointed out, the problem is getting worse because of the enormous amount of drainage which needs to be done &mdash; both field drainage, and arterial drainage.  Lack of proper drainage in the north of our county is causing flooding in both the Shannon and Suck valleys.</P>
    <P>Prior to the development of forestry those lands acted as a great big sponge which soaked up substantial amounts of water during times of heavy rain or snow.  Those lands have now been drained and, as a result, water which might take three to four months to get into the River Shannon is now entering it in 48 to 60 hours.</P>
    <P>There has also been major development of the bogs in the midlands which 20 years ago were also sponges which soaked up the water for months on end and discharged it gradually.  Now they have been developed and drained and, as a result, a huge amount of water is getting into the rivers very fast.  The channel from Athlone to Meelick is unable to take the water load and it must, therefore, spread out not just over all of south Roscommon but also into parts of south Westmeath, Offaly and east Galway.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to amend the Arterial Drainage Act. The present Act no longer serves the purpose for which it was enacted.  It was a great idea.  It intended to bring land into production and to alleviate major <Col N="2113" /> problems in different parts of the country. It served the people well.  However, nowadays, we are no longer talking about bringing more land into production. In Senator Dardis's county a substantial amount of land has been left to set-aside.</P>
    <P>We will not succeed in getting funding from Brussels for drainage <i>per se</i> but the people who live in those areas are entitled to a certain standard of living and to be treated as equal citizens of Europe, which is not happening today. Huge difficulties have been experienced by many families, not just in rural areas but also in some towns.  Those people must be helped and the only way we can do that is by drainage and maintenance. The maintenance of the River Shannon must be tackled under the amended Arterial Drainage Act.</P>
    <P>A report has been carried out which indicates that with a very small sum &mdash; not more than £2 million &mdash; a huge amount of drainage work could be done between Athlone and Meelick which would allow the free flow of water from Lough Rea into Lough Derg.  In 1986, the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, got her Department to carry out some remedial work at Meelick weir.  It has been recognised by the IFA and other bodies involved in the River Shannon that that work alleviated many of the existing problems and allowed a great deal of water to get away much faster.  Of course, it was only a very small scheme but, nevertheless, it alleviated some of the problems.  There are major blockages on that river, particularly between Shannonbridge and Meelick, which require remedial work.</P>
    <P>Some of those blockages, I hasten to add, are as a result of peat which was run off in the Bord na Móna developments into the bed of the Shannon and has lain there.  It is not unknown for cruisers to run aground on those mud banks in the Shannon.  The Office of Public Works has a responsibility for navigation there but it appears that it is happy once it can keep boats going up <Col N="2114" /> and down the Shannon.  However, there are mud banks there which must be removed.</P>
    <P>Recently, I met the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Food and the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Hogan and my reason for meeting them was two-fold.  First, in 1986, the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and the then Minister for Agriculture visited the areas which were flooded in 1985, and he was horrified to see farming families totally marooned.  They only way they could communicate with Athlone, which was only a mile away, was by boat.  Other families had to go seven miles around to make what should have been a mile and a half trip.  He set up an interdepartmental&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House.  The then Taoiseach established a committee, with a view to setting up a Shannon valley authority.  This would bring all the different bodies involved in the Shannon, whether it was the ESB, Office of Public Works or inland fisheries, under the one umbrella for the purpose of the management and control of the Shannon with statutory authority.  This is what we want and this is the long term aim.  Such a body for the management and control of the Shannon would alleviate many of our problems.</P>
      <P>My other point relates to recognising the special problems of farmers in the Shannon valley.  Flooding is an annual event for these farmers and is not something new.  They should be recognised under the headage mechanism as having special difficulties.  There should be special criteria laid down so that they would receive additional income from the headage mechanism.  This would help to alleviate the major problems they will face day in day out for generations to come.  I am not one who believes the Shannon will be drained, but its management and control is of vital importance.</P>

      <P>As other speakers stated, this is a timely debate.  The people of the west have developed patience over the years when it comes to storms and flood damage.  I come from County Kerry, but the county was not mentioned anywhere in the Minister's speech.  People might think it does not rain in County Kerry and we stay dry there, but I assure the House that the county is flooded every other week.  It experiences the worst storms of any part of the country.</P>
      <P>If there is flooding in Dublin, the reaction never ceases to amaze me.  I remember when the River Dodder broke its banks.  I thought for some time that I was living in Las Vegas, given the number of helicopters, ambulances, gardaí and Army personnel around the place because the homes of some people around the RDS were flooded.  If the flooding which has occurred in County Kerry or in the west over the past months had happened in Dublin, I am sure the ambulances, helicopters and gardaí would have been around the place again.  There would be national television coverage and it would be a worldwide event.  I have sympathy for the people living in the west and the hardship they have endured over the years and I am glad something will be done this time to alleviate the flooding problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years the watercourses and watertables in many counties have been blocked.  Many people mentioned county roads but one will never see a pothole on a dry road.  Potholes always appear on roads which are subjected to some form of flooding.  I must criticise the shortfall in the budget for county roads in the coming year which is something in the order of £12 million.  It will <Col N="2116" /> take a huge amount of money to restore county roads to the condition they were in prior to the flooding.</P>
    <P>There are many mountains in County Kerry and people might think we do not get the same flooding as occurs in the flatlands around Counties Galway and Clare.  However, we get similar flooding. I went through the village of Ballyduff in County Kerry during one of the heavy floods and there was approximately two feet of water on the main street.  Sewage was flowing back into homes because all the water was going into the main part of the sewerage system and coming back up through gullies. I went into premises where there was up to two feet of sewage and this was in one of numerous small villages in the county which were destroyed.</P>
    <P>I understand that the £2 million allocation is to help farmers.  Is there any funding or assistance for householders in towns or villages?  Will there be any assistance for the people in these places who were subjected to flooding?  Will a priority list be drawn up for the spending of this money and, if a priority list is drawn up, to what counties will the money go?  Will it be broken down between counties that were flooded and will it be distributed by local authorities or the Department?  Who will report back to the Department and who, ultimately, will decide where the money is spent?  I remember the last priority list drawn up by the Office of Public Works and it was a complete disaster.  It would be a mistake to draw up a priority list in this case.  The Minister should contact local authorities and get reports on the flooding in their counties.  Perhaps the Department should go through it county by county and give each county its fair share to ensure that each area is assisted.</P>
    <P>I am totally surprised that Ireland has been excluded from the EC disaster fund.  The Minister should contact the EU immediately, if he has not done so already, to ensure that Ireland is included in this major disaster fund.  At this stage the Minister's colleague in Brussels, Commissioner Flynn, should <Col N="2117" /> be contacted and perhaps the two could use their offices collectively to ensure that Ireland is included.  Regardless of the nature of the flooding in Europe, it has been just as severe in this country on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should also be contacted with regard to granting planning permission to people living in low lying areas.  They should be prevented from proceeding with any type of development on land which would be subject to flooding.  This should be part of the planning regulations and the Department should contact the planning authorities to ensure that no developments take place in low lying areas.</P>
    <P>At this stage a case can be made to bring all the unemployed people who are capable of working on to the roads, supplying them with shovels and getting them to open up all the watercourses on every road in every county.  Local authorities should be forced to call on farmers to ensure that watercourses to main rivers are kept open.  It is a major problem when farmers will not allow water on their land and they are trying to block gullies to allow water onto the public road at present.  The road then becomes dotted with potholes and local authorities must repair it.  Local authorities should use their powers to ensure that all main drains and gullies across lands are kept open.  If grants were introduced for people to make bigger drains on their land so that they can reach headings to the main watercourse, it would remove much of the flooding from the roads in the west.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a serious problem on his hands which will not be dealt with easily.  If new initiatives have to be introduced I would not refer back to the findings of the Brown Commission, which are antiquated.  They may have worked 50 or 60 years ago but would not work now.  A lot more development has taken place and there is a lot more drainage of land.</P>
    <P>When the water hits now in flash floods it appears rapidly.  I remember during the Listowel races one year, which would be the busiest part of our <Col N="2118" /> season, I opened my pub and I had four feet of water coming in one door and going out the other.  I expected up to 400 or 500 people to come in after the races for food and to warm themselves and the flood wiped out the entire business. That happened three or four times until we got together with the local farmers and started working on a drainage system to get the water into the main river.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I congratulate him on his appointment; I wish him every success. Flooding in any area may be of two types.  There is large scale flooding, which can be caused when a large river overflows, or by the sea, over which we have little control.  There is also small flooding which can occur on local roads. The two types should be tackled differently. On my way to the House it was raining heavily and there is a flood at the front gate which I had run through to get here.</P>

      <P>I come from the same south-west region as Senator Dan Kiely and we have high rainfall, more than the east of the country.  This year it has been exceptionally high and the records have been broken.  As a result water tables are continuously very high and the falling rain does not sink but runs off into the rivers and streams and causes flooding. The inordinate amount of high rainfall over the last number of months is causing great problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the worst things that can happen to a house at this time of the year <Col N="2119" /> is to be flooded, especially if it is an old house.  Not only is the present dampness going through the walls but it will stay until summer &mdash; if we get a summer &mdash; before it can dry out.  We have no dry weather to allow any airing.  Old houses built with stone walls can be badly hit with this rainfall.  Modern houses would not be built at such a low level due to modern planning rules and the problem does not arise.  However, if it did and a new house was flooded, it is easier to dry out afterwards than an old house.  It is an awful problem when carpets, furniture, walls and everything else is destroyed.  This is apart from the health hazard when water is coming from who knows where into a house and stagnating there.</P>
    <P>In Cork south-west, as in other places, we have tremendous problems along the coast, particularly in towns such as Bantry, Skibbereen and Clonakilty, where if there is a high tide and a flood there can be tremendous sudden flooding causing great damage.  In addition, people cannot get insurance for their houses and I do not know how we can tackle that. The Dutch got a hammering this year, but we have the same problem with the sea on a smaller scale and these smaller towns are hit badly.  People are getting very sour about the whole matter.  If the channels of the rivers going through those towns are opened up enough to allow the water to get through to the sea quickly it would help to relieve the problem.</P>
    <P>The finger of responsibility for flooding is often pointed at different people. When a flood occurs the county council is easiest to blame.  However, the council is not always fully to blame for flooding as the rivers often come through private lands.  Someone must take responsibility to ensure that proper drainage is done on the rivers.  If the rivers are kept clear and the water can flow away, the flooding will not occur.</P>
    <P>In my town of Dunmanway when the river reaches a certain point its course changes and it flows over one of the main roads, in through houses and out <Col N="2120" /> again.  Nothing can be done but wait for the flood to subside.  It is frightful that this should occur in this day and age.</P>
    <P>With small flooding there can be a hollow in the road which gets filled up with water and can be of great danger to traffic.  The result of water being left on the roads and flowing over them is that potholes are left behind.  We need more road workers on the roads.  In the past there would have been a local ganger and three or four men working on the roads.  They knew that when a certain amount of water fell they would have to go to certain places and unblock drains that would be habitually blocked. That is the answer to a lot of the small flooding.  In many cases the old gangers have retired or gone to their eternal reward.  Often no workers are recruited in their place and as a result nobody knows the local geography of drains and trenches that have to be sorted out.  If we could get more people with experience on the roads to clear them we would not have the problems we have today.</P>
    <P>With regard to the large rivers, a proposal was made in the past to build a barrage across the estuary at Clonakily. It came to the Department of the Environment and was shelved.  In the meantime any high tide and flooding from the small river means that a number of houses are flooded in the low lying part of the town.  It is a continuous danger and threat to the people.  In Bantry the local river flows underground through the square and if it is blocked by any material it floods the streets and houses.</P>
    <P>We should carry out an engineering survey on the roads and rivers which are liable to be flooded.  If we had a list and could know what is to be done throughout the country and if we allocated moneys to each job each year, we would get rid of the flooding.  After all, there are children going to school who cannot travel along the roads due to flooding; school buses are held up and school schedules disrupted.  This happens continuously when flooding occurs and much of it is unnecessary.  If we could get more workers on the roads, more <Col N="2121" /> people to clear the gullies, dykes and ditches, the problems would not arise.</P>
    <P>When there is a high spring tide and heavy rainfall the town square in Bantry looks like a scene from Venice because it is completely submerged in water. Houses and shops on the square are flooded and goods are destroyed.  Flooding occurs suddenly and it would be good if warnings could be given as in the larger cities.  If the weather continues as it is at present, we will have to face this problem sooner rather than later.  In the past if the months of February or March were dry, it would dry out the countryside so that if there was heavy rainfall in April and May, the water table would be low and would allow water to soak into the ground thereby avoiding flooding. If money was given to local authorities, they could pay a large part in this regard.  It would help the situation if in some instances FÁS schemes or the new community enterprise schemes could be applied on an emergency or a once-off basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate surrounding this year's flooding seems to have become more emotive and urgent than in other years.  There are good reasons for that in that there has been more flooding throughout the country than in the past.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I will not say that I would have preferred to have seen my colleague from Kilkenny.  I know the Minister will not only think of the west but of the east and south east when deciding on priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad my party spokesman on the environment suggested ways of amending legislation which would make it easier for the Minister's Department and the Government to deal with this major problem.  Over the past number of years the farming community has suffered because of flooding.  One could, however, say that farming is a cause of the flooding because of the extensive drainage schemes in certain areas which caused water to flow into rivers thus creating problems.  There are different types of flooding, including tidal and <Col N="2122" /> river floods.  Water does not always flow where one expects; it often flows into a narrow area which subsequently overflows.</P>
    <P>It would take a seer greater than the Minister and his advisers to decide on the best solution to deal with the flooding problems.  We must look at the causes of flooding.  During the week a TD from the west suggested that if £60,000 was spent in a specific area it would solve the problems there.  I hope he will have money in the future to pay compensation for the flooding which would be caused by digging a drain so water from a number of farms could flow elsewhere.  That is not a solution.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny we have been looking at the problem of flooding for many years. Flooding occurs on a yearly basis in three areas, which is caused by the River Nore and its tributaries.  On 17 March 1947 a flood, which we refer to as the 100 years flood, occurred when the level of the River Nore rose by 16 feet.  People were evacuated through the roofs of their houses.  The flood was caused by continuous snow over a long period and a sudden thaw.  Anyone who says that such flooding can be dealt is not being realistic.  But what we are talking about is the normal one year or five year flooding.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the Office of Public Works has carried out a survey yet, but this year's flood is probably the worst in ten years.  How do we deal with what has happened this year?  Do we try to deal with the average yearly flood or the ten, 50 or 100 year floods?  If we consider heights from the 100 years flood, the allocation of money which the Government has at its disposal for the Department of Education and the Department of Health could not cope with it.  If one considers flooding which occurs each year, I suggest that perhaps £50 to £100 million would be required. Some £2 million was allocated in the budget.  However, this would not solve even half of the problems of the five year flood in Kilkenny, which has not been allocated any money.  Money which the Government must make <Col N="2123" /> available must come from the EU or from another fund.  I ask the Minister where he believes this money will come from.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny we have tried to devise a programme to alleviate the problem on an annual basis.  The cost of this in the city area alone would be £355,000.  As we all know, by the time that programme is initiated that sum will have increased to £500,000.  That sum does not take into account smaller towns in Kilkenny which are flooded by the River Nore, including Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh, or the fact that the peripheral areas between Carlow and Kilkenny are flooded by three rivers.</P>
    <P>The problem of periodic flooding will not be easily resolved.  I heard people say that even if £10 million is allocated towards the alleviation of flooding, it could not deal with the problems in south Galway or anywhere west of the Shannon.  We must realise that flooding is a problem and that money must be allocated on a regular basis.  We must plan and find the cause of flooding.  This may not suit those who want the immediate alleviation of their problems. We cannot, however, alleviate the immediate problem if we do not know the cause of it.  A long term project which will receive long term funding is required.  Once the houses in flooded areas are cleaned up, everybody else seems to forget about the problems associated with flooding.</P>
    <P>At a time when people are talking about the Price Waterhouse report and decreasing the size of our Defence Forces, we recall that the major tasks of our Defence Forces over the years have been threefold &mdash; protection along the Border, training our troops in preparation for an emergency and service abroad, but also service to the civil power.  The Army should be involved at all times in emergency situations such as flooding.  In certain areas where flooding is a regular part of the winter environment, emergency services come into play immediately; they are ready.  The <Col N="2124" /> county councils, the Garda, the Civil Defence and the Army should get together and draw up an emergency plan.</P>

    <Title>Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a statutory framework for the Government's civil legal aid and advice service.  The Bill continues the arrangement whereby the Legal Aid Board provides legal services in civil matters to persons of limited means, at little or no cost to applicants. Since the vast majority of cases dealt with under the scheme are family law cases the Bill is, in substance, a family law measure, and for that reason it is a priority measure under the Government's programme of legislation and that of my Department.  The Bill is part of a series of extensive proposals which the Government is pursuing in relation to family law matters, including the holding of the referendum on divorce in 1995.</P>
      <P>The main features of the Bill are that it provides for the establishment and composition of the Legal Aid Board, the powers and duties of the board, the criteria for the granting of legal aid and advice, the type of cases which may be aided, management of finances and the powers of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to make certain orders and regulations to give full effect to the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vital resources of a system of civil legal aid and advice are a combination of money, staff, law centres and clear rules under which the system can operate to the benefit of the public.  For most of the time since the foundation of the legal aid scheme some 16 years ago, Exchequer funding has been in short supply.  Numbers of staff and law centres were not, therefore, what they should have been, and long waiting lists <Col N="2125" /> were a feature in most law centres.  My dissatisfaction with that over the years is, I think, well known and I have always been determined to do something about it.  In my period in office as Minister since 1993, funding of the board has, I am delighted to be able to say, more than doubled.  It went from £2.7 million in 1992 to £4.97 million in 1994.  The 1995 Estimates provide for £6.2 million, an increase of 25 per cent on last year. With these extra funds available over the past two years, the Legal Aid Board has been able to more than double its staff numbers.</P>
    <P>The number of full time law centres has increased from 16 in 1993 to the current figure of 24.  When the Wexford and Ennis law centres come on stream shortly, the number of full time law centres will be 26.  Based on 1995 Exchequer funding increases, more centres are proposed to be opened and additional staff will be provided.  Access to legal aid has been greatly facilitated by these major developments and waiting lists have been reduced dramatically.</P>
    <P>For too long the board and its staff have had to plough a lonely furrow in providing a service to needy clients without proper funding, not enough law centres and insufficient numbers of staff.  I wish to make special mention of those solicitors and other board staff whose dedicated service kept the legal aid scheme going during the lean years and to express my appreciation of them. The board now has a nationwide service and the necessary staff resources are being made available.</P>
    <P>The scheme, which has been in operation since 1979, was established against the background of the report of a Government appointed committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Denis Pringle.  The main features of the scheme were announced in May 1979 and anticipated by some months the judgment handed down by the European Court of Human Rights in October 1979 in a case taken by Mrs. Johanna Airey against the Irish Government in the matter of access to the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2126" /> Many of the provisions in the scheme are in line with recommendations contained in the Pringle report.  That is not to say that all of the report's recommendations were followed; there were some significant differences.  The committee considered, for example, that a mixture of law centres and solicitors in private practice offered the optimum basis for servicing a civil legal aid scheme.  However, the scheme until recently provided only for the use of the board's own salaried solicitors in law centres.  The board had no authority under any circumstances to avail of solicitors in private practice.</P>
    <P>I formed the view when I took over responsibility in relation to the Legal Aid Board two years ago that the time was right to embark on an initiative in this regard, to provide for the introduction of a pilot project for the use of private solicitors to supplement the services provided by solicitors in law centres.  I have made provision in the Bill to enable the board to avail, where necessary, of private solicitors. However, the main work of the board's legal services will continue to be the responsibility of the law centre solicitors.</P>
    <P>To assist the House in its consideration of the Bill, I now propose to explain briefly the manner in which the existing scheme of civil legal aid and advice operates.  This is relevant to the debate because an understanding of that scheme, on which I am basing the statutory scheme, will be useful when we come to deal with the details of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for assistance under the present administrative scheme, an applicant must satisfy two basic eligibility tests.  The first of these is a means test and the other is a merits test.  An applicant is eligible on financial grounds if his or her &ldquo;disposable income&rdquo; and &ldquo;disposable capital&rdquo; are within certain limits specified in the scheme.  &ldquo;Disposable income&rdquo; is the income which remains when various deductions are made from gross income, &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; being defined as total income received from all sources.  The <Col N="2127" /> deductions to be made from gross income, which are referred to as allowances, include for example, income tax, mortgage repayments, rent, social insurance, VHI contributions, expenses in travelling to and from work, together with various allowances in respect of the applicant's spouse and dependent children. &ldquo;Capital&rdquo; includes, for example, money in the applicant's bank, credit union, building society or post office accounts, or the applicant's house, property or land.  The assessment of the value of such resources can have the appearance of being a complex matter. However, the simple aim is to find the value of the applicant's disposable capital, which is its gross value, less, for example, the cost of realising assets, outstanding loans etc.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases applicants do not have significant capital resources which means that, by and large, eligibility is determined by reference to income alone.  It is worth mentioning that while the incomes of a husband and wife are normally aggregated, they are treated separately when the parties are in conflict with each other, or where they are living separately and apart.  The effect of this rule is that in a very high proportion of matrimonial cases, a wife will qualify for legal services, even if her husband is financially secure.</P>
    <P>The merits test to which I referred earlier operates on the basis that legal aid may be granted only where the applicant has, as a matter of law, reasonable grounds for taking, defending or being a party to legal proceedings and is reasonably likely to be successful in those proceedings.</P>
    <P>Different considerations apply in the case of applications to the board concerning children.  Senators may be aware that this is the effect of a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of M.F. <i>v.</i> Legal Aid Board and Others ([1993] 13 ILRM 797).  Following that decision the position has been that a person applying on behalf of a child who is otherwise eligible for legal aid should not be refused <Col N="2128" /> it under the merits test unless the board considers that there is no reasonable likelihood that the applicant's point of view and submissions in relation to the child would be among the material which would be relied upon by a judge in determining issues concerning the child.  The board, therefore, has considerable scope to grant legal aid in cases concerning children on the basis primarily of the means test.</P>
    <P>In considering applications for legal aid in general, it is also necessary for the Legal Aid Board to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the probable cost of taking or defending the proceedings, measured against the likely benefit to the applicant.  In effect, the purpose of the scheme is not to put the person of limited means in the position of the person for whom &ldquo;money is no object&rdquo; but in the position of the person whose means, while not over-abundant, are sufficient to cover essential legal services.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme applicants for legal services are liable to pay certain contributions. The minimum contribution is £3 for legal advice plus a further £16 where the applicant needs to take or defend court proceedings.  An important feature of the contribution system is that, generally speaking, the individual applicant knows from the outset what the maximum cost of the legal service will be, even if he or she loses the action.  In a small number of cases the contributions originally determined may be increased &mdash; for example, where the applicant's financial circumstances improve while he or she is in receipt of legal services, or where his or her financial circumstances change for the better as a result of obtaining such services.</P>
    <P>There are three final points concerning contributions which are worthy of special mention.  First, all persons depending solely on social welfare payments qualify for legal services on payment of the standard minimum contributions I have referred to, that is, £3 for advice plus a further £16 for representation in court.  Further, a person who is liable to pay the minimum contributions <Col N="2129" /> may have the payments waived in whole or in part in cases of severe hardship. In addition, contributions may in certain circumstances be paid by instalments.</P>
    <P>Certain matters, including representation before tribunals, are excluded from the scope of the existing scheme. This does not mean, however, that applicants seeking assistance for tribunal hearings are turned away from law centres.  The situation is that law centre solicitors can, and regularly do, provide advice in connection with cases coming before tribunals.  They do not provide representation at the actual tribunal hearing.  If, however, the decision of the tribunal is appealed to the courts, both legal aid and advice may be provided. I will refer again to tribunal hearings later.</P>
    <P>Other excluded matters under the existing scheme include defamation, debt collection where the applicant is the creditor, civil bills for sums below £150, election petitions, licensing matters and disputes concerning rights and interests over land and conveyancing, other than conveyancing which arises following a settlement of a matrimonial dispute or where the applicant suffers from an infirmity of mind or body and appears to have been the victim of fraud or undue influence.</P>
    <P>So much for the existing scheme.  I turn now to the main details of the Bill. Section 2 enables me, as Minister, by order to appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.  This is a standard provision in legislation of this nature.  It allows for what I intend to be a fairly short period of time to elapse between the passing of the Act and its date of operation.  This time will allow for regulations to be made under the Act and for the board to put in place the necessary measures for its operation as a statutory body.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 5 deal with the establishment of the Legal Aid Board and charge it with the function of providing, within the board's resources and subject to the provisions of the Act, legal aid and advice to applicants who satisfy those provisions.  The board will <Col N="2130" /> be endowed with legal personality, thereby entitling it to be a party to legal actions and to hold legal title to property.</P>
    <P>Section 4 continues the arrangement under which the Minister has power to appoint the board.  It will consist of a chairperson and 12 ordinary members. Two members of the board must be barristers and two must be solicitors.  For the first time, staff will be represented on the board.  There will be two such representatives.  I am ensuring that the board will have an appropriate gender balance.  Not less than five members must be men and not less than five must be women.</P>
    <P>As at present, the term of office of board members will be five years and no member will be able to serve more than two terms.</P>
    <P>The principal function of the board, by virtue of section 5, will be to provide legal aid and advice in civil cases to individuals who satisfy the income eligibility criteria specified in section 29 and the other requirements of the Act.  Under section 6, however, the Minister may assign additional related functions to the board.  The board will be entitled to delegate functions to its members or its staff.</P>
    <P>Section 7 empowers the Minister to issue general policy directives in relation to legal aid and advice to the board and requires the board to comply with such directives.  This provision is necessary in view of my overall responsibility to the Oireachtas for policy in relation to legal aid.  However, as at present, the board will have independence in the giving of legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>In section 9 I have dealt with the matter of annual reports and have adhered to the current practice of requiring the board to present such a report to the Minister in such form as the Minister may approve.  The section requires the Minister to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas copies of every such report. The Minister may also request that the board supply additional information as to the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2131" /> Section 10 provides for a chief executive officer of the board, who will be a civil servant of the State and will be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Sections 11, 21 and 22 deal with matters relating to the other staff of the board.  Those sections have been framed after lengthy discussions with five different trade unions as well as the board itself.  The result of those discussions is one which I believe will satisfy all of the parties involved.  It provides that the board's administrative and clerical staff will be civil servants in the Civil Service of the State.  The board will be in a position to recruit staff through the Civil Service Commission &mdash; a development which it has sought for some considerable time.  The board's solicitor staff will continue, as at present, without civil service status.  However, the Bill enables me to designate them as civil servants following consultations with them and the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 23 is a standard provision to safeguard the pensions of any members of the board's staff who do not ultimately become civil servants.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 17 deal with a number of technical and practical matters which arise because of the legal identity which the board will have on enactment of the Bill.  Section 14, for example, is a standard provision which transfers all property, rights and liabilities currently attaching to the non-statutory board to the new board, while section 15 serves to ensure that contracts entered into by the current non-statutory board are transferred to the new board.</P>
    <P>Sections 18, 19 and 20 deal with matters relating to funding of the board and they empower the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to advance funds to the new board and require it to establish and maintain a legal aid fund to finance all its operations.</P>
    <P>I now come to the heart of the Bill &mdash; that part which deals with the provision of legal aid and advice.  While the <Col N="2132" /> sections in question reflect the provisions of the existing scheme to a considerable extent, there are a number of significant changes which, I believe, will enhance the legal aid system in this country.</P>
    <P>Section 24 maps out the primary test which an applicant for legal aid must pass in order to obtain such services.  It requires that legal aid or advice will not be granted unless a reasonably prudent person, in similar circumstances, who could afford to pay for the services of lawyers in private practice would do so at their own expense, and a lawyer would be likely to advise them to do so.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 and 26 concern legal advice, which is defined as legal assistance other than actual representation in court or any preparatory steps leading up to it.  The board will, as at present, be precluded from providing legal advice in relation to criminal law matters, because, as Members will be aware, such matters are dealt with under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962. The board will, however, be allowed to continue the special arrangement under which legal advice, free of charge, is provided to complainants in rape and aggravated sexual assault cases.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 deal with legal aid, which is defined as meaning representation by a solicitor or barrister nominated by the board in civil proceedings conducted in the District, Circuit, High or Supreme Courts or any court or tribunal prescribed by the Minister by order under section 27.  The definition encompasses all such assistance as would normally be given to a client by a solicitor in private practice in relation to instituting, defending or concluding court proceedings, and it applies to all civil proceedings other than those referred to in section 28 as &ldquo;designated matters&rdquo;.  The designated matters are matters presently excluded from the scheme, such as defamation and conveyancing, other than conveyancing which arises out of a matrimonial dispute. However, in a significant departure from the scheme, I have, in subsection (11) of section 28, provided that the <Col N="2133" /> Minister may, by order, deem any of these matters as no longer being designated. I think the House will agree that present policy should be to direct funds to those cases where funds are most needed, to increase the number of law centres, to provide proper staffing levels and then to assess whether the Exchequer, having regard to various priorities, should extend funding to the board for all cases.</P>
    <P>As has been the case since the inception of the scheme, applicants will only be provided with legal aid where they are granted legal aid certificates.  The criteria for the granting of certificates are contained in section 28 and are on similar lines to those contained in the scheme.  Special provisions, as at present operated under the scheme, will apply in the case of children.</P>
    <P>The general test of merit is continued by the Bill and is supported by various other provisions in the scheme which are to the same general effect.  There is provision, for example, that the applicant must have as a matter of law, reasonable grounds for taking, defending or being a party to proceedings, that it must be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case to provide legal services and so on.</P>
    <P>The relevance of the &ldquo;merits&rdquo; test will be apparent to practitioners; there is very little point in legally aiding a client where it is considered that, from a legal point of view, the client's case is totally lacking in merit and that legal services, no matter who may provide them, are unlikely to provide him or her with any worthwhile benefit.</P>
    <P>In assessing whether a certificate of legal aid should be granted, the board will continue to be required to weigh the probable cost of providing legal aid against the benefit likely to accrue to the applicant as a result of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The board will also have discretion to refuse to grant legal aid certificates on certain specified grounds where, for example, the cost to the applicant of taking the proceedings without receiving <Col N="2134" /> legal aid would be less than the contribution payable by him to the board, or the applicant has failed to provide such information as is required by the board to make a decision on his or her application.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the critical matters of financial eligibility criteria and contributions.  An applicant's eligibility and contribution will be assessed by reference to his or her disposable income and, where appropriate, disposable capital, in such a manner as is prescribed in regulations.  In framing those regulations, I intend to look closely at the financial limits currently in place and would hope to be able to broaden those limits in order to increase the number of people who are eligible to receive legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill provides for the establishment of panels of solicitors and barristers who will be able to provide legal aid and advice to clients of the Legal Aid Board.  The pilot project which I initiated last year was generally welcomed as being instrumental in helping to reduce the backlog of cases which existed because of underfunding and the lack of law centres and staff.  Its operation is at present being reviewed by a committee appointed by the Legal Aid Board.  Once the review group has reported, I will be in a position to determine how best the project should be used in the future to complement the work of the law centres.</P>
    <P>Section 30 (6) is new.  It will enable individual law centres, through different solicitors, to assist both parties to a case. In the past, such cases have been dealt with by separate centres with the result that clients of the board have, on occasion, to travel considerable distances to meet with their solicitors.  I have taken the opportunity given by the Bill to tackle that problem.  It will be of benefit particularly to persons who avail of law centres in the smaller towns. They will not now have to travel long distances to other centres.</P>
    <P>Section 31 deals with the selection or nomination of lawyers to represent clients.  Section 32 guarantees clients of <Col N="2135" /> the board the same rights as they would have should they have retained the services of solicitors in private practice, subject to one exception.  That exception is that lawyers providing legal aid or advice will be obliged to pass on to the board any information which is necessary for the purpose of enabling the board to discharge its statutory functions.</P>
    <P>Sections 33 to 36 deal with the matter of costs.  To date the board, because of its non-statutory status, has had difficulties in recovering costs from non-legally aided parties.  I am providing in the Bill that courts or tribunals should make orders for costs in the same way as they would in cases involving parties who are not legally aided.  Section 34 points to a number of specific factors which should be taken into account by the courts in making such orders.</P>
    <P>These then, Senators, are the main provisions in the Bill.  I am delighted that the Bill has been initiated in the Seanad.  Senators will not be unaware that this is the fourth Bill I have initiated in this House in two years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House again.  I am not unaware that this is the fourth Bill he has initiated in the House, and I am particularly aware that this is the second Bill within two weeks with which I have had to grapple.  Nonetheless, I welcome the fact that the Minister has decided to initiate a number of Bills in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for a Partnership Government, which we thought would run from 1993 to 1997, contained a specific commitment to place the present scheme on a statutory <Col N="2136" /> footing and to further extend it to tribunals.  This legislation achieves this and for that reason I welcome the Bill. In his speech, the Minister stated that the present scheme exists because in 1979 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that as a Mrs. Airey could not obtain a legal separation because she could not afford legal representation, this was in breach of the Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>However, while I recognise the various improvements in this Bill, it has to be acknowledged that lack of finance is only one factor which prevents disadvantaged people, in particular, from making effective use of the legal system. With your permission, Sir, I would like to read into the record parts of an article from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8 February 1995 by Gerry Whyte, who states that:</P>
    <P>Two very different views exist as to the proper function of a civil legal aid scheme.  In one view, civil legal aid is primarily about assisting individuals to litigate their claims.  It is this perspective which arguably informs the proposed Bill.  The other view, however, sees civil legal aid as primarily concerned with assisting disadvantaged individuals and communities and, moreover, engaging in activities other than litigation. Supporters of this view will find little of comfort in the proposed legislation....</P>
    <P>For those who do not subscribe to the restricted understanding of civil legal aid, which arguably informs the Minister's proposals, the Bill is open to much more fundamental criticisms.</P>
    <P>According to this view, disadvantaged individuals and communities are denied access to effective legal services, not only because of inadequate means, but also because they are unaware of their rights and because of the psychological or cultural barrier which exists between socially deprived clients and lawyers.</P>
    <P>This analysis of the problem was shared by the Pringle Committee on <Col N="2137" /> Civil Legal Aid and Advice which, in its report, published, in 1977, recommended that a comprehensive scheme, addressing each of these problems, be introduced.</P>
    <P>Thus the report recommended that a legal aid scheme should, in addition to providing legal advice and representation, also engage in &ldquo;any appropriate activities in the community... which would be likely to enhance the status of the centre and would be consistent with the provision of a comprehensive legal aid and advice service for the community&rdquo;. He goes on to give an example of the Coolock Community Law Centre].</P>
    <P>Moreover, such a scheme should locate its centres in disadvantaged communities and each centre should, where practicable, have a consultative committee consisting of, <i>inter alia,</i> representatives of the local community who would be in the majority.</P>
    <P>This model of civil legal aid is much more responsive to the argument that the legal needs of disadvantaged communities are not necessarily best-served by the type of service traditionally provided by the private legal sector and also takes on board the reality that disadvantage is not only about lack of resources but also lack of control.</P>
    <P>That view is also supported by the FLAC submission made last year to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights which stated: &ldquo;For there to be effective access to justice, legal services must include education to counter this lack of knowledge.&rdquo;  The main fear or reservation I have about this Bill is that, as it now appears, it fails that challenge completely.</P>
    <P>The Bill does address the needs of individuals, in certain cases, to litigate their claims but it does not reach out to communities or marginalised groups in society to inform them and, more importantly, to involve them in their own system of justice.  This Bill specifically excludes communities and that was <Col N="2138" /> a flaw with the 1980 scheme which was similarly restrictive.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that during the Labour/Fianna Fáil coalition this Minister put 56 to 58 per cent additional resources into the civil legal aid system. He was also responsible for opening additional centres and the involvement of private practitioners in the service to reduce the pressures on it.  A positive aspect of this Bill is that it covers tribunals as well as setting a gender balance for the composition of the board and including staff members on the board and it mentions that advice will be given in rape cases.  Unfortunately, it does not go on to provide that legal aid will be automatically given in these cases.</P>
    <P>In order to strengthen the Bill we should look at what it excludes.  It excludes defamation, debt collection, disputes concerning rights and interests in or over land, civil matters within the jurisdiction of the District Court, licensing, conveyancing and election petitions. Whatever about election petitions some of the other matters give me great cause for concern.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the board will exclude cases which in its opinion constitute test cases.  It is specifically that type of case which has caused uproar and disquiet throughout this country.  I refer to the arrears of social welfare case.  The court recently decided that arrears were payable to married women who had been discriminated against by the social welfare system. This type of case is not covered by this legislation and that is a major flaw in the Bill.  It is another indication that it serves a narrow individual need and not the needs of communities and groups, particularly marginalised groups in society.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the exclusion of defamation.  The Minister may in his reply or on Committee Stage explain why it should be excluded.  Some of the areas defined as designated matters may be deemed unconstitutional.  Disputes concerning rights or interests in or over land is one such matter.  This Minister <Col N="2139" /> has responsibility for equality and the rights of travellers.  There is no doubt that this specific exemption could be said to affect travellers.  In that respect it may be deemed to be unconstitutional and should be examined.</P>
    <P>Section 28(3) states:</P>
    <P>Where the proceedings the subject matter of the application under this section concern the welfare of (including the custody of or access to) a child, paragraphs (c) and (e) of subsection (2) shall not apply.</P>
    <P>The Minister previously introduced legislation to allow for adoptive leave.  I have had correspondence from various groups but I specifically have notice of two cases where adoption orders were not completed and the final consent not given.  In one case the child was nine years old and the mother had still not given final consent.  The other case involved a shorter period but there was similar hardship to the families involved.</P>
    <P>The adoptive parents association in a submission informed me even though the concept of illegitimacy is no longer in use, civil legal aid was not available, regardless of income, to parents who had to take a case to the appropriate court to have the application completed and finalised.  All such cases were paid for out of the resources of the adopting parents.  However, if the State has to bring a family to court where the child is deemed to be legitimate, the State can go from the District Court through to the Supreme Court if necessary and the State will foot the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will make the details available to the Minister because it is a little sketchy in my mind.  I may be misrepresenting it but that was the core of the submission. There is a huge injustice in this area.  If this subsection of section 28 addresses the welfare of children we may need to examine that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>This case involves costs of about £8,000.  If the child is not legally the child of that family, they are taking on the responsibility of the State to finalise a legal arrangement.  I will make the details available to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>He can examine it and see where it could be dealt with best.</P>
      <P>At present 75 per cent of cases at law centres are taken by women.  As the Minister stated, this Bill is part of a series of legislation being put in place prior to the divorce referendum.  If the divorce referendum is carried by the people and we introduce legislation allowing for divorce, we can reasonably assume that the number of cases presenting at legal aid centres will grow.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to look at the existing position.  I again acknowledge that this Minister fought his corner in the last Government and I have no doubt he will continue within the existing framework to ensure he gets funding as required.  It is necessary to examine the existing situation even with that additional funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board made a submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Right correcting an article which had appeared in a national newspaper.  This constitutes a balanced view.  These are not wild statements which was how the board described the newspaper report.  This submission was made in 1994 and states that the demand for legal services under the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice exceeds the capacity of the board to meet the demand.  To be fair to the board they were writing to correct a <Col N="2141" /> report by FLAC which suggested that the situation was far more serious.</P>
    <P>The board's reports from 1987, 1988 and 1989 stated:</P>
    <P>The reality is that a great many people who are badly in need of legal services, mainly in relation to family law matters, are being denied justice because of the Board's inadequate resources.</P>
    <P>FLAC in its submission stated that in 1992 the board provided legal services in 1,418 cases of domestic violence.  We are now dealing with new areas of family law including the Bill the Minister introduced last week and the six others he intends to introduce.  If, where funding has been increased, the services are already under pressure, I wonder what will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>The piece refuted by the Legal Aid Board appeared in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> What was not refuted was the statement by Ms Greene of FLAC that spending on legal aid in Ireland was among the lowest in the EU even with the recent 56 per cent increase in funds. Statistics were given for delays or waiting periods which did not concur with those given by Ms Greene.  One must accept that one often has to wait for services but these delays ranged from four weeks to five months.  This morning I was informed that a person in Malahide will wait 12 months before a legal separation case will be taken.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge what the Minister has done but it is obvious that existing facilities and services are still heavily taxed. Perhaps I am misreading the legislation &mdash; and I will bow to the superior knowledge of the Minister and other Members on this issue &mdash; but the final line of the explanatory memorandum states: &ldquo;The Bill has no financial or staffing implications.  It will not involve any additional charge on the Exchequer.&rdquo; The Bill is lacking because it does not embrace a community need, but we are only fooling ourselves if we think that putting something on a statutory footing, which is inadequate and does not provide for additional staff or <Col N="2142" /> funding, will make a difference.  With the best intentions in the world, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> or <i>A Government of Renewal</i> will mean nothing if resources are not available to support the worthy aspirations of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech, which I will examine on Committee Stage, outlines the general criteria for eligibility. Adopting couples qualify under the existing scheme, if they have £8,000 or £10,000 to pursue their case.  The criteria in the Bill is hazy.  Section 24 (a) states:</P>
    <P>... a reasonably prudent person, whose means were such that the cost of seeking such services at his or her own expense, while representing a financial obstacle to him or her would not be such as to impose undue hardship upon him or her, would be likely to seek such services in such circumstances at his or her own expense, and....</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could incorporate what he said in his speech in the Bill because this would strengthen it.  I am a legislator, yet I do not understand the general description, which, perhaps, applies to criminal legal aid.  I will discuss other issues in the Bill in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (4) (b) states: &ldquo;Each member of the Board shall act on a part-time basis save where the Minister, on being satisfied that it is necessary to do so in the interest of the proper functioning of the Board and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, appoints any such member or members to act on a fulltime basis.&rdquo;  Last November various claims and accusations were made that the reason for the problems in the Office of the Attorney General was because the Attorney General worked on a part-time basis.  That was subsequently denied at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security by the then Attorney General.  Why then is this section included in the Bill?  If we want the best statutory legal aid board, we should not consider part-time work.  In contradiction, section 11 states that &ldquo;An <Col N="2143" /> office of the Board shall, upon his or her appointment as such, be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State.&rdquo;  I do not know any civil servants, even those sitting behind the Minister who do not work on a part-time basis, who are afforded that status on the basis of working part-time.  That is an administrative problem.  The same applies to solicitors employed by the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 (4).</P>
      <P>I always had problems with the law during the few times I was in court because people who were represented by their solicitors or barristers believed that some of them, with all due respect to Senator Gallagher and the Minister, did not listen to or take on board the important points of their case.  I know a barrister or solicitor must argue a point of law, but that is a fundamental flaw in our legal system.  Winning a point of law often means a complete lack of justice for the person bringing a case.</P>
      <P>I have raised this issue in relation to family law matters.  I was appointed to the committee of court practices and procedures and, to the horror of its members, I suggested that individuals should be allowed to make their own cases, particularly in family law matters. The learned judges and solicitors were shocked at my suggestion.  Members of the legal profession are reluctant to allow lay people to become involved and this means that the best case is not always made.  Judges will say that if they allow this to happen, it will take approximately three months to hear one case and this would result in a backlog. However, people should be allowed to get involved, particularly in family law cases.  I could not argue company law, but I am sure I could make a reasonable case in court if it involved a family law case.  That is not provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31 (4) states that the person to whom the board has given legal aid <Col N="2144" /> does not have the right to change his or her solicitor.  However, subsection (5) states that &ldquo;A solicitor.... at his or her discretion, nominate another solicitor&rdquo;. This is another major flaw in the legislation. I know of numerous cases where people received insufficient service from their solicitors, but when they complained to the Incorporated Law Society they got no satisfaction.  This Bill enshrines in law a solicitor's right to give shoddy service, but the consumer has no right to demand a different solicitor. Yet the solicitor, at his or her discretion, can ask someone else to take their case.  That does not show equality between the practitioner and the user of the service.</P>
    <P>Section 34 refers to costs and states that the board should operate on a cost effective basis.  However, when the board is looking for costs, it must include the time devoted to the case and the salaries, fees and other expenses paid to the staff of the board.  This means that civil legal aid is more expensive than availing of a solicitor's services because one is only paying for the services of that solicitor's office and not for the fees and salaries of a board. We have enshrined in law that civil legal aid will be more expensive than contracting out the work.</P>
    <P>I look forward to debating the Bill on Committee Stage.  There are problems with it, the fundamental one being that it does not attempt to change the system from an individual based litigation service to a community based system.  It does not ask the board to undertake education or information campaigns.</P>
    <P>One can make parallels with the health service.  There have been radical changes there and it has been acknowledged an effective service deals with curing as well as prevention.  A legal aid system should concern itself with more than merely facilitating litigation.  This Bill falls short on that requirement but there are other problems with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on initiating the Bill in this House.  We are always <Col N="2145" /> pressing for legislation to be initiated here and we should acknowledge when a Minister decides to do so.  I welcome the Bill which puts civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing.  I compliment the Civil Legal Aid Board which has administered that scheme on a non-statutory basis since it was established in 1979 with funds from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It is an issue of natural justice that citizens with limited means should have access to justice in civil matters; this is particularly true for family court issues. It is important that services of solicitors and, where necessary, barristers are available to persons of modest means at as little cost as possible; otherwise our justice system would be unavailable to a large section of our society.</P>
      <P>It is also important that the service includes anything from writing letters on behalf of clients to representing them in court.  While solicitors in the law centres also provide legal services on a part time basis in community centres, etc. the service in rural areas has not developed and is unsatisfactory.  The Minister is dealing with this problem and making legal advice available in more regions.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for the present scheme is based on disposable rather than gross income.  It can be frustrating for people with a small disposable income but a reasonable gross income to be excluded from assistance by the State.  We encounter this every day as public representatives. I know of a third level student who is ineligible for grants because his parents have a high gross income; however there are long-standing debts which the family are forced to repay so they have a low net income. The local authority cannot take these extraordinary circumstances into account when making assessments for educational grants and other services &mdash; everything is based on gross rather than disposable income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach of the legal aid board is that eligibility for legal services under the scheme depends on disposable income, which is what people have after <Col N="2146" /> allowances are made for dependants, rents, mortgage, hire purchase repayments and other outgoings.  The Bill indicates the Minister will decide by ministerial order what the deductions will be.  He should examine the present arrangement which is working well.</P>
    <P>The civil legal aid scheme covers most types of civil proceedings.  In reality, to date it has been confined because of its resources to family law matters.  These include proceedings involving barring, maintenance, custody, access, judicial separation and nullity.  In 1994 the board opened additional law centres so each county now has a full time or part time law centre.  However, as I said, it is not available in rural towns and villages apart from the larger towns.  The funding for 1995 is welcome.  The allocation by the Government of £6.2 million represents a 25 per cent increase on the £5 million funding in 1994.  This should be used to further extend the services of the board in areas where they are not available.</P>
    <P>Special tribute should be paid to the work of the free legal advise centres, FLAC.  This voluntary organisation, which is involved in campaigning for access to the courts and the establishment of a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid and advice, does much good work.  FLAC also endeavours to provide legal assistance to those areas not covered by the State scheme of civil legal aid and advice, especially in employment and social welfare matters. It is involved in the provision of information and campaigns for law reform in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill places the board on a full statutory basis, which is overdue.  FLAC is critical of how the free legal aid scheme has developed as a service dealing exclusively with family law representation. This is clear from the annual statistics.  The most recent figures available are for 1992.  In that year 1,791 legal aid certificates were awarded in family law cases and only 63 certificates in other cases.  The 25 per cent increase in the Government contribution should improve this position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2147" /> The present situation which is regrettable is due to a number of factors.  First, certain areas of law are outside the remit of the scheme.  Second, the board has no role in educating the public as to their rights and obligations at law. Third, the law centres operate independently of the community in which they serve.  I am reflecting some of the points made by Senator McGennis in stating this.</P>
    <P>In future legislation the Minister should consider creating community based law centres similar to Coolock Community Law Centre.  In the original scheme of civil legal aid there was a provision for community consultative committees to be set up.  Such committees should be empowered to consider conferring additional duties on individual law centres.  The legal aid board, as it exists, has no role in the education of the people it serves.  Education is a fundamental part of a full legal service package.  Equal access to justice requires that all members of society should be aware of their rights and obligations.</P>
    <P>From my reading of the Bill it appears the Minister is empowered to extend legal aid to tribunals by order. To date people qualifying for legal aid on a means test could not get assistance or representation on the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Social Welfare Appeals Tribunal.  As a member of the EAT, I am worried that these tribunals are becoming more legalistic and there is over-involvement by lawyers.</P>
    <P>Initially those tribunals were established as an informal setting where people could make their claims &mdash; the less involved the legal profession was, the better.  This has now totally changed. In most sittings of the EAT when I am involved, both sides are represented by a barrister and a solicitor.  This is expensive, especially for the climant who has often suffered dismissal.  The average award by the tribunal last year was in the region of £4,000.  If a large legal bill comes out of that, the net benefit is small.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2148" /> I was involved with the tribunal at its establishment in 1977.  Then one would rarely see a solicitor or barrister at a hearing.  If people were represented, an employee would invariably be represented by a trade union official and a company by an industrial relations official of the FUE, now known as IBEC.  It has totally changed and the legal representation is the same as in a court.</P>
    <P>The new chairperson of the tribunal, Ms Mary Flaherty, who is a barrister, has stated she would like to see the tribunal reverting to being less formal.  I hope that will happen but I will not hold my breath.</P>
    <P>The objective of the new board, and the operation of the system of free civil legal aid, must be towards the attainment of equal access to justice for all members of society.  This can only be done by a combination of services and education and community involvement. I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill and look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this Bill.  It is splendid that so much of the Minister's legislation is being initiated in the Seanad.  We get the first bite of the cherry on such occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Second Commission on the Status of Women devoted the first chapter of its report to constitutional and legal issues.  One of the most important statements was at the beginning of that chapter in which the commission compared Article 3 of the 1922 Constitution with Article 40.1 in the 1937 Constitution.  The report stated that Article 3 of the 1922 Constitution provided that &ldquo;every person without distinction of sex, domiciled or born as provided therein, is a citizen of the Irish Free State and shall within the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State enjoy the privileges and be subject to the obligations of such legislation&rdquo;.  In the 1937 Constitution on the other hand, Article 40.1 states &ldquo;All citizens shall as human persons be held equal before the law. <Col N="2149" /> This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The commission went on to point out that equality before the law has been impossible for Irish women because the exclusion of the phrase &ldquo;without distinction of sex&rdquo; in the 1937 Constitution was extremely important.  It was important not just from the point of view of the privileges of the law but of the obligations of the law.  It had a dampening effect on the equality of women.  Even on the international stage we felt obliged to follow up these matters.  In 1986, when this country acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Ireland entered some reservations. One of these reservations related to the area of financial credit. When one thinks of how important finance is with regard to the law, one realised that could only have militated against women having equal access to the law in this country.</P>
    <P>Equality before the law was impossible for many Irish women because it depended on money.  In many situations women were not economically independent; they depended on male relatives for financial assistance.  While this Bill is to be welcomed by all citizens it must be welcomed in particular by women and especially by mothers.  As other Senators have pointed out, since the civil legal aid scheme was set up in 1979 it has been used mainly by women. Sadly, it has been used most often in the area of family law.  About 95 per cent of the cases which have gone to court with the assistance of civil legal aid have been in the area of family law and mainly to secure barring orders, judicial separations, maintenance orders and access orders.  Almost all cases have been initiated by women.</P>
    <P>The introduction of free civil legal aid, after the Airey case, was extremely important.  However, another change in the legal area has been a great increase in the number of women involved in the <Col N="2150" /> courts system since the then Senator Mary Robinson brought the Airey case to the Court of Human Rights.  Until about 20 years ago &mdash; despite the fact that wigs and gowns were the order of the day in the courts &mdash; the legal system was virtually male dominated.  This made it appear user un-friendly to women.  Senator McGennis was right to point out the cultural and sociological differences between the clients of the law and the practitioners in the courts. This has changed a little.  However, there has been a definite change in the authoritarian figures in our courts with, for example, the appointment of a woman to the Supreme Court and the appointment of women to the High Court and to the district courts.  There has also been a large increase in the number of women barristers and solicitors, due probably, to a large extent, to the CAO which ensured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for reminding me.  As I will be meeting her tomorrow I would not like to have omitted her.</P>
      <P>This change has been very important. Women now see the law as being more friendly.  It was very intimidating for 50 per cent of clients &mdash; and far more than 50 per cent in family law cases &mdash; to see that the law was represented totally by the other gender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to see that the Legal Aid Board, like other boards being appointed by the Government, will have a gender balance.  That is very important.  President Robinson spoke in Strasbourg recently about the necessity for women to become more active and to be more visible in public life.  As she said, a quota system really should not be necessary but sometimes it is.  Recently I read the obituaries for the American politician, Senator Fulbright.  While I always admired his foreign policies I was somewhat doubtful about his domestic political policies, particularly on racial issues.  Senator Fulbright used to <Col N="2151" /> say that he liked to rely on the slow conversion of the human heart.  The heart sometimes is slow to convert and the head can be even worse.  Sometimes a slove in the right direction is no harm. I am glad that the Minister has included this provision with regard to the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>It was not just the staff in the courts who were all male.  Until 1976, when Mairín de Burca took her case against the then Attorney General, the juries were totally male in composition.  I do not know how anybody could describe that as being judged by one's peers. Until then women could automatically ask to be eliminated from juries.  This was really unfair to those who were to be judged.  If one is to be judged by one's peers, I presume women would like to see a certain proportion of the jury being women as well.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extensive and there are few matters in it about which one might quibble.  Senator McGennis and Senator Neville have mentioned some of them. One particularly good point relates to matrimonial cases.  Partners can now go to the same legal aid centre but they will be represented by different solicitors. Previously, this was a difficult issue for people in matrimonial cases.  While I am aware that the Minister has extended the number of legal aid centres, if a case was being taken in a small country town it meant that one or other partner had to travel quite a distance to get legal aid to engage another solicitor.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained the extension of aid to tribunals whereby advice will be given but not representation.  He apparently intends to make an order at some date in the near future under which legal representation can be made also.  I would be pleased if that order could be made now or at least at a specific date.  I am always anxious about the near future &mdash; it can sometimes be a long time away.  I often think that it is great to have a deadline in life so that at least when it is reached and one has not achieved his or her objective, one knows that one has failed.  However, if <Col N="2152" /> one does not have a deadline it is often too easy for things to be put on the back burner.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to discuss and which Senator McGennis covered very ably is the importance of the involvement of communities, a good example of which is the Coolock Community Centre.  It makes solicitors appear less remote if many people from the community are involved.  In addition, they may have made suggestions as to the most important legal issues in their area. In this respect, I was surprised on one occasion, in view of the many family law cases, when some people seeking additional legal aid told me that debt defence was an important area.  Without this kind of knowledge from the community it is sometimes difficult to know what is needed.</P>
    <P>It is a pity also that some areas have been excluded, such as defamation, property disputes, the small consumer claims of under £150 and debt collection. However, I am pleased to note, and perhaps many solicitors could take this on board, that the Minister has decided to allow the solicitors involved in dealing with cases to decide whether they have merit.  This is a good point, because quite often nowadays there is even criticism in the courts regarding cases brought which judges consider not of sufficient merit to come before the court.</P>
    <P>Giving information to the public is important and I am sorry the Legal Aid Board will not have more of a role in this.  It is very hard to ask for one's rights to be enforced if one does not know them.  In this respect, FLAC did a survey a few years ago and found that a very large proportion of people did not know their rights.  While there is a leaflet in the citizen's advice centres, we have been talking about the establishment of one stop shops on social welfare, employment and so forth in the Forum for Social and Economic Progress. Perhaps in this context the Minister would consider establishing, if not an entire legal aid centre, then some kind of legal officer who could attend <Col N="2153" /> these one stop shops at certain times to advise people of their rights.  Even the distribution of leaflets in these centres may be important.</P>
    <P>That people will not be in a position to attend schools and community groups to give lectures is a pity, because often major public issues, which affect that community only and which may have legal implications, need to be discussed and it would be a good idea if the legal aid centres were in a position to give some help to the community.</P>
    <P>We all owe a great debt of gratitude to people who work and have worked in the free legal aid centres, and to all the private lawyers who have worked on a <i>pro bono</i> basis for so many people.  I am pleased to note the Minister has stressed the use of private solicitors in cases, because this is rather like the extension of the general medical service, where people have a choice of doctor.  It made an enormous psychological difference to people to be able to decide who they would attend and who would take their cases.  This is especially welcome, because there is a bit too much of the dispensary, or poor house idea when the State decides whom one must attend.</P>
    <P>Like Senator McGennis, I believe the scheme will need more money, because of this most justified extension to it. Senator McGennis referred to delays. Justice has to be done, but as we all know, it has to be seen to be done swiftly.  Delay in cases of violence and in cases which involve children always worries me.  In this area, the Minister will have to keep fighting his corner &mdash; as he has done so ably to date &mdash; to get more money for the legal aid scheme. The extension of access will highlight the need.  While we hear a great deal about the waiting lists in the health service, the waiting lists in the legal aid service are as serious, and I hope they will be addressed by the provision of more finance to the Minister's Department under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is his fourth Bill initiated in the House a trend for which <Col N="2154" /> we have called.  The Minister is a brave man to have done this, given that we are in a minority on this side of the House. Obviously, he has great confidence that the Bill will be carried.</P>
      <P>Only yesterday Members spoke at length on the provisions of the Family Law Bill introduced by the Minister.  In examining existing legislation, including proposed legislation such as the Family Law Bill, it is clear that certain areas of law are being greatly expanded.  In this respect, family law is probably the fastest growing area of law in the country, and many people find themselves in the unhappy circumstance which require legal assistance, through the need for maintenance, barring orders, protection and so on.</P>
      <P>In recognising the growing complexities of our lives, and in responding through statutory means, we see an ever increasing need for legal assistance and redress.  The Minister recognised this growing need and the expense attached to it, by providing in other legislation greater jurisdiction for the District and Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>This move towards more and more cases, especially in family law matters, being heard at local level reduces legal costs and serves the parties involved much better.  It means that those involved in cases do not have to wait until the Circuit and High Court attend their area to have the matter heard.  It also means that access to the law is provided on a much more local and convenient level.  However, most importantly, it reduces the costs of such cases and I therefore welcome these moves.</P>
      <P>With regard to hearing family law cases I note that Senator McGennis referred to the need to have the people involved make their own cases in court In my experience I find this happens and judges in family courts give much leeway to the parties to speak as the wish and represent themselves.  I am sure the Senator will be happy to not that there is leniency in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that retraining may be necessary for judges, to help them keep up with the ever changing and ever progressing areas of family law.  Furthermore, it is expected that if a divorce referendum is approved, there will be approximately 70,000 couples applying for it directly thereafter.  I am aware this is a matter for the Minister for Justice, but I hope provision for more family courts will be made to deal with such circumstances.</P>
      <P>As the number of laws, and their application increase, so also does the need for access to the legal system.  As I have remarked before in the House, there is little point in providing rights for individuals, while those who require the assistance of the law to vindicate such rights cannot afford it.  In this respect, access to the law, as we well know, means much more than just being given rights on paper.</P>
      <P>I know these concerns are shared by the Minister, and he took them on board in his usual practical fashion by, immediately after his appointment, ensuring that the allocation to the Legal Aid Board was greatly increased.  Since 1992, the funding to the board increased by 131 per cent.  Indeed, I welcome the increase this year by a further 24 per cent.  In effect, the Government is putting its money where its mouth is.</P>
      <P>With this, we see a more than 100 per cent increase in the staff of the board since July 1993, and I note further staff increases are expected this year following the enactment of the Bill.  This increase in staffing was badly needed to reduce waiting lists and the pressure on existing staff, many of whom have given generously of their time and expertise, over and above the call of duty, in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all, I congratulate the Minister on bringing legal aid to the citizens of this country, and Senator Henry referred to this.  In this respect, Senator McGennis spoke of solicitors working on a part time basis.  My understanding is that at centres which operate on a part-time basis the solicitors are employed full time.  They work part <Col N="2156" /> time in one centre and spend the rest of their working week in another centre so that, effectively, they are full-time members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Bill states it is the board more than the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>That might cover it. When I first spoke in the House on this matter I pointed out to the Minister that people in my area of Cavan and Monaghan had no facilities for legal aid.  The nearest centres then were Dundalk or Dublin which simply was not practical. It is unreasonable to expect people to travel 40, 60 or 70 miles for a service which they badly need.  Furthermore, people who need legal aid are obviously those with limited means.  They often do not possess a car and the cost of public transport is prohibitive.  How can a woman be expected to travel with her toddler and a buggy on the 8 o'clock bus to Dundalk for an appointment at 11 o'clock and then wait all day to get the bus home?  The harsh realities which people face in trying to get assistance are not always recognised by those lucky enough to live in areas where services are readily available.  Therefore, I congratulate the Minister on providing a full time legal centre in Monaghan town and a part time one in Cavan town, for which I am particularly grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister already increased the number of law centres from 35 to 42, with two more due to open shortly and even more planned, is ample evidence that he has worked very hard and has already achieved great success in improving access to the law.  This is the crux of this Bill.  It is 20 years since the European Court of Human Rights found in favour of Mrs. Airey by deciding that our legal system did not then provide proper and adequate access to the law, in that we did not have a proper system of civil legal aid.  It is obvious that the Governments of that time did not readily accept that judgment with delight because, after all, it took them a further six years to establish a basic <Col N="2157" /> administrative scheme of civil legal aid. The Minister can take pride in having tackled the limits of access to our law and in bringing forward this long awaited legislation in the interests of all those who rely on the State in their pursuit of justice.  I know that it is a day of celebration for many.</P>
    <P>As already stated, this Bill places the board on a statutory basis thereby giving it a separate legal identity and a guarantee of permanence for the future. Most of the sections are, therefore, enabling to allow for the smooth changeover in status.  It appears to be very comprehensive in covering the make up and powers of the board, the continuing entitlements of the staff, the transfer of assets and liabilities, the continuance of work and so on.  Perhaps it does not make very exciting reading, but it provides for what is needed.</P>
    <P>To take up the point made by Senator Henry, I am particularly delighted with the provision which smacks of Labour Party policy.  Section 4 requires at least five women on the new board.  It is not long &mdash; January 1992 &mdash; since the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, saw fit to appoint four men to fill vacancies on an already all male board.  Sadly, that is not unusual.  We know, for example, that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, had great difficulty in getting 40 per cent representation on the country enterprise boards, which have yet to be established.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the legal aid board, it must be remembered that three quarters of the clients of law centres are women, yet their views have no representation on the body regulating the entire system.  It is not just a matter of appointing women for the sake of having them there; they have an important role in that people from that board form the committees which deal with appeals, certification, etc.  An important aspect of this Bill is the inclusion of proper representation for women on the board and I particularly welcome the Minister's efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>The general criteria for a grant of legal aid and advice have been somewhat <Col N="2158" /> eased in this Bill.  In practice there is adequate flexibility in this area and I am quite happy with it.  However, I ask that provision be made for the regular review of income limits and other criteria in deciding whether a person is entitled to legal aid.  It is important to keep an eye on this area on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the scope of legal aid.  While legal aid already applies to a wide area of law, the statistics show it is predominantly used in family law cases.  As stated, 1,791 legal aid certificates were issued in family law cases and only 63 in other cases.  Some would argue for the extension of the powers to cover defamation. land disputes, etc., but obviously, the demand for coverage in those areas would not be huge.  Nonetheless, I hope that the new board will examine the possibilities at a future date and I note what the Minister said in that regard.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this Bill allowing for the application of legal aid to cases brought under the landlord and tenant legislation, proceedings relating to the family home, the defence of a counter claim for defamation and certain other matters broaden the scope of legal aid considerably.  Furthermore, I welcome the fact that the board can now provide free legal advice to complainants in rape and aggravated sexual assault cases. This is a practical provision which will assist victims of such appalling acts by allowing them to get some advice on what to do and where to go.  Obviously, some thought went into this area and I believe that the provision will be appreciated by women who, unfortunately, find themselves in circumstances which warrant it.</P>
    <P>Overall, the scope of the board has been carefully extended to cover areas where it is most needed.  It should also be noted that the small claims procedure, which is now available through the district courts throughout the country, plays a very important role in providing access to the law in circumstances where otherwise the legal cost involved would outweigh the benefit.  It is yet <Col N="2159" /> another method by which justice is being served in a practical fashion.</P>
    <P>In relation to the infamous waiting list for civil legal aid, it is known that matters have improved greatly in this area. As the Minister said, the extension of the law centres and the increase in solicitors and staff employed by the board has helped a great deal.  It should also be noted that the Minister's private practitioners' scheme operated very well in relieving waiting lists.  This scheme allowed private solicitors to accept cases from those entitled to legal aid, thus representing them without delay, and to receive recompense subsequently through the court.  In fact, there will probably be a need for such a scheme in the future, particularly in areas which are not yet well serviced by such centres.</P>
    <P>Many solicitors have given and continue to give free legal advice and assistance to many people.  In fact, it is part and parcel of a solicitor's work, particularly in smaller towns.  While everybody likes to report stories of the big, bad, money grabbing solicitor, it is fair to point out that many solicitors spend much of their time filling out forms for farmers and pensioners, giving advice to people who call in or telephone with a query, writing letters relating to minor matters, acting as counsellors in family cases or for people who are distraught, and all free.  This is accepted as part of the job by many solicitors for which they deserve some recognition.</P>
    <P>There is a need for information in relation to the law and one's rights, generally. It sometimes seems that people are well aware of their rights and often anticipate the amount which their claim may be worth.  It is said that we are one of the most claims conscious countries in Europe.  On the other hand, as Senator Henry said, a large section of our community are more vulnerable and less knowledgeable and often do not know their rights or where to go.  When they are wronged they are often the most reluctant to seek redress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2160" /> As I said, many solicitors give free advice and I recognise that the Legal Aid Board also plays a certain role in this area.  As stated, FLAC has provided a vital service, although not on a sufficiently wide basis as to be available to everybody and must be congratulated for its work over the years.  However, I would welcome the establishment of a nationwide citizens' information system or a one stop shop system.  They have an important role to play in distributing vital information, not just on legal rights and services, but also many other areas, such as consumer rights.</P>
    <P>As politicians, we know only too well that information and assistance is often sought from us through clinics.  This could and should be independently provided. This system has often been used by politicians to give leeway whereby people, who may not have been aware of their rights, have to bow down to the politician who has ultimately informed them of their rights.  They are expected to deliver their thanks in the form of a vote at a later date when this information was and should have been available to them.</P>

      <Col N="2161" /> I had reason to contact the Minister's office in the first week of January in regard to a number of residents in St. Conal's Hospital, Letterkenny, being transferred to nursing homes against their wishes and those of their families. A number of these residents had been in St. Conal's Hospital for between eight and 50 years of their lives.  My point is that to inform them they were being moved on the day after St. Stephen's Day was completely insensitive and cruel and should not have taken place.</P>
    <P>One of the people involved had been in St. Conal's Hospital for a long number of years and was subjected to quite an amount of pressure over the past two years to move out of the hospital.  This person decided to go in the week prior to New Year's Eve.  I went to see that person, with whom I had a good relationship over many years, and her attitude was that she had given in to the pressure put on her over the past two years.  She felt there was no point fighting it any longer.  Her family had not been informed of her transfer.</P>
    <P>Another patient was transferred 30 miles from Letterkenny, not in the direction of his home but in the opposite direction.  He ended up approximately 80 miles away from his home.  Threats were used against this resident, that he would lose his pension if he did not go.  The resident has since returned to the hospital as he was very unhappy in the area to which he was transferred.  My information is that the threats of his pension being taken from him still exist.  Another resident was transferred to a nursing unit in Letterkenny. He lives 40 miles from Letterkenny and definitely was not sent back to his own area.  This person has also returned to the hospital as he was unhappy in the area to which he was moved.</P>
    <P>Another person approached me on St. Stephen's Day and said that the family had been asked to attend the hospital the following day to discuss the transfer of a relative.  They were unhappy that the message had been sent to them on <Col N="2162" /> 26 December, and they were not prepared for it.  One of the relatives also had a very close friendship with the person concerned and would have found it much more difficult to visit the person in the nursing unit rather than the hospital.  My advice to them on that occasion was that they should visit the nursing home and then make up their minds.</P>
    <P>They did this, but, at the end of the following week, they decided the resident should not leave the hospital as she was quite happy there.  It also suited the relative who visited the resident on a regular basis.  Some time later, this relative who visited the hospital was approached by a member of the management team, who stated that a bed was available in the nursing home and the hospital would facilitate the resident at whatever time they wished to go.  This resident was put under extreme pressure and went through a bad time as a result.  This transfer did not take place.</P>
    <P>A number of other residents in the hospital were pressurised to go to district hospitals, nursing units and nursing homes.  In my letter to the Minister, I pointed out the position in St. Conal's and also the attitude of the nursing union within the hospital, which was holding discussions with the management and the North-Western Health Board on staffing levels.  The union stated that wards were overcrowded and that this was due to the closure of a ward and that a number of residents had been transferred to other wards.  This created overcrowding and worsened the conditions of both the residents and staff in these units.</P>
    <P>Christmas is an emotional time, as is the New Year.  I received representations not just from residents and their families but also from groups which are members of the Friends of St. Conal's Psychiatric Hospital.  They were concerned about residents being moved and also their welfare.  In fact, some of them may have written to the Minister on this matter.  I received letters from people in regard to a number of residents in St. Conal's, expressing the wish that they <Col N="2163" /> not be moved.  They maintain that pressure was put on residents and on families at this time of year and I consider that this was wrong and insensitive.</P>
    <P>At all times I stressed that my criticism was based on the transfers which took place from the hospital over the Christmas period.  I worked in the hospital for a number of years and during this time transfers to the community, which involved a large number of people, took place with the blessing of the residents, their relatives and the staff associations in the hospital.  The associations have never criticised this and have always encouraged the transfer of people from the hospital to the community.  They have been very consistent on this approach over the years. Many transfers were made with the complete co-operation of the people concerned and the staff associations. However, I am referring to transfers over the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>I have yet to receive a reply to a letter I sent to the Minister's Department regarding this matter.  I ask that the hospital ceases to pressurise people if it is against their wishes to move out of this institution, which has been their home for between eight and 50 years. As the Minister will understand, many of these residents have no one to speak on their behalf and the fact that they do not have anyone is not a good enough reason for them to be moved against their wishes to accommodation which may leave them very unhappy.</P>
    <P>Many people have gone out on transfer over the years and quite a few have returned.  There are no winners or losers in this situation, but it has always been the policy of both the management and unions in the North-Western Health Board to do what is best for the people concerned.  This is the way the matter has been dealt with over the years. What happened in the hospital over the Christmas period was wrong and I refer the Minister to his letter to Deputy Paddy Harte on Tuesday, 31 January, in which the Christmas transfers were not addressed.  In the Minister's reply to <Col N="2164" /> Deputy Harte, there was no difficulty with regard to the situation as outlined by the North-Western Health Board, which was the basis for the letter. However, the statement did not once address the situation that occurred at Christmas in St. Conal's.  While I agree wholeheartedly with the statement as outlined by the health board, which has been most forward thinking in regard to the services it provides, a mistake was made at this time and should have been addressed.</P>
    <P>At present, there are moves from the general hospital with the transfer of services to vacant units in St. Conal's Hospital.  This is to be welcomed.  In other statements to the paper this week, the former chairman of the board of management of the regional technical college in Letterkenny, who has been a member of the North-Western Health Board for 24 years, says the problem at St. Conal's Hospital at Christmas was not addressed.  This was another vicious attack on the attitude I have taken on behalf of the people who were not able to speak for themselves.  These are the politics in Donegal; one looks on some of these statements as nothing more than vindictive and trivial.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take on board the points raised and to request the North-Western Health Board to investigate the situation in relation to the transfers from St. Conal's at Christmas and not to depend on statements from the health board which completely ignored what happened there.  I thank the Minister for his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank Senator Maloney for raising, this issue today.  I have listened carefully to what he has said.  The information I have is in contrast with the information he has provided to the House so I do not think we will resolve the issue.  However, I will get a copy of the Official Report of the Seanad and ensure that the claims made by the Senator are fully investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board is responsible for the delivery of health <Col N="2165" /> services in County Donegal.  The board has been working consistently to develop its psychiatric service in line with the recommendations of the report <i>Planning for the Future</i> which was published in 1984, and its services for the elderly in line with <i>The Years Ahead</i> report published in 1988.  <i>Planning for the Future</i> recommended a shift from the psychiatric hospital being the focal point of the psychiatric service.  It proposed a service which was comprehensive, community oriented, sectorised, integrated and appropriate to the needs of the patient.</P>
    <P>As the Senator will be aware, the Green Paper on Mental Health which was published in 1992 documented the progress to date of the development of a new psychiatric service in the context of the implementation of the recommendations of <i>Planning for the Future</i> while identifying areas which still needed to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Mental Health looked at the needs of specific groups. In 1992 there were over 3,000 persons aged 65 years and over in psychiatric hospitals, the majority of whom had been there for a long time.  Few of these elderly patients have an active psychiatric component to their illness but they remain heavily institutionalised.  With appropriate rehabilitation it is considered that many of them could live in more appropriate accommodation in the community which would lead to an improvement in the quality of life for the patients.</P>
    <P>The 20 or so elderly patients to whom the Senator is referring were long stay patients in St. Conal's.  They were no longer psychiatric patients and, whenever needed, received their medical care not from the psychiatric medical team but from a general practitioner.  Most of these former residents of St. Conal's are not from the Letterkenny area but from the south-west, middle and north-west of Donegal.  It is a cornerstone of health policy toward the dependent elderly as set out in <i>The Years Ahead</i> report that they should be supported at home and where this is not possible, to provide <Col N="2166" /> their care in a residential home as close as possible to the person's home and family.  The North-Western Health Board has consistently worked towards achieving this objective.  The transfer of patients from St. Conal's to residential care in their communities is consistent with this objective.</P>
    <P>In all cases they have been transferred to either other health board units or to registered private nursing homes whose facilities comply fully with the provisions of the nursing homes regulations <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  The board is satisfied that the services being provided to these patients are excellent and are being delivered in a homely setting.</P>
    <P>Before any transfers took place there were discussions with the families of the residents and where, concerns were expressed these were fully taken into account.  All arrangements had been in place by the end of October 1994 and no patient was moved either against his or her wishes or those of their families. A small number of transfers were made on a trial basis and where this proved unsatisfactory the patients were returned to receive continuing care in St. Conal's.</P>
    <P>The transfer of these elderly patients from St. Conal's coincides with a major £1 million development at the hospital which will result in additional health facilities and refurbished accommodation for the remaining patients there. These refurbishments when complete will result in two fully modernised ward areas with the full facilities necessary to ensure the comfort and privacy of patients.  These changes are part of the continuing programme to develop the mental health services and to ensure that residential care is provided in an environment which respects the dignity of the individual patient.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my confidence that the staff of the North-Western Health Board have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the transfer of patients from St. Conal's was carried out in a way that respected the wishes of those concerned and was in the best <Col N="2167" /> interests of the patients.  I thank the Senator for bringing this matter to my attention.  If there are matters outstanding which are a cause of concern I will have my Department take them up with the health board to see if there is at least agreement on the facts.</P>

      <P>Before I call Senator Lanigan I congratulate the Minister for Defence on his appointment and I welcome him to the House.</P>

      <P>I join in welcoming the Minister to the House.  I raise this matter not expecting to get definitive answers to the concerns and problems raised by the Price Waterhouse report and the efficiency audit group, and their bearing on what might happen in the Defence Forces in the future.  I was at a function in Ballincollig on Saturday last. Since Deputy Coveney was appointed Minister for Defence the people there are quite satisfied that Ballincollig is safe.  However, I would like the Minister to say so.  I wish I could say the same for other places around the country.</P>
      <P>People may think that the Minister has a greater interest in our naval service than in our land services, but I hope that in the next few months as he reads himself into his brief, his Department officials will realise that the Army, the Navy and our Air Service play an integral part in the life of the country.</P>
      <P>In his speech last night the Minister gave the impression that he would not be Minister for Defence in three years time, that he was leaving decisions over for that period during which people will work on the programme that Price Waterhouse has laid out.  That has exacerbated the problems of confidence among Army, Navy and Air Force personnel. They see this as a softened stance on the closure of barracks.  That is not what I would like to see.  I hope the Minister will look at the Defence Forces in their entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> The Minister stated that our barracks were opened because the British were here and that they were barracks of occupation rather than barracks of need for a modern era.  In his speech he suggested that communications are now so good that one does not need the same involvement on the ground as in the past.  That might be all right if we were talking in terms of a rapid response group.  However, we are not; we are talking about multifaceted Defence Forces which have to serve abroad and at home and which have to maintain military and civil powers.  Over the past few years the Army has been involved as an aid to the civil powers.  Transfers of money for the banks could not take place without the Army as we do not have a Garda force that can do the job the Defence Forces do.</P>
    <P>We have been proud of the role played by the Defence Forces in peacekeeping abroad.  That role enhanced the Army and the image of the country.  In the future we will be called on to become more involved in peacekeeping operations throughout the world because we are good at it.  We can be proud of our Army personnel who have been involved in the United Nations in different parts of the world.  They have always fulfilled the mandate given to them.  They have never become involved in local operations and have always abided by the rules of the United Nation.  Because of that, they have not been popular with countries like Israel. In southern Lebanon Irish Army personnel do not consider themselves as primarily members of the Irish Army but members of the UNIFIL forces. They want everything that happens in that area to go through the United Nations command; they will not deal with local Israeli soldiers and are, therefore, respected by everybody except those soldiers.  Southern Lebanon would be a wilderness but for the Irish involvement in UNIFIL.  No matter where one goes, whether it is the Iran-Iraq border, Syria or Somalia, the Irish are respected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> We must protect the recruitment and the training potential of the Army, Navy and Air Corps.  The Navy is becoming more involved in fisheries protection. Perhaps that should not be its role but nevertheless it does it well.  Because of recent changes allowing Spanish fishermen further into the Irish box, the Navy will have a major part to play in fishery protection.</P>
    <P>The closure of barracks may be a local emotive issue.  It also damages a local economy.  In the Minister's constituency Irish Steel does not contribute more to the local economy of Cork than does the barracks in Kilkenny to its local economy.  To keep jobs in Irish Steel workers are subsidised by possibly £200 each per week.  One could consider that paying £200 per week to a soldier in Kilkenny is subsidisation but I do not believe we are subsidising the soldier because he is an aid to the civil power. Portlaoise barracks, for example, is also strategically located.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how a group of accountants can audit the operations of a defence force.  The only way they can audit it is in terms of its cost.  I believe outside experts were brought in from Canada and other countries.  When did the Canadians ever acquire expertise in organising an army, a navy or a defence force?  The former Chief of Staff, Noel Bergin, said this was nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Minister must ensure that the Price Waterhouse report is made available to those interested in the future of the Defences Forces so that we can analyse its contents and have a meaningful discussion on it rather than on the leaks which have come from PDFORRA, RACO, the Department, the media and elsewhere.  Nobody other than the Minister's Department, including those in the military section of the Defence Forces, has seen the report so how can we analyse it?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister produce the report so we can analyse it and consider the implications, not only of the closure vitally important barracks?  I ask the Minister to consider the report in detail but not to delay its implementation for <Col N="2170" /> three years because it will create havoc in the families of those involved in the Defences Forces.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan raised many issues to which I would like to respond.  The submission was more wideranging than the motion which was specific.  I will try to deal with some of the points raised.  Last evening I was pleased to have the opportunity to address Dáil Éireann on defence issues and this evening I am grateful to have the chance of addressing Seanad Éireann on the same important issues.  I am happy to avail of this occasion to clarify the situation regarding the review of the Defence Forces by the Efficiency Audit Group.</P>
      <P>The Efficiency Audit Group, EAG, was established in 1988 by the Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, to examine various Government Departments with a view to recommending practices and methods which would improve effectiveness and efficiency.  The group comprises senior figures from the public service, trade unions and the private sector. In 1993, the Efficiency Audit Group was asked to carry out a comprehensive review of the Defence Forces for the Government.</P>
      <P>The Efficiency Audit Group submitted its report to the Department of the Taoiseach at the end of December.  The report has not yet been considered by Government.  Accordingly, no decisions concerning the future of the Defence Forces have yet been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This review did not arrive out of the blue.  It was initiated for good reasons when the Senator's party was in Government.  It is widely accepted that there is something fundamentally wrong with the structure of the Defence Forces and that there is a need for change.  This was accepted by the Opposition when in Government.  It was also accepted by the military authorities, by the military representative associations and by the present Government.  There is scope for debate as to the possible solutions, but there is no denying the nature and <Col N="2171" /> extent of the fundamental problems we must face.</P>
    <P>In many ways, the conclusions reached by the EAG and their consultants, Price Waterhouse, were fairly predictable. Over four years ago the report of the Gleeson commission highlighted serious shortcomings in the structure of the Defences Forces.  Similarly, the problems regarding the rising age profile have been the source of public debate for some time.  In 1993 the Government issued a revised statement of roles for the Defence Forces which re-emphasised the need to focus on the effective performance of operational tasks.  Given the acknowledged need for reform, it is in the interests of the country and of the Defence Forces that these issues be addressed.</P>
    <P>Before action of any kind can be contemplated on foot of the recommendations of the EAG, it will be necessary to establish an implementation group to prepare a fully costed implementation plan for phase I of the proposals.  This first phase, covering a period of approximately three years, will not involve the closure of a single barracks. It will concentrate instead on the more fundamental issues in the recommendations. I will not, therefore, be presiding over the closure of Kilkenny barracks or for that matter, any other barracks.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that any reforms will be implemented in a planned and sensitive manner.  There will be no compulsory redundancies. There will be consultations with the representative associations in accordance with the agreed system of representation and I have invited both groups to meet me next week.  Where changes are required, they will be introduced as part <Col N="2172" /> of a comprehensive programme and at a realistic pace.</P>
    <P>I am determined to tackle in a positive way the many problems confronting our Defence Forces, for example, the high and rising age profile, poor equipment, inadequate collective training, the excessive numbers working in civilian type jobs and the imbalance between pay and non pay spending.  At present 82 per cent of the Defence budget is spent on pay and 18 per cent on equipment; the ideal ratio would be 70 per cent on pay and 30 per cent on equipment. If these and other problems are not tackled, then the operational capacity of the Defence Forces will be seriously eroded.  Therefore, a do nothing approach is neither a realistic nor a responsible option.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to emphasise that the review process, which predates my arrival in the Department by several years, was not undertaken in any sense as a pure exercise in bookkeeping.  On the contrary, Price Waterhouse, a leading international firm of management consultants which included eminent Canadian military experts, whom our own military admire and have worked with on UN missions, conducted an indepth analysis of all aspects of the Defence Forces.  In addition to that, the EAG took on a separate international expert from New Zealand who is also held in high regard.  Senior officers of the Irish Defence Forces also participated actively in the study and are largely in agreement with its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 22 February 1995.</P>
