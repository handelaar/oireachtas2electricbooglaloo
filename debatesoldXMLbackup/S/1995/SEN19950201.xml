      <P>I have received notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to extend public liability insurance for pupils attending Carrick-on-Shannon community school in order that school buses may dispatch and pick up students in the car park of the sports complex adjoining the community school, and so resolve a disagreement between CIE and the Summerhill Residents Association.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Naughten of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the action taken by his Department to limit the loss of milk production at primary level from sensitive zones to other areas of the country, particularly <Col N="1650" /> in view of the present situation at Shannonside.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the examination papers for the junior certificate are printed in this country.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The proposal by the Minister for Justice to dispense with sittings of the Circuit Court in Rathkeale, County Limerick, and to transfer the entire list for their sittings to Limerick City.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Wall of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister of the Environment to outline when the study of funding of local government will be commissioned and when it is likely to report given the strong feeling of inequity among people concerning service charges.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Education the plans she has for the introduction for an early retirement scheme for teachers as promised at teachers conferences in 1993.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to immediately provide assistance to those affected by the widespread flooding in the Shannon/Suck catchment area and to take steps to avoid the recurrence of such flooding.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Finance to outline the action he proposes to take to deal with the very serious flooding problems at Sixmilebridge.  Ballyvaughan and Leadmore.  County Clare; and if funding will be provided <Col N="1651" /> to deal with the flooding problems in these areas.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to urgently introduce measures into penal institutions to reduce the risk of suicide of detained persons.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Mooney's and Senator Naughten's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1 without debate and Item 2.  Item 6, the Independent Senators Private Members' motion, will be taken from 5.30 p.m to 7.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>I realise that Item 2 covers four reports of developments in the European Communities, so I suggest a time limit of 30 minutes for the first speaker for each group and 20 minutes thereafter. If there is a problem with that, given the fact that we are covering four reports, we could look at it during the course of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business.  I was hoping the Leader would have made time today for a debate on the Brinks-Allied robbery. There is a need to debate the circumstances of the robbery and the aftereffects of the horrific shooting of a constituent of mine: obviously, I am pleased that she is recovering.  This House should also get the chance to debate the legislation covering this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week on the Order of Business I raised with the Leader the need to have a comprehensive debate on the current state of the educational servicing system.  The Leader did indicate <Col N="1652" /> that he would be positively disposed to that matter and I would like to hear the current position.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister for the Environment has announced the extension of the franchise of this House to our emigrants. As the first elected politician in this country to raise that issue many years ago, I welcome that.</P>
      <P>With this new legislation &mdash; this issue has been raised from these benches on many occasions &mdash; I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister to extend the franchise to graduates of other third level colleges, apart from universities, so that they would also have representation and voting on the Universities Panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last point, may I suggest to the Leader that this legislation be introduced in this House rather than begin its passage in the Dáil, as it is most relevant to this House?  May we assume that we are close to a general election in view of the number of items on the Adjournment this afternoon?  In a serious vein&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems serious to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>To those of us not in the know, it is probably very serious.  I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on Northern Ireland.  The last time this was raised &mdash; it was raised by several speakers on the opening day of the session &mdash; I thought it would be better to leave it until after the framework document was drafted.  However, in view of what we have seen today and the deliberate attempts by individuals, if not organisations, to sabotage the peace process, there is a certain urgency about the framework document, there is a vacuum and it is being exploited by people for very bad purposes.  For that reason and in view of the history of the House in dealing with this matter in a balanced and responsible way, we could give a very strong message of support to the Government and the whole peace process. I ask the Leader to make time <Col N="1653" /> available at the earliest opportunity for a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the proposal for a referendum on the granting of votes to emigrants for seats in this House.  It is very important and welcome step and I am certain everybody will be happy to support it.  Last week I raised the question of a debate on the invasion of Chechnya by the Russian Government.  I am pleased that the Minister for Foreign Affairs lodged a protest about this.  It is important and necessary that we have a debate so that we can express our abhorrence at this invasion and the slaughter of innocent people.  Many people would like to express their views.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader if there are any plans for an immediate debate on the new Road Traffic Act.  I believe the Government is considering amending legislation. Before the legislation is introduced, it would be important that everybody in this House has an opportunity to express their views, whether they are for or against the Act or are proposing amendments to it and put their proposals to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the House that the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz took place at the weekend.  I understand that no reference was made to this in the House last week.  That is perhaps understandable because the date of the commemoration is equidistant between the meetings of the House last week and this week.  Had I been aware that no mention was made of it I would have suggested, a Chathaoirligh, that we have a minute's silence in memory of the millions of people who died, in particular because of the lamentable attitude of the Polish Government in handling these ceremonies in virtually excluding all mention of the millions of Jewish people, confining itself exclusively to the 80,000 Polish Roman Catholics and completely ignoring up to half a million gay people who were annihilated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> I wish to mention a couple of Items on the Order Paper.  Will the Leader give time for Item 2, a motion in the names of Senator Henry, Senator O'Toole and myself, about East Timor? It is a non-Government motion.  A deputation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will attend a meeting in Portugal on this subject within the next few months and it would be useful for us to have passed a resolution of this nature.</P>
    <P>With regard to votes for emigrants, as one of the people who sponsored this idea during a debate on reform of the Seanad some years ago, I very much welcome it.  I think it is an excellent idea.  However, I hope that the new Administration will not confine itself to this small measure because we need a much more wide ranging reform of the Seanad.  I know there will be sympathetic minds on the Government benches in this regard.</P>
    <P>Item 7 refers to the recent attack on a distinguished Irish journalist and follows in the wake of what my colleague, Senator Wright, said about the Brinks-Allied robbery.  An important point was made in this morning's newspapers, that there should be co-ordination between the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have made a few speeches now.  Could you direct your query to the Leader please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I finish this point? Will the Leader draw to the attention of those responsible for those areas the fact that I am aware, for example, that there are people in my constituency, in the middle of a heroin epidemic, making upwards of £40,000 a week with extensive properties?  I would like to know why the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and Social Welfare are not coordinating their efforts and asking the kind of questions that might put some of these gentle persons behind bars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week on the Order of Business I raised a question <Col N="1655" /> concerning severe flooding in the catchment area of the rivers Shannon and Suck, and nationally as well and I explained to the Leader the grave concerns that were being expressed to public representatives in the areas affected. The Leader indicated a certain line of action which has not proved to be successful. This matter needs to be debated because the situation has deteriorated to the point where families are having to leave their homes.  In my county a large number of families have had to abandon their homes in the last few days, and stock and fodder have been lost.  I am calling on the Leader for a debate today or, if necessary, we could sit tomorrow to debate this urgent matter after the Presidential address.  This issue cannot be put aside for a few weeks; the only way it can get the attention it requires is by a Minister explaining the Government's response to the House.  I am asking the Leader to honour what he said last week when he agreed that it was an important issue that should be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, you have been speaking for a good while and have made your point.  I want you to put your question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I went along with a certain mode of action but I now call on the Leader to have a debate on this matter and that we sit tomorrow, if necessary, to discuss it.  A Minister should respond to the debate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader of the House about a Bill but I made an error with the title.  The actual title is the Harbours Bill, 1994.  In a document issued for the session before Christmas, when we were in Government, it was listed for publication.  I am amazed that in a list published today by the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Seán Barrett, there is no mention whatsoever of that Bill being published before the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>It would kill Foynes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1656" />
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a downgrading because this Bill was to have gone through this House and the Lower House before last summer.  However, at the time the junior Minister, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, was handling that Bill and it was delayed.  I am pleading with the Leader to try to get that Bill published immediately because it is very important.  I also ask him if it could be initiated in the Seanad because, in terms of volume, it is as big as the Companies Bill.  There would be much debate involved in that Bill.</P>
      <P>I also support the call by Senator Finneran for a debate on the flooding, not just in the midlands but throughout the West, indeed covering almost 90 per cent of Ireland.  It is amazing to observe the publicity received by Holland, Belgium and Germany and the money the European Parliament have already said they are going to give these countries. There is no mention of the hardship people are enduring in the midlands and the West.  Only the other night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On this, my first visit to the Seanad since the loss of our son, may I very simply but very sincerely thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and all of the Members of the Seanad who offered and freely gave of their sympathy and their support for us in so many different <Col N="1657" /> ways.  I thank Members particularly for what was said in the Seanad on the first meeting after his death.</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, may I say, since we had the game of musical chairs, some of the Senators do not look nearly as well from the hack as they did from the front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely true. The Senator did not move across himself. There is a space here for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a more serious note, I am usually the one asking for time to be spent on Northern Ireland.  With great respect to Senator Dardis I suggest that we would be talking in the vacuum which he mentioned.  It would be wise to postpone statements on Northern Ireland until after the framework document is published.  That is my view because we would then have something to talk about.  At the moment we have nothing to talk about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Senators who urged the Leader to ensure that the legislation providing for the extension of the franchise to emigrants be initiated in this House.  Those of us on the Independent benches, who have already experienced emigrant voting, are aware of the benefits this can have for our emigrants. We are probably the only people who have had the advantage of seeing the franchise already extended to graduates. The legislation for the new referendum, whenever it occurs, must be initiated in this House.  I can think of no other Bill which deserves to be initiated here as much as this one.</P>
      <P>It is likely to be quite contentious. When discussing it last night I realised that the American revolution started on the basis of no taxation without representation. Here there is clearly a view that this will constitute representation without taxation.  We must ensure a full and open debate starting in this House which will tease out the flaws in the legislation before it goes any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Enright for a debate on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act.  It would be beneficial to the Minister to hear the views of the Members of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader of the House if, rather than having the debate called for by the Leader of the Opposition on the Brinks-Allied robbery, we could have a debate on crime, the escalation of crime and what action has been taken over the last seven years under Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I also addressed the serious flooding issue and drainage problems generally.  Since then there has been serious flooding in Ennis, County Clare, where the business life of the town has been disrupted.  Many businesses and private houses have been <Col N="1659" /> flooded and damaged.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could give us some indication about the legislation which is being prepared because there is a difference of opinion as to whether it is with the Department of the Environment or the Department of Finance and whether it will have provisions to pay compensation to the people who have been badly affected by the recent flooding. We are discussing European affairs, which are important in their own way, but it is vitally important, in view of the serious widespread problems, particularly in towns like Ennis which have been flooded, to discuss this matter today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to request the Minister for Justice to comment on remarks made by a Government Deputy that the Garda Síochána is the laughing stock of the criminal world.  I am sure the Leader agrees that this remark is extremely offensive to members of the Force and I ask him to indicate in his reply if this view is shared by the other parties in Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As there are few items on the Order of Business, perhaps the Leader would request the Minister for Health to come into the Chamber this evening to make a brief statement on the increased numbers of bacterial meningitis cases which have been detected in north Dublin.  This is of great concern to families with children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the National Roads Authority because local authorities are precluded from debating its functions. In particular, I refer to the north-west which has been totally neglected as regards funding and anyone who considers <Col N="1660" /> the plan drawn up by the National Roads Authority for funding will realise this is an important matter; it concerns all local authorities in the north-west.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue.  It would help if the Minister for the Environment could offer an explanation and if we could make a recommendation in this important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a county which has suffered badly from emigration over the past number of years, I welcome the Government's decision to extend voting rights to emigrants.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Dardis, Senator Quinn and Senator Enright that it would be appropriate to introduce such legislation in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to arrange time for a debate on the severe hardship experienced by rural communities as a result of the terrible weather over the past two weeks. Finally would the Leader inform the House when he envisages legislation being introduced to amend the Arterial Drainage Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Naughten in welcoming the commitment of the Government &mdash; at least it is a step forward.  As the House knows Senator Manning kindly responded to a query I raised on this matter on the Order of Business last week and matters have moved on somewhat.  However, this is but a halfway house.  It is not the most acceptable solution for those who have been lobbying for access by emigrants to a franchise in the Irish voting system, especially Glór na Deoraí, the UK based lobby group which has taken a lead on this.  I ask the Leader to give an indication of the Government's wider thinking on this matter.  Is this to be the extent of the reform on the emigrant vote issue?  Are we to accept this is the end of the matter when there are other serious issues surrounding this subject to be debated, analysed and discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" /> Although I speak from a Seanad perspective I am prejudiced in my view to the extent that if I was a TD in a multi-seat constituency I might not be as vocal in looking for support for emigrant votes.  The Tánaiste said in a recent article he would not like to be waiting for votes from Brooklyn to decide the last seat in Kerry North.  I appreciate there are such difficulties in multi-seat constituencies but I believe it is necessary to debate this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not accept three seats in the Seanad will adequately address those issues raised by Glór an Deoraí and other Irish people abroad.  I ask the Leader to indicate whether we will get an opportunity to debate even this narrow concept or when we will get such an opportunity.  Although the statement was issued publicly no indication was given of how these three Senators would be elected, under what franchise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to a public statement by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the imminent publication of a Green Paper on broadcasting, is it the Minister's intention to give this House an opportunity to be involved in the consultative process which will be initiated once the Green Paper is launched?</P>
      <P>I endorse the remarks made by Senator McGowan; I too would welcome a debate on the actions, activities and terms of reference of the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those looking for an urgent debate on flooding.  In case anyone thinks it is a rural or western and mid-western phenomenon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or an Athlone phenomenon, flooding is a recurring problem.  For some reason, although the <Col N="1662" /> weather has not been as bad this year a other years, the floods have been much worse.  Small towns in County Carlow, County Kilkenny and throughout the country are still impassable.</P>
      <P>There is a need to discuss this on a rational basis to see what can be done in the long term.  Short-term solution will not work where flooding is concerned. There is no point putting in pieces of bridgework which will break away under the next severe flood.  We will not be dealing with floods which happen only every 150 years, we want to deal with problems which arise on a day to day basis.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate so that the Seanad can have an input to the commission which is beginning to consider the urban districts and the extension of boundaries in these areas.  Such a debate should take place in the Seanad.  It will affect places like Drogheda, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Durdalk, Tralee and other large urban area as well as smaller rural towns and villages. We should have a debate before the commission properly begins it work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we should have a debate on the recent flooding; has affected Carlow very badly.  In December and January as much rain fell as would normally fall in three and a half months.  That was the primary cause of the flooding and, no matter what we do, such excessive rainfall will cause certain amount of flooding.  However, we should have a debate on the issue in any case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also welcome debate on the recent flooding.  I rarely speak in the Seanad about flooding because it is so common in my county. When the Dodder overflows or there is a flood in Carlow everybody scream about it but it happens in my county on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <P>On this occasion the flooding caused severe damage.  It is an ongoing problem.  It might he no harm if the Tánaiste and others could take time off from their duties and visit the county to see the damage.</P>
      <P>I would also welcome a debate on the proposed votes for emigrants and I would like to know how the system will be put in place.  As a founder of the movement for emigrants in the United States in the 1980s, and as one of those who put money forward with the former Taoiseach to help that movement.  I would like to know if the Senators will come from the United States only or if they will come from England or other countries?  Will all emigrants vote in the election?  How will that be organised?</P>
      <P>Could the Leader also tell us when we will have a debate on IMRO?  There is much uncertainty about this matter. Business people throughout the country, including small shopkeepers, are concerned about the many levies and royalties they are obliged to pay for playing music on their premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That was quite a lengthy Order of Business.  Senator Wright requested a discussion on the Brinks-Allied robbery.  I spoke to the Minister for Justice earlier about that matter.  She feels she gave a full statement to the other House but she will be happy to come to the Seanad, perhaps next week, should it be necessary.  I join Senator Wright in condemning the shooting of Veronica Guerin who many of us on this side of the House got to know when she was secretary to the Fianna Fáil delegation to the New Ireland Forum.  The shooting was reprehensible.  All of us wish her a speedy recovery.  We see this incident for what it was &mdash; a dastardly attempt to influence honest reporting.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole requested a debate on education.  The Minister for Education would be happy to attend the Seanad in two or three weeks time for a long and open ended debate on current issues in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Quinn, Senator O'Toole and <Col N="1664" /> Senator Dardis, mentioned the issue of votes for emigrants.  I would dearly love the Bill to be initiated in this House. However, that is not possible.  Under the Constitution a Bill to amend the Constitution must be initiated in the other House so we are precluded from initiating such legislation in the Seanad. However, there is no reason we could not have a debate before the Bill is introduced on the general question of votes for emigrants.  I am sure the Government would be interested in hearing the views of Senators even at an early stage.  I would see this as part of the debate I hope to initiate soon on Seanad reform.  A section of that debate could deal with the question of votes for emigrants.  I also take Senator O'Toole's point about the extension of the franchise to graduates of other universities besides NUI and Trinity College.  That case was often made here by Senator Jackman when she was a Member.  It is a matter which again should come under the general heading of Seanad reform.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis requested a debate on Northern Ireland.  Debates on Northern Ireland in this House have always been sensitive and careful.  On this occasion, while joining with Senator Dardis in total condemnation of the act of sabotage committed yesterday whose only purpose can have been to hinder the peace process, I tend to agree with Senator Wilson's view at this point.  It is better to wait until the work on the framework document is complete before holding that debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright raised the question of Chechnya.  If we can find time for a debate on that subject we will.  I am not too open minded about an immediate debate on the Road Traffic Act at present.  The Government is re-examining this Act and submissions can better be made within the individual parliamentary parties and to the Minister.  If the Government then proposes changes, or if it does not, after a certain time we could then have a discussion.  A debate on the Act at this moment would not be helpful, but I could be wrong on this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> With regard to the point raised by Senator Morris, I would like to discuss with other party leaders and other party groups if there was some way in which we could suitably mark the fiftieth anniversary of Auschwitz.  An impromptu approach is not the way to proceed.  Perhaps we could have a discussion on this, but the House should find a way of marking the event.</P>
    <P>There are a number of requests for debates on specific foreign affairs issues. The reality is that we can do our best but we probably will not get to most of them between now and the end of the session.  I could explore the possibility of a kind of omnibus debate on foreign affairs where three or four issues could be combined in one debate.  Perhaps we will see if there is a way in which we can do that.</P>
    <P>On the issue of floods, looking at the pagodas on Leighlinbridge coming from Carlow I know exactly the extent of and the damage being caused by the floods in so many parts of the country.  We should have a debate on flooding as soon as possible and I will try to be more specific about that.  However, as Senator Townsend so wisely said, the excessive rainfall of the last couple of months is an act of God &mdash; wherever she is &mdash; and not something that we in this House could too easily deal with.  The debate should not turn into a fire fighting exercise.  The causes of flooding appear to be much more deep seated than that.  There appear to be long term planning and other issues which need to be addressed, and I suspect that our debate could be more useful in that context. I can give a commitment that we would have a debate on this issue next week and if I can arrange a debate earlier I will do so, but I believe Senators will agree that it is probably better to address the whole question of flooding in that wider context because there are, apparently, important ecological and other changes taking place.</P>
    <P>I apologise to Senator Fitzgerald with regard to the legislation in respect of harbours.  I do not have information on <Col N="1666" /> this issue, but any request from the Senator will be treated with the utmost dispatch.  There may have been some flaw in the drafting of the legislation but I will come back to him with full information on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the question of the franchise for emigrants, which I addressed, and Senator Daly raised the question of arterial drainage.  I got a bit ahead of myself last week in the House and I announced that there would be legislation on that matter fairly soon. Fortunately the Taoiseach caught up with me today in the other House.  He announced that there will be legislation on arterial drainage as soon as possible, but it could usefully be part of the wider debate I am proposing on the whole phenomenon of flooding.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis raised the issue of meningitis which I will discuss with the Minister.  It is a serious subject but I doubt if an immediate statement is possible. I will see what can be done on this matter.  Senator McGowan spoke about the National Roads Authority, which was frequently raised when we were on the other side of the House.  This is a serious issue.  I do not know how we can deal with it, but it is a subject which could benefit from an airing in the House; perhaps an arrangement could be made with the Whips or for Private Members' Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten mentioned the question of flooding, which I have covered, and Senator Mooney mentioned the new thinking on emigrants, which I have also covered.  On the issue of broadcasting, I have not spoken to the Minister on the Green Paper but I will convey the Senator's views.  A debate on this issue would be welcome in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the issue of the smaller urban areas.  I do not have an answer for the Senator but I will talk to him afterwards to see what can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great honour for me to have this opportunity to address this House for the first time as a Minister.  I am grateful to the Leader of the House for his kind words.  It is more correct to say that I have not yet graduated to the Seanad; it might come my way in time.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the Seanad on developments in the European Union as it faces a particularly challenging period.  The six monthly reports which the Government, under section 5 of the European Communities Act, makes to the Houses of the Oireachtas provide a useful account of recent developments in the Union.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that for the first time in several years these reports are up to date.  The Government's aim is that these reports should be available within three months of the end of each reporting period.  The period covered by the reports before the House today is July 1992 to June 1994, and it is intended that the report covering the last six months of 1994 will be published next month.</P>
      <P>Before going into detail on the substance of recent developments, I should first like to draw your attention to a recent change in the format of the six monthly reports.  The presentation of the reports has been overhauled to make them more user friendly and accessible.  An attempt has been made to ensure that the material included in the reports is concise, jargon free and more analytical.  The revision of the format, which was largely untouched since the reports first appeared in 1973, will help to ensure that information supplied to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the public in relation to developments in the European Union is transparent, comprehensive and relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period covered by the reports under debate today was one of the most significant in the history of the European Union.  It followed the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ending of the Cold War which transformed the political landscape of the whole continent of <Col N="1669" /> Europe.  Since 1989, the Union has been adapting to the new situations, coping with the new challenges and seeking to define its future role.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention some key themes which are reflected in the reports and which will influence the development of the Union in the years to the end of the century.  These themes might broadly be divided into the internal evolution of the Union and the challenges and opportunities which confront the Union externally.</P>
    <P>Internally, the focus of the Union's work has included, and will continue to include, the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty and the process leading up to the 1996 intergovernmental conference which will review the Treaty's provisions, the preparations for the third stage of economic and monetary union and the continuing efforts to deal with unemployment and securing of the competitive base of the Union.</P>
    <P>Externally, the Union's immediate concerns remain the development of its relations with the countries of central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean basin, and the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy on the basis of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>Within the Union, the past two years have, in part, been dominated by the political debate over the Maastricht Treaty and its ratification.  This debate was instructive as well as difficult and the lessons learned will be taken into account as the Union prepares once again to undertake a review of the treaties at the intergovernmental conference in 1996, preparation for which I have been given particular responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Governments now have a better appreciation of the absolute political necessity of retaining the support and understanding of their electorates for the development of European integration. There is also now a greater understanding of the need to bring the institutions of the Union closer to the citizen and to ensure that decisions taken at EU level, which affect the daily <Col N="1670" /> lives of all our citizens, enjoy widespread public support.</P>
    <P>In his first public statements as the new President of the Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer has placed great emphasis on ensuring that the citizens of the Union have faith in and support the development of integration.  I greatly welcome the importance he attaches to such issues as openness, transparency and the need for participation, as they are concerns which, I believe, are shared by the Irish people.  Indeed, this Government has attached a high priority to transparency at both national and European levels.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty, although much maligned and misunderstood by some, represents a very important milestone on the road to European integration. Nobody would claim that it is an elegant or easily comprehended document.  Its language is dense and the political compromises involved in obtaining agreement on its construction are complex.  President Havel has referred to it as a machine without a spirit. However, at the same time, the Treaty, while itself perhaps lacking in spirit, is a mechanism which enables the vision of European Union to live and accurately reflects the reality of the current political situation in Europe.</P>
    <P>Europe is inevitably a complex business. The differing views of the Governments of the member states about the future course of European integration, the complex historical relationships between the members of the Union and their differing political and legal traditions are not easily accommodated in a single Treaty.  It was, perhaps, inevitable that a Treaty as ambitious as Maastricht should result in a complex document. The Treaty is now in force and Governments are working to ensure that it is fully implemented.  Although the Treaty is in operation for less than 18 months, we are already preparing for an intergovernmental conference in 1996, which will review its provisions. Our citizens may wonder why we should be so eager to embark on yet another round of European constitutional building <Col N="1671" /> following the politically difficult Maastricht ratification process.</P>
    <P>When the Maastricht Treaty was signed, the European Union was still adjusting to the new political reality following the end of the Cold War.  The authors of the Treaty explicitly provided for the holding of a review conference in 1996 to deal with a variety of issues which some Governments believed were not fully resolved in the Maastricht negotiations.  These issues included the common foreign and security policy, the powers of the European Parliament and the structure of the Treaty.  In providing for a 1996 review of the Treaty, I suspect the authors did not appreciate the full importance which would become attached to the 1996 negotiations.</P>
    <P>Since the signing of the Treaty, events on the continent have moved more rapidly than any Government expected. The Union has concluded association agreements, called the Europe agreements, with several central and east European states.  These agreements recognise the ambition of these countries to become members of the Union. The Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 took a number of important decisions.  It recognised that the associated countries that so desire shall become members of the Union as soon as they are able to assume the obligations of membership.  The council also provided for the establishment of a structured dialogue between the Union and the countries of central and eastern Europe on a broad range of political and economic issues.  The Essen European Council in December 1994 developed the framework for this dialogue which is intended to be wide ranging and ambitious.</P>
    <P>The Union now politically accepts that the further enlargement to the east is inevitable, as well as desirable.  Much work will, however, have to take place, both within the Union and the applicant states, before accession of the countries becomes a reality.  I wish to place some emphasis on the fact that the evolution of the European Union has come about <Col N="1672" /> as a result of what happened on the European continent in the first half of this century.  In the second half of the century, there has been peace, largely because of the European Union and its forerunners.</P>
    <P>When we think about the Union in terms of prosperity we must also remember we cannot have prosperity without peace.  As we look at the new emerging democracies in central and eastern Europe, we must recall the objectives of the Union and we in turn must be sure to keep the spirit of the founders of the Union alive and well.</P>
    <P>The 1996 intergovernmental conference, which had been intended in some areas at least as a wrapping up exercise to address some unresolved issues in the Treaty, is now seen as the arena where the institutional adaptations to the Union required for a future enlargement will be examined.  It is the prospect of a future enlargement of the Union which might increase its size to between 20 and 30 States which adds to the significance of a new round of Treaty negotiations in 1996.</P>
    <P>The agenda of the intergovernmental conference is now also likely to include such issues as the weighting of votes in the Council, the size and future role of the Commission and the powers of the European Parliament.  There may also be proposals about the overall organisation of European integration, which in the view of some might include a multispeed approach, variable geometry or an inner core, to use the jargon.  Such proposals are prompted by the view that a Union of 20 or more member states with different levels of economic development and different views of the future of European integration may only make progress if those member states in a political and economic position to advance are permitted to move ahead towards a common objective.</P>
    <P>Although the formal opening of the negotiations on this Treaty review are a year away, preparations at the Union level for the 1996 intergovernmental conference will begin in earnest over the coming months.  The European Council <Col N="1673" /> meeting at Corfu in June 1994 agreed to establish a reflection group of personal representatives of Foreign Ministers and the President of the Commission to prepare the agenda of the intergovernmental conference.  The reflection group, which will also include two representatives of the European Parliament, will begin meeting in June 1995 under a Spanish chairperson.</P>
    <P>The European Council also invited the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to establish separate reports on the functioning of the Treaty on European Union.  These reports will serve as inputs to the work of the reflection group.  The preparation of the Council's report on the operation of the Treaty will be finalised under the current French Presidency.  It is obvious, therefore, that the timetable for the intergovernmental conference has been established and that preparations at European Union level are already under way.</P>
    <P>I might note at this point that as Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union in the second half of 1996 we will have the task of chairing the intergovernmental conference during this crucial period.  Given the complexity of the intergovernmental conference's agenda and the political sensitivity of its discussions, chairing the intergovernmental conference will be one of our major Presidency priorities. Preparations on the development of our policy position in relation to the inter governmental conference are under way.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that there are both internal and external challenges facing the Union. While the intergovernmental conference is obviously an internal challenge, its discussions will be heavily influenced by the external challenge of enlargement.  The Union must first agree on the internal institutional reforms necessary to safeguard its continuing effectiveness and efficiency if it is to embrace successfully a further round of enlargements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> The working methods of the Union were devised for a community of six. They are stretched in a Union of 15 and could become even more cumbersome in a Union of over 20.  Obviously any negotiations about the reform of the institutions of the Union and their working methods could have serious implications for smaller member states such as Ireland.  We will contribute to the discussions at the intergovernmental conference constructively and positively based on our long experience as a small member state committed to European integration.</P>
    <P>The policy programme of the Government of Renewal points out that in the next century Ireland will develop a deeper and more complex relationship with Europe, no longer primarily as beneficiaries of funding.  It is with this prospect in mind that we are developing our approach to the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>An inevitable focus of successive Irish Governments in the European Union has been the achievement of economic and social cohesion.  We have successfully sought to ensure that the disparities in economic development between the different states in the Union were progressively reduced.  In the negotiations of the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty Ireland took a leading role in the discussions on the cohesion chapter which now provides the Treaty basis for the Community's policies in this area.</P>
    <P>The achievement of economic and social cohesion in the European Union is recognised as a pillar of European construction and will remain of crucial importance to us.  It is not a gift; it is a right.  It is part of the balance of equity which ensures that the Union serves the interests of all.</P>
    <P>In addressing the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference we need to think in very broad terms about the development of European integration, the institutions upon which such integration is founded and the future course of the European Union.  As a long standing member of the Union we must contribute <Col N="1675" /> to the political and intellectual debate about the type of Union which will enter the next millennium.</P>
    <P>While the negotiations at the 1996 intergovernmental conference will be a major item on the Union's internal agenda they are by no means the only internal challenge.  The Maastricht Treaty sets out in great detail the three stage process for the achievement of economic and monetary union.  We are now in the second stage of this process. The European Union, quite possibly at the European Council in Dublin in December 1996, will have to decide whether the move to the third and final stage of union should take place in 1997. If a decision is not taken to move ahead to European Monetary Union in 1997, those member states meeting the entry criteria will automatically enter the third stage in 1999.</P>
    <P>The past two years saw a deep recession accompanied by currency turmoil and a sharp increase in unemployment across the Union.  However, the Union's rapid emergence from recession and its continued determination to overcome its structural obstacles to the creation of employment have restored confidence in the European Monetary Union project.</P>
    <P>The Government, in its Programme for Renewal, explicitly accepts the public debt philosophy and targets set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  Indeed, only two member states, Ireland and Luxembourg, were accepted by the Commission under the excessive debt procedure as meeting the Treaty's fiscal criteria in 1994.  As we approach the Treaty deadlines for decision making in relation to European Monetary Union I look forward to greater public awareness of the challenges and opportunities which lie ahead of us.</P>
    <P>The Union has recently experienced a deep economic recession.  The scale of the job losses suffered during this downturn in the economic cycle was horrendous and unacceptable.  The fight against unemployment has become the Union's priority, has been the focus of <Col N="1676" /> debate at successive European Councils and is listed as the first priority of the French Presidency.  The Commission's White Paper on Growth.  Competitiveness and Employment forms the basis of the Union's approach to dealing with the key issues of unemployment and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>While many of the instruments which must be used in the fight against unemployment lie in the hands of national governments rather than the Union, a coherent Union approach to the issue is essential.  At a political level we are aware that people across the Union expect the governments represented at the Council of Ministers to work together to overcome the debilitating and corrosive effects of unemployment. There is a clear appreciation that the Union as a whole must tackle the issue which cannot be solved by member states acting individually.</P>
    <P>The Union is not responsible for the unemployment problem &mdash; on the contrary. However, to some extent the public's faith in the Union has become linked to its efforts to deal with unemployment and growth.  A Union which is seen to be ineffectual in such a key area which so closely affects the daily lives of our citizens would be harshly judged.  At the same time, of course, the governments of the member states must not abdicate their responsibilities in economic policy or seek to blame the Union, as there may be a tendency to do, for their domestic economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Union in this area reflects the consensus of the member states on how to proceed.  The White Paper emphasises the need for training, for investment in infrastructure and key technologies, for appropriate deregulation and for the creation of a domestic and social climate which is favourable rather than inimical to job creation.</P>
    <P>Much of the White Paper is written in the perspective of the enormous challenge which the Union faces from the rapidly industrialising economies of the developing world.  The global transformation of trade has already had an impact on the economies of the Union and will <Col N="1677" /> assume even greater importance in the years to come.  Ireland, as a small open economy highly dependent on both exports and a high level of foreign investment, is greatly exposed to the globalisation of trade and the rapid exchanges which are taking place.  We share the White Paper's strong emphasis on the need for the Union to take action to secure its competitive base.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the White Paper's recommendations at both Union and national level is the key priority for the Union.  Without a firm economic foundation the future development of the Union will not have earned the necessary support from its citizens.</P>
    <P>The Union now also confronts a series of major foreign policy challenges arising from the new political and security situation in Europe, the situation in former Yugoslavia, the development of relations with Russia and instability and the challenge to human rights in many regions of the world.  With the coming into effect of the Maastricht Treaty on 1 November 1993, the new common foreign and security policy replaced European political co-operation.  The CFSP extends and develops EPC in several respects, in particular by setting out objectives for the European Union in the international area, by providing for more systematic co-operation between the member states and developing the concept of joint action.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the CFSP include the preservation of peace, the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights.  These are issues which have traditionally been central to Irish foreign policy and participation in the CFSP enables us to pursue these objectives more effectively at international level.  The first year or so of the CFSP has seen a record of solid achievements. Six joint actions have been adopted and the Union is pursuing a concerted policy in relation to the main foreign policy issues such as former Yugoslavia and the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Some disappointment has been expressed nevertheless about the impact <Col N="1678" /> of the Maastricht Treaty procedures on the effectiveness of the EU's foreign policy.  It was inevitable, however, that time would be required to develop and acquire experience of the Maastricht Treaty in the foreign area.  Where the Union has been the target of particular criticism, as with former Yugoslavia, it has to be appreciated that the Union is not acting in isolation.  The complex nature of internal conflict such as that in former Yugoslavia has challenged all international organisations and states which have been involved in the search for a solution.  The EU has contributed significantly to such progress as has been made, particularly in regard to humanitarian efforts.</P>
    <P>Ireland is an active and constructive participant in the CFSP.  We have contributed to the implementation of several of the joint actions with personnel and financially.  I would mention, in particular, the sending of observers to the elections in Russia and South Africa and the financial contribution towards the costs of the EU administration of Mostar.  We welcome the progress which has been made on developing procedures for improving the functioning of the CFSP.  Ireland is keen to ensure that the Union follows a forward looking pro-active foreign policy with the greatest possible coherence between action taken by the Union and the member states.</P>
    <P>Austria, Finland and Sweden joined the EU on 1 January this year.  We warmly welcome the contribution which they will make to the CFSP.  They will bring particular expertise and skills in relation to certain policy areas, such as central and eastern Europe, Russia and Bosnia.</P>
    <P>As part of the pre-accession strategy for the associated states of central and eastern Europe, arrangements have been made to facilitate an increase in the level and quality of political dialogue with these countries.  These primarily involve regular and intensive dialogue at both ministerial and official level and the opportunity for the central and eastern European countries to <Col N="1679" /> associate themselves with EU statements, démarches and joint actions.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the publication of a White Paper on foreign policy this year.  To prepare for the White Paper a series of public seminars on different aspects of Irish foreign policy are being held at different venues around the country.  The purpose of these seminars is to give people an opportunity to express their views on the key foreign policy issues confronting Ireland.  If we are to receive full public support for the conduct of our foreign policy it is essential that we are fully aware of the views of ordinary citizens and that they should develop a sense of ownership of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I participated at a seminar on the European Union on Saturday, 28 January, at the University of Limerick.  The discussions ranged over many of the key issues confronting the Union, including the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, future enlargement and economic and monetary union.  I was very impressed by the level of public interest, understanding and concern about these issues and the level of participation in the debate.</P>
    <P>Among the many interesting points which were raised at the seminar.  I noted the strong public interest in the need for greater participation in matters relating to the European Union.  The distance between decision making in Brussels and the citizen is obviously greater than it should be.  The Government is determined to ensure that that distance is bridged.</P>
    <P>The debate today is a further opportunity to discuss the issues confronting the Union and to obtain the particularly important input of Members of the Seanad.  In the coming months as work on the White Paper advances, the Government is committed to developing the public discussion on European affairs.  The decisions we as a nation have to take in the coming years are of enormous importance to everyone in this country and indeed to future generations.  I, therefore, welcome this <Col N="1680" /> debate on developments in the European Union.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his outline on developments in the EU during the period in question. However, I wonder if we should be discussing developments in the EU during that period because it appears to me and to many others that there have been more negative aspects than developments. Going back to the beginning of the ECSC, Churchill said: &ldquo;I love France and Belgium but we must not allow ourselves to be pulled down to that level.&rdquo;  Some countries in Europe believe they are being pulled down to the level of others and a difference of opinion is emerging between leaders of EU members states in this regard.</P>
      <P>We are discussing these developments at a time of chaos.  Despite the ending of the Cold War, smaller conflicts have developed throughout the world which have an horrific impact on these areas.  We are also discussing these developments at a time when the leadership in the United States has been weakened &mdash; a leadership which does not seem to know where it is going.  It would appear that China does not know whether to go back to the old Maoist way of thinking or to develop into a modern, technological state.  This has not been helped by the aging leadership in China.  Japan also faces leadership problems as incidents of corruption in government arise almost on a daily basis, not to mention on a cyclical one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Mitterrand of France is soon to leave office and it is believed that Mr. Balladur will be the next President. Economists have said Mr. Balladur &ldquo;has all the charisma of an inter office memo.&rdquo;  It has been suggested that that might also be said of John Major.  Italy has also faced scandals and problems in relation to Mr. Berlusconi, <Col N="1681" /> the former Italian Prime Minister. Indeed, there have been problems throughout Europe; it does not seem to know where it wants to go.</P>
    <P>Europe faces a number of challenges. The most important is how to absorb the large number of countries which want to join the EU.  In recent months three countries successfully acceded to the EU.  It was easy for the EU to allow this to happen because these countries are highly developed economically and technologically.  There was no cost involved to the EU in allowing them to join because they would be net contributors. Problems, however, arise when countries which are not as economically developed want to join the EU.</P>
    <P>The reunification of Germany and the inclusion of former eastern European states in an economic union with the rest of western Europe have posed problems for the EU.  While there are major advantages in developing links with former eastern European countries, we also face challenges which must be dealt with sensitively.  Firms in Ireland are losing out because of cheaper labour in eastern Europe. Many jobs will be transferred from western Europe, including Ireland, to eastern Europe as long as wage rates there remain low.  It is now easy to move capital from one country or from one continent to another if that is what the market demands in terms of labour costs and machinery.</P>
    <P>Europe has not confronted the issue of unemployment.  Over the past ten years unemployment has increased throughout Europe.  If there is to be any basis for economic union, the EU must address unemployment.  We are told this country is doing well on a macro-economic level, but there is no point telling that to people who are out of work. While jobs are available for our young people, to whom we refer as the best educated in Europe, they are not available in Ireland.  Although there is an upward swing in the economy at present, jobs are not being created.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately over the past ten years our best graduates have emigrated and <Col N="1682" /> are working in companies which are doing well.  They probably will not come back or, if they do, they will have a good reason for doing so.  In many cases, they will have to be given adequate payment for their work.  There is no doubt most of them would come back if their salaries were commensurate with what they are getting abroad and if the tax rates were not so high because many of them probably have not yet married.  This means that they would be taxed at a higher rate than if they were resident in most other countries.</P>
    <P>The weaknesses of the leadership in Europe are there and because of that, I am afraid the European Union will not succeed as we would like in the next number of years.  If it did succeed, one would expect all our people would benefit from it.</P>
    <P>The French once again seem to want to bring variable geometry into the equation by creating a three-tier Europe. That three-tier Europe would even accommodate the British, despite its opt out clauses.  It has been said that Britain opts out of any of the difficult decisions. If this variable geometry is brought into place, possibly creating a three-tier Europe, the first tier would be led by the French and the Germans, with Britain possibly being dragged along; the second tier would consist of the reasonably well developed countries while the smaller countries and those which would not, in the opinion of Germany and France, be able to maintain themselves in this fast lane, would make up the third tier.  However, it has been proved that Ireland is one of the few countries which, on macro-economic terms, would be able to cope in the fast lane.</P>
    <P>Has the European Union provided us with a single free market for goods? There is possibly a single free market for food, but there is still a huge divergence between the VAT rates in the various countries.  From an Irish point of view, we are non-competitive in many areas because of our transport problems, VAT, higher insurance and various other costs.  Until these costs are <Col N="1683" /> taken into account, one cannot say that we are on a level playing field with the other countries.</P>
    <P>The Irish people, in a recent survey, apparently did suggest that we would agree to a single currency; we are one of the few nations that would.  The only possible advantage would be that we could deal in our goods and services in a single currency across borders without having to pay banks and currency dealers a percentage every time we shifted goods.  While there would be a diminution of sovereignty, in a sense, by agreeing to a single currency, nevertheless, there are advantages that should be taken into account.  Is there a guarantee of democracy throughout the European Union?  There is a sense of democracy, but the whole of Europe is not truly democratic, any more than it was before the advent of the EU.</P>
    <P>Europe is staggering around trying to find some means of helping when emergencies occur outside the Union. We do not have a joint foreign policy on aid, NATO and the United Nations.  As a result, the Union staggers from one problem to another.  If fire brigade action has to be taken, such as helping the people in Chechnya for example, it is impossible to do it.  I do not think we will ever see a single joint foreign policy developing.  We will be fighting about it after 1996 and into the next century.  It is not possible for an amalgam of what will be 20 nations to have a joint foreign policy, nor would I wish it to be so.  The idea of a joint foreign policy implies a federal state, which does not lie too easy on my conscience or in my psyche. There must be independence in the area of foreign policy.  If there is not a certain amount of independence, one will get a consensus view at EU level on foreign policy issues.  Generally speaking, a consensus means that the people who are most anxious to get something done in a certain area will have their position downgraded, there will be a slight upgrading of the position on the opposite side and we will get nowhere. <Col N="1684" /> Consensus does not help the person one is trying to help.</P>
    <P>When eastern European countries in the former USSR wanted to become separate nations, they suggested that the UN allow them declare themselves as separate entities.  The Ingushetian people decided to stay in the CIS and the Chechens decided they would not. The world did not allow the Chechens to stay outside the CIS.  It is stated that there was a democratic vote taken in the Russian Parliament, that this was agreed to by the CIS and that Chechnya would not be allowed to separate.  Of course, the Chechen people are now feeling the brunt of that decision, which was not a democratic one because the Chechens had decided they wanted to opt out.  If countries which were part of former Yugoslavia can opt out under international rules, why were the people of Chechnya not allowed to do the same?</P>
    <P>While the Government has sent messages to the Russians telling them to stop the massacres there, we should ask ourselves why these people were not allowed the freedom to set up their own independent state.  It should be obvious to anybody why certain bigger states do not want separation especially when the main gas and oil pipelines are laid across that country &mdash; from central Russia into western Europe.  There is also oil in that region.  When one considers the economic benefits which flow from the supply of oil and gas, I am afraid fair play does not come into the equation.</P>
    <P>In Europe, over the past 18 months in particular, we have been talking about peace in the Middle East.  Much play was made on the Declaration of Principles signed between Israel and the Palestinians.  There is no doubt that the people who signed those documents were honest in recognising the differences between them and the major problems confronting the Israelis and the Palestinians.  However, neither would have signed the Declaration of Principles if it were not for the fact that the European Union, America, Japan and the northern states which are not part of the European Union promised <Col N="1685" /> huge inputs of money into the Middle East peace process.  To date, the amount of money transferred from the western world to the peace process is negligible and, as a result, we are seeing a horrific upsurge in violence in that area.</P>
    <P>We must absolutely and without reservation say that the bombing of the buses last week in Israel, the shooting of the Palestinian policemen in Gaza and the violence against the Palestinians who were peacefully protesting against settlers, are but the start of problems which will continue unless the western world comes up with the money it promised to provide for the peace process. The pledges in the 1994-2000 economic plan amounted to $14 billion.  As far as I know, up to last September when I was in Gaza, only $7.5 million had been paid.  A police force and an administration was to be set up.  The western world and the European Union has reneged on its promises and, as a result, the conflict is on a much larger scale than it was before the signing of the Declaration of Principles.</P>
    <P>If one looks at what the EU has done to provide aid for developing countries in northern Africa, one would ask if the problems in Algeria would be as severe if economic aid was provided or if the French, in particular, had allowed the last Algerian election to take place peacefully and the almost democratically elected Muslim led group to take power rather than imposing a military solution.  There is no doubt that France has a major part to play in that area and that if it had allowed the democratically elected Government to take office, the Islamic extremists in Algeria would not be as strong as they are now and the violence that is now taking place in Algeria would be much less.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland must look at our attitude to the Western European Union, its objectives, its relationship with NATO and the former eastern European States.  The general objectives of the Union are the preservation of democracy and the protection of democratic <Col N="1686" /> values against the threats of collectivities, States and criminal organisations who apply violence to achieve unjust and illegal goals.</P>
    <P>To try to eliminate the threats posed to Europe by ethnic and economic tension, fundamentalism in north Africa and our lack of following through with the promises we make in international fora &mdash; I am speaking about Europe as a whole &mdash; we have supposedly a United Nations which up to now was reasonably able to deal with problems.  After a certain length of time, a peace-keeping group could be sent to an area but there has been a change in the UN in the past number of years.  It is now talking about peace enforcement.  They were very poor at peace-keeping but they are worse at peace enforcement.  Unless the UN develops a cohesive policy, the pretence that its forces are peace-keepers or peace enforcers will have to change.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that in every specific area UN peace-keeping efforts have been of no value.  The UNIFIL operation has been of value in southern Lebanon and I am delighted that Irish battalions through the years have played their part there.  If the UN had the guts to clear southern Lebanon of the Israeli led criminal groups, there would be no need for UNIFIL.  According to UN Resolutions the Israelis should have been gone from there since 1984.</P>
    <P>The criterion of membership of the EU &mdash; this is what people at the centre are now saying &mdash; is that countries must bring themselves up to the standards of the existing members and they will then be considered for membership.  When we asked to join we were given time and aid to develop certain areas of our economy. We were given aid to help bring us to a reasonable standard so that we could compete in Europe.  The rules now seem to be changing and the EU is telling applicant countries to reach our standards and they will then be allowed join.  That is completely against the <i>raison d'être</i> of a European Union.  The EU must play a bigger part in attempting to negotiate between warring <Col N="1687" /> parties in problem areas close to or within Europe, such as Italy, Slovenia, Greece and Turkey.  There are various internal and external crises which could be resolved if there was the will in the EU but this does not seem to be there. As long as this is so problems will continue to exist.</P>
    <P>There are other major items not being confronted by the Union.  I am being very negative but in the time allowed I might as well be negative and let somebody else be positive.  If I started to outline the good things, I might forget some of the bad things which are happening, and it is better to talk about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to be a pessimist to become an optimist.  We have major problems in Europe in terms of emigration and I am afraid they will not go away.  They are causing horrendous tensions in the bigger cities of western Europe.  The inward swing of people from Africa and eastern Europe is caused by the difference in the standards of living in Africa and eastern European and in the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is talk about harmonisation of laws relating to emigrants and immigrants. They should look at the way immigrants are treated in cities like Paris and Brussels, in the major German cities and in Holland.  It is a growing problem.  The open borders to the east present another problem that has to be confronted because of the huge amount of drugs that are coming in.  The open border theory is grand, but when it comes down to policing or eliminating the major drug problem we have, we will have to examine carefully how we can deal with the open border principle. In Europe we will have to take a stronger attitude on environmental issues as a result of the reunification of Germany on the one hand and the development of the economies of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the east.  Such economies are <Col N="1688" /> not up to the required environmental standards and it will take a long time before they can be brought into harmony with standards in the West.  In general western environmental standards are reasonable but they are not as good as they should be.</P>
    <P>For democracy to succeed throughout Europe there must be a harmonisation of living conditions not alone in terms of the amount of money people earn but also in terms of environmental protection. There is a downturn in the great expectations people had about what the European Union would bring to us and to everybody else within Europe.  We are failing because of lack of real leadership in the centre of Europe, and the danger is that while the Union will not split apart fully, there could be a tiered Europe.  The dangers of such a Europe for us in Ireland would be more harmful than for most of the other states on the European continent.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for having an early debate on what is happening in Europe and I am glad, as he said, that developments in the European Union are going to be consumer friendly.  But I am afraid that this pamphlet is not consumer friendly &mdash; they have changed the colour but kept the printing style the same and without a précis.  It is good for a library but not much good for a working politician and is definitely not what I would consider to be an upgrading of PR or presentation technology.  You just do not change the colour and use the same print style.  Some technical words have to be used in any document from the Government Publications Office but the language could be made more user friendly.  I hope the Minister will examine how this can be done.</P>

      <P>That is where some of our education was obtained.  I wish him every success in what is a very important Ministry and the first of its kind.  The affairs of the European Union will have an important part to play in his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are debating the reports for the period from July 1992 to July 1994.  To some extent I accept Senator Lanigan's point that one has to go right through some of these reports to obtain different facts and summaries.  In his address the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, said he intended to update, improve and modernise the information, making it more accessible.  If he succeeds in that it will be important for everybody.  The civil servants who prepare such documents should appreciate that facts should be presented in a readily available manner. This would give elected representatives an opportunity to analyse the points outlined so that they can make decisions.  It would also benefit the media in furnishing information to the general public in a readable way.  It is essential that the public can understand <Col N="1690" /> whatever documents, facts or figures are presented.</P>
    <P>To date we have not succeeded in making the European Union consumer friendly for the general public.  Of the various referenda that have taken place on entry into Europe, Ireland's has probably seen the largest majority of any country.  In other countries where referenda have since taken place voting results have been close and in some instances the results have been so narrow as to cause concern.  One country actually rejected the application for EU membership made by the Government. That demonstrates the necessity for people to be able to feel that they know what is happening in Europe.  A majority of people here are, at present, in favour of European integration, but that majority is certainly not increasing.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of warning signs and the general public are at least asking questions about Europe.  There is no point in having people lull themselves into a false sense of security.  It is important to bear in mind that many people are asking questions.  A considerable number of people are dissatisfied with Europe and we have to ensure that this trend is not allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The 1996 intergovernmental conference is intended to review the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and their implementation.  It is important that this intergovernmental conference goes ahead and that there will at least be an opportunity to see what progress has been made under the Maastricht Treaty.  This will allow people and Governments an opportunity to go through the benefits which resulted from the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>On the outcome of whatever discussions take place at the Intergovernmental Conference, a decision will be made regarding enlargement and allowing other countries from central and eastern Europe to join.  My party have always been absolutely committed to European Union.  The party was absolutely committed under former Deputy Liam Cosgrave, then Leader of the Opposition, when this matter first <Col N="1691" /> arose.  Since Seán Lemass was Taoiseach through to the present day we have been supportive of entry into the European Union.  We continue to be actively and positively interested in the European Union and integration. However, if after the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference we allow in countries from eastern and central European, we as a nation will have to be careful in any decisions we make about further enlargement.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there are bureaucratic and organisational considerations. The existence of 15 member states already appears to be quite cumbersome. Allowing in additional countries will cause great problems for the Community. I want to go a stage further.  We have an important interest in further enlargement because one of the main reasons Ireland joined the European Union was our agricultural exports.  In the event of further enlargement of the European Union and the admission of states from central and eastern European, we will find that many of these states will be in competition with us.</P>
    <P>These states will also seek some of the funding we obtain for our agricultural produce and community.  With the scarcity of resources, there is a real danger that our farming community will suffer because of the admission of new countries.  The Irish economy depends to a considerable extent on our export of agricultural produce.  If there is to be a reduction or dilution in Structural Funds and a diminution in agricultural assistance and aid, our economy will be damaged considerably.</P>
    <P>It is also important to bear in mind that we are an island off the coast of Europe.  Our peripheral nature means we have to place before our fellow member states the facts of the situation and the necessity that we protect our vital national interest, which could be seriously affected and damaged in the event of other member states being allowed in.  That is not to say that I am against the admission of new member states.  Why should it be 15?  Why not 17 <Col N="1692" /> or 14?  However, we have to be careful in whatever negotiations take place in the future regarding the admission of new members.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other important issues.  At both local and national level, I encounter considerable criticism of the implementation of rules, regulations and decisions taken in Europe.  A considerable amount of criticism has been levelled at the area of the preparation of food, including bread, cakes, confectionery, biscuits, jam, meat.</P>
    <P>Our health boards, local authorities and various Government Departments have been implementing rules and regulations which result in the imposition of what can only be described as a bureaucratic heap of red tape on people who are trying to conduct their business, make a living for themselves, their wives and families and provide a service for their community.  Through red tape of one type or another many small businesses, family businesses and small industries have been closed down.</P>
    <P>I have seen this particularly affect bakers.  Small family bakeries have come in for considerable scrutiny from local authorities and health boards. Small family butcher shops have been similarly affected.  I know of one butcher who had to make three different changes in his shop following hygiene regulations and so on.  After carrying out works as directed he was again asked to change his premises.  The person is since deceased, but the stress and strain from the local authority caused him a considerable amount of problems.</P>
    <P>I have visited a number of cities, including London, Paris and Rome.  I have seen food, including meat and vegetables, sold openly on the streets and nobody taking any action, and rightly so.  I looked at the products on sale and thought they were well presented, clean and hygienic.  However, if there is to be one law for people conducting business in Ireland, there should be a similar law for everybody else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> Those regulations are doing much damage to the image of Europe.  Laws have to be couched in a manner which complies with commonsense.  Some of the regulations and the manner in which they have been enforced defy commonsense. I have seen many butcher's shops, small shops and people in business close down.  It is not good enough and it is not right.  Similar regulations are not being applied across Europe.  Regulations should be applied in a fair manner everywhere.  It is important to place that on record.</P>
    <P>Governments more or less say that all the good things coming from Europe are wonderful and that the benefits were obtained through their hard work. However, when anything bad happens, they blame Europe.  Laws should reflect a nation's culture and identity and they should not be brought in from Europe if they do not comply with the identity and culture of the people.  I discussed at length and opposed the Road Traffic Act, 1993, because many of its terms were wrong.  However, the Government at the time thought it was complying with European regulations and law, but in my opinion it was not.  While we strictly implement European laws, rules and regulations other countries do not. We should be more sensible in our approach to the implementation of laws. We have our own culture and independence but we are still proud to be members of the European Union.  When people come to visit Ireland and meet the Irish people, we should ensure that they recognise our identity and culture which allows us to be distinctive.  We should not allow ourselves to be consumed into a European stew where everyone is the same.  We must retain our own identity.</P>
    <P>The jobs situation continues to be a serious matter for everyone.  We need to question why so many important traditional industries are closing, including the textiles and motor industries.  Many social schemes are assisted by Europe and are of considerable benefit to our country, but we need to examine why so many established industries have closed <Col N="1694" /> and how the remainder can be kept open and made viable.  That is not to say that we should push money into industries which are unable to survive, but we must ensure that every effort is made to keep industries, which could be viable, open, during periods of recession and competition.  Something must be done to prevent these closures.  It must be remembered that there are many black spots in our cities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for western development.  Deputy Carey, has been appointed to look after the western seaboard and I wish him well in that onerous and challenging task.  I come from County Offaly and we face the same challenges as the Minister faces on the western seaboard.  South, south-west, west and mid-Offaly suffer from emigration, depopulation, large scale unemployment and low incomes. A number of our industries, including the ESB and Bord na Móna, are experiencing many difficulties as a result of competition and considerable debts.  I ask the Minister to see if he can extend his brief to cover parts of Offaly and other areas along the Shannon, that will probably be the cut-off point.  I am not making a parochial point but he might be able to assist other areas east of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The level of depopulation in parts of the west has been alarming.  We have not seen such large numbers of people leaving since the Famine.  Villages and towns in parts of France and Italy have ceased to exist as a result of depopulation. There is a great challenge facing the European Commission, the European Parliament and the structures of the European Union when one sees the total depopulation of these areas.  We must make an effort so to make these communities viable and address this problem.  Many cities are overcrowded, yet there are serious problems of depopulation in the country.  We must try to strike a balance.  The reports we are discussing this evening do not fully address or suggest answers to these problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> This afternoon I said we should have a proper debate on Chechnya.  We discussed the former Yugoslavia at different times, but the European Union has not succeeded in finding positive solutions to the problems in these European countries.  As regards Chechnya, it is sad to see a country being invaded and its people attacked, mutilated and killed, while others stand by and do not take action or provide assistance.  Might should not be allowed to walk over innocent people.  This is a test to see if the European Union intends to take action.  If the European Union had stated that it would make more positive efforts than lodging protests and imposing embargoes, it might have made President Yeltsin and other members of the Russian Government stop and think before they took action. More clear and concise policy decisions should be made by the European Union when it is confronted with such problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Senator Lanigan covered a wide range of issues in their speeches.  This is an important debate on four reports.  I wish the new Government well in its task and in the intergovernmental conference in the second half of 1996.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell a story to relax the proceedings. Almost two years ago I was at a conference on the far side of the Atlantic. One of the speakers in the small group, not unlike this House, was the former British Prime Minister, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, who gave her views in a forthright <Col N="1696" /> manner as she tends to do.  She spoke about her views on Europe, among other things.  When she had finished she asked us for our views.  I told her I disagreed with her on Europe.  I asked her to suppose that in the 1770s in Philadelphia, when Madison, Jefferson and others drew up the US Constitution, they had decided to have 13 individual states, each with its own passport, immigration laws and currency.  I asked her if that had happened whether we would have unity and a strong nation in the USA, as we have today.</P>
    <P>I thought I had done a marvellous job and asked the right question, but Lady Thatcher did not take kindly to it.  She said the position was not the same because the people of the United States had gone there of their own free will, instilled with enthusiasm, effort and drive in an ambition to create that nation, not like the bureaucrats of Europe who sat in Brussels dreaming up red tape for the rest of us.</P>
    <P>The discussion went on and I felt slightly squashed.  However, the man beside me was Mr. Vernon Jordan, a tall man &mdash; rather taller than the man beside me now.  Senator Lee &mdash; and probably the most prominent black lawyer in the United States.  At that time he was chairman of the Clinton administration transition committee.  Mr. Jordan stood to his feet and, speaking in a strong voice, told Lady Thatcher not everyone came to America of his own free will.</P>
    <P>I tell the story because it is a reminder to us of the different views on Europe. Lady Thatcher and the British have one view, which not everyone shares.  In America a strong unified force emerged but it did not come easily; it came from long debates, many changes and a number of amendments to the US Constitution. Although the focus of this debate is recent developments in the EU, I will use those developments to talk about future developments.  In particular I will discuss the challenges we face next year from the Intergovernmental Conference to re-assess and revise the Maastricht Treaty.  Next year <Col N="1697" /> may seem a long time away but we have no time to lose if we are to avoid the cardinal mistake made at the time of Maastricht, which nearly sank the project. That was the virtual absence of discussion in the member states in advance of the treaty negotiations and the total lack of consultation with the broad mass of citizens of Europe.</P>
    <P>We should remind ourselves of the trouble this approach caused.  The negotiations on the treaty were handed over to people who thought they only had to please themselves.  As they went about their horse-trading they clearly gave no thought to how the finished product would look &mdash; whether it would hold together in a cohesive way, whether it would be readily understood by the citizens of Europe, whether there was enough in the treaty to create growing enthusiasm for the European ideal.  All negotiations result in compromise, but most negotiators who have a constituency to whom they report realise they must be able to sell such a compromise to their constituents.  The Maastricht negotiators did not realise they were ultimately responsible to an increasingly discerning constituency throughout Europe.  They produced a compromise which proved extremely difficult to sell.</P>
    <P>In presentational terms we ended up with legalism gone mad.  Those of us who read the treaty, who persevered diligently until the end, were even more confused after our reading than before &mdash; at least I was.  We were asked to understand and judge not a self-contained treaty setting out a new order but a hodge-podge of amendments to the Treaty of Rome.  Its structure was anything but user-friendly, to use a computer term, and the language used was obscurantist, foggy, ambiguous, vague and quite difficult to grasp.</P>
    <P>At the best of times this would have caused difficulties itself, but they were added to by the fact that the people of Europe were not being consulted in advance.  Most of them knew nothing about what was happening until the final negotiations, when the end of the <Col N="1698" /> process was revealed and Maastricht emerged fully-fledged into the public consciousness, the people having played no part in its evolution.</P>
    <P>This was the central reason for the problems which beset the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; the lack of involvement by European citizens and the lack of any consultation or discussion in advance where ratification by referendum was required.  The electorate were presented with a pig in a poke; in effect, the people were asked to rubber stamp a highly complex and often contentious proposal in its entirety.</P>
    <P>We all know what happened.  The Danes rejected it, at least the first time; the French only passed it by a fraction of 1 per cent; and ratification was equally difficult in several national parliaments. In our case we passed the treaty with a comfortable majority.  Just under 70 per cent of the Irish people voted yes.  However, it would be foolish to expect a similar response on the next occasion.  The stakes are getting higher all the time and the advantages of EU membership for Ireland are more in the balance as time goes on.  Despite the high vote for approval many people feel they were railroaded into the treaty and will look far more critically at the proposals the next time.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, just as across Europe as a whole, we must take a different approach to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.  We must start discussing the matter now and familiarise people with the options up for discussion.  We do not have to hammer out a detailed negotiating position in advance &mdash; that would simply not be practical &mdash; but the negotiating positions of Ireland and of other countries should emerge against a background of a good public awareness of the many complex issues involved.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I was delighted with the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell.  I welcome him into his new position.  I was interested to hear the number of seminars he plans to hold and I was encouraged by the attendance at the <Col N="1699" /> seminar in Limerick last month.  It is this type of discussion and interest that we should encourage.  If we do not involve the people of Europe in advance the project is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>That in itself would be a major tragedy for Europe in general and Ireland especially.  Europe must continue to grow and develop and can only do that by constantly evolving its institutions. Each step in that evolution can be a small one, provided it is a step forward. If there is no progress &mdash; or, even worse, if there is a stepping back from earlier commitments to progress &mdash; the European ideal will stagnate and perhaps even crumble.</P>
    <P>It has been a problem for Europe from the beginning that what was the EC and is now the EU has always been too remote from those it serves.  We are now beginning to experience the consequences of that.  There is a widespread backlash against too much centralisation and bureaucracy and a lack of genuine democratic involvement in the decision making processes of the EU.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Enright talk about the difficulties experienced by butchers and bakers &mdash; he did not refer to candlestick makers. I know many of those difficulties.  For instance, a proposal was made about minced beef or ground meat which was necessary in southern Europe but not in the northern part.  It was almost passed until an explanation was given of why there was no such problem in the northern countries.  When a proposal was made regarding the refrigeration of eggs, which was very necessary apparently in Italy and Spain but which was not necessary in northern Europe, the people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry listened with attentive ears before they went to negotiate. In many cases we have achieved solutions because the members of the Irish Civil Service have the ability to listen to the citizens of Ireland before they go to negotiate.</P>
    <P>However, these concerns must be addressed.  They should not be <Col N="1700" /> addressed by giving in to the backward looking factions across Europe who want to roll back what has been achieved already.  We hear those voices continuously in the British Parliament at present.  That is not the way for the future.  Equally, however, the day has passed when people's support for changes in Europe can be taken for granted.  The day is past when that support can be whipped up after the event during the few weeks before a referendum.</P>
    <P>These concerns can be addressed. They can be addressed if the people are treated as adults by involving them in open discussions, as the Minister proposes to do through these seminars.  I hope they represent only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the discussion the Minister intends to encourage.  The discussions should be about the problems and other issues.  We must pay real attention rather than lip service to people's needs and wants from Europe, their aspirations about Europe and their expectations from Europe.  There is a massive job to be done and very little time in which to do it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we as a small nation cannot have a huge influence on what happens across Europe but we have considerable influence on what happens in this country. I urge the Government to treat this as a matter of urgency.  I am delighted to see that it appears to be doing so. Above all, I urge the Government to suppress any temptation towards complacency as a result of the large yes vote in the last referendum.  Next time things could be very different.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the approach adopted by Senator Quinn and the approach adopted in the paper.  There is an admonition that we must begin rethinking our approach towards Europe in order to develop what one could call a deeper and more complex relationship, no longer primarily as beneficiaries of funding.  It is a sign of hope about the <Col N="1701" /> maturity of our foreign policy that we are beginning to think some distance ahead about the implications of the inevitable decline in the degree of subsidisation from Europe we have enjoyed under various headings, such as Structural Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy.  I welcome the general approach adopted in this regard.  A two way educational process &mdash; Government to people, people to Government &mdash; is desirable and necessary.  I therefore welcome the series of seminars being launched by the Government.</P>
    <P>I will go back to the beginning of the Minister's statement and try to follow its main point, which I presume will lend an impeccable logic to my structure.  He is right to say that there is a big improvement in the most recent report and, indeed, in its construction.  When we last debated one of these reports &mdash; I think it was October, 1993 &mdash; many of us lamented the singularly unhelpful nature of the report.  There is an improvement in this report and that is to be welcomed.  I hope it will be sustained and developed further because there is still scope for sharpening the transparency of some of the analyses.</P>
    <P>A major issue confronting us in the EU is the enlargement problem.  It offers both a challenge and an opportunity to Ireland.  A natural response is to say that the possible new entrants from eastern Europe threaten our subsidies and therefore we will either oppose them openly or, as is more consonant with our national style, warmly welcome them and then drag our heels as effectively as we can in preventing them actually achieving the terms which are necessary for them.  That would be a mistake on several grounds.</P>
    <P>I am an unashamed European in many respects and I welcome the adhesion of the countries and cultures of east and central Europe to the existing European Union.  I would welcome it even if they were not bringing short term material benefits to the European Union, as they probably will not. However, they are developing much more rapidly than one would deduce <Col N="1702" /> from static figures of <i>per capita</i> GNP or whatnot, which in my view are grossly underestimated, certainly on the basis of personal observation.  I realise that is not a scientific criterion but I put far more weight on it than I do on tables of <i>per capita</i> income calculated in a highly arbitrary way and failing to do full justice to the nature of these economies. These eastern European economies have far more potential for rapid growth than some economies which entered the EU in an earlier period.  Even if they had not such potential, I would still welcome their membership.</P>
    <P>We should welcome it for a number of reasons.  First, we should welcome it if we are genuine Europeans and, secondly, because the axis of Europe in general and even of the European Union is moving eastwards anyway. Berlin, which is a central European city &mdash; it is certainly not a western European city in the classic sense &mdash; will become the capital of the Bundesrepublik in a few years time.  Dresden, which at about this time in 1945 was barbarically razed to the ground, is rising from its ruins once more.  Prague is again joining the mainstream of European history. Vienna, which was paralysed for 50 years because of the artificial border to the east, is again resuming its place as one of the great cities of Europe.  Budapest, I am glad to say, is resuming its rightful place.  If I were being melodramatic I would say that the hoofbeats of history are sounding once more through central Europe.</P>
    <P>We should be part of the welcome for that development.  Regardless of whether we are, it will happen.  We will not be able to stop it even if we wanted to.  It may happen more slowly if we create difficult terms for the entry of the eastern central European countries to the EU, but I am convinced it will happen. Our negotiating position, therefore, should be to welcome wholeheartedly and without reservation the applications of these countries.  Of course, we can legitimately claim compensation if there is disproportionate damage caused to our interests compared <Col N="1703" /> with the interests of other member states.  That goes without saying.  We would be entitled to demand that and ought to demand it.  However, we should not do so in a grudging way.  We should convey the impression that we warmly welcome the adhesion of these states as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a further calculation of self-interest. At least three of these states are small states.  Even Poland psychologically is a small state, although it has a population roughly equal to that of Spain.  It is striking how much admiration &mdash; perhaps slightly exaggerated admiration &mdash; these states have for Ireland, which is seen as a successful and effective member of the European Union.  The extent to which Budapest, Prague, Bratislava &mdash; when it discovers where we are &mdash; and Warsaw look to the Irish performance in the EU as a small state is quite striking.  There is potential for &mdash; a union of hearts would be putting it a little melodramatically &mdash; effective co-operation between us and them as small states within the European Union.  Even from the point of view of our potential long term interest we should look on the eastern European states as an opportunity as well as a challenge politically and economically. It is up to us in large measure whether it becomes an opportunity.  How we conceptualise it will determine to a considerable extent whether it becomes so. It is up to us to appreciate that opportunity and to grasp it as best we can.</P>
    <P>It is important that we are very clear in our position and that we do not sidle along being pulled one way and the other by whatever interest group has the ear of a Minister at a particular time.  I would like to see the Government and the Irish State give a lead on this issue and not allow itself to become the puppet of whatever the dominant interest group may be at a given moment.  In this context national interest supercedes sectoral interest and a clear distinction can be drawn between them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> I wish to deal with one or two other aspects of this issue.  I welcome the seminars. I welcome the commitment to contribute to the political and intellectual debate about the type of Union which will enter the next millenium. While we can rightly say in this paper that we are a long standing member of the EU, the countries which are not members at present can also rightly claim, and I will not go into millennia of history, to be equally long standing members of European civilisation and European culture, and that from the point of view of Europe, as distinct from the EU, they have a legitimate claim to being regarded as integral members of this civilisation.</P>
    <P>I do not get as excited about Maastricht criteria and Maastricht targets as some people do from time to time. Many of these targets, such as the 60 per cent on the debt/GNP ratio, are arbitrary. I believe in disciplined public finances, but whether the target is 70 per cent or 50 per cent at any given time is a matter of opinion.  There is nothing sacrosanct about any given statistic.  A great deal depends on circumstances, and circumstances are always changing. While we should be working towards these targets in a general way, we should not imprison ourselves within the thought processes out of which these targets emerged.  Let us, therefore, not get too worried if we are not moving at the speed which others believe we ought to move from time to time.</P>
    <P>I am also sceptical about the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment.  Much of that White Paper is at least as aspirational as our own effusions on unemployment and solving unemployment in this country.  I am open to correction on this, but much of the English version appears to have been translated from the French, because the rhetoric is peculiarly suited to the retundities of the French language rather than the English.</P>
    <P>I wish the White Paper well.  There are some good things in it but it is not going to make the slightest difference in the short term.  If unemployment falls in <Col N="1705" /> Europe over the next couple of years, and we all hope it does, it will be the result of the internal workings of the international economy as currently constituted, and not of specific measures adopted from the White Paper.  It may make a difference, and it probably will not do any harm, in the medium term, but to argue that there is clear appreciation that the Union as a whole must tackle the issue which cannot be solved by member states acting individually is unsustainable on the basis of evidence.</P>
    <P>Unemployment varies greatly between EU member states and among other European states.  It is not a function of the Union <i>qua</i> Union and, as regards the argument that states cannot solve the problem acting individually, they cannot solve the problem but they are certainly not going to be any less capable of solving it than the Union as a whole is capable of solving it for the foreseeable future.  Perhaps in due course mechanisms will emerge, maybe policies will be devised, maybe great minds will find ways of coping with these challenges all over the Union. However, for the foreseeable future &mdash; to the end of this century &mdash; the Union <i>qua</i> Union will not make very much difference to the solution of unemployment problems in its various member states.  That is not to denigrate it; it is just to ask ourselves to be realistic.</P>
    <P>I do not see why voters or Europeans should blame the Union if unemployment fails to fall in individual member states as distinct from blaming their own national Governments, in so far as national Governments have any influence on the matter, but then as national Governments claim that they have, even if they have not, they deserve to be blamed.  Do not ask too much from the Union in this respect.</P>
    <P>I have one criticism of this paper.  The section on foreign policy, the section on former Yugoslavia and the section on Russia succumb to being too bland by half.  There is a horrendous situation there and there may be very little we can do about it.  However, citing as a record of solid achievements the types <Col N="1706" /> of documents that have emerged &mdash; even humanitarian aid, welcome and deserving of applause though it is &mdash; ignores the fact that it is not the complex nature of internal conflict, such as that in the former Yugoslavia, which has challenged all international organisations and so on but that member states, or any states who do not feel themselves directly threatened by a problem, are going to be very reluctant to commit resources which may mean committing the lives of their citizens to the solution of that problem, whether it is an internal problem or an external problem elsewhere.</P>
    <P>While these resolutions go in the right direction, there should be a franker acknowledgement of the inadequacy of the EU response from a European perspective, because they can be legitimately hoist on the petard of their own rhetoric about Europe in a way that Americans or others cannot.  If they are serious about the rhetoric they should have been doing something more, and if they are not serious they should keep their mouths shut in the light of the horrors that have been experienced, are being experienced and will continue to be experienced in those areas.</P>
    <P>Regarding the argument which Senator Quinn so eloquently advanced that the distance between decision making in Brussels and the citizen is greater than it should be, of course it is, and while the Brussels bureaucracy is small in number, many members of that bureaucracy have a distinctly <i>dirigiste</i> attitude towards how Europe ought to develop, and we ought to be confronting that <i>dirigiste</i> attitude whenever and wherever we can.</P>
    <P>However, one might say the same to some extent of decision making in Dublin, in that the distance between the citizen is greater than it should be except that in our dear country it is mediated by the human qualities of our civil servants. I include the citizens of Dublin, and not just the citizens in the west of Ireland who have prepared for Deputy Carey, because two miles from Government Buildings can be a long way from <Col N="1707" /> decision making.  Hopefully, we would practise what we preach within our own State as well as in the EU.  If subsidiarity is to make sense it should do so within countries as well as between national capitals and Brussels.</P>
    <P>Laws should reflect national cultures and national values as far as is remotely possible with harmonisation within the EU.  Harmonisation ought not to necessarily mean standardisation, except in those relatively limited areas where it is in fact very difficult to distinguish the two.</P>
    <P>We have been considering our political and national cultures, but there is nothing about culture in the narrower sense in this paper.  Perhaps this is a remit by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, but in foreign affairs documents there should be some reference, especially when we are concerned with membership of the EU and the European ideal, to the potential Irish contribution, in a cultural sense, and not have them compartmentalised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his fine address; although he has left the House I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  There is one point in the Minister's address which stands out:</P>
      <P>There is also now a greater understanding of the need to bring the institutions of the Union closer to the citizen and to ensure that decisions taken at the level of the Union which affect the daily lives of all our citizens enjoy widespread public support.</P>
      <P>If the EU is to be a success it must be based on that sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with four reports, on the Developments in the European Communities and the EU, Nos. 41 to 44. Many events occurred during the time covered by the reports &mdash; July 1992 to June 1994.  The signing of the Maastricht Treaty would have had a big effect, although it occurred in February 1992. However, an important event took place during the term of the first report.  On <Col N="1708" /> 11 and 12 December 1992, the European Council met in Edinburgh from which emerged the Delors II package. This was the framework for the Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds that are, and will be coming into effect up to the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Another event which took place was the European political co-operation, especially with eastern Europe; there were also direct links with the Middle East, with Africa south of the Sahara, with Asia and with Central and South American countries.  This involved opening up European influence throughout the world.  The major aspect of the second report is that Denmark finally accepted the Treaty of European Union.  There was difficulty in the beginning but they finally accepted it. The 44th report deals with the negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway.  During this period, Austria joined the EU; we will leave what happened with the other countries until another day.  The major aspect of the 43rd report is that on 1 November 1993 the Treaty of European Union was accepted.  European history was made during the period covered by these four reports.</P>
    <P>The final report deals with the meeting in Corfu on 24 and 25 June where a reflection group was set up to prepare for the intergovernmental conference in 1996.  This conference will be of extreme importance because it is a continuation of what happened over the previous two years.  What will be highlighted are the things which went wrong; the things which went right will be accepted.</P>
    <P>We accepted the Maastricht Treaty in good faith, but some people are asking if we are being too good as Europeans. We follow every regulation which comes from Europe and make rules, regulations and restrictions and so on, perhaps more so than people in other parts of the EU.  We saw examples of that in the past.  We must ask if the Spaniards coming into our waters and violating our fishing rights are adhering to the concept of a European Union. These issues should be straightened out <Col N="1709" /> at the intergovernmental conference in 1996.</P>
    <P>We are placed further out on a limb the more Europe stretches eastwards. Will we be forgotten on the western wing?  We have to bear that in mind.  I am not against the European Union spreading to the whole continent of Europe.  However, there is a big problem because Europe has such complex cultures, boundaries, climates and people.  There are cultures which go back many thousands of years, as distinct from the countries of the New World.</P>
    <P>In comparing Europe with the United States, people often say that we will have the United States of America on one side of the Atlantic and the United States of Europe on the other side.  It is not easy as that, because although there are 50 states in the USA, many of them were wide open countryside when they were conquered by Europeans.  It is a totally different concept to that of Europe.  American culture only goes back to the War of Independence, or a little earlier.  What traditions do they have before that?  They would adore to have Newgrange or the Grianán of Áille.  If they had the Skellig Islands it would be built higher than the Statue of Liberty because it would be part of their national culture, which is something they do not have.</P>
    <P>In Europe, not only is there a culture, there are cultures.  We can see the problems which cultures have caused in places such as Yugoslavia.  A very wide, varied and complex situation could develop over the years as the EU stretches eastwards.  The European Union will eventually stretch to Russia, which is only west of the Urals, and that will cause economic, cultural and linguistic problems.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has left because I was speaking about Ireland's peripherality. In his new role as Minister of State with responsibility for the islands, we will be tackling him &mdash; as you will.  Sir &mdash; about the islands off the coast of Kerry and west Cork.  He is not just a Minister for <Col N="1710" /> north of the Shannon, he will also have to come a little bit south.  It is a pity that he has left because I would have reminded him of that.</P>

      <P>Very good.  With regard to monetary union, it was remarked some years ago that if a person left Dublin with £100, visited the 12 capitals and exchanged the money in each city, on their return to Dublin they would have less than half the money left because of charges.  That is a tremendous disadvantage for business.  I do not know what effect three other countries joining will have on that.  Will it mean that one could come back with a minus quantity if any more countries join?  The exchange rates and charges are a large hindrance to business and tourism.</P>
      <P>We must stress our peripheral nature as an island at any Intergovernmental Conference.  If a country such as Poland joins the EU, its people can drive across the border into Germany.  We cannot do that and it is a hindrance and a huge cost.  Therefore, we must prepare to make our case very strongly at this Intergovernmental Conference in 1996. The centre of the EU is regarded as Brussels, Strasbourg, Paris and London. That is the main centre of influence in Europe.  Will that shift eastwards and how will that affect us in our outpost in the Atlantic?</P>
      <P>The European traditions will have to be welded together.  Norway did not join the EU, which was its entitlement. Smaller states such as Liechtenstein and San Marino will also have to be accommodated. Will Switzerland ever become a member of the EU and what would be the consequences if it did?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to return to the point which the Minister of State mentioned in his speech on the Union coming closer to the citizen.  We in Ireland are very conscious of our membership of the EU, but I wonder if people on the Continent, who do not benefit as much as we do, are as conscious.  We get road grants, <Col N="1711" /> area aid grants, training grants and so on from the EU which makes us conscious of it.  There are many people in Germany, the Netherlands and France who are not as conscious of the European Union as we are.  We have much to gain from Europe and much to give. It is very important that we put our case at any conference or meeting of the Council or elsewhere.  It is only by so doing that we can get the best for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the recent developments.  I wish to begin by referring to the new Commission, which is now a 21 member executive.  Among its most striking features are five women, an increase in one on the outgoing Delors Commission, and a strong social democrat slant.  Two of its members are former Prime Ministers, Madame Edith Cresson of France and Mr. Santer, who stepped down in Luxembourg.  Another newcomer is Mr. Neil Kinnock, the former British Labour Party Leader, who almost became Prime Minister after the 1992 election.  It is much more a political body than its predecessor, making it much more difficult for critics to justify criticism about anonymous bureaucrats in Brussels.  The argument which took place between Sir Leon Brittan and Mr. Santer obscured potentially significant reforms in the organisation of the Commission, starting with the strengthening of the office of the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the new order Mr. Santer will assume final authority over the Commission's role in the common foreign and security policy and preparations for the creation of a single European currency. He will also play the lead role in co-ordinating the Commission's position in the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference to review the Maastricht Treaty. Mr. Santer's accumulation of power needs to be seen in light of the evolving role of the Commission, expanding from 17 to 20 members with Austria, Finland and Sweden voting in favour of EU membership in their referenda.  Without a greater degree of centralisation and <Col N="1712" /> co-ordination, the Commission risks becoming even more unwieldy than it is already.</P>
    <P>The second major reform introduced by Mr. Santer was the ending of the artificial barriers between the economic and political affairs in external relations. In the future responsibilities will be defined on geographical lines, allowing a more integrated approach to policy making and hopefully ending the turf battles which plagued the outgoing Delors Commission.  I was particularly pleased to note that Mr. Pádraig Flynn retained his portfolio and continues with social policy.  It was indeed a sorry sight to see so-called feminists attacking Mr. Flynn on the basis of his sex without having regard to his record on women's rights.  They were unable to see that what they wanted most for themselves &mdash; equality of opportunity and no discrimination on the basis of sex &mdash; they were unwilling to grant to Mr. Flynn.  It was an even sorrier sight to see some Irish MEPs attacking one of our own, their sole purpose being, it seems, to reduce the responsibilities of the Irish Commissioner.  One has to be up very early in the morning to put one over on Mr. Flynn and it is widely rumoured in the Berlaymont that nobody rises before the Irish Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Nearly all the developments in recent times, in common with all developments, are pushing towards a united Europe.  However, uniting the two halves of Europe is by far the biggest challenge facing us at present.  It is a task of historic dimensions, comparable to the foundation of the original European Community in western Europe in the 1950s.  We must continually remind ourselves that in the aftermath of World War II, a group of visionaries started a drive to European unity in order to make future wars in Europe impossible. A similar grand design must now be sketched out for the whole Continent, but this time, as European Union critics have been quick to point out, the vision has been slow in coming.  Most will agree that most countries of western Europe have been preoccupied of late <Col N="1713" /> by their own economic, social and political problems and have not wanted to look at the broader historic picture.  On the contrary, the prospect of opening the doors to central and eastern Europe, particularly to its low cost exports, looks to many more like a threat than an opportunity.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism has been exaggerated and some of it has been wrong. It has often failed to take adequate account of the political difficulties caused by recession and high unemployment in western Europe.  There is little doubt, at least in the years immediately following the collapse of the Iron Curtain, that we could have been more helpful to our neighbours as they struggled towards western style market democracies.  Hopefully, that phase is now over.  Over the past year or so, largely prodded by Germany, the European Union has begun to treat the political and economic integration of central and eastern Europe with broader vision and greater urgency.  Something resembling a grand strategy is now finally emerging.  The European Union has signed an unprecedented trade and co-operation agreement with Russia and it has promised full membership to at least six central and east European countries &mdash; Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania. It has agreed to start extending the Single Market to the central and east European countries and it is forging closer political bonds by bringing central and east European Governments more into decision making councils.</P>
    <P>Since the offer of membership to the six countries at the Copenhagen Summit, the EU is now committed to a major eastward expansion.  The question is no longer &ldquo;whether&rdquo; but &ldquo;how and when&rdquo;, and Poland and Hungary have already submitted formal entry applications. However, before any of these ex-Communist nations can join, a number of time consuming and difficult conditions must be fulfilled, both on the eastern and western sides of the former Iron Curtain.  With the best of wills, there is no way that the ex-Communist <Col N="1714" /> countries can be admitted into the EU much before the turn of the century. The year 2000 has become a type of informal target date, at least for the most advanced countries, although many European Governments would not want to be pinned down to it.  On the eastern side, the first and fundamental requirements are that the former Communist states become functioning market economies and acquire sufficient institutional stability to guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the protection of minorities &mdash; to use the EU's own words.</P>
    <P>There are basic conditions of European membership which could not be fulfilled by a totalitarian country or by dictatorships, such as those which kept Spain and Portugal out of the Union until 1986.  There are also severe practical difficulties.  The central and east European countries are nowhere near being able to apply European Union rules in fields such as competition policy, state aids and the environment, to name but a few, let alone economic and monetary policy; nor are they yet ready to face the competitive pressures of full EU membership.  However, major changes will also be necessary on the western side.  First, we must digest the entry of the new members, Austria, Finland and Sweden, and then in 1996 review our whole constitutional future. The likely expansion of the Union, from its current 12 to well over 20 members, would make it impossible to continue with rules which were essentially designed for six founder members in the 1950s.  This raises the question of a two speed, or even a three or four speed Europe.  We must ask ourselves if we should immediately become part of the Schengen agreement.  It is a difficult question and is one of the difficulties facing us.  Personally, I would not like a two speed Europe, but these things may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Perhaps of equal difficulty is that the European Union must radically reform its Common Agricultural Policy and its system of structural development funds for the poorer regions to make way for <Col N="1715" /> the new central and east European members.  If the CAP's price support system is extended to farmers in Poland, for example, it would almost certainly cause a production explosion, a growth of unsaleable surpluses and consequent trade conflicts, and the collapse of the EU budget.  On the other hand, it is unlikely to be politically feasible to exclude Poland and other central European countries from as central an EU policy as the CAP, either altogether or for a protracted transitional period.  I do not believe that any of the Governments have taken this on board, particularly the political consequences of tampering with support levels to vociferous farmers.</P>
    <P>Richard E. Baldwin, in an exhaustive report by the London based Centre for Economic Policy Research, warns that the foremost van countries, namely the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland &mdash; usually considered the most likely to join first &mdash; would need at least a ten year transitional period after 2000 AD before benefiting from the Union's agricultural and Structural Funds.  Without such an arrangement, he states, the net cost to the Union of bringing in just those four countries in the year 2000 could be a gigantic $63.6 billion a year. This is exactly equivalent to the budgetary spending of the entire 12 nation Union in 1992.  I do not believe that taxpayers in western Europe are even remotely prepared for this type of impact, nor are Governments of the countries that will be major rivals of the newcomers for EU Structural Funds or those who would have to finance the new payments.  This includes almost everybody.</P>
    <P>If nothing is done to bridge the yawning financial gaps, EU integration will stall.  It would be tragic if the historic and geopolitical imperatives of uniting Europe were to be lost from sight in an inward looking haggle over agriculture and budgetary reform.  Strong leadership is required and this is coming at present from Germany.  It is fortunate for Europe that at this point in history <Col N="1716" /> Germany's interest in bringing in the central and east European countries coincides with its broader European interests.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the whole relationship of the European Union with America.  In January 1814, Thomas Jefferson set out a rationale for American engagement in Europe, which still holds good today.  He said: &ldquo;Surely none of us wishes to see Bonaparte conquer Russia and lay thus at his feet the whole continent of Europe.  This done, England would be but a breakfast.  No, it cannot be to our interest that Europe should be reduced to a single monarchy.&rdquo; In a couple of sentences, Jefferson captures how US foreign policy towards Europe will be ultimately driven by considerations of balance of power.  Europe will always be of vital interest to the US, a fact underlined by a near $3 trillion a year in goods, services and capital in bilateral trade investment.  We must ask ourselves what will happen in the future.  Many things could happen both in America and in Europe.  For example, alternatives could appear in Europe.  Either the Continent reverts to its 19th century past, fragmented by nationalism and ethnic rivalry &mdash; concepts so abhorrent to the peacemaker, Mr. John Hume &mdash; or it enters a new age in which the European Union acts both as a subordinator of the nation state and a strategic partner of the US, covering the full range of common economic, political and security interests.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with most of the other issues before us, but I would like to deal with security and foreign policy which are being brought under one roof.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Cabinet to give high priority to a comprehensive reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, to enable the Government and the public service to adapt more effectively to modern conditions.</P>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. Cuirim fáilte roimh an t-Aire.  Tá súil agam go bhfeicfimid í go minic sa Teach seo sna blianta atá romhainn.  The Minister is very welcome.  I thought for a moment that the Cathaoirleach's reference to the quorum reflected on what some might consider the esoteric nature of the proposal but I gather that it refers to historic events before my time.</P>
      <P>Some might consider this motion to be an esoteric matter but it is actually the most important issue that could come before us.  I am taking as my text the paragraph in the Programme for Renewal which refers to reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and says that, in co-operation with the public service, reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, will be undertaken with a view to, <i>inter alia</i>, the separation of policy and executive functions of Departments, and clearly highlighting all areas of direct ministerial accountability in matters of policy and practice so as to evolve delegative exercise of power and responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One response to that is to say that we have been over this ground so often in the last 25 years that we will merely be adding more vacuous words to the thousands, <Col N="1718" /> if not hundreds of thousands already spoken, many of them in this Chamber.  It is a purgative experience and not just for the normal reasons, to read the debates in this Chamber on the Devlin report and the establishment of the Department of the Public Service and see how far, or rather how little, we have progressed since then in terms of reforming the public service.  Nevertheless, some important things have happened, particularly the establishment of the top level appointments committee and many more important things can happen if there is a combination of political will, in Government and in the Civil Service.  We must start with Government because the lead must come from politicians.</P>
    <P>As regards the paragraph in the programme, I agree very much with the theme of co-operation with the public service because this has to be done in large measure through consensus.  That does not mean that the most antediluvian blocker can be left in position permanently, but it does mean that a majority have to be brought along with the thought process of reforming the public service.  I do not think it can be imposed, and it ought not to be imposed even if it could be, because the willingness to participate in change by those who are effected is, as far as I am concerned, both a principle of Government and a principle of good management.  I am not talking about imposing anything.</P>
    <P>If I criticise or seem to criticise some aspect of the Civil Service it is not because I am critical of the Civil Service in general.  We have an awful habit in this country the moment we criticise an institution, everybody in that institution takes it personally.  If I criticise the Civil Service it is precisely the same as when I criticise universities.  It is not because I am opposed or hostile to them, it is because I value them and think they can do better with the potential at their disposal if they organise themselves more effectively.</P>
    <P>Reform would be undertaken with a view to, <i>inter alia</i>, the separation of policy and executive functions of Departments. <Col N="1719" /> That, of course, is going back to the standard Devlin model of the Aireacht and the executive unit and so on.  I would not be in the least dogmatic about the type of organisational structure one would impose.  I can see it varying from Department to Department depending on specific circumstances, but the fundamental problem Devlin confronted was the use of time by the best quality minds in the Civil Service; their time should not be squandered on minutiae as far as possible.  Exactly the same applies to politicians by the way, and indeed to others, although they live in different cultures and they have very little choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>Quality time of the best minds in the Civil Service has to be protected.  It must not merely be protected, it must not be frittered away dealing with endless trivia.  It is over 30 years since Dr. T.K. Whittaker, then Secretary of the Department of Finance, made a plea for finding time to think.  Where could he and senior civil servants find time to think?  That was in a much simpler age where there was far less documentation to read and we did not have the European commitments we have now.  If 30 years ago one of the finest minds to have ever served this country felt under pressure in finding time to think, what must be the position with most senior public servants today?  That happens to be one of the most important issues confronting us.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;senior&rdquo; I am not talking about seniority as merely in age, because there is a lot of talent there.  It is one of the biggest problems confronting the Civil Service that a lot of talent was recruited roughly 20 years ago when there was a big recruitment drive for the public service in the mid and late 1970s.  Much of that talent is now bunched together and its promotional outlets are blocked.  There must be a lot of frustration for many people in the promotional structures in the Civil Service at present.  One cannot resolve that easily but one can give responsibility if the will is there, <Col N="1720" /> responsibility of a type which makes the work more challenging.</P>
    <P>One should be prepared to delegate within the Civil Service to a greater extent; one should be prepared to devolve responsibility to a greater extent and then be prepared to recognise, because recognition is very important in sustaining morale, the contributions of people who may not have the level of seniority they would wish but whose work is often very important and does not receive the recognition it deserves within its own Department. That problem is by no means confined to the Civil Service, it exists in every institution in the country.</P>
    <P>If our best people do not have time to think, from where will our ideas come? They will come from a variety of sources, usually at second hand.  We are now far more reliant on consultants than we were 30 years ago when they were virtually unknown.  The quality of consultancy advice &mdash; and this is a point I have made time and again but I see no reason to change it &mdash; is extremely uneven.  The best can be very good but much of it is not the best and there is a lot of, I do not want to say rubbish but that is what it is, in many expensive consultants' reports.  Likewise we have some very good, more general reports but even many senior civil servants are reduced to relying on executive summaries, as indeed virtually all politicians are as well as most commentators.</P>
    <P>Executive summaries are useful and if they are done well they are indispensable but they are dangerous in terms of quality of thinking for the simple reason that they give the conclusions without presenting the evidence, so you do not know what the quality of the use of evidence is on which these conclusions are based.  If, as I say, our best minds do not wrestle with the quality of the evidence on which the conclusions are based, then they are likely to swallow whatever is the fashion of the moment and become prisoners of contemporary fashion instead of thinking through the implications from the quality of their own minds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> One reason we hear such a consensus &mdash; very often a consensus of platitudes &mdash; on a whole range of policies is that none of the policy makers is thinking through these policies, not because they are stupid or incapable of wrestling with these assumptions, but because they simply do not have the time and it is easier to run with your executive summary than to try to wrestle with the basic material.  That is reinforced by the propensity of public servants, and politicians and Ministers also, to listen to what is said in the corridors in Brussels, at OECD meetings or among EU working groups; and if a consensus appears to be emerging among their colleagues there about the general direction in which policy should go in European countries, then they come back reinforced in the conviction that it is the correct way to go in this country, which it may be.  However, it is not the correct way to go because others think it is the correct way to go for their own countries. We need to try to make thinking time and space for the best minds we have.  We are not succeeding in doing that at present.</P>
    <P>Before I talk about the corporation sole idea, I would mention one glaring lacuna &mdash; we have spoken about it often here &mdash; in our current governmental structure, which is effective co-ordination techniques and systems.  I will not rehearse what one has said already about how few of our departmental structures now correspond adequately to the actual type of problem they are confronting.  Most of the major problems that face this country transcend departmental distinctions and one of the main challenges confronting this or any Government is how to effectively co-ordinate departmental activity.</P>
    <P>Interdepartmental committees are not an adequate solution, because all they do is bring the departmental perspective and arrive at a compromise based on departmental interests.  Cabinet is not an adequate solution.  One might think in principle it ought to be, but the Cabinet depends not on co-ordinating policy but on balancing interests. <Col N="1722" /> That has to be the case &mdash; I am not lamenting that; it is just part of nature. Therefore, unless co-ordinated policy is presented to Cabinet in the first instance, Cabinet is not going to succeed in co-ordination.</P>
    <P>We have to ask carefully how we effectively co-ordinate; how we build co-ordination into our systems of decision making and not simply how, after a variety of alternative and often conflicting proposals comes through, we strike a politically acceptable compromise, in administrative terms, between them.  We have to be much more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to the House, I have myself to leave quickly.  I am grateful to all who have co-ordinated the arrangements just now.  I am writing of the matter in a prominent public publication soon and I will take I hope adequate notice of every worthwhile point when it comes to that. <Col N="1723" /> The point has often been made &mdash; it is not original to me; the Leader made it the other day &mdash; that in 1924 departmental structures were simple.  One can look at the departmental structure and see nobody but a Secretary or an Assistant Secretary and a Higher Executive Officer in several Departments.  That is completely gone.  The idea that a Minister today can be remotely personally responsible for everything happening in the Department is simply nonsense.  At one stage we might have regarded it as a polite fiction, now it is simply a fraudulent facade.  It is important that the right message should go out from this assembly that one does not want to sustain that in future, indefinitely and interminably.</P>
      <P>There are areas where of course the Minister has to be accountable and has to be directly responsible, but that does not mean everywhere.  An unfortunate habit has begun recently of blaming civil servants from time to time for matters which were previously regarded as ministerial responsibility.  Civil servants ought to take the blame for matters for which they are delegated responsibility, but if they do not have that responsibility by legislation then they ought not to have to take the blame.  If there is not responsibility it is most unfair of politicians to try to shift the responsibility to civil servants in specific circumstances on specific occasions.  That matter should be cleared up so that everybody knows what the lines of responsibility are and accepts responsibility for that for which they are responsible, whether it is the civil servant or the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministerial responsibility is now counterproductive to thinking constructively and positively about public affairs.  One might make many points about it, but I will refer to the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell's speech in the statements earlier where he greatly welcomes the importance attached by Jacques Santer to such issues as &ldquo;... openness, transparency [where did we hear that before] and the <Col N="1724" /> need for participation ... Indeed, this Government has attached a high priority to transparency at both national and European levels&rdquo;.  We cannot have transparency nor can we be serious about it unless we make a serious effort to identify reality in public administration, to identify what actually happens as distinct from the ministerial front covering everything.</P>
    <P>No Government can be regarded as being serious about these commitments unless it is prepared to implement them, of course in a discerning manner, in public administration.  It is also important to bring the public administrators along with that.  We have top class public administrators; we have the potential for them to achieve even more of their own capability.  My criticism of our public service, as of many other institutions, is not that we do not have a remarkable number of first class people in the service; it is the structures we have devised for them which cramp them and prevent them achieving their own full potential.  Due to the time constraints, I will not go into mechanisms for doing that, but it is one of the most important issues that confronts us.</P>
    <P>Reform, as has often been said, is not an event; it is a process.  It is also, of course, a thankless task, as the Minister will be well aware.  I was looking recently at a speech by John Boland, who was, whatever one thinks of his specific actions, one of the most courageous Ministers the State has had in recent times &mdash; much good it did him in electoral terms.  There is not much electoral gain in much of this work; but if there is a public perception that a commitment to openness, freedom of access, freedom of information and to the general thrust of the type of society which I hope we want to be, is being blocked by a coyness, cuteness or a &ldquo;too-clever-by-halfness&rdquo; in terms of ministerial responsibility covering up what happens, there will be a gradual erosion of public confidence in this Government's commitment to the type of regime to which it has committed itself.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Senator Lee I feel weak speaking on this matter.  It is a joy to listen to Senator Lee and I know the Minister listened with avid interest, as we all did. I was glad the Leader suggested that he not be limited as to time because I could have gone on listening for some time.  I commend Senator Lee for introducing the topic.</P>
      <P>The Ministers and Secretaries Act is crucially important legislation.  Not a great many people know much about it other than those in the institutions of the State.  When I was asked by the Government in 1979 to become Chairman of An Bord Poist &mdash; a name we were happy to get rid of later for An Post &mdash; I came for the first time from the private enterprise business world into the State sector.  I realised how little I knew, and I was not much different from the vast majority of those in business who do not understand how the system works.  I was not even aware of the implications of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>I know that the Irish Management Institute and the Institute of Public Administration over a number of years made various efforts to create interchanges between senior management in industry and business and in the State organisations, and had a great deal of difficulty.  The Act was crucially important legislation because it and its many amendments effectively regulate the relationship between the people and the administrative machinery that serves them, the relationship between citizens and the State.  Because of this central role, it is important that every so often we dust off the legislation, look at it again to see what we should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having read the Principal Act last week in relation to the Bill which <Col N="1726" /> created Minister Doyle's position, it was a revelation to me as an outsider, because it showed how things had changed over the past 70 years since it was passed.  It seems that the type of thing which is now taking place is very worthy, particularly the strategic management initiative which the Minister has been &mdash; I was going to say &ldquo;burdened&rdquo;, which I am sure is the wrong word &mdash; offered as a challenge.  I am sure she has accepted that challenge because in many ways this is the right time to do it.</P>
    <P>One of the many basic assumptions underlying that Act may no longer be valid today.  A second reason why we need to take a fresh look at it is because of the heavily amended aspect of that legislation.  Amending legislation is not a bad thing, but amendments are often made simply to respond to specific needs.  That in itself is quite dangerous, because if one amends legislation for a specific reason without taking a fundament look at the whole situation then, as has happened in the past, the amendments do not realise the implications they may later have.</P>
    <P>Such considerations, the almost patchwork look of the present Act because of the amendments made since 1924, led &mdash; I believe Senator Lee said 20 years ago &mdash; to the setting up of the Devlin committee which produced a report which I suggest was both radical and far-reaching.  St. John Devlin is remembered for the constraints he put on the income levels of senior civil servants and those in State bodies.  The report was interesting, far reaching and useful because it looked at something which had not been considered in that way for many years.  Some of the recommendations made in that report eventually found their way into the Statue Book, but others fell by the wayside because of blocks in the political or the administrative system.  It is tempting to believe that a generation later it is time for another big bang approach like the Devlin report.  However, I am not sure that is the right way to go about it.</P>

      <Col N="1727" /> There is a fallacy in that approach which could prevent us from having the best administrative system, and that is what appealed to me when Senator Lee spoke about seeking the best system to do the work.  That is what we should look at.  The fallacy I refer to is the assumption that there is a perfect way. I do not believe there is a perfect way to run anything.  If there was, there would be no modern books, speakers and consultancies advising on new ways of doing things.  Some believe that all we have to do is find a model, put it in its place and from then on things will be fine until in the future changing circumstances will call for a different perfect model suited to that time.  I believe that is erroneous and fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>The way the world works is that there are no perfect models, but many imperfect ones.  The way to run an enterprise, whether it is a State or a private one, is to take an imperfect model, accept it as such, but constantly seek to improve it. Rather than try to move from imperfection to perfection in one step, we must accept that the journey must consist of a large number of small steps.  I am talking about evolution rather than revolution. Instead of working to a model of 25 or 50 years ago and only changing by means of big shake-ups when forced to do so, one must accept that the only way to run an enterprise is by changing constantly, a few small steps at a time.  Evolution is easier than revolution, not least because it is easier to sell to the various parties involved and to put right.</P>
    <P>If one works by taking many small steps, one can build in-course corrections along the way.  One can also reverse mistakes if one makes them, as one invariably will.  For example, the last Government created several new Departments.  That was what I call a big bang which reverberated right across the board.  I want to focus on the Department of Trade and Tourism. That Department is responsible for Bord Fáilte on the one hand and Bord Tráchtála on the other.  In the long term that Department is a nonsense &mdash; there <Col N="1728" /> is no logic to it.  One of the main reasons is that the Export Board reports to a different Minister to the Minister responsible for industrial development generally.  That flies totally against commercial reality and it makes the co-ordination of policy virtually impossible to effect.</P>
    <P>The only sense the Department of Trade and Tourism made was in terms of what we call a personal chair.  The Leader of the House and Senator Lee will understand that term because that is the one used in universities where they appoint a personal chair for somebody who suits that situation.  In universities I understand that when that person ceases in that position, either dies or retires, then that personal chair is removed.  That does not seem to happen in Government.  Perhaps initially a Minister is appointed to a personal chair, but when that person moves on it stays there for whoever takes their place.  We must be careful that each change is not assumed to be right or permanent because one Government later we still have this ridiculous Department of Trade and Tourism.  We have not faced the fact that whatever merit it may have had in certain circumstances, it makes no sense once they change.  The perfect model system encourages the perpetuation of mistakes like that.</P>
    <P>I am not saying Government Department are not abolished, but too often it is for the wrong reasons.  Following the Devlin report 20 years ago, we created the Department of the Public Service, which has been swallowed back into the Department of Finance.  The Department of Economic Development also disappeared.  More Departments disappear because of what I call turf wars or because of the constitutional limitation on the number of Cabinets rather than the fact they do not make sense anymore. We should face the fact that when it comes to Government and administration, changes tend to be cast in stone.  That approach makes us less ready to experiment with changes and it certainly makes us slower to undo the <Col N="1729" /> mistakes we make in the past.  In this regard, evolution is better than revolution.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to remain as fluid as possible because of the difficulty of working across departmental boundaries, a task which the Minister has undertaken.  In the private sector we always have difficulty working across functional boundaries.  One of the challenges of management is to deal with this.  That is why one of the in things in management at present is the area re-engineering. It is a challenge for the Minister which she will face with enthusiasm.  Boundaries are a problem in any organisation, but they seem to pose a particular difficulty for Government. Among other things, transport is about roads, but they are not the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. There may be various reasons for this &mdash; some may be good &mdash; but there is no ideal permanent solution to such conflicts.  On that basis I welcome this debate and I am happy to second the motion.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity to examine what happens elsewhere.  My son-in-law is a senior civil servant in Paris.  He is a Frenchman who works as a senior executive in one of the state companies there.  He explained to me the system in Paris where there is a post-graduate school called <i>Ecole Normale d'Administration.</i> Its main purpose is to spread knowledge of the administrative system, not only among civil servants, but among those who may become legislators, Ministers, judges, advisers to Ministers and political parties.  There must be some opportunity for us to do something like that if only to ensure an understanding of the job which must be done and which is effectively being done in many areas.  Let us continue to try to make it more effective in the future.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an interesting Chamber and I enjoyed every moment of my time here.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my thanks to Senator Lee, Senator Quinn, Senator Henry and Senator O'Toole for putting down this motion.  I welcome the opportunity to tell the House of the Government's plans which are directly relevant to the motion.</P>
      <P>Public service reform was described in this House only last week as a thankless task.  I would not entirely disagree.  We have had lots of reports and analyses, but very little radical reform.  I often feel that the various initiatives over the years in public service reform are a little like the aftermath of a photo finish at Leopardstown, Navan or Fairy-house; a short period of great fuss followed by a period when people wonder what all the fuss was about, followed by an even longer period when people forgot that there had ever been a fuss in the first place.  I know I may be accused of political recklessness for saying this, a Chathaoirligh, but I am going to say it anyway.  This Government will not let up until we have reshaped our system of public administration to fit the particular needs of our people at this stage of our history.</P>
      <P>In response to what Senator Lee said &mdash; he evoked T. K. Whitaker and his plea to allow civil servants to find time to think &mdash; basically what it is all about today, and this would incorporate the aspirations of T.K. Whitaker, is ensuring that people can work smarter not harder.  There are very hard working people throughout the civil and public service, but there is a case in many areas for working smarter and not harder.  In a sentence, that is really what this is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have read this Government's programme of work &mdash;<i>A</i><Col N="1731" /><i>Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; will have noticed that the very first item in our strategy for renewal section is the reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  That Act is the bedrock legislation upon which our Civil Service system is based.  The 1924 Act provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the establishment of the Departments of State, Ministers, as the heads of their respective Departments, to be &ldquo;corporations sole&rdquo; and the expenses of each of the Departments of State to be subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance and to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>To give the House a clearer view of the Government's intentions in this area, I will quote the relevant section our programme:</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the public service, reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, will be undertaken, with a view to, <i>inter alia</i>, the separation of policy and executive functions of Departments, and clearly highlighting all areas of direct Ministerial accountability in matters of policy and practice, so as to allow for the delegated exercise of power and responsibility.  Within the agreed budgetary allocations for their Departments under various heads and subheads, Ministers will have the freedom to implement agreed policy, without requiring further financial authorisation.</P>
    <P>This is a radical agenda.  When implemented, it will transform the organisation of the Civil Service, will clarify and, if necessary, redefine the respective roles of Ministers and civil servants and will accord significant additional financial autonomy to Departments.</P>
    <P>While we are only at the early stages of our consideration of these issues, I should like to flesh out a little the plans which the Government has in the areas affected.  The separation of the policy and executive functions of Departments would be a critical area.  This is not a novel proposal.  Its inspiration is at least <Col N="1732" /> as old as the report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group &mdash; the Devlin report, to which Senators have referred &mdash; which was published in 1969 and concluded that:</P>
    <P>An efficient, developmental and acceptable public service can best be achieved if its policy and executive roles are assigned to broadly distinguishable types of body.  Overall policy formulation, direction and control should be the task of central areas of Departments, the Minister's advisers, who constitute the Aireacht. Execution should be the responsibility of executive bodies with the greatest practicable operating freedoms.</P>
    <P>The separation of policy and execution was also envisaged in the White Paper <i>Serving the Country Better</i>, published in 1985, which envisaged that:</P>
    <P>Where Departments have a sufficiently large volume of purely executive work, Ministers will be enabled by legislation to transfer such work to separate offices &mdash; to be known as executive offices &mdash; which will have full responsibility for discharging it effectively.</P>
    <P>It is clear for all to see that this concept has been in the public domain for a long time indeed.  In fact, a number of other countries which &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; the principle of separating policy and execution long after we did, and may I suspect have even taken inspiration from our proposals, have actually gone out and implemented the idea.</P>
    <P>The separation of policy and execution has much to recommend it.  It allows managers in the areas concerned to devote their energies to the delivery of the public services for which they are responsible; at present they have an additional function as policy advisers to Ministers.  Ministers rather than their officials are widely regarded as being constitutionally and legally responsible for all aspects of the of Departments. Civil servants are, accordingly, much influenced in their performance by the <Col N="1733" /> parliamentary accountability of their Ministers.  As a result, they tend to exercise a level of caution in their actions and feel the need to maintain a volume of records which may not be commensurate with the efficient discharge of major services to the public.</P>
    <P>Managers in large service oriented sections or divisions of Departments ought to be freed from the constraints which the existing arrangements impose.  I see this change as closely linked to the moves, which I intend to initiate separately, to improve the delivery of public services generally; working smarter not necessarily harder is what it is mainly about.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish, not to say misleading, if I were not to acknowledge that there are bound to be difficulties associated with the separation of policy and its execution, not least of which is the fact that, in some instances, the dividing line between the two is not at all clear cut and in certain cases may come down to a judgment call while in others, it may well be that the lines are so blurred that no meaningful distinction between the two can be drawn. These observations are not counsels of despair, rather they represent a realistic acknowledgement that the road ahead may be bumpy.  However, I would never regard such a consideration as a reason for not starting out on the journey and seeing it through to the end.</P>
    <P>The second strand of our review of the 1924 Act concerns the doctrine of the Minister as corporation sole.  Much learned argument has been advanced about the significance of this principle. The Devlin report concluded that the implication of this was that the Minister &ldquo;in law, must himself make all decisions relating to his Department.&rdquo;.  That report went on to say that &ldquo;this legal imperative remains a polite fiction. Daily a multitude of decisions are taken by civil servants in every Department of State without reference to the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A similar view was taken by the White Paper, <i>Serving the Country Better</i>, where it was observed that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> Except in a very few instances, the Minister has not been given power to delegate the discharge of his functions even to staff at the highest level in his Department.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the views expressed in these eminent reports, the question of what the corporation sole concept actually means may not be quite so black and white.  There is another school of thought which says that under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Constitution, the power of the State may be exercised by the Government or, through delegation, by Departments of State.  This recognition, that Departments and Ministers are distinct entities, seems to be implicit even in the Long Title of the 1924 Act, which commences with the words &ldquo;An Act for constituting and defining the Ministers and Departments of State in Saorstat Éireann....&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Government is not content to continue with this situation of legal ambiguity.  We intend to undertake the necessary research, both administrative and legal, in order to arrive at a more definitive interpretation of the position. It might, of course, as a result emerge from these investigations that what I might call the more narrow, conventional interpretation of the corporation sole doctrine, which would vest all power and responsibility in the Minister and in the Minister alone, is in fact the correct one.  If so, then we will initiate the necessary statutory amendments to ensure that the legal framework corresponds with the practical necessities of public administration.  It will be immediately evident that if we are to pursue the notion of hiving off large parts of Departments and forming them into executive agencies operationally free from their parent Departments, as I indicated earlier, then we must know precisely where the dividing line between the power of Ministers and that of their civil servants resides.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Department of Finance has been moving away from tight centralised control over public <Col N="1735" /> expenditure.  Considerable delegation of detailed expenditure has already been allowed to Civil Service Departments. On the control of administrative costs front, which includes such items as staffing, engagement of consultants, office accommodation, telecommunications costs and so on, considerable freedoms have also been delegated to Departments. The strategic management initiative envisages that this process will be continued so that the maximum possible level of delegation of spending powers, consistent with retaining overall budgetary control, should be made. What we are seeking is to develop a cooperative, open relationship between the Department of Finance and spending Departments.</P>
    <P>Of course, the review of the Ministers and Secretaries Act is but one element in the Government's comprehensive programme of public service reform. We have a number of other red hot pokers in the fire, including legislation to open up public access to official information &mdash; freedom of information legislation, once enacted, will be my responsibility to implement &mdash; improvements in physical access to information and rights for both able-bodied citizens and those with disability; overhauling of the facilities available for community information, building on the network already in existence in the voluntary and statutory sectors; putting in place structures and funding to return the greatest amount of opportunities to an effective and accountable administration; an Administrative Procedures Act, which will be drafted and which will vest in the Office of the Ombudsman monitoring and regulatory functions aimed at ensuring that the citizen gets the best possible service every time he or she has dealings with the various branches of our public administration; the review of the legislation underpinning the Ombudsman with the objective of extending the remit of the Office; exemptions from that office's powers will also be given specific attention. Major Oireachtas reforms will be <Col N="1736" /> initiated, including the introduction of privilege and compellability legislation to enhance the investigative powers of Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>The unifying factor behind all of these changes is the wish to make our democracy a living, day-to-day reality for every citizen.  All of this amounts to an ambitious programme.  I firmly believe that the various elements which are essential to its success are in place. There is firm political will for public service reform, even where this means that political office holders may have to make adjustments to some of their traditional roles and practices.  There is an unprecedented level of enthusiasm and determination for change among the ranks of our Civil Service.  This is most important.  I am reliably informed that our civil servants no longer take their inspiration from the young St. Augustine: &ldquo;Lord, reform me, but not yet&rdquo;. Finally, we have the reassurance of knowing that there is a strong trend towards the reform of public services in many western democracies which can provide us with inspiration as well as advance warnings against certain pit falls.</P>
    <P>I accept and appreciate very much the point made by Senator Quinn that this is all about evolution and not revolution. Attempts in the past might be deemed to have failed because they were imposed from the outside in or from the top down.  Evolution, with politicians and civil servants going forward together, is the way we will achieve the important changes which are so necessary in the age in which we now live.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by Senator Lee about the danger of relying on executive summaries which give conclusions without outlining any of the evidence.  This is a most important point.  I also agree with his assessment of consultants.  There are some excellent people in that field, some self-appointed. It is really a case of buyer beware in this entire area.  We want to know and appreciate the type of knowledge we are buying or inviting before <Col N="1737" /> we get into the whole field of consultants.</P>
    <P>There was a plea from Senator Lee for the co-ordination of departmental functions.  This will be one of my most important and delicate areas of reform. One of the great scandals of the Houses of Parliament in the last few years is the little work we have done in the child care area.  One of the real reasons, which has never been admitted, as to why progress has been so scandalously slow is because the functions of child care are the remit of three separate Departments &mdash; the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.  One could never get them to sit down and agree a programme on which to go forward. What the Department of Health wanted was not approved of by the Departments of Health and Justice. What the Department of Justice wanted, the other two were out of step with.  This Government has recognised, in the appointment of Deputy Currie as Minister of State with responsibility in these three Departments, the need for horizontal co-ordination of functions through Departments and not just having vertical functions with each Department standing alone.  Child care is an easy example of how we have failed to proceed in a critical area because of lack of co-ordination of departmental functions. I entirely agree with the case made by Senator Lee on this point and the Government has already taken it on board.</P>
    <P>It will be a particular responsibility of mine to ensure that Departments work smarter, not necessarily harder.  Most civil and public servants with whom I come in contact work hard, but not always smartly.  Those in the Civil Service and those of us politically charged with this job should, together, make the radical reforms which are necessary through evolution and not revolution, to borrow the words of Senator Quinn.  I appreciate the opportunity to put my views on the record and the interest shown by the Seanad in forwarding this motion this evening.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on taking up what I regard as far from being a brief which is difficult.  It is probably the most exciting brief in Government.  In 1979 Mr. Ray MacSharry was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for public service reform.  I spoke to him that night. He said that when he first received word of his appointment, he wondered about the brief.  As he thought about it through the day he realised it gave him a canvass on which he could draw and he went from strength to strength.  I have no doubt that the Minister sees this brief as a challenge and a canvass on which she will make a very big impression.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is committed to making Ireland's public administration system more responsive to the needs of the Irish people, more effective and more relevant to the challenges of modern government.  One area personally tagged for reform by our party leader in the aborted negotiations with the Labour Party last December was the specific issue of ministerial responsibility and the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  It is flattering to myself, having had some small part in drafting the programme for Government put before the two parties at the time, that the current Government's programme endorses in every regard &mdash; full stops, commas and all &mdash; the proposals we made to our then partners in Government.</P>
      <P>We will be very active in supporting any measures coming from any side to bring forward all of the public service reforms outlined by the Minister tonight.  The Minister will have a very supportive ally on this side of the House.  It is our intention, if we feel she is dragging her heels or some of her Civil Service colleagues do not see this in the same urgent light she sees it, to assist her with Private Members' legislation and we look forward to doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>At the heart of our public administration system lies the theory of ministerial responsibility.  It is a costly farce which has long since deserved to be consigned to the bin of unworkable administrative theories and ideas carried over from the Victorian era.  In 1969, as the Minister pointed out, the report of the Public Service Organisation Review Group found that the doctrine of ministerial responsibility was the primary influence on the organisation of the Departments of State. Invariably, the doctrine sees the Minister as being the heart of the Department. All the acts of the Department are deemed to be the acts of the Minister. The Minister, with the exception of some well defined areas, is answerable to the Dáil for each and every action and every decision of the Department. The same report diagnosed the consequences of Ireland's adherence to this Victorian hangover as being an administration which is excessively centralised, secretive and bureaucratic in its nature; an administration where the top management is focused on day-to-day detail which would be handled at the most junior level in the private sector; an administration where planning and strategic thinking is continuously displaced by more mundane matters and, above all, an administration where communications between the administration itself, the public and the press are not as open as they should be in a modern democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Public Service Organisation Review Group also recognised that ministerial responsibility was largely a fiction and that &ldquo;with the complexity of administration and the mass of detail to be covered it would be impossible for any Minister to have direct personal knowledge of all operations of his department&rdquo;.  We have 15 Ministers and in excess of 35,000 civil servants.  It is a farce to suggest that every Minister should have detailed knowledge and personal responsibility, as opposed to answerability in the broader sense, for the actions of each and every civil servant. It is time that we as politicians <Col N="1740" /> accepted that it was a farce and stopped using the farce, as we all do, when it suits us.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting speeches in the Dáil last week may have been made by the Minister herself, suggesting that the legal interpretation traditionally given to ministerial responsibility was excessively restrictive.  I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister and would go further in saying that not only is it excessively restrictive but that the interpretation which is being given to ministerial responsibility &mdash; to the concept since 1924 of the Minister as a corporation sole &mdash; is wrong.  It has suited many people within the administration and many of us within politics to go along with this wrong-headed interpretation.</P>
    <P>The way we have traditionally interpreted the doctrine is also highly costly. Not only has it meant that top management has been deflected from planning to day to day matters, but it has also had other direct impacts.  It has resulted in our Civil Service being excessively secretive, unwilling to be open with information, becoming decidedly non-client in its approach and being regarded as a hostile area for the public. It has also resulted in our Civil Service being costly in financial terms because simple decisions pass through many costly layers of administration before they are made.</P>
    <P>It is also, of course, costly in political terms.  Irish political clientelism is directly related to the close nature of our State institutions.  There is another cost.  Matters which have nothing to with politics become politicised.  We had a number of interesting examples of the latter in the last 12 months; and if we went back over the last 12 years, when different parties were on different sides of the other House, we would have seen many other examples.  For example, in the Galmoy affair a particularly narrow view of ministerial responsibility was taken by Opposition spokespersons. That debate took place a quarter of a century after the publication of the Devlin report.  Twenty-five years after <Col N="1741" /> the publication of the PSORG the extraordinary thing is that politicians who should have known better, and press commentators who did know better, were, for the convenience of the motion, reverting to an interpretation of the concept of ministerial responsibility that did not even apply when Queen Victoria was a girl in order to give a little stick to a Minister who found himself in some difficulties at that time.  I have no doubt that if the boot were on the other foot in the Lower House right now, you would find equally perverse views of ministerial responsibility being taken.</P>
    <P>The nonsense which we witnessed at that time is not good for politics or public administration.  If those who were trumpeting for Deputy Brian Cowen's head at that time had really cared a fig for public administration they would and should have used the affair &mdash; particularly when a civil servant made a public commentary at the time &mdash; as an opportunity to re-open the debate. Instead it was used, as we all characteristically use it, as a stick to punish a political opponent.</P>
    <P>At the end of the year the Smyth affair was even more extraordinary. When we come to think of the whole Whelehan-Smyth affair we will see that it is a watershed in political terms, not just because of the events themselves but because it will rank on a par with the Critchell Down case in the history of public administration with regard to how we interpret ministerial responsibility. Like the Critchell Down case, it illustrated how a politician who could not conceivably have known of the existence of a particular thing &mdash; in that case the Duggan file lying in a civil servant's drawer &mdash; was ultimately answerable for that action.  As politicians we are all vulnerable to be answerable for things beyond our control if this farce of ministerial responsibility is continued.  It is right and proper that politicians should answer for those things they are involved in, for the policies they produce, but it is not right that accidents of the moment should become the basis <Col N="1742" /> for political head-hunting exercises.  I do not say that while standing on any high moral ground, because there has been an awful lot of political standing on high moral ground in recent years.  We all do it when it suits us and I am suggesting that it is time we got this farce out of the way.</P>
    <P>Another clear problem is that ministerial responsibility has operated as a dead hand on the abundance of ingenuity that operates within the Civil Service. Politics has suffered badly because of the way we interpret ministerial responsibility, but so too has public administration.  There is a huge amount of genius, a huge number of extraordinarily capable people within the Civil Service who are continuously impeded from moving forward and fully achieving all they can.  It is wrong that top management in the Civil Service should be ensnared in day to day activities.  It is perverse to have Ministers answering petty questions in the Lower House.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning will know that at one time I was a collector of odd parliamentary questions.  One of the oddest arose many years ago when a Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Finance was asked for an explanation of the colour that the DVO offices were painted in Naas.  What a waste of public time.  What an absolutely perverse application of the concept of ministerial responsibility.  Among my collection there was also a parliamentary question about the crown ewe population in the Bourne Vincent Memorial Park.  Politicians who use the parliamentary system, which derives from the concept of ministerial responsibility, in that way do not deserve to be taken seriously, and it is clear that they do not take the whole process of Government seriously.</P>
    <P>Ministerial responsibility is a farce at the heart of public administration.  I agree wholeheartedly with everything the Minister has said, but I would make one point which is not in any sense pugnacious or to undermine the Minister. In her speech the Minister made the point about needing to study the matter and looking into the legal ambiguity.  I <Col N="1743" /> suggest to the Minister and the public servants present that there is no ambiguity about this matter at all.  Since the foundation of this State we have established over 60 executive agencies.  Many of those non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, as the Devlin report pointed out, are by regulation simply hiving off areas which otherwise would have been dealt with within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>In the period immediately after the Devlin report the kind of study which the Minister mentioned was undertaken by senior personnel and was at least the subject of discussion among senior civil servants at that time.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister and the Department that they should not waste any time trying to consider how many administrative angels can dance on the head of a pin.  The narrow, conservative interpretation &mdash; to use the Minister's own words &mdash; is not relevant.  The reality is that the Ministers in this Government should do as has been done in the last few years in the Department of Social Welfare, and make a conscious effort to identify stand-alone executive areas of their Departments.  If necessary they should make the required ministerial orders and simply set them up as an Aireacht or executive units as envisaged in the Devlin report.  If that approach is adopted, always provided that the public interest is defended &mdash; and it is, because we have an Ombudsman &mdash; you will find willing support from this side of the House.  I welcome the Minister to the House and look forward to working with her over the next few years.  I am sorely tempted to use the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; word but I will resist the temptation this time.</P>

For many years she was involved in local authorities; she knows the health boards and was a Junior Minister in the Departments of the Environment and Finance.  She knows the area well and the portfolio we are discussing tonight suits her.  I have no doubt she will do a very good job.</P>
      <P>At the end of the Minister's speech, in relation to the Child Care Act, she mentioned that there were duplications between the Departments of Health, Justice and Education.  Senator Quinn mentioned the duplication between the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Environment. I am delighted the Minister said this Government intends to co-ordinate those areas.  She addressed that in her speech when she said:</P>
      <P>This is a radical agenda.  When implemented it will transform the organisation of the Civil Service, it will clarify and, if necessary, redefine the respective roles of the Ministers and civil servants and finally, it will accord significant additional financial autonomy to Departments.</P>
      <P>That is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned working smarter not necessarily harder which is what it is all about.  Nobody knows that better than she because, as I said, she was a member of the local authority and a Junior Minister.  I have no doubt she will address those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the drafting of an administrative procedures Act.  It will vest in the Office of the Ombudsman monitoring and regulatory functions aimed at ensuring that the citizen gets the best possible service every time he or she has dealings with the various branches of our public administration. It is also proposed to review the legislation underpinning the Ombudsman with the object of <Col N="1745" /> extending the remit of the office. Exemptions from that office's powers will be given specific attention.</P>
    <P>I pointed out last week that in 1992 there were 3,500 complaints from the public to the Ombudsman.  Senator Roche said that in 1979 Ray MacSharry had responsibility for this area of the public service.  John Boland, a former Minister, initiated some reforms in the public service.  He got rid of the hatches, with which we were all familiar, in motor taxation offices and in the health boards where officials dealt with the public.</P>
    <P>The public should be treated as clients, not as just another problem. When we consider that the Ombudsman received 3,500 complaints from the public we realise there must be many more complaints out there.  Most of the problems concerned the local authorities.  I have no doubt the Minister will also address that area.</P>
    <P>When I spoke last week I mentioned Braintree local authority on the outskirts of Essex.  It is a small town in England but compared with our small towns, it is quite large with a population of 100,000.  They were shocked when 5,000 people were put on the dole and the manager of the local authority decided that he would get working and put new ideas in place in the local authority. The Braintree local authority is now a model for all other local authorities throughout the UK.  Business people come from all over England to examine the system in place there.  I have no doubt that can be extended to all the local authorities in this country and to the public service because we need better services.</P>
    <P>We need a more efficient and courteous public service because the people should get a civil answer when they ask about their entitlements.  Their queries should not be put on the long finger. Members of the public should be made aware that when they make applications, they will get their entitlements; <Col N="1746" />&ldquo;pull&rdquo; will not work.  This would reduce the workload of public representatives because a third of our work is sorting out problems for people who are not entitled to that for which they have applied and, at the end of the day, we are not able to help them.  If they could get that information straight from the public service or local authority, it would be easier for them and for us.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee said there was not a great awareness among the public about reform of the local authorities and the public service.  In my experience there is a great awareness among the public about the public service and the local authorities and reforms to make them more open and customer friendly.  I have no doubt the Minister will address this matter.  She has the experience and ability to do so.</P>
    <P>I congratulate her again.  I know she will do an excellent job and we look forward to the reforms she mentioned.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was not here last week because I would certainly have taken part in that debate.  I might have said some things that might not have made the Minister smile.  I would not have voted against the Government on that occasion but I probably would have abstained.  An argument could have been made about the amendment of this Act, that it could be viewed quite <Col N="1747" /> cynically.  However, that was a matter for last week and I will leave it where it belongs &mdash; in the history books.</P>
      <P>This legislation is 70 years old, and I am sure others referred to that fact.  It is now so encrusted with amendments that they more or less outweigh the initial document.  That suggests that it is clearly time for a complete overall because the circumstances have changed.</P>
      <P>This was a new emerging State with a comparatively small Civil Service and bureaucratic element.  We have now developed into a significant member of the European Community with a much more sophisticated network of bureaucracy. I use that term in its clinical application and not as a term of abuse because I believe government can be well served by an adequate and efficient bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>I have nothing against bureaucrats nor have I anything against the Civil Service or the public service.  By and large, they give us excellent public service. From time to time there is tension between the political executive and the Civil Service, for a number of reasons. Tennyson wrote the poem about the river which stated that &ldquo;For men may come and men may go, but I go on forever.&rdquo; Politicians, political heads of Departments and Ministers may come and go, but the Civil Service tends to continue forever and may be required to apply fairly dramatic changes in policy with apparent loyalty and ease of heart, although I have no doubt it urges and advises what it considers to be wiser cautions on the Minister.  Often a good strong Minister, with a mind of his or her own, can do the State good service by overriding that advice.  One should always listen to advice, carefully sift it, take it into consideration and then, if necessary and for good reasons which can be made available to the public, ignore the advice proffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> I remember on one occasion in this Chamber arguing strongly for an amendment with a Minister of the last Government.  The civil servants were whispering in his ear, telling him I was wrong and that he could not accept it. However, he said that his civil servants advised him I was wrong, that he could not do this, but he was the Minister and he was going to do it.  I felt that was what this Chamber was about, pushing through amendments, sometimes in the face of advice from civil servants.  In certain Departments that advice can occasionally be disastrously inadequate, out of date and misleading.  I have had experience of that as well, although not too often.  On the other hand, I am sure there were many occasions when the people sitting behind the Minister had to restrain their smiles at my inadequacy, inaccuracy and the misleading and ill-informed nature of my contribution.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what the Minister said about co-ordinating departmental functions because too often, as the Minister indicated, Departments exist in watertight boxes.  In particular, she instanced an Act in which I have an interest, the Child Care Act, because of the spread of responsibility between the Department of Health, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice.  When that Bill was going through this House &mdash; I think the Minister was here at the time and played a significant role in that debate &mdash; I put forward an amendment which was technically out of order, but the Minister showed his wisdom and flexibility by putting it forward as a Government amendment.  It had to go back to Cabinet because it was a new section introducing guardian <i>ad litem</i> into the Child Care Bill.  However, for a variety of reasons, principally involving finance, that section has never been fully activated.</P>
    <P>One finds that Government can operate like another of my hobby horses, <Col N="1749" /> Dublin Corporation and the public utilities and services.  For example, they dig up the roads, followed by Bord Gáis, the ESB and Telecom Éireann, although each is a different responsibility. There is no co-ordination, even at the level of local government, about what happens in that simple matter of digging up the roads and then repairing the road surface, so one is often left in limbo.  That seems to be bureaucratic paralysis.  If the review of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, can lead to cutting out such bureaucratic paralysis, which is not necessarily all the time the responsibility of the immediate civil servants but is a result of the way in which Departments are organised, then so much the better.</P>
    <P>There is also a certain tension between the accountability of Ministers, on the one hand, and the traditional anonymity of civil servants.  Both must be looked at because, as was quoted in the Minister's speech from the Devlin report, the idea of total ministerial responsibility for every action taken in Departments is a polite fiction.  These are the kind of fictions which are not seen politely by the public and they add to the public's cynicism about public office and politics in this country.  It is not accurate to say that Ministers are always responsible, although sometimes they must take the fall.  But they are not always responsible and when they try to wriggle, it looks bad as far as the public is concerned.  They should be able to say that a decision was taken further down the line and, although they accept technical responsibility if necessary, they did not make that decision.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is the question of the inconsistent application of these rules &mdash; for example.  Cabinet confidentiality, which was the subject of a contentious law case and was supposed to be signed, sealed and delivered and over which people got into serious trouble.  Then during the recent crisis, Cabinet confidentiality went out the <Col N="1750" /> window and people were leaking like sieves all over the place.  In addition, we have a curious situation where in the Galmoy dispute a civil servant, apparently at his own prompting, appeared at a press conference in order to give an explanation of a certain situation.  That breaches a principle.  There is total inconsistency.</P>
    <P>I remember sitting in the Dáil Gallery and listening, for example, to one of the debates which took place during the recent controversy and hearing a reply, which I think was drafted by a civil servant who has been widely named, Mr. Russell, and which was put on the record.  It appeared to specifically finger and name a Deputy on the Opposition benches, Deputy Barrett, and attach around his neck responsibility for an amendment to the 1965 Act, which he immediately and totally disclaimed in the Chamber.  It seems rather strange that an anonymous &mdash; at least at that point &mdash; civil servant should be in a position to finger a politician, whereas the politicians were expected not to name anybody.  Some senior civil servants appeared at the recent inquiry.</P>

The peasant mentality has not died out in this country.  If there were hats and forelocks, they would have been doffed and touched, perhaps because of public school accents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> I am in favour of accountability, openness and open Government and I look to this Government to produce that desired effect.  I believe, knowing the personnel involved, that we stand at least a sporting chance of that happening.</P>

      <P>I join with the other speakers in welcoming the Minister back to the Seanad.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate this issue tonight and I thank the Independent Senators for giving us the opportunity. It is an appropriate topic at this time.  As other speakers said, we are dealing with old legislation, dating back to 1924, which has been amended numerous times.  However, it is appropriate to look at it and to bring it into the modern age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators said, many changes have taken place, particularly in the light of our membership of the EU, and our society and the way we administer our Government and legislation has changed dramatically.  Departments have adapted to that change in the way they have formed and reformed, and responsibilities have changed in accordance with changing needs.  It is appropriate to discuss this issue today.  I am convinced there is a strong political will to implement the change which the Minister has read out from <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, particularly in relation to the reform of the Ministries and Secretaries Act, 1924, and specifically in relation to defining the difference between policy and Executive functions as between ministerial and departmental responsibility. I accept the point others made that this is not an exact science.  One cannot be absolutely certain of how these things can overlap.  Nevertheless, it is essential to define them as well as we can.  We should also bring modern management techniques into the Civil Service; this is a direct responsibility of the Minister.  Terms like &ldquo;quality management&rdquo;<Col N="1752" /> are well known to people in business and it is appropriate to apply that approach to the Civil Service, because it is a large business, one which is in the ownership of the people.</P>
    <P>We are answerable to the people and should not forget that.  Article 6 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>All powers of government, legislative executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State [.]</P>
    <P>We must bear that in mind continually. When we talk about openness, accountability, transparency and other buzz words, we mean we are accountable to the people of Ireland and we have to be seen to be accountable.  There must be maximum access to information.  People must know what is happening in Government and we must ensure it is run with maximum efficiency.  In that context the promise to reform this Act goes hand in hand with other reforms such as the Ethics in Public Office Bill, the Electoral Reform Bill, reform of the Office of the Attorney General and Cabinet confidentiality and freedom of information.  All these aspects are part of one package and will be introduced in that way.  In fairness, during the previous Administration when my party was in Government with Fianna Fáil there was a great deal of movement in that direction also.  This should not be seen as the property of any party or parties. Throughout the House there is an interest in this area and a determination to bring about reform.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the Devlin report and other studies on this issue.  We should acknowledge the work of the Institute of Public Administration in this area.  That body has done much work towards keeping public administration up to date.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee made many good points in his introductory contribution about not getting into a bureaucratic groove or <Col N="1753" /> continuing to do things simply because one has been doing them; rather one should be able to use imagination and initiative and allow the public service to move forward.  As he also said, this must be done as a co-operative venture rather than imposing a way of doing things on public servants and the public service without consulting or working with them, or consulting the unions representing public servants.  This is an important aspect of reform.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a strong defence of our programme managers because they have been much maligned over the last few years.  Our party has also been much maligned for introducing the concept of programme managers, but it has been taken on board by all sides now.  They are an important part of this plan.  Ministers make policy decisions in Cabinet which are implemented in consultation with the public service.  The programme manager works between the formulation and the implementation of the policy. We should congratulate programme managers for the work they have done. Their role will continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be responsible for the system known as the strategic management initiative, which has been mentioned. This will involve setting out objectives, ensuring they are carried out in an efficient way, having targets, monitoring progress, etc.  The House had discussed motions on this matter, especially in relation to the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The best possible models and standards will be used and everyone in the Civil Service will welcome that.</P>
    <P>The same applies to people in local government.  Many people referred to local authorities and many of us are members of those bodies.  A desire to reform that area has been mentioned.  I would support any moves to bring local communities into the decision making process.</P>
    <P>Many speakers mentioned the need to co-ordinate across Departments.  In <Col N="1754" /> the area of child care it is necessary to co-ordinate the Department of Health, the Department of Education and the Department of Social Welfare.  There are many other examples.  Some Members met a number of groups today representing the physically disabled, whose concerns range across the Department of Health, the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment.  Another organisation, Barnardo's, is interested in the child care area and their concerns range across a number of Departments.  The integration of the tax and social welfare systems is also under review, which again involves cross-departmental work.</P>
    <P>These are indications of how times have changed and how we need to adapt our methods to those changes.  Now more than ever we require Ministers, especially Ministers of State, to work across Departments and co-ordinate development so it is of optimum benefit to the people we represent, which is the basic requirement.  We should not be stuck in bureaucratic grooves just because they exist.  We should be willing to change, to be innovative and above all to be accountable, which is the buzz word.  The people who elect us should get not only maximum value but should know what is happening and what decisions are being made in their name.</P>
    <P>I support the proposal by the Independent Senators.  I welcome the role the Minister will be performing and I wish her well in her duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a good example to the rest of us indeed, Senator Manning. I compliment Senator Lee and the Independent Senators on this motion, which <Col N="1755" /> is timely.  The Minister has probably the most important role in the Government because for far too long we talked about major reform of the public service but nothing has happened.  Reform of the public service must go hand in hand with reform of the Oireachtas and the electoral system.</P>
      <P>I will quote from a speech made by the former Taoiseach, the late Seán Lemass, in 1961 in which he addressed this topic.  Before doing so I should say that from my experience of five years in a Department, I found that the quality of people in the public service was second to none.  It was far higher than I believed before I worked directly with public servants.  However, many fine public servants have their abilities stifled by the archaic structures in which they operate.  We should remind ourselves that although we are dealing with an Act dating from 1924, the Ministers and Secretaries Act, it is an archaic and Victorian system of Government which operates in Ireland.  It is past the time for change.</P>
      <P>The late Seán Lemass said:</P>
      <P>Sometime ago I spoke of making every Department of the Government into a development corporation in the particular field of national activity entrusted to it.  I had then in mind the bringing about of a change of attitude and outlook amongst civil servants, a new psychological approach to the Government's development responsibilities, rather than matters of organisation, but all experience teaches that the right kind of organisation can help in developing the right attitudes.  Can we feel certain that the present structure of our civil service tends to encourage the right attitude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is true to say that in some Government Departments there is still a tendency to wait for new ideas to walk in through the door.  It is, perhaps, the normal attitude of an <Col N="1756" /> administrative Department of Government to be passive rather than active, to await proposals from outside, to react mainly to criticism or to pressure of public demand, to avoid the risks of experimentation and innovation and to confine themselves to vetting and improving proposals brought to them by private interests and individuals rather than to generate new ideas themselves.</P>
    <P>That speech was made in 1961; the same speech could be written today.  Lemass goes on to outline his desire to make fundamental changes in the public service. Unfortunately, no major action has been taken by anybody since his passing with the exception perhaps of John Boland, who made a serious attempt to reform the public service, and Noel Dempsey.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to make a success of the task with which she has been entrusted she must opt for fundamental reform.  She must bring modern management techniques to the public service. She must do away with the Victorian pyramid system of responsibility which does not work in the modern age. Indeed, we have seen many examples of how the system has failed.  Although I agree that the programme managers have been successful, I believe they were introduced purely in an attempt to deal with a symptom of the problem rather than with the problem itself. There is a fundamental distrust between civil servants and politicians although it will not be found in day to day dealings with individual civil servants.  The reality is, however, that if that distrust did not exist programme managers would not be required &mdash; civil servants would be able to do the job.</P>
    <P>In my dealings with civil servants I found people who were extremely talented &mdash; as Lemass said, &ldquo;the best brains in the country&rdquo;&mdash; but they had been totally switched off by the bureaucratic archaic system within which they worked.  The attitude was why should <Col N="1757" /> one take a chance when the person who takes it easy all day will probably end up the best off.  That attitude has changed as a result of new systems of promotion and so forth.  However, among the 35,000 civil servants there is no reason for the vast majority of them to put their backs out, as it were, because there is no great reward for doing so.  If I were a middle grade civil servant I would feel exactly the same.</P>
    <P>The only way to change and improve that attitude is to introduce modern management techniques where responsibility becomes far more important.  When I was a Minister of State at the Department of Education the files I received were signed and counter-signed by three and probably four civil servants &mdash; the person who drew up the report, his or her superior who initialled it and possibly made a change in it, the next superior and the next.  I often spoke to the person who was perhaps the first or second to sign the report.  That person was usually top class in every respect: highly educated with possibly a master's degree.  When I asked the person why it was necessary to go through that procedure and why he or she did not take the decision the answer was always the same &mdash;&ldquo;we do not take decisions here, we pass them up&rdquo;.  The Minister, supposedly, takes them but, of course, I never did because they were more than likely already taken.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister introduces the type of management structure or technique to be found in private industry she will not be successful.  If one compares the staffing situation in the banks with that in the Civil Service one can see the difference.  The industrial psychology that applies in some of the American industries located here, such as Intel, and the industrial psychology applied in, for example, the Department of Education are absolutely worlds apart.</P>
    <P>The other fundamental problem is that the present system leads to the type of difficulties we have seen in recent months where ministerial responsibility <Col N="1758" /> means that the Minister is responsible while, nine times out of ten, it is impossible for the Minister to keep an eye on everything that is happening.  Consequently, the bureaucracy involved in decision making is a serious hindrance to progress.  The result more often than not is that no progress is made.  Indeed, civil servants who are anxious to get on with the job and see progress are often stunted by their inability to get in to see a Minister or to be promoted.</P>
    <P>The final difficulty I wish to mention is that which exists in the public service <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Oireachtas.  Politicians will be unable to reform the public service properly until we reform the electoral system and the Oireachtas.  The current electoral system is the primary problem in this country.  Until such time as we change to the single seat transferable vote system politicians will continue to worry about going to funerals and being messengers.  That affects the Dáil and Seanad where our priorities, by and large, are to function as messengers for our constituents rather than as legislators which should be our most important function in the context of the public servants we employ to help us carry out our role.</P>
    <P>The man who was probably our finest politician identified the problem in 1961.  Many of us have talked about it since then but none of us has done anything about it.  The Minister has a major task and I wish her the best of luck with it.  I sincerely hope she makes progress. When she does this country will move forward in leaps and bounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Independent Senators on giving us an opportunity to debate this motion.  I welcome the motion for two reasons: first, it is intrinsically worthwhile and, second, it does not require a vote which makes life easier on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister.  This is the second time in the last 24 hours I have had the opportunity to listen to her outline different aspects of her job and how she intends to approach it.  Having <Col N="1759" /> heard what she had to say I believe our decision last week to emphatically endorse her appointment will be vindicated. I was particularly taken by the Minister's clear jargon free approach. She laid out in a clear and straightforward way the problems as she saw them and how she intends to tackle them.</P>
    <P>However, one unworthy thought struck me: if all these changes take place what will happen to the Civil Service we all knew and loved?  In particular, what will happen to the Civil Service that provided many fine writers over the years, much of whose writing must have been done while they probably should have been dealing with drains and sewerage and so forth?  I am thinking of people such as Myles na gCopaleen, Conor Cruise-O'Brien who wrote some marvellous historical essays while in the Department of External Affairs, the poet Val Iremonger, the Joycean scholar John Garvin and the historian Leon Ó Broin.  These people produced work of the highest quality while they were senior members of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>There probably is no longer a civil servant like the late Myles na gCopaleen who would arrive to the Customs House with two hats &mdash; he would throw one hat on the hatstand while he slipped out wearing the other hat to refresh himself after the rigours of the previous evening.  A story is told of him arriving in one morning to the late John Garvin, who was his boss.  There was a strong smell of drink and Garvin told him: &ldquo;You smell of stale drink.  Go out and come back when there is a smell of fresh drink from you.&rdquo;  The day of that type of Civil Service has gone forever.  We are clearly at the beginning of a brave new world in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was struck by a number of points in the debate this evening.  The first was the recognition of a central aspect to Civil Service reform &mdash; the Minister spoke about it last night and she was reminded of its importance by people in the audience &mdash; and that is that it is not &ldquo;them <i>v.</i> us&rdquo;, it must be a joint effort, and that there is a recognition that there <Col N="1760" /> is a strong will to reform the system within the Civil Service itself, which must be channelled, and for obvious reasons.  People want career opportunities and they want to be rewarded and recognised for work done.  There has to be a distinction between those who simply serve their time and those who make a real effort, and there must be the possibility within reform of recognising this will for real change, which the Minister strongly recognised. No worthwhile reform will take place if there is a conflict situation, if it becomes them <i>versus</i> us, and I am pleased that the Minister also recognises this.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the aspect of co-ordination, another point which is important, and increasingly so.  Only today we were discussing on the Order of Business the question of flooding. Flooding is an act of God in one way, but there is also a range of factors which have made our present situation much worse.  However, clearly the different Departments involved in tackling this problem are not co-ordinated and have not been co-ordinated.  Co-ordination is increasingly important for problems such as this, or such as child care, which can go across the spectrums of our entire lives.</P>
    <P>There was a point I made last week, and a phrase I used which was not meant to be offensive, but there is an extraordinary need for strong second tier leadership, where Ministers of State will lead the task of co-ordinating and leading in these specific areas.  In this respect Senator O'Sullivan mentioned the problem of local government, which is not within the Minister's brief. However, it is necessary that the question of local government reform be placed high on the agenda as it is not there at present.  We do not have meaningful local government.  Hopefully, when the Minister has tackled this job, we will address this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan also mentioned the work of the Institute of Public Administration, and I concur with her remarks.  Over the years the IPA has been pioneering the way in introducing <Col N="1761" /> the ideas for Civil Service reform, and this has often not been fully recognised. Senator Fahey referred to Seán Lemass, and I would not disagree with a word he said.  But the work of people such as Tom Barrington, Des Roche and others in the IPA over a long period of time, often in a hostile and indifferent climate, must be recognised.  Doubtless the Minister will do so in many of the ideas which she will be implementing.</P>
    <P>I was especially pleased tonight by the number of references to former Minister John Boland.  One is always careful in praising John Boland, because one never knows quite what the reaction will be. Senator Lee made the point that administrative reform is not a popular, vote catching exercise.  It may be the most important part of Government, but it gets very few votes and can make many enemies.  Of all Ministers in recent times, John Boland displayed great courage and vision in grasping some of the most thorny issues in public service reform, and little thanks he got for it.  In addition, some of the most innovative ideas of recent times have come from him.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to begin the beatification process of John Boland tonight, but, as in all matters of history and so forth, a person will often be recognised only after they have left office.  It is a good thing tonight therefore that, across the floor of the House, tributes were made to the courage and the vision of John Boland as a reforming Minister for the Public Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give her a large dose of it if she likes, because the idea of programme managers was savaged, unfairly in many ways.  It was an idea which has been around for some time and is a normal feature of Government in most European countries where there <Col N="1762" /> is the <i>Chef de Cabinet</i>, or whatever it is. I have been turned down by the Government in my attempt to make Senator Cosgrave my programme manager, but I will keep trying.  However, it is an important idea and I am happy to put it on the record.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister has this job, that she is the person who has it. She has the right qualities, she is not hampered by any false sense of modesty or diffidence and she will not be shy in putting forward her point of view. However, she also has enormous qualities of tact, endurance and stamina which will also be required for the job.  I wish her well, I know she will be successful and I thank the Independent Senators for giving us an opportunity to discuss this most important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Doyle back to the House, but in her elevated position, and I wish her well.  I heartily endorse the comments which have been made regarding her brief, difficult and widespread as it is.  I am sure that it has been a cause of wry comment around the country, and in her own circles perhaps, that whenever she will be addressed in the future it will cause enormous difficulties for those not acutely aware of protocol to have to go through the whole gamut of the Minister's titles.  However, it is not the title which the Minister is concerned with, but the function of her position, and in that I wish her well.  If I were to look into a crystal ball, which one hears or reads about in fairy stories, and ask it to tell me who it is that should be the person to go into the public service and sort it out, it would come up with the Minister's name, so it was a good choice in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am especially interested in the areas outlined in the Minister's speech to which she intends to devote her period in office.  These include legislation to open up public access to official information, <Col N="1763" /> improvements in physical access to information, rights for both able bodied citizens and those with disabilities, an overhauling of the facilities available for community information, building on a network already in existence in the voluntary and statutory sectors, and so on.</P>
    <P>I pause there.  Perhaps in that context the Minister will consider utilising the public library system more effectively than at present.  It has been part of the policy of the Library Association of Ireland for some time that the public perception of the public libraries &mdash; and perhaps even the official perception of them &mdash; is that they are simply lending libraries, in that if one wishes to borrow a book that is where one goes. However, the range of services which they provide and the whole emphasis of their service has changed dramatically over the past number of years, especially in recent times with the advent of modern technology.  Public libraries are now a focal point for communities. However, they are underfunded, undercapitalised, and yet in many cases, especially in areas of social disadvantage, they are like a beacon of light, not only in an educational but also a social context.  The library is the place to which people will go if they wish to acquire community information on various activities taking place in their area.  It is also the place one will attend if one wishes to learn a foreign language or to seek general information of a reference nature.</P>
    <P>In the overall thrust of the Minister's brief, as it applies to the specific area of utilising the community and voluntary sector, the Minister might consider ways of involving the public library system and making its role, as it is currently defined, more central.  Indeed, the definition and role of the public library system may be a starting point.  In this respect, Mr. Boland was the first Minister to update the 1947 legislation on <Col N="1764" /> libraries, which had been in force from that time.  This was the first major piece of legislation of its kind since the foundation of the State, because the system had been inherited from the British administration.  The amount of legislative reform in the public libraries area is substantial &mdash; and it is something the Minister's officials will advise her on &mdash; but I urge her to consider it in the wider context of the community and voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>In trying to come to terms with Senator Lee's motion and the context in which it was framed, including the historical context &mdash; the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 &mdash; it is interesting that much of the controversy that arose over the last few months as to the role and function of civil servants <i>vis-a-vis</i> their relationship with Ministers and the collective responsibility concept of Ministers in Cabinet were aspects of the Act which did not, it appears, exercise the minds of our predecessors in either House.  They were more concerned &mdash; and perhaps it is not all that strange in view of the debate in the House last week &mdash; about extra jobs for boys and girls and extra money being incurred by the State, even to the extent of calling for the abolition of several Ministries rather than for the creation of new ones. There was, for example, a call for the abolition of the Department of External Affairs, as it was then known; in fact, it was also know as the publicity Department. Members of both Houses at that time felt that it was serving no useful function and should be abolished.</P>
    <P>There was also severe criticism of the creation of legislation to allow seven new Parliamentary Secretaries; how times have changed.  There was also a great deal of discussion in relation to section 8, which was the creation of a military council.  Those were the areas in which they involved themselves, not the areas which the Minister of State identified or which have arisen in this debate today.  From that point of view, <Col N="1765" /> we have advanced considerably.  It is long past time that the machinery of Government was overhauled.  If that was the thinking at that time, and if that has been the consequence of that thinking over the last 50 or 60 years, then there are an enormous number of cobwebs in the public service which have to be swept away.  That is no reflection on the Civil Service which, as has been remarked here, has been quite outstanding. I can only endorse those remarks.</P>
    <P>Without going into any further detail, I welcome the Minister of State's appointment and the aspects of her appointment which impinge on the areas which we have discussed.  I am sure she will return during her term in office to update us on how she is getting on.  I look forward to contributing to that debate.</P>

      <P>This important motion is asking to expedite an item in the Government programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>  It is great to see that there is such unanimity on this question. It occurred to me, as everybody was speaking, that if the Minister of State had come here last Thursday we might not have had such an acrimonious debate in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>Reform of the 1924 Ministers and Secretaries Act is just one of the measures needed to reform institutions and procedures which still largely have their roots in the 18th and 19th centuries, a time when Government trickled down from the top.  Much play was made in the other Chamber about openness, accountability and transparency, mainly, of course, by those who when in Government themselves were anything but open, transparent and accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government has mushroomed over the past two or three decades and generally that growth has been in the public interest.  However, the growth of Government means that a plethora of individuals are now responsible for areas of Government which had not <Col N="1766" /> even been thought of in the 1920s, such as technology, tourism and social welfare, to name just a few.</P>
    <P>Reforming the 1924 Ministers and Secretaries Act will give Ministers greater flexibility and ensure that the structures are put in place through which civil servants can account for their actions.  However, reform of the Act must not be seen in isolation from other institutional reforms to which this Government is committed and to which my party, Democratic Left, is fully committed to supporting.</P>
    <P>The referendum on Cabinet confidentiality is vital to ensure that citizens are not kept in the dark by those elected to govern.  The freedom of information legislation will copperfasten the public's right to know, a right which is essential in any civilised democracy.  Under the counter Government has been the norm for far too long.  The carefully engineered leak and counter leak have become institutionalised.  Freedom of information legislation will ensure that citizens have increased access to information in the possession of the State, both about themselves and the workings of Government.  Access, however, is worth little unless it is free.  In this regard, I hope that the public will not be charged a fee for information obtained under the forthcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>For far too long, the interests of the public have been weighed against the interests of Government and, generally, the public has lost out.  The reform outlined in the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> will, I hope, result in a change in our political culture, a change which will ensure that democratic rights are not just exercised every few years at the polls.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I very much welcomed her speech but after Senator Manning spoke I was not quite so enthusiastic; we must go forward cautiously. I remembered the splendid literary <Col N="1767" /> work my friend, Hugh Leonard, did when he was a temporary clerk for 14 years in the Land Commission.  He has assured me that his work for the Land Commission was not quite so splendid, which is why he never did the Irish exam so that he could be made permanent.</P>
      <P>Last week when we were debating the legislation to approve the Minister of State's appointment and that of Deputy Carey, I was very taken by the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, specifically put forward for Deputy Doyle the fact that the strategic management initiative within Departments was to be under her control.  This is extremely important.  I am delighted the Government decided to continue this initiative which was initiated by the last Government.</P>
      <P>Great contributions can be made by all Departments if changes are made. This will, naturally, make a great contribution to national development, the provision of services for the public and the efficient and effective use of resources.  It is important to remember that within the public service resources are more than money, they include the people who work there.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State stressed, as did other Senators, the importance of co-ordinating work between Departments. This is one of the areas where there has been most waste.  I hope to see much better co-ordination between Departments after the Minister of State's term in office.  The strategic management initiative will examine existing practices to see how they can be improved.  I am glad we have stressed evolution rather than revolution.  This is an area where many people are looking forward to enthusiastically taking part in the solutions to the problems which exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad John Boland was mentioned by so many speakers.  I remember trying to deal with the Civil Service before John Boland did his initial work. <Col N="1768" /> It was impossible to get civil servants' names, it was as basic as that; when one telephoned an office they were not permitted to give their names.  I remember even that change as being revolutionary.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a member of the public service outside this House, I naturally have to accept the praise given to all of us tonight &mdash; that we are intelligent, hardworking, dedicated people. However, we could improve in some areas and I hope we will not be too resistant to change.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris was right to refer to the committee which met in Kildare House.  It gave us a very clear insight into a most important part of the Civil Service, the Attorney General's Office. As Senator Lee said, it was dreadful that people had so little time to think. The civil servant in charge of a file which was in a drawer for seven months said that if he had had three days he could have solved the problem, but he had no time to address it.  Probably, in seven months a man of his calibre could have written a Ph.D. thesis on the entire policy regarding extradition in this country.  It is most important that we try to straighten out these areas.</P>
    <P>Every time I come into the Seanad I learn something, and this evening I learned something from the Minister of State.  When we were talking about promoting policy matters and separating them from the executive, I was reading the speech and it referred to the doctrine of the Minister's corporate sole.  I said to Senator Quinn, who is always my adviser in matters such as this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like the Minister of State to also be the &ldquo;corporate soul&rdquo;, to have time to add inspiration to the development of policy and <Col N="1769" /> so forth, and not for it to be just an executive function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the Cathaoirleach's welcoming remarks.  I am pleased to be part of a small piece of history as Minister of State, Deputy Allen, addresses the Seanad for the first time on the Adjournment.  The Minister is familiar with the wording of the motion as he addressed a similar motion <Col N="1770" /> in the Lower House last week. However, I understand that matters have moved on since then and this provides me with an opportunity to discuss the issue without delaying the House by repeating details of which Minister is already aware.</P>
      <P>The original intention of the motion was to attempt to resolve a difficulty which has arisen as a result of the opening of a new community school in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, and the subsequent busing of children through a residential area to get to the school.  Picking up and setting down those children has created enormous difficulties for the residents.  It is now a matter of public controversy in the Carrick-on-Shannon area.  I do not wish to pre-empt what the Minister will say, but I appreciate that there may be some difficulties with regard to the extension of public liability insurance.</P>
      <P>This matter came about as a result of discussions with CIE, which acts as the franchise owners for the Department of Education in the operation of the school bus system.  It was felt that it would help to resolve the problem if the Department extended public liability insurance to the car park of the sports complex adjoining the community school for the purposes of setting down and picking up children at specific times of the day.  It was approached in this fashion because the Department already extends public liability insurance to students using the sports complex, admittedly under supervision. However, I understand there may be other reasons the Department is reluctant to go down this road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to correct the information supplied in the Minister's reply last week. It contained certain inaccuracies, although I appreciate the Minister was acting on the basis of information supplied to him by Bus Éireann which acts as his agent in this matter.  As in all scéil. beidh dhá thaobh, there are two sides to every story.  A substantial amount of correspondence has come on to my desk <Col N="1771" /> in the last 24 hours &mdash; and I have no doubt this also applies to the Minister's desk &mdash; from the Summerhill Residents' Association, referring to a number of these inaccuracies.  The most pertinent is a suggestion that the residents' association had come latterly to this dispute when it had, in fact, alerted the Minister for Education as far back as January 1993 to the potential difficulties which would arise if Bus Éireann insisted on sending its buses through the Summerhill residential area.  I am not sure if I can contribute to a solution to this difficult problem, nor do I expect the Minister to perform miracles.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Summerhill Residents' Association and by extension to the school authorities that the appointment of what are colloquially known as lollipop men or women at the pick up and set down point on the road in question, at the front of the school, might go some way towards alleviating this difficulty. Proposals made for alternative routings for the school buses have been rejected by Bus Éireann and I am interested to know why it has refused to use alternative routes.  Perhaps the Minister will elucidate this point.  The question of providing a road safety service at the school should be explored, perhaps by the school authorities, who are ultimately responsible in this area, or at the Minister's urging.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to a similar situation that exists on the N4, the road which runs from Dublin to Sligo.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with other parts of the country but I use this example because it is the one of which I am most knowledgeable.  There is a school in the middle of the N4 and if one is driving through Longford in the morning or at the end of classes, there is inevitably a huge volume of traffic using the road.  However, there is a lollipop system in place which, presumably, operates without any great difficulty and, allows parents to drop off their <Col N="1772" /> children.  It also allows school buses to drop off children and although this is further back, the children must walk down to that point and negotiate the N4.  A minor county road, a by-road in effect, is involved in the Carrick-on-Shannon situation and it should not be beyond the capacity of Bus Éireann, the Department of Education, the school authorities and the Summerhill Residents' Association to come to some equitable solution.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that there does not seem to have been any reference to a potential problem when the school was being built, although the Summerhill Residents' Association would argue that it alerted the Minister as far back as 1993.  However, I understand that, as a result of the restrictive nature of parking in the immediate school grounds, the school buses would not have access to the school grounds.  This has created the difficulty in that they must allow the children to alight on the public road. The Minister is fully aware of the various aspects of the case but, at the risk of repetition and for the benefit of the Summerhill residents, the children's parents and the school authorities, I ask that whatever reply the Minister gives to the House will go some way towards resolving this problem, which should have been resolved a long time ago.</P>
    <P>If I were to lay blame on any side I would have to put on record my disappointment &mdash; and I will put it no stronger than that &mdash; at the seeming intransigence of the representatives of Bus Éireann in this matter.  They do not seem to have been at all responsive to the genuine fears of local residents considering the various alternatives which were put in place.  Some of these had the active support and participation of Leitrim County Council, which has bent over backwards to progress this problem in whatever way it could as a local authority.  With most of the parties involved willing and anxious to help solve this problem, I suggest that the <Col N="1773" /> Minister nudge his agents.  Bus Éireann in this instance, towards a greater degree of flexibility on this issue.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I wish to thank you for your comments and also Senator Mooney.</P>
      <P>This is a very difficult problem and it is the first problem I have had in relation to school transport and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it surely will not be the last one, but having listened to Senator Mooney, I will be as flexible as I can in order to find a solution.  I understand that this matter has arisen because a group of residents living in the Summerhill area adjacent to the newly opened Carrick-on-Shannon community school object to six school buses which carry pupils to and from the school using the Summerhill Road.  The residents have claimed that the buses will cause traffic congestion in their area and have requested that the buses use an alternative route.  The alternative routes are the Circular Road which, I understand, is narrow and in poor condition and would require upgrading at considerable cost, and a secondary route linking the N4 Dublin-Sligo road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meeting between representatives of Leitrim County Council, Bus Éireann, the Summerhill Residents' Association, the parents' association of the school and the local transport liaison officer was held on 13 January 1995.  At this meeting, a temporary arrangement was agreed &mdash; that, for a two week period, three buses would use the Summerhill Road and the other three buses would use the Circular Road.  I very much regret that when the bus operators tried to revert to the original arrangement last Monday, their passage was made impossible by the blocking of parts of the road leading into the school.  The <Col N="1774" /> only ones who lost out on this were the unfortunate children whose only offence was to want to get to school.</P>
    <P>In planning the building of the new community school in Carrick-on-Shannon the Department envisaged that the Summerhill Road would be used as the school bus route leading to the school. To facilitate the safe alighting and embarking by the students, the Department provided extensive footpaths and a set down point for school buses along the northern perimeter of the school site bordering the public road linking with the Summerhill Road.  The cost of these works was £10,000.  There were no objections whatsoever from local residents while this arrangement was being put in place.  If buses were to use either of the alternative routes, then the designated set down point to the north of the school site would become unusable.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the car park belonging to the sports complex situated to the south of the school should be used as a bus park venue. This proposal would entail a walk of 200 metres for the students.  The sports complex in question is privately owned and is vested in trustees, whose permission would be required to allow for its use as a bus park.  It is not known at this point if this would be forthcoming.  The car park would also require resurfacing and other remedial works &mdash; at considerable further cost.  In addressing the question of insurance in respect of the car park for use as a set down and pick up point for the students who travel to school by school bus, the question of extending the school insurance cover to the car park would have to be considered so as to indemnify the trustees from any insurance claims arising from any accidents or damage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the community schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which might arise.  The State indemnity, <Col N="1775" /> however, does not extend beyond the perimeter of the school premises, except in circumstances where pupils are required to use premises outside the school grounds as part of the school curriculum. For example, in this particular case, the pupils of Carrick-on-Shannon community school use the sports complex for physical education purposes and this is covered by the State indemnity for the duration of their attendance there.  In such circumstances, the school must arrange that there is adequate supervision of the students.</P>
    <P>In view of the significant exposure which would be involved in extending the State indemnity to the car park, and having regard to the expense to which the Department has already gone in providing footpaths and set down points to secure the safety of pupils arriving at and departing from this school, together with the unsuitability of the Circular Road, I could not involve the Exchequer in any additional expenditure in this matter by extending the State indemnity.</P>
    <P>I will consider Senator Mooney's suggestion that we appoint lollipop persons to deal with the road safety services. In view of what Senator Mooney has said tonight and what has already been said to me by Senator Reynolds and Deputy Ellis, I will certainly take on some of the points raised by the three representatives and I will ask that next week one of my officials visit the area and talk to a cross-section of interests and opinions in that area.  I hope that at some stage we can come to a solution to this problem.  I will certainly be as flexible and reasonable as I can but I have to adhere to the situation as it is set out at this stage.  Certainly somebody will visit the area next week to deal with the people involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again I thank the Minister.  It is as much as I would ever expect from Deputy Allen, whom I <Col N="1776" /> know for a long time.  I am pleased that he acknowledged the representations made to him by my colleague, Senator Reynolds, and by Deputy Ellis in the other House because it is very much a consensus among the public representatives and the locals that this matter would be resolved.</P>
      <P>In relation to the sports complex my understanding is that as the Minister quite correctly points out, it is privately owned, but that the trustees would be prepared to allow its use for a bus park. In regard to the question of the Circular Road being unsuitable, when the Minister's official visits the area it will give him, and subsequently the Minister, by extension, a better understanding of the geography of the area as the residents and others see it, and perhaps then the Minister might help to make up his mind and come to the conclusions we all hope will be the right ones in the long term.  As the Minister quite correctly identified, it is ultimately the children who have to be accommodated here as much as anybody else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this Adjournment matter because of the need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the action taken by his Department to limit the loss of milk production at primary level from sensitive zones to other areas of the country, particularly in view of the present situation at Shannonside Co-op. Ballaghadereen.  Shannonside Co-op is owned by three co-operatives in the West, North Connaught Farmers Co-op, Kiltoghert Co-op and Mid-west Farmers Co-op.  These three co-operatives cover the five Connaught <Col N="1777" /> counties.  Collectively they own Shannonside Co-op in Ballaghadereen. Recently one of those co-operatives, Mid-West, took the decision to send 15 million gallons of skim milk from Shannonside in Ballaghadereen to the Nenagh and Tipperary Co-op.</P>
    <P>This, as I see it, will cause two major difficulties for the West.  First, it will cause a loss of jobs and second, it will undermine the viability and future of Shannonside Co-op.  Shannonside currently employs 91 people of whom 34 have been laid off.  We saw what happened in Tuam, for example, where sugar processing no longer continues. We were told when the Tuam sugar factory was closed down that a meat plant would be provided there which would create a substantial number of jobs. That never happened.</P>
    <P>We have seen Ballyforan close down and we now see the peat being transferred from there to Shannonbridge or Lanesboro, again with loss of jobs in the Roscommon area.  In north Roscommon we have seen the closure of the Arigna mines and the power station with huge loss of jobs.  We cannot continue this drain with the risk of 34 jobs immediately and a possible 50 or more jobs later.  I do not see Shannonside survive if it loses the skimmed milk from Mid-West. The operation in Shannonside will not be viable.</P>
    <P>Shannonside is a co-operative which has suffered from mismanagement. Senator Finneran and I were at a meeting recently where the issue was raised. One member from the Ballaghadereen area pointed out that while 34 production workers &mdash; 50 per cent of the production workers &mdash; were let go they still had seven managers, seven secretarial staff and seven supervisors.  I suggest that the management structure is crazy.</P>
    <P>I know it is not possible for the Minister to interfere directly in this dispute since it is a dispute between three co-operatives; I do not blame north Connaught <Col N="1778" /> farmers &mdash; I say this as a farmer &mdash; for transferring their milk supply from Shannonside to Nenagh and Tipperary. They are getting approximately £50 per cow more for their milk by sending it to Nenagh and Tipperary than they were getting by sending it to Shannonside.  A sum of £50 per cow to somebody with 20 cows is £1,000 profit and no farmer can afford to lose that.</P>
    <P>The sizeable article on Shannonside co-operative in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of yesterday clearly highlights the major problems.  I would like to see the Minister and his Department become the honest brokers in this dispute between those three co-operatives.  It is not as simple as getting straight agreement between the co-operatives themselves. The future must lie in those co-operatives, if possible, coming together and getting another major player into milk manufacturing in the West.  As the financial structure of Shannonside would appear to be so weak that it would be impossible for the three existing co-operatives on their own to get the financial structure correct, it is vitally important to try to get the three co-operatives around the table with another player.</P>
    <P>The ICOS has a major role to play in bringing those co-operatives together, as has the IDA in an investment programme to keep Shannonside as a modern milk processing plant and to meet all the new requirements that are laid down for plants of that type.  Without those elements being brought together I cannot see any future for Shannonside Co-operative and I regret having to say that.  It is of vital importance to ensure that jobs are protected in the West.  I have to put on record regretfully that I do not see a future for Shannonside if Mid-West is not part of the pool of milk available to Shannonside.  At this point with the management structure, the cost structure and the price being paid for the milk, I do not see how the suppliers <Col N="1779" /> of Mid-West can continue to supply skimmed milk to Shannonside.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem Mid-West also because it will lose its suppliers to other creameries, whether in Westmeath or east Galway, if they do not increase the price of their milk.  If they cannot get a better price for their skimmed milk they cannot increase the price of their milk.  This is why I ask the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry use its good offices to bring the parties together and to try to get some of the other major companies involved in the manufacturing of milk in Ballaghadereen, and to bring ICOS and the IDA in on the venture also.  I understand substantial finance is needed to bring Shannonside up to the standard of a modern manufacturing plant.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for being here and I would be grateful if his Department could act as an honest broker in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Naughten for sharing his time and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, and congratulate him on his appointment.  I support fully the sentiments expressed by Senator Naughten with regard to the unfortunate development that has taken place at the Shannonside Co-operative in Ballaghadereen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannonside was started in 1970-71 and is a vital cog in the wheel of opportunity for employment and development in the West, in particular on the boundary between Roscommon and Mayo.  The knock-on effect of the threatened withdrawal of Mid-West from the Shannonside Co-operative will bring the operation in Ballaghadereen to a standstill &mdash; it will close it down &mdash; and will cause that which we do not wish to happen &mdash; a further rural decline.  We recently talked about <i>Developing the West Together</i> and the bishops' initiative and it will all seem hollow if we cannot <Col N="1780" /> stave off this disaster for the Ballaghadereen area.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for the Minister to tell any co-operative where to sell its milk.  I appreciate that the Mid-West farmers have a genuine crib and are not satisfied with what they are getting for their milk from Shannonside Co-operative. I have discussed the matter with them; they feel they have lost millions of pounds in recent years by supplying to Shannonside Co-operative.  Nevertheless, it is important that we try to resolve this crisis on the basis that Shannon Co-operative stays and that it continues to get milk from the three co-operatives involved.  Otherwise it will not be viable.</P>
    <P>If it is possible for the Minister, through his good offices, to intervene and act as an honest broker, there may be other opportunities by which he could give support through Government or European aid.  No stone should be left unturned to try to stave off this disaster now staring the people of Ballaghadereen in the face.  Further jobs will be lost &mdash; all the jobs in that factory &mdash; there will be displacement of families as people have to move elsewhere to get jobs and as a consequence there will be a decline of another part of the rural west.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues in Government should do anything they can to aid these people.  The first step would be for him to act as the honest broker; to see if he can bring the people together and work out a strategy to bring Shannonside Co-operative back to viability.  Decisions will have to be taken with regard to reorganisation and rationalisation there and that could be done through the good offices of the Minister and his Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Naughten for bringing this matter to my attention <Col N="1781" /> this evening and I thank Senator Finneran for his contribution.</P>
      <P>While they have outlined the problems in the Ballaghadereen area my reply will refer to the whole subject of milk quotas and milk quota support for small producers.  I will not refer directly to the Senators contributions until the end of mine.</P>
      <P>The operation of the milk quota system in Ireland has always given special treatment to small scale producers and because many of these are situated in the west, north and north-east, consequently these sensitive areas have benefited to the greatest extent from this policy.</P>
      <P>If we go back to the very beginning of the quota system in 1984, even the initial distribution of the quota represented a more advantageous allocation in favour of small scale producers. Each purchaser was allocated a basic quota reflecting the amount of its purchases from producers in the 1983 reference year plus a flat rate allocation of 497 gallons for each producer with a delivery in 1983 of less than 14,000 gallons, and an allocation of 3.55 per cent of 1983 deliveries for each supplier over 14,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>This meant that those purchasers with the highest proportion of small scale producers received the highest percentage increase above their 1983 deliveries. As these purchasers are situated principally in the west and north-east of the country, these areas received 6 to 8 per cent above their level of 1983 deliveries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other special community reserves since then have also favoured small scale producers, and consequently the sensitive areas.  In particular an 11 million gallons reserve allocated in 1989 went principally to small producers.  The allocation to small scale producers situated exclusively in the west and north-east under this reserve was topped up by the allocation of a further 1.7 million gallons in 1991.  A further 6 million gallons reserve was negotiated in the 1993 farm price review most of which went to <Col N="1782" /> small producers.  In conjunction with this 1993 allocation, and in special recognition of the importance of dairying for the social and economic development of sensitive areas, a further scheme was put in place whereby 1.9 million ECU was used to operate a buy up and reallocation scheme in the west, north and north-east only.  Small scale producers supplying purchasers in these areas received a further 1.1 million gallons.</P>
    <P>Apart from these special reserve allocations, the various national arrangements which have been put in place for the redistribution of any quota which becomes available have been based on a policy of prioritisation.  The first priority category for these arrangements are producers with quota of less than 30,000 gallons.  As I already said, the larger number of small scale producers are in the west, north and north-east and these areas, therefore, benefit most from these arrangements.  In the context of the temporary leasing scheme, small scale producers have total priority access to any quota which becomes available in any year through other producers not filling their quota.</P>
    <P>The restructuring schemes which provide for purchase of additional quota on a permanent basis have also given priority access to this category.  As a further encouragement to small producers, particularly those in sensitive areas, to expand their enterprise, two new elements were introduced into this scheme in 1994.  A special subsidy of 50p per gallon towards the cost of restructured quotas was made available.  The principle of ring-fencing of quota with the more severely and the less severely handicapped areas was also implemented in the context of the restructuring scheme.  The purpose was to maintain, in so far as possible in the same region, any quota surrendered by outgoing producers in that region thereby improving the viability of their holdings.  Both these measures have contributed to the success of the restructuring scheme in the disadvantage areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> As in previous years, in the event of a national super levy situation, any unused quota will be redirected in the first instance to small scale producers under the present flexi-milk arrangements.</P>
    <P>A further important factor in maintaining milk production in the sensitive areas is to ensure that producers are in a position to comply with the new hygiene requirements for dairy farms.  To this end a special grant scheme has been put in place which also has special arrangements for small scale milk producers, giving them grant-in-aid of 60 per cent of the cost of their improvement measures.</P>
    <P>In the particular context of Shannonside raised by the Senators, the sale of milk between processors is a commercial matter in which my Department has no role.  Taken together, all the measures I have mentioned, however, represent a commitment to smaller producers and to maintaining milk production in the sensitive areas.  If milk production is encouraged at primary level in these areas, the long term future <Col N="1784" /> of milk processing can only be enhanced.</P>
    <P>In reply to the request made by both Senators about getting the Department involved, it is something I will certainly discuss with them.  If there is a mechanism whereby Department officials could be involved in bringing the three co-operatives together and if it would help, I can see no reason it could not be done. As Senator Finneran pointed out, the Department does not normally become involved in commercial matters within co-operatives.  In this instance, I agree with Senator Naughten that a milk quota is important to many parts of rural Ireland.  If that part of rural Ireland loses its quota, the base of its economy will be lost also.  It is something which I will discuss with both Senators and if an official from the Department can bring the three sides together to work out a better management system and so on, then I am sure it will be for the betterment of the community. I will certainly look at that immediately.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.05 p.m. until the Joint Session at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 February 1995.</P>
