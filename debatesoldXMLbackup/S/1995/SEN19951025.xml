      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to address the problem of delays in the issuing of folios in respect of certain counties by the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to address the public concern at reports that the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland has been abolished.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to include the Theatre Project in Letterkenny on the priority list of projects to be sent to Bord Fáilte for evaluation from a tourism and economic perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Cosgrave's and Mooney's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. <Col N="1822" /> Senator Maloney may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is item 1 until 6 p.m.  By agreement, the first speaker from each group will have 30 minutes and subsequent speakers will have 20 minutes.  Item 15, motion 17, will be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  In the last couple of weeks I have asked the Leader for this House to be given the opportunity to discuss and debate the nuclear policy of the UK.  In view of the decision yesterday by the EU Commission, it is very important for this House to be given an opportunity to send its message to the nuclear industry. I hope that the Leader will find time in this session for that debate.</P>
      <P>The Leader's party had the opportunity at the weekend to discuss the drugs issue.  My colleagues have several ideas and experience in that area and it would be worth while if the Leader afforded time for another debate on the drugs issue which is to the forefront in every village and town in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the Order of Business.  I support what Senator Wright said in respect of the nuclear problem.  I noted yesterday that the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, was against what was happening in England, but what is he going to do about it?  We are all against it, but what is going to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader make time available for a full debate on education?  I understand that there is legislation in preparation which will have a very serious effect on our universities.  It would be a very bad move to interfere in the academic freedom and management of universities, particularly Trinity College, Dublin, which has a centuries old tradition. It is a wise principle that <Col N="1823" /> academics should not be interfered with in any way by the political process.  That principle has stood for centuries and should not be interfered with, which is why I would like these matters to be debated in full here before the legislation comes to this House.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat. Gach bliain bíonn lá na Gaeilge anseo sa Seanad.  An bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire lá na Gaeilge a bheith againn i mbliana?  Almost every year while I have been a Member of the Seanad the Houses of the Oireachtas have had a Lá na Gaeilge where everybody does their utmost to speak a few words of the Irish language.  I would like this custom to be continued in both Houses.  Will the Leader ask the Minister if he intends to have a Lá na Gaeilge this year?</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on nuclear energy.  I am not sure what good a debate would do because it seems that Governments have exhausted almost every avenue in their bid to close down Sellafield.  However, a debate in the House would make people more aware and the public would then rise up with the politicians and object strenuously to nuclear energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's request for a debate on education. I have no illusions about the superior virtue of academics, but one hears disturbing rumours about the intentions of the Minister for Education as regards the governance of higher education.  If there is any foundation to those rumours, they would portend an unfortunate change in the relationship of the State to education.  I hope this issue is clarified as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cabhrú leis an Seanadóir Fitzgerald agus guím go mbeidh Lá na Gaeilge againn sar i bhfad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said about nuclear energy.  I agree with Senator Dardis that the Government should do whatever it can about Sellafield.  It is disappointing that the EU has not been more effective in this area.  We hoped it could have used the considerable powers it has to do something in this regard.  As it has a lot of power over our lives, from the baking of brown bread upwards, I thought it would be able to take strong action, particularly when one EU state is affecting another.  I hope our MEPs will pursue this matter further.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Wright, who called for a debate on drugs.  The principal Minister in this regard is the Minister for Justice, but it also affects other areas such as education and health.  I hope we have a wide-ranging debate which will not just concentrate on justice.</P>

      <P>Cuidím leis an méid atá ráite ag mo chara, an Seanadóir Fitzgerald, i dtaobh Lá na Gaeilge agus an méid atá ráite freisin ag an Seanadóir Lee.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh díospóireacht anseo againn tar éis tamaillín.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on Northern Ireland.  We have a good record in this House for dealing with this issue and it would be an opportunity to clarify some matters which are causing concern.  Nuclear waste in the Irish Sea concerns the North and the South of Ireland.  This common cause is worth discussing in that context.  As spokesman on Northern Ireland, I am anxious to have such a debate because of the concern over the reported refusal of the Taoiseach to meet Mr. John Hume and Mr. Gerry Adams.  We all want to see this process advanced and we do not want to isolate anyone who has been involved in bringing about the peace which everyone has enjoyed for the past 14 months.  I hope we can have such a debate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>When an organisation such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which has been in existence for <Col N="1825" /> 150 years, expresses concern at the growing incidence of attacks on its members, surely it is time for the Minister for Justice to respond to the breakdown of law and order and the spiralling drug problem in the country?  I support the call for a debate on drugs and the breakdown of law and order.  It is shocking that this organisation has made such a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment if he has any plans to change the planning appeals regulations due to the fact that the Masonite plant in County Leitrim applied for planning permission 12 months ago, but it took one year before a decision was made.  I am glad the decision was favourable.  The Government should urgently consider this issue because it has a strong effect on industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the recent High Court decision about Clonmannon. If this House had been listened to two years ago and the actions which all sides called for had been taken at that time, a lot of misery would not have occurred, a lot of tax revenue would not have gone missing and many creditors would not have been as badly hurt as they were.  However, it is better to have some action than none at all.</P>
      <P>When will we see the Government's proposal for a Freedom of Information Bill?  The Leader will recall that when we moved our Bill on Second Stage, I indicated that we would keep it on ice until such time as the Minister had the opportunity to come in with her proposals. I understand the Government is having some difficulties in framing its Freedom of Information Bill.  I do not want to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; but the route it is taking is fraught with difficulties. Can the Leader of the House find out when we will return to that issue, or else it will be necessary to resurrect our Bill, which is still on ice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I join in the concerns expressed about the rumoured changes <Col N="1826" /> in the governance of universities.  It should be debated in this House.  This House has a unique link with the universities. If, as is rumoured and widely reported, the Minister wants to change the governance of universities into a form of quango or a ministerial appointed organisation, it would be a retrograde step and we would all have reason to regret it in the long term. Party affiliation may prevent the Minister from agreeing with me, but I am certain his views on the matter would not be a million miles from mine.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest to the Leader of the House that we make time for a debate on the reports of the Ombudsman. After all, the Ombudsman reports to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As far as I am aware, there has not been a full scale debate on this issue at any time.  A lot of wisdom about the way the public service relates to the citizen is contained in those reports.  We may have looked at one of them in the past but it would be timely to look at the whole operation. The Office of the Ombudsman has been in existence for almost ten years.  It has made a unique contribution and it is bad that its reports should simply gather dust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to a matter I raised last week and I wish to ask the Leader if there is any further information on it.  I can locate some relevance to it in item No. 10, taking note of the reports of the Developments in the European Communities.  The matter I refer to is the question of copyright law.  This was introduced stealthily by the signature of a statutory instrument from Europe with no discussion in either House of the Oireachtas.  When I inquired on this matter, I was told there was a necessity to comply with this by the end of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure, which seriously prejudices the Irish publishing industry by putting people like James Joyce and W.B. Yeats back retrospectively into copyright, has not been signed by most of the other members of the European Community because they are busy trying <Col N="1827" /> to deal with the complexities that will result in their jurisdictions.  It is a great shame that this House did not have the opportunity to discuss such a matter.  I ask the Leader to ensure this occurrence does not happen in future.</P>
    <P>Of course, I am not pointing the finger at our distinguished Leader, but we did have until recently a committee that reviewed secondary legislation in the European Communities and I am sure this falls under the brief of the new Joint Committee on European Affairs or the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  We must rely on them to alert us to this kind of proposal when it comes through.</P>
    <P>I also support my colleagues who raised the question of the serious concerns in university circles about the rumoured attempts to interfere with their management structure.  I am all in favour of greater democracy, but in the matter of university administration this does not seem to me to be the way to go.  A number of my former colleagues in Trinity College Dublin have expressed dismay, concern and real anger and this is not the way for a Government to proceed.  There needs to be good relations between universities and Government.  I ask the Government, if it is contemplating such a proposal, to think again.</P>
    <P>Finally, I note that item No. 8, the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, is on the Order Paper.  When will that be discussed? I am interested in ethics, although I am not claiming the high moral ground &mdash; perish the thought &mdash; but ethical considerations are important.</P>
    <P>Continuing on this line, I ask the Leader if it will be possible to organise a debate on the media in Ireland.  I say this in the full knowledge that the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will invite them in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;press benches are delightfully full today, but some newspapers do not report the proceedings of <Col N="1828" /> this House, which is one of my concerns. Unfortunately, <i>The Cork Examiner</i> appears to be about to drop reporting of the Oireachtas totally.  That is a practical matter; but there are serious ethical concerns, particularly regarding the penetration of the British gutter ethic into this country.  I would welcome an opportunity to deplore the following of Bishop Brendan Comiskey to a private clinic in the United States of America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question from the other side of the House last week, the Leader, Senator Manning, confirmed that the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons will come into force on 1 November, and let us hope it is operated in spirit as well as to the letter.  As the House is aware, I visited UK prisons last September and in HMP Full Sutton we were excellently received.  With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I welcome to the House the chief chaplain of HMP Full Sutton, Reverend Ian Gomersall, and his wife, along with Sister Catherine of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to recall a matter I raised with the Leader last week concerning the attendance of the Minister for Health in the Seanad.  I appreciate he will be here today, but that is to discuss a specific Bill.  Last week I mentioned the crisis looming in the VHI and newspaper reports since have verified that.  This week there is a crisis in the Irish private nursing homes.  The Seanad is a suitable forum for a broad debate on health and a number of issues must be dealt with, such as the White Paper on Mental Health.  It is coming to the <Col N="1829" /> stage that we will have to insist that the Leader ask the Minister to come here for a debate.  Those matters cannot continually be put on the long finger.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach if he agrees with the activities of his Members on the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies in denying a businessman an opportunity to clear his name, when he had so requested?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in calling for a debate on education but perhaps for a different reason, as it would afford me an opportunity to thank the Minister and her officials for arranging that students in St. Patrick's College, Carlow, will now be grant-aided.  This is the first time it has happened in the college's 200 year history and so as far as Carlow is concerned it is both historic and significant. In order to show due respect to the Minister it is appropriate that she should be thanked here.</P>

I also join with other Senators in seeking a debate on the media.  Senator Cassidy and I put down a motion on this at one point but the only other speaker was the current Leader of the House &mdash; that must be a record.  Will there be much more interest in a debate on the media this time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will be.  I also support Senator Reynolds about plannning. The length of time developers are held up and not allowed continue with work is disgraceful.  It costs them both time and headaches.  Many people who could work advantageously for this country have thrown in the towel because of the red tape and cost involved.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to come here for a debate on crime and drugs?  In this city children of ten or 12 are robbing BMWs and ramming Garda cars, but within two hours are back on the streets looking for another car to steal.  What has happened to law and order and when will we come to grips with this?</P>

      <P>I endorse the request of my colleague, Senator Norris, in relation to copyright law.  I am not as enthusiastic about the opposition to it as Senator Norris.  There are many different aspects to this directive and it also <Col N="1831" /> has implications for the public library system.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange a debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader agree with what I hope would be the condemnation of the House of the remarks by representatives of Muintir na hÉireann last week? These bordered on anti semitism and effectively attacked two Jewish Members of the Oireachtas.  There is no place in our culture or ethos for that type of attack or approach, particularly in the emotional environment of the divorce referendum.

      <P>Some time ago Members were circulated with the programme of legislation which would dealt with by the Government.  However, the only agricultural legislative proposals related to bovine diseases, the control of horses and the greyhound industry. Given that programme, there will be little discussion of agriculture in the House in this session and probably the next.  I appeal to the Leader to arrange a debate on agriculture, particularly given the ongoing dispute between the vets and the Minister and his refusal of late to meet the veterinary union.</P>

      <P>I renew my call to the Leader for a general debate on employment. This should take place in the context of an overall debate on the economy. The Leader will be aware that, unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, was unable to be present.  The debate on the Industrial Development Bill, 1995, turned into a technical discussion.  As the yearly Estimates time approaches and bearing in mind the need to keep the Irish budgetary situation in line with the Maastricht criteria for European Monetary Union, could we have a wide ranging debate on employment and the economy with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment present?  There are 300,000 people unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The issue of third level education was raised by a number of speakers.  As I understand it the details of proposed legislation have been sent to the heads of the Irish universities.

The Department of Education has promised a position paper which should be published shortly and it will provide an informed basis for the debate.  It would not be a good idea to see the legislation rushed through.  A position paper would be helpful.  Any legislation will have to respect the distinctive ethos of all of the Irish universities.  That is the position at present as I understand it. The Minister for Education has agreed to come to the House within the next couple of weeks for a debate on education in which it will be possible to raise and expand on these issues.  I will bring any further information to the House.</P>

    <Title>Irish Medicines Board Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to <Col N="1837" /> come before the Seanad today to present the Irish Medicines Board Bill, 1995.  The essential purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a new statutory body to be known as the Irish Medicines Board.  This new board will replace the National Drugs Advisory Board, which was established in 1966 and which, over the years, has given considerable service to the State in ensuring the safety and quality of medicines supplied in this country.</P>
      <P>However, with recent developments in relation to the control and regulation of medicines, not least the establishment of the European Agency for Evaluation of Medicinal Products, it is appropriate that we should review our own regulatory structures and procedures and adapt these to reflect these changing circumstances. Up to now, the Minister for Health has acted as the licensing authority for medicinal products.  However, all applications for such licences, commonly known as product authorisations, were assessed on behalf of the Minister by the NDAB so as to establish the safety, quality and efficacy of the products. Licences were only issued by the Minister on the advice of the NDAB. Similarly, under the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 to 1990, permissions to conduct clinical trials are granted by the Minister, also on the advice of the NDAB.</P>
      <P>For some time now it has been accepted that this involvement of two separate bodies in the process of licensing was both unnecessary and administratively cumbersome.  Indeed, since 1991 it has been Government policy that the licensing functions of the Minister should be transferred to the NDAB. However, in order to successfully transfer the licensing function of the Minister to the NDAB it will be necessary to radically restructure that organisation so as to equip it to take on these additional responsibilities and to make the fundamental change from being an advisory body to being the licensing authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered how best to achieve this transfer of functions from the Minister, I have decided that the <Col N="1838" /> most appropriate way of doing so is to establish, on a statutory basis, a new national medicines licensing authority which will replace the National Drugs Advisory Board.  It will at the same time take over the existing functions of the NDAB and will also assume the licensing function at present exercised by the Minister.  The Bill before the House, therefore, provides for the establishment of the Irish Medicines Board.  This board will become the licensing authority for both human and veterinary medicines and will also be given the responsibility for the granting of permissions to conduct clinical trials.</P>
    <P>The new board will be more compact and different in character from the NDAB.  It is proposed that the board will comprise some nine members and that it should be primarily management in character.  At the same time, it will obviously be necessary that the board should have available to it the range of expertise contained within the current membership of the NDAB.  For this purpose the Bill provides for the establishment of two expert advisory committees, to be known as the Advisory Committee on Human Medicines and the Advisory Committee on Veterinary Medicines.  These advisory committees will be made up of a broad range of experts drawn from the medical, pharmaceutical and veterinary professions such as are currently represented on the National Drugs Advisory Board.  The committees will also be authorised to establish such expert advisory sub-committees as they may require to assist them in their work.</P>
    <P>The functions of the new board shall be broadly those currently exercised by the NDAB but with the additional responsibility of being the licensing authority for human medicines.  The NDAB is currently the licensing authority for veterinary medicines.  The board will also take over responsibility for the granting of permissions to conduct clinical trials and generally assume the responsibilities currently exercised by the Minister under the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987-1990.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> At the same time, the new board will be given a specific responsibility in relation to inspection of the collection, screening, processing and quality control facilities and procedures in respect of human blood, blood components, blood products and plasma derivatives with a view to ensuring the safety of such products.  Senators will be aware that the recent report of the expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board recommended that the implementation of the Government's proposal to transfer the licensing of medicines to the NDAB should be proceeded with.  I am obviously anxious to give early effect to the recommendations contained in that report.  Indeed, this is one of the reasons I am anxious that this legislation should be enacted without delay.</P>
    <P>The board will also become the competent authority in the State for our obligations in relation to the licensing and control of medicines which arise as a consequence of our membership of the European Union.  The new board will also work closely with the newly established European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and will have responsibility for the supervision of any medicines on sale in the State which are licensed by the European Agency.  It is also to be hoped that the board will be in a position to provide services as rapporteurs to the agency for the assessment of applications for European licences.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from establishing the new board and setting out its functions, the Bill, of necessity, provides the legal basis for the transfer of all the functions, responsibilities, assets and liabilities of the National Drugs Advisory Board and, in particular, for the transfer of the staff of the NDAB to the employ of the new board on terms no less favourable than those they enjoyed while in the employ of the NDAB.  The Bill also includes a number of standard provisions relating to State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> The original Government decision in 1991 provided that the board should become self-financing at the earliest possible date.  It is certainly my wish and that of the Government that this will still be an objective for the board; the Bill, as presented, seeks to place such an obligation on the board.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill provides the statutory basis for the regulation of medicine.  The specific details of the licensing scheme will be spelled out in regulations to be made under the Bill.  In this respect, I wish to draw the attention of Senators to a number of commitments in relation to the regulations which I gave to the Dáil and which I reiterate here.  In particular, I undertook to examine the possibility of providing some form of appeals mechanism in the regulations. This was in response to representations made to me by the pharmaceutical industry and concerns expressed by a number of Deputies in the course of the debates in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the regulations should provide a statutory basis for the supply of medicines on the so-called &ldquo;named patient&rdquo; basis.  Heretofore this has operated on a voluntary basis, but it has been recognised for some time that the named patient supply of medicines should be put on a clearly defined statutory basis.  The regulations will seek to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will provide the framework for the future control and regulation of medicines in Ireland and I am happy to commend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is important that we know the content of the regulations before we deal with Committee Stage of the Bill because the contents of those regulations could decide whether we propose amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this legislation to the House.  Things have changed since the time when pharmaceutical companies could market their drugs in Ireland without hindrance.  These drugs were <Col N="1841" /> sometimes of dubious quality.  That changed in 1966 when the Government established the National Drugs Advisory Board whose function was to ensure the safety and quality of all drugs on the Irish market.  I thank the National Drugs Advisory Board for its dedication to the work it has carried out over the last 30 years.  However, the board has run into difficulty.  There is now a very long delay in the processing of applications for both new and renewed licences for medicinal products, which has been a matter of great concern in recent years.  These problems have arisen as a result of the extra functions given to the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>In 1974 a statutory scheme was introduced for the licensing of drugs.  This scheme was extended to blood products in 1983 and to veterinary products in 1985.  All this extra work was given to the National Drugs Advisory Board but resources were not increased significantly and this has contributed to the backlog.  There are now, I understand, more than 1,000 applications awaiting authorisation.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House &mdash; the Irish Medicines Board Bill, 1995 &mdash; broadly speaking, has the support of Fianna Fáil. We must be conscious at this time of the importance of the pharmaceutical industry to this country.  We must also be conscious of a situation where there is an understanding between the board and the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to establish a new medicines board that will take over the authority from the Minister to license medicines, both human and veterinary.  It will also be given the responsibility for the granting of permissions to conduct clinical trials. It is proposed that we delegate power to this board to carry out a statutory function. It is of vital importance that this new board be accountable and responsible and that the highest standards are maintained by the board in the powers that are delegated to it.  We do not want a repeat of the blood bank scandal.  That was an enormous setback to the regulation <Col N="1842" /> of blood products in this country and is something of which the enormity has not been debated and certainly not in this House.  I understand that over 1,000 women have been affected by the negligence of a State agency in this case. It seems quite inappropriate that this matter has not been debated at length in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill will tighten the supervision and inspection of, and the reporting on, the processing of blood and blood products and this is to be welcomed.  I believe the introduction of this Bill was precipitated by the Hederman-O'Brien report, which highlighted in its review of the Blood Transfusion Service Board the need to examine the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board in supervising the licensing of blood products. The facts are that inefficiencies have taken place and a major backlog has been allowed to build up.  Many new drugs have not been introduced because of bureaucratic administrative difficulties on the existing board.  It is quite clear that there was a major breakdown in the preferred activity of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the National Drugs Advisory Board and, indeed, the Department of Health and its public health division, in particular, as it applied itself to the product authorisation for the anti-D product, which was applied for in December 1982 and not issued until October 1986.</P>
    <P>The expert group has noted that the Blood Transfusion Service Board Anti-D was effectively without a valid product authorisation for a number of years and that the authorisation for such an important product was eventually issued on a retrospective basis because of the crisis in the licensing system.  This type of activity cannot be allowed to continue and there is an onus on the Minister and the Government to ensure, in the provisions of this Bill and in the Minister's Department, that we do not have a repetition of what has happened over recent times, particularly as regards the anti-D situation.</P>
    <P>A number of studies have been conducted since the early 1990s regarding <Col N="1843" /> the matter and expert groups have made recommendations.  One of the areas which is not clear to me and does not seem to be contained in the Bill is that the named patients arrangements will continue.  The Minister made mention of it at the end of his speech.  I understand that this process operates under Article 5 of the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984, and these provide for an exemption from product authorisation requirements for the importation or sale of a medical preparation for or to a registered practitioner for the treatment of a particular patient.  This named patient system has been operated informally by the National Drugs Advisory Board.  I would like the Minister to comment on that in his reply and to see if this system will be allowed to continue. I appreciate that the Minister has made some comment on this matter, but we would like something definite as regards the regulations.</P>
    <P>We also had the situation where a replacement for the anti-D product was imported under the named patient category. The expert group did not seem to be happy with that and it did not believe that it was appropriate that the replacement of the anti-D product came within the remit of the named patient system. I would like the Minister to refer to this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>There is worry that the named patients system is open to some abuse and that certain products could be imported for chemical trials.  We would all like to have the matter fully regulated so that the system would not have any loopholes.  I welcome the provisions of the Bill under which product authorisation will be carried out speedily.  Will the Minister set a time limit for the giving of this authorisation?</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister questions about the staffing arrangements and funding of the new board.  It appears from the Bill that the board will have unlimited power to charge fees and I wonder if this is good.  There is also a proposal to make the applicants for <Col N="1844" /> licences liable for all the costs of the board.  The power under the Bill to charge fees is unlimited no matter what the activity.  My reading of the Bill is that fees may be increased to cover the cost; the Minister may have something to say about this.  Is there not a danger that licence fees may go through the roof to maintain funding for the board?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage the Department of Finance or the Department of Health making any contribution to the funding of the board?  Surely funding of the blood transfusion service and public health should be the responsibility of the Exchequer and should not be funded by extra fees imposed on drug companies.</P>
    <P>The pharmaceutical industry is of major importance to the country.  It is a big employer in my county, where over 500 people are employed by the Elan Corporation.  We do not want this Bill to work in any way against the continuation of existing pharmaceutical companies or the setting up of new ones. This is a growth industry: the IDA and Ministers are trying to attract foreign companies to set up in Ireland.  We should not bring forward provisions which will hamstring or inhibit the possibility of this continuing.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unclear about where responsibility ends.  The existing situation is that the National Drugs Advisory Board advises the Minister for Health on all matters pertinent to drugs.  The Minister will appoint the members of the board but, following that, it seems that there will be no direct relationship between him and the board.  I question this.  In recent times a Minister said he was not competent to give information about the National Roads Authority concerning road developments which were being undertaken.  Are we now to have a situation where the Minister will not be answerable to the Oireachtas for the Irish Medicines Board?  This would be inappropriate.  The buck stops with the Minister and the Government and I would like the Minister to clarify this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> To whom will the chief executive officer of the board be responsible?  Will the chief executive officer and the board of directors be obliged to attend committees of the House where they can be questioned about the day to day operations of the board?  It is important, considering what has happened in the past, that the board is accountable, that its activities are transparent and that it is open to questioning and investigation by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister is the person responsible at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>Is it the intention of the board to consult with the pharmaceutical, health care and medical industries?  These industries have an enormous amount of information, knowledge and expertise in this area.  There should certainly be co-operation between the pharmaceutical industry and the board because both are working towards the same end.  The pharmaceutical industry exists to make money but it must also take responsibility for the products it brings forward. It must prove that these products are safe; otherwise there is the prospect of litigation.  The Minister should inform us of the procedures he envisages for such co-operation.</P>
    <P>Will there be indemnity for people working for the Irish Medicines Board? Who will be responsible in the event of litigation by somebody who may be injured by a drug approved by the board?</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is the publication of the annual report.  The present situation as regards the National Drugs Advisory Board is most unsatisfactory. I believe a report has not been published in the past five years.  This cannot be allowed under the new system and board.  The Bill provides that the Irish Medicines Board must file an annual report within six months of the year end.  However, there is a loophole in that it does not state when the Minister must publish the report.  This is not acceptable.  The Minister should amend the Bill so that the report is brought forward as quickly as possible and laid <Col N="1846" /> before the Houses of the Oireachtas within a specified time.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the opportunity for an appeals system against the refusal to grant a licence, which the Minister mentioned in his speech.  There should be some recourse to appeal.  Has the Minister considered the matter?  Is he prepared to amend the legislation to accommodate such an appeals procedure?</P>
    <P>Recently the contraceptive pill made news headlines.  Canadian studies point out that side effects can occur as a result of taking certain brands of the contraceptive pill.  Is the Minister satisfied that the health of Irish women is protected in this situation?  Does this Bill reassure women that their health is not in danger?</P>
    <P>By and large, Fianna Fáil supports the Bill, which is important in the context of public health.  It is welcome and it addresses a situation which has become controversial and which, to some extent, has lost the support of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the public. We all accept that we need an independent competent authority to deal with these matters.  I believe the Irish Medicines Board is an appropriate vehicle but it must have the confidence of the public and the professions.</P>
    <P>I raised a number of matters and I hope the Minister will respond.  If they are not clarified we may table amendments on Committee Stage.  We welcome the Bill which is overdue and, as I said, addresses a controversial and serious situation that has arisen.  I hope the apparent difference between us and the Minister can be resolved on Committee Stage and that the new Irish Medicines Board will carry out its functions in a proper manner in the interests of public health and the safety of our citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am delighted on behalf of my party to support it.  The Bill, while somewhat technical in nature, proposes to replace the National Drugs Advisory Board with a new body <Col N="1847" /> to be known as the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
      <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board was established in 1966 and it is only right that we acknowledge the excellent work it has carried out since then.  The primary role of the National Drugs Advisory Board was advising the Minister for Health on all matters relating to the safety of medicines.  The Minister was the licensing authority, but all applications for licences were subject to scientific assessment by the National Drugs Advisory Board.  It was on the advice of that body that the Minister issued licences.</P>
      <P>It has been recognised for some time that the involvement of two separate organisations in the licensing process was probably not the most effective or efficient way of dealing with such matters. It is not surprising that since 1991 it has been the policy of successive Governments that the licensing function should be carried out by one agency.  I am pleased the Minister has now grasped the nettle and has brought forward this Bill.</P>
      <P>This legislation is timely for a number of reasons.  Senators will be aware that the Report of the Expert Group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board recommended that the licensing of medicines should be devolved from the Minister to the National Drugs Advisory Board or, as is now proposed, to its successor, the Irish Medicines Board.  I would like to read from that report.</P>
      <P>From our investigation of Anti-D, we offer the following conclusions and recommendations relating to the NDAB:</P>
      <P>&mdash;There is an urgent need to strengthen the Board and management of the NDAB so that it can discharge its functions in relation to medicinal products, including blood products, with sufficient speed and efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;We recommend that the NDAB should become the licensing <Col N="1848" /> authority for all medicinal products for human consumption. The present arrangement whereby the Minister for Health issues licences on the advice of the NDAB is cumbersome and unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>If only to implement these recommendations, then the legislation before the House is timely.</P>
    <P>Developments are also taking place at European level in relation to the regulation and control of medicines.  Perhaps the most important of these is the establishment of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicines.  It is important that we in Ireland, while keeping abreast of these developments, put in place structures which will equip us to deal with the challenges and opportunities these developments present.  I hope the new board will build on the expertise and the reputation which the National Drugs Advisory Board enjoys among its European counterparts.  It is crucial that the new board is properly constructed and equipped to play its full role in the new European regulatory environment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the new board will be more compact than its predecessor and, in particular, that greater emphasis will be placed on the management of its character and orientation.  This is important for the success of the new board.  At the same time I recognise that it must have the same range of expertise and advice that was available to the National Drugs Advisory Board. However, the Minister's proposal as set out in the Bill to establish an advisory committee will ensure that the range of expertise required will be available to the board.</P>
    <P>The pharmaceutical industry is a major sector of the economy.  Not only do we have many major international companies operating here, but there is also a considerable indigenous pharmaceutical industry.  It is important that the agencies of Government work in tandem with the industry to ensure that there is no unnecessary bureaucracy in <Col N="1849" /> the regulatory controls.  I am sure the establishment of one agency with overall responsibility for the licensing of medicines will provide a more effective licensing system and as such will be welcomed by the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>It is important that we ensure the highest possible level of protection for the consumer.  This can only be done by ensuring that the medicines we licence and make available are of the highest order as regards their safety, quality and efficacy.  The Irish Medicines Board will have an important role to play in this respect.  I believe it will achieve this high objective.  For that reason, I am pleased to support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Ethics in Public Office Act will not be implemented until the beginning of next year, I want to point out that I also have an interest in this Bill as a medical practitioner, a patient, as someone who has run clinical trials, who has given the pharmaceutical industry advice and hopes to do so again in the future, who has been on some of these boards, who has given advice to the National Drugs Advisory Board and as a member of the public.</P>
      <P>For me this is one of the most important Bills to come before the House.  I am delighted the Minister brought it forward so swiftly.  Mrs. Hederman-O'Brien and her colleagues must be complimented on the report they produced on the Blood Transfusion Service Board; it was instrumental in bringing this Bill forward with such rapidity.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the Bill are welcome, particularly from the point of view that it appears to reduce bureaucratic duplication between the Department of Health and the Minister and the board itself, which always seemed to be a problem with the old National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must be one of the few Members of the House who has been involved with the National Drugs Advisory Board. While it did a great deal of very worthwhile work in the early part of its career, towards the end it was quite obvious <Col N="1850" /> that because of the lack of resources or staff, it was becoming absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of work it had to do.  The serious delays were a major difficulty for many people within the medical and pharmaceutical industries, some of which have already been alluded to.</P>
    <P>One of the many problems was the fact that named patient regulations were grossly abused because there was such a delay in trying to bring in some drugs as it took so long for the board to assess them.  I am sure it was not their fault, but there were terrible delays.  It is important to remember that some new drugs may be very beneficial to patients and, especially if they are only needed on a small scale, doctors will be very anxious to have them as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran spoke about fees.  It is important to remember that in a small country such as this, if the fees are very high for some drugs which may only be of use to a very small number of patients, it may not be worthwhile for the pharmaceutical company to apply for a licence to market the drug here.  I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the named patient regulations will be looked at.  I think that this will be done under the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Sale and Advertising) Regulations, 1994. However, as Senator Finneran said, I hope that we will be told how soon these regulations will be changed.  I do not think that we are the only country which has been in a position to abuse the named patient regulations.  During the blood transfusion debacle last year when Win RHo was brought in here on a named patient basis, I was told that the drug was widely used in North America and on the Continent. However, I discovered after some investigation &mdash; in fact I was told by the FDA &mdash; that it was only being used on a named patient basis in some states in the US and in some countries on the Continent.  It is very serious to allow these regulations to be used for a large <Col N="1851" /> number of patients and I hope that the Irish Medicines Board will look at it very carefully.  Senator Finneran is wise to ask the Minister to let us know when this new regulation regarding named patients is being brought in.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers medical and veterinary drugs.  We are inclined to think that all of these will be prescribed by a doctor, but there is a great increase in the number of over the counter products which can be bought.  Unless the person concerned reads the documentation given out with the drug very carefully, they may get little or no advice &mdash; although some pharmacists are very careful to advise patients about any problems with drugs.  We must remember this when we are increasing the number of drugs which can be bought over the counter.  I am glad that cosmetic products have also been included.</P>
    <P>I am not clear if homeopathic products are included.  Are they included under the Council Directive of January 1965, which I believe provides the definition of medical product in this Bill?  If they are included, what is the definition of homeopathic product? This is a very important because an increasing number of nature products are being produced as well as homeopathic products.  In some cases they have had very serious adverse effects on those who have taken them, particularly if they were taken in amounts in excess of what one would normally recommend.</P>
    <P>This Bill results largely from the report by Mrs. Hederman-O'Brien, which did not show the National Drugs Advisory Board and the Blood Transfusion Service Board in a very good light.  I am glad that the Minister has acted so rapidly.  It was a revelation to me that there were such incredible delays between when a licence was requested and when one was eventually given.  The Win RHo product was imported here for emergency use in February and, even with a great deal of urging &mdash; they must have known the <Col N="1852" /> sense of urgency regarding this product &mdash; it was not licensed by the board until the end of June.  That was a very long delay for a product about which there was a great deal of public worry.</P>
    <P>The first Clinical Trials Bill had to be introduced in 1987 because of the death of a young man on a clinical trial.  The subsequent Bill in 1990 had to be introduced because of worries about immunity, which I will come to later.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very important for the licensing of drugs in this country to ensure that they are efficacious, safe and so on and for their continued monitoring. It is important to remember that the monitoring is as important as the initial licensing of the drug in terms of assessing the side effects found on an international basis.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss Ireland's relationship with the new European drug regulation system.  We have an enviable reputation in assessing medical products and carrying out clinical trials and are asked to do an enormous number of them by pharmaceutical companies.  I was one of those who hoped that the proposed European medical evaluation agency would be established in Ireland.  The Department of Health did lobby for it but I told it to make the bid as vigorous as possible as it would have been splendid to get it.  We did not get it, but that does not mean we will not be in a position to do a great deal of the work which will come from the agency.</P>
    <P>All drugs to be sold within the European Union will have to be sent to this new agency which will be based in London. It will put together dossiers of work on each drug which will be farmed out to various agencies within the European Union.  We are in a splendid position to bid for an enormous number of those dossiers on all biotechnological products.  The committee which will be distributing these dossiers is the committee on proprietary medical products. The financial rewards for just looking at these dossiers will be worth about £50,000 per assessment in the number of people they will employ on a technical and professional basis.  We see in the <Col N="1853" /> newspapers today that the services area of the economy has been the best at increasing employment in this country. It is important to ensure that this Bill is so watertight that the agency will wish to have as many of its evaluations as possible done here.  We already have an extraordinarily high reputation for carrying out clinical trials.  The fact that we speak English is also a great advantage.</P>
    <P>Other Senators pointed out how important the pharmaceutical industry is in this country and how successful we have been in attracting many pharmaceutical companies to set up in this country, mainly because of the very good employees they can get in this field.  I hope that everything possible is done to facilitate the medical, pharmaceutical and veterinary professions in this country to gain as many of these dossiers and evaluate as many drugs as possible.</P>
    <P>The situation which pertained in the old board regarding the under-reporting of adverse reactions to drugs is also very important.  Approximately eight million prescriptions are issued every year by the general medical services.  It has been recognised that there has been gross under-reporting of adverse reactions to drugs.  Approximately one to 2,000 reactions are reported each year.  My profession is worse than the pharmaceutical profession as regards reporting them. This situation must be rectified.  Perhaps the under resourcing of the last board was an important factor and, if that is the case, the new board should be made aware that this is a priority as far as the Department of Health is concerned. Adverse reactions must be reported.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives the new board a remit as regards the safety, quality and efficiency of all medical products in use. Many people feel we have not been vigilant enough under the current system for testing products and assuring their ongoing safety.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the board makes this a priority.</P>
    <P>Last week the committee on safety of medicines in Great Britain issued a <Col N="1854" /> warning to one million women that the contraceptive pill they were taking might not be as safe as had been previously claimed.  It was suggested that the pills under the brand names Femodene, Femodene ED, Minulet, Triodene, TriMinulet, Marvelon and Mencilon, which contain the new progestagen, gestodene, were more likely to cause blood clotting problems than other pills.  These pills had initially been considered safer than other contraceptive pills because they were low oestrogen dosage pills &mdash; oestrogen was implicated in the original pills in the 1960s which caused blood clotting problems.  I did part of my MD thesis on the blood clotting problems associated with those contraceptive pills, although they were then known as period regulating pills because contraceptives were not allowed into the country. Although these pills were totally unsuitable for older women with large families, because they were more likely to have blood clotting problems, they were still the only form of contraception available.  Many of these women felt it was wiser to take them rather than risking another pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The committee on safety of medicines in Great Britain issued the warning last week, but it was greatly criticised for doing so.  The World Health Organisation, which is organising this major trial, was said to be furious.  The trial is incomplete.  Dr. Anne Szarewski, a leading expert on family planning in Great Britain, said the Government's action was &ldquo;irresponsible and premature&rdquo;. Perhaps it was, but I wonder if the fact that members of the committee on safety of medicines could be sued by anyone who got blood clots while on these pills influenced the issuing of this warning.  The committee is currently being sued by Femodene Action and this happened before the World Health Organisation's document got into the public domain.  This may be a serious problem here.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the legal liability of those who serve on the board and its subcommittees and those who give advice to the board.  No matter how <Col N="1855" /> carefully drugs are assessed, it must be appreciated that licences will be issued on a limited amount of information. Animal toxicology and first stage trials are done, second stage trials are done on healthy volunteers and then clinical trials are done on patients.  Most drugs are evaluated on approximately 2,000 people.  This means that if a person has serious side reactions, even as serious as death which may only occur with a certain drug once in every 5,000 to 10,000 cases, it will not show up in the 2,000 patients.  Nothing can be done about this and it does not mean that one is negligent as a result.  Some adverse reactions, even serious ones, will not come to light until the drug is used in the wider community &mdash; for example, on older patients, debilitated patients or on patients who are taking other drugs at the same time.  A serious criticism is often made that the majority of clinical trials are only done on healthy young males.  How do these relate to women? Side effects will occur no matter how careful we are in assessing the drugs involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister and all members of the medical profession know there is a climate of litigation at present.  Companies, as well as individuals, threaten the relevant boards with litigation.  The National Drugs Advisory Board was successfully sued by Scotia Pharmaceuticals. I do not remember the details of the case, but it was a technical matter involving relevant details from one product which were used in assessing another similar product.</P>
    <P>While the board can be sued as a corporate body in a legal action, it does not have tangible assets.  When we look at the experience of what happened in other jurisdictions it is likely that committee members and advisers who have assets could be sued by companies or individuals.  The members of this board will be voluntary, apart from the chairman who will be paid.  If it is established in the same way as the old National Drugs Advisory Board, medical practitioners, nurses and vets will be on it. <Col N="1856" /> The clinical work done by doctors is covered by the medical malpractice insurance agencies, but they have said they will not cover us for doing the work on these boards.  I do not know if the Irish Nurses' Organisation, which has a large indemnity for its members of approximately £1 million, will cover its members on the board and I do not know what will happen as regards the veterinary practitioners.  Many people say a good horse or dog is worth more than a human, so they might have the same trouble as well.  This is an important situation which has not yet been considered.</P>
    <P>Anyone the Minister asks to serve on these boards &mdash; we want the best people &mdash; must look at the fact that they could be sued for considerable amounts of money.  The Minister has not indicated what he will do to provide for the legal costs of a defence for these people or how they will cope if awards are granted against members of the board, the committee or its advisers.</P>
    <P>It has been implied that immunity is granted to people on these boards &mdash; for example, those on ethics committees &mdash; under the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1990.  However, this does not seem to be watertight.  The majority of legal opinion believes that the granting of such immunity from prosecution is unconstitutional.  Tomkin and Hanafin's book, <i>Irish Medical Law</i> states:</P>
    <P>S. 5 of the 1990 Act provides an immunity in respect of actions (except in the case of wilful neglect or default) against the Minister for Health, the National Drugs Advisory Board, and its members acting as such, its officers or servants, and ethics committees or any member thereof. The immunity is for actions for damages &lsquo;in respect of any injury to persons or property alleged to have been caused or contributed to by reason of or arising from the discharge of any of their functions imposed by the&rsquo; 1987 and 1990 Acts. [These have now been incorporated into this Bill].</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> S. 5 (2) provides a similar indemnity in respect of claims against the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>A question must be asked about the constitutionality of this section.  It provides an immunity from suit on a subordinate body created by the Oireachtas, [as we are now doing] and, since the State itself is not constitutionally entitled to avail of immunity from suit since <i>Byrne v. Ireland</i>, it follows that any subordinate body might not be so entitled.  This view would seem to be supported by Hogan &amp; Whyte, who discuss immunities in the context of the inconsistency of the State's obligation under Article 40.3 to defend and vindicate the citizen's personal rights. &ldquo;Hogan &amp; Whyte&rdquo; refers to <i>The Irish Constitution</i> by J.M Kelly.</P>
    <P>Since the people the Minister asks to serve on this board will be totally exposed medically and legally, how does he propose to confer indemnity on the members of the board, its staff, committees, sub-committees and expert advisers?  The foundation of the board, as well as its functioning, could be in jeopardy from its beginning if the Minister does not do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry's speech will be a hard act to follow; it was educational in itself.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board Bill, 1995, has been welcomed by all parties in the Oireachtas because people believe it is important to the health of the general public and is overdue.  The pharmaceutical industry is one of our most successful sectors and it is important that strong links are established between that industry and the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss many issues of major concern to people working in the health area.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a new statutory body to be known as the Irish Medicines <Col N="1858" /> Board.  It will replace the National Drug Advisory Board, which was established in 1966, which has given considerable service to this State in ensuring the safety and quality of medicines.</P>
    <P>There have been major developments in the field of medicine controls, not least the establishment of the European Agency for Evaluation of Medicinal Products.  The role of the NDAB should be reviewed and appropriate structures which take account of these changes in circumstances should now be put in place.  I believe this is what the Minister is doing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the Minister has acted as the licensing authority for all medicinal products.  However, all applications for such licences, commonly known as product authorisations, were assessed on behalf of the Minister by the NDAB so as to establish the safety, quality and efficiency of the product.  Similarly, under the control of the Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 to 1990, permission to conduct clinical trials is granted by the Minister on the advice of the NDAB.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted for some time that this involvement of two separate bodies in the process of licensing was unnecessary and maybe cumbersome administratively.  Since 1991 it has been Government policy that the licensing function should be transferred to the NDAB.  This is already the case in respect of veterinary medicines in that the NDAB is both the assessor and the licensing authority and it is not necessary to have a further stage in the process.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way since the early sixties when companies were allowed to supply drugs to health authorities without full consideration being given to the potency of the drugs being supplied.  Pharmaceutical companies should not be allowed to process or sell their drugs without competent tests or assessments being carried out on them. It is possible that deaths may have occurred in some cases a few years ago because some drugs were suspect.  We must ensure this does not happen again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1859" /> The National Drugs Advisory Board, which was established in 1966 to ensure the safety and efficiency of all drugs on the Irish market, has been in existence for almost 30 years.  This board has served a useful purpose and the people who work there are to be commended for their commitment.  However, the extension of its functions over the last two decades has created problems for it. The extension of its functions without a significant increase in its resources may have contributed to the time it takes to process applications for licences.  I understand there is currently a backlog of approximately 1,250 new applications for products and about 275 renewals. This seems unduly long.  Hopefully, the new board will speed up the process when it comes on stream.  Resources may be needed to allow this to happen and I hope the Government will seriously consider this situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of the Irish Medicines Board which will become the licensing authority for both human and veterinary medicines.  The current board has a membership of 18 while the new board provides for a membership of nine.  Two committees will also be set up within this new board.  I also welcome the establishment of the two advisory committees &mdash; the Advisory Committee on Human Medicines and the Advisory Committee on Veterinary Medicines.  A broad range of experts should be drawn from all areas of medicine to advise the people concerned.</P>
    <P>If we look at the human and veterinary medicines currently on the Irish market, we would have to express major concerns about the lack of assessment and trials being carried out.  I refer specifically to Prozac.  I do not want to create a scare, but many people using this drug over a number of years, especially women, have reacted badly to it.  I would call it a suicide drug because of the reactions I have seen and the way in which people behave when they are on it.  Not enough assessments and trials have been carried out on Prozac and the <Col N="1860" /> Minister should request the current board to seriously consider its full medicinal qualities.  I am extremely concerned about it.  A Channel 4 television programme on the use of Prozac referred to one American State as the Prozac State.  The number of people who committed suicide because they used this drug was unbelievable.  People on the drug have come to me for help. They are concerned and I can understand why.</P>
    <P>Some sportsmen and women are using steroids and some of them have died due to an excess usage of these drugs.  At times we wonder why they are so easily available when we consider the dangers they pose.</P>
    <P>The expert group laid much emphasis on the establishment of the new European Medicines Evaluations Agency which would be of assistance to the NDAB in expediting applications.  Has this been taken into account in the legislation? What effect will the European dimension have on the staffing of the new medicines board?  Will it free up staff in the board and speed up the processes or could it lead to excessive administration, which many have seen happening in other areas where the European dimension has been involved?  I seek clarification on this matter.</P>
    <P>Sections 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the Bill deal with fees and charges.  Will the licensing fees bring in enough money to make the board self-sufficient?  Can the Minister outline what the cost to the Exchequer may be if not enough money comes in from the licence fees?  I know the power to charge fees under the terms of the Bill is unlimited, but will the board have to increase its fees if it needs more resources?  Will this mean that licensing fees will have to increase dramatically?  Is there some way the Minister can indicate what the cost may be to the Department?  Is there anything in the Bill which indicates costings in that sense?</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about ministerial responsibility and ministerial accountability. The present system seems fine <Col N="1861" /> but under the new system what happens after the board is appointed?  It is stated we will receive a report from the board each year, but who will be ultimately responsible?  Will the Minister have people appointed to the board?  What happens if Senators raise questions in the House about problems which may exist with the board?  The Minister is finally responsible, as is clear from what happened in the case of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, but what is the answer if things go wrong?</P>
    <P>The Bill has been welcomed by the pharmaceutical industry, people working in the health services and all political parties in the House.  I have no doubt it will have widespread support among Senators and I commend it to the House.  There will be much more to be said when we come to the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the legislation and join with other Members in expressing appreciation to Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien and the expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board who presented the report.  It is timely to bear in mind that it is as a result of a tragedy &mdash; the contamination of a blood product &mdash; and the effect it has had on 1,000 women that we are now dealing with this Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister and other Senators were speaking I was looking at the report of the expert group because if we introduce legislation we should ensure we improve on what existed before.  It appears the old board did not work tremendously differently from what is proposed in the legislation.  The major difference is that under the old system, to quote the report:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health, through the Department of Health's Public Health Division, issues the licence or authorisation in each case on the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board.  In practice, officers of the Department of Health issue licences and authorisations on behalf of the Minister on the basis of advice given by the NDAB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> There is a suggestion in the Minister's speech and the legislation that he is introducing a major change to what went before.  The impression is given that the Minister went through applications and decided who would get licences; that may have been what was in the previous legislation, but it is not what happened.  The report states that on the recommendation of the board, the Minister granted a licence, as it was his authority.</P>
    <P>The presumption is that if we transfer that responsibility to a new drugs board we will make a dramatic change from the previous procedure and prevent the recent tragedy from happening again.  I am not sure that will happen.  I know it is a recommendation of the expert group, but it may not be a solution to further tragedies and problems in relation to blood products or medicines.</P>
    <P>The report deals specifically with the crisis in the BTSB and its main point is that while the board did not do its work properly, it was totally overloaded and could not cope with its work and additional responsibilities it was given. The report states:</P>
    <P>We were told that over the years the backlog of new applications for first Product Authorisations awaiting examinations by the NDAB continued to grow.  To this backlog were added applications for the renewal of existing authorisations which were then expiring at the end of their five-year periods of validity.  We understand that due to this backlog of applications in the NDAB, new applications for first PAs were given priority by the NDAB, which in turn delayed the issue of PA renewals.</P>
    <P>As Senator Finneran and others have said, blood product, including anti-D, was one of those given a retrospective PA.  I hope we are not carried away in the belief that simply having the board issue the licence will solve the problem, because it appears to be greater than that A number of matters have to be addressed, not least the staffing level in the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> As to how the board works, I welcome the Minister's statement that:</P>
    <P>in order to successfully transfer the licensing function of the Minister to the NDAB [or the new board] it will be necessary to radically restructure that organisation so as to equip it to take on these additional responsibilities and to make the fundamental change from being an advisory body to being the licensing authority.</P>
    <P>I hope he means by this that the board will be given the necessary resources to do the expanded job it is being given.</P>
    <P>An objective of the board is that it will be self-financing.  That has been the thrust of much legislation through the years and it is an objective rather than an absolute, but I am slightly worried about it.  If it is to be self-financing, is it possible its work might be compromised if it has to seek funding for its costs and cost structure?  Due to lack of finance it might be compromised in terms of funding from outside agencies.</P>
    <P>The expert group stated that the functions of the board and of the chief executive should be clearly outlined and defined, and that is done in the legislation. The functions of the new board are listed in section 4, but they are slightly disappointing in comparison with the functions of the old board, although it had its shortcomings.  The report stated the first function of the NDAB was:</P>
    <P>to organise and administer a service for obtaining and assessing information as regards the safety of new and reformulated drugs and, in particular, their toxicity and other adverse affects[.]</P>
    <P>This may not mean anything as the functions are probably not listed in the Bill in order of priority, but the first function of the new board, in section 4 (1) (a), is:</P>
    <P>the licensing of the manufacture, preparation, importation, distribution and sale of medicinal products[.]</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> It is only in section 4 (1) (f) it is stated the board has the function:</P>
    <P>to establish and administer a service for obtaining and assessing information as regards the safety, quality and efficacy of medicinal products[.]</P>
    <P>That should have been first on the list and the last function listed should have been the issuing of a licence.  We are replacing a board which was found to be deficient, but its first function as outlined in the report is a more important function.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran and Senator Henry mentioned section 4 (1) (g), which lists as a function:</P>
    <P>to establish and administer a service for obtaining and assessing reports on any adverse effects of medicinal products in use in the State[.]</P>
    <P>There is a huge degree of concern regarding the contraceptive pills listed in the national media as being dangerous. I ask the Minister if he can give Senators information on the functions of the new board in section 4 (1) (a) and (g), the first of which was also a function of the previous board.  Has any ongoing testing or research been done since the newspapers highlighted that some contraceptive pills are dangerous?  I realise it is only a short time since then, but if any other drug was flagged as a cause for thrombosis, we would see an effective and efficient recall of the drug until it was tested.  At present there is a &ldquo;suck it and see&rdquo; attitude &mdash; women have gone to GPs who have said they do not think that is the effect of the named contraceptive; if the women want to change it the doctors will facilitate them but they do not see an absolute necessity for doing so.  Thrombosis is a serious condition and this is not an appropriate response if it may be a side effect to a medicine.  I endorse the comments of other Members.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) (1) deals with another function of the board, which is to &ldquo;establish and administer a service for the inspection of any service for the collection, screening, processing and quality <Col N="1865" /> control facilities&rdquo; of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I welcome this aspect.</P>
    <P>In common with Senator Henry, although I approach it from a different angle, I am a little concerned about the transfer of the function from the Minister to the board if a product is found to be unsafe.  The legislation states that any cases before a tribunal or legal cases pending against the old board will be transferred to the new board.  What will be the effect on further litigation when the new board is established?  Is the Minister responsible for answering legal cases?</P>
    <P>Senator Henry's point related to covering practitioners who may join the board.  Who will be responsible for actions which may be taken in the future against the new board?  Since the new board will be the licensing authority and the Minister was previously the licensing authority, will the Minister be liable to legal action?  I am a little worried that the devolution of power will involve the transfer of a heavier responsibility.  I ask the Minister to reassure me that the new board will be able to fulfil any obligations it may face in the future in terms of compensation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the functions of the board, section 8 states: &ldquo;The Board shall hold such and as many meetings as may be necessary for the performance of its functions&rdquo;.  I may have overlooked it, but the section does not stipulate the minimum number of meetings the board should hold.  The board is being told to do its job effectively and efficiently and I understand the rationale behind that move.  However, for example, when the Civil Legal Aid Board was being established, the legislation specified the number of meetings which should be held in the year.  This Bill leaves the position open.  If the board is good, it will do its job efficiently and hold regular meetings. However, if that is not the case, the Bill does not state that it must meet at specific intervals.  The board may feel it fulfils the performance of its function by meeting once a year and I am concerned about this aspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> Regarding the overload, the report of the expert group states:</P>
    <P>It would reduce the time taken to process applications for new and existing PAs if the NDAB [the new board] took account of the assessments performed by regulatory agencies in other countries and raised any supplementary issues it might wish to examine.  This would help to reduce unnecessary duplication of assessments while retaining the right and responsibility of the NDAB to raise specific issues it considered relevant.</P>
    <P>The group is clearly stating there is no need to reinvent the wheel.  We must ensure the highest standards but there is no need for duplication.  The Minister must ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Section 10(8) states: &ldquo;The Chief Executive shall devote the whole of his or her time to his or her duties as Chief Executive and shall not hold any other office or position without the consent of the Board.&rdquo;  This is an extremely good provision and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the board is to be self financing.  In relation to charges for services, section 14 (2) states: &ldquo;The determination of the amounts of charges by the Board for advisory services shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.&rdquo;  However, subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>Charges, prices and payments under subsection (1) in respect of functions performed, services provided, activities carried on or things sold, shall not, save with the approval of the Minister, be less than the cost of the performance of the function, the provision of the service, the carrying on of the activity or the production and development of the thing, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The board is being given licensing authority, which is a strong power, and being told that its function and responsibility is to ensure that products receiving a licence are safe, etc.  However, the Bill also states the charges, which is a much less weighty issue in terms of the <Col N="1867" /> board's responsibility, shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I could accept the inclusion of this aspect if subsection (3) did not specify that the board cannot charge less for the service.  This should not be provided at a nominal cost which would place a burden on the Exchequer and I accept that point.  However, it is counterproductive to allow the board to be free to perform its functions and issue licences, but then specify that the Minister will oversee matters of cost.  The Minister either stays in or out and there is no need for the charges provision.</P>
    <P>Section 16 states: &ldquo;The Board may accept gifts of money, land or other property, upon such trusts or conditions, if any, as may be specified by the donor&rdquo;.  I do not understand this measure.  Does it mean that if somebody makes a bequest to help the board continue its work it may accept it if it is not in conflict with what it is doing?  The Minister is nodding, so I understand the position.</P>
    <P>In common with previous pieces of legislation, the Bill stipulates that accounts should be provided within a specified period.  This is welcome.  I gleaned these points from a summary examination of the Bill.  This is welcome legislation if it achieves its objective. For example, a similar case arose with regard to the Office of the Attorney General and we received a report yesterday on the ongoing review.  Unless the legislation equips the new board to deal with its workload effectively and efficiently, it will fail.</P>
    <P>Regarding the expansion of the functions of the old board, it was the licensing authority for veterinary medicines. Perhaps that authority should be removed from the new board as its other functions in relation to human medicines and blood products are of far greater importance.  Perhaps another body should deal with the veterinary products.  The new board should not be overburdened with both functions.  Perhaps a separate veterinary medicines licensing board should be established <Col N="1868" /> and human medicines dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of homeopathic drugs.  They are popular, but I am not sure whether specific checks on them are carried out. Another aspect occurred to me during the Minister's speech.  When the board is up and running, working well and acting as a model of how boards should work, is it the intention to sell that expertise to developing or Third World countries which are often exploited in many ways in terms of pharmaceutical and other products?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but we should remember that it came about as a result of a crisis.  The board had become ineffective in carrying out its important duties but that problem was not tackled. I welcome the Bill if it achieves its objectives.  The Minister said a radically restructured organisation will be put in place to equip it to take on the additional responsibilities and to make the fundamental change from being an advisory body to being a licensing body. This may require substantial additional finance, but unless we ensure the new board has the resources it requires to carry out its job properly, we may be faced with a report from another expert group examining a human tragedy.  I hope that will never occur again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party welcomes this Bill.  I compliment the Minister for introducing it so quickly in response to the recommendations of the expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The recent tragic events for women who have become infected with hepatitis C through the anti-D vaccine has been the greatest scandal in the history of the Department of Health and the bodies under its aegis.  It has made us all aware that, while there are great benefits from advances in human science, there can also be a downside which was not anticipated.  Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien's report on the Blood Transfusion Service Board was damning.  One of the recommendations of that report was the setting up a new <Col N="1869" /> body and I compliment the Minister on moving so quickly on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board will replace the National Drugs Advisory Board which has been in existence for almost 30 years.  It was originally set up to ensure the safety and efficacy of all drugs available in Ireland, but over the years its powers increased.  In 1974 the statutory scheme for the licensing of drugs was introduced and this was extended to cover blood products and veterinary products.  The functions and duties of the board have increased without a parallel increase in the facilities available to it.  This has been the reason for the delays in licensing new products and renewing licences which have led to an outcry on the part of those using the board.  The matter needed to be addressed and, hopefully, the new medicines board will be a more efficient and effective organisation because I presume it will have increased facilities.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board made us aware of some of the dangers inherent in medical advances, particularly in relation to blood and blood products.  It is to be welcomed that the new board will have such a large remit in this regard.</P>
      <P>We do not often have the opportunity to talk about drugs in this sense in this House.  We constantly call for debates on illegal drugs.  Regrettably, society now demands and believes there is a pill for every ill.  There is a lack of awareness, education and information on the drugs which are available.  A prescription from the doctor legitimises drug taking.  We do not seem to concentrate on education and awareness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the recent concern about the contraceptive pill and possible associated dangers, the experts researching the matter believed there was an increase in the risk of thrombosis from 1 in 10,000 to 2 in 10,000. Although the risk had effectively doubled it was still a very small number. For many women the dangers of pregnancy are greater than the dangers of taking the contraceptive pill.  Many <Col N="1870" /> women may be scared of hormone replacement therapy.  Nobody talks about the dangers of smoking and its enormous consequences for women's health, particularly in this country but scare tactics are used when dealing with the pill or HRT products which can benefit many women.  We should have reasoned and responsible debate on all such issues rather than frightening many people, often unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>Health matters can be of great concern and people can be frightened if they do not have all the information. There is an onus on Members when dealing with such issues to do so in a responsible manner.  Where dangers to health are posed by drugs, they should be taken off the market.  However, when there are outcries about what might be dangerous, we should be careful.  We should not tell women to stop taking the pill when the consequences for them could be greater than the effects of taking the pill.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about liability or responsibility.  In relation to the hepatitis C problem responsibility has been accepted by the Department of Health, and the Minister is dealing with the issue by compensating the women involved.  However, I would be concerned if the responsibility for this new board was taken away from the Minister. The National Drugs Advisory Board made recommendations to the Minister but the new board will be the licensing authority.  In the light of recent events I am concerned as to where the ultimate liability will rest.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern on which many of us have been lobbied is that the running costs of the board will have to be generated by levying fees.  Large multinational companies can afford larger fees.  However, there are also small Irish based pharmaceutical companies and I would not like to see their potential for development and employment hindered by the Bill's provisions on fees.  The level of fees charged to these companies should involve a realistic appraisal of the size of a company, <Col N="1871" /> its turnover and the number it employs.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board seemed to lag behind in the production of its annual reports &mdash; its last report was published in 1991.  Annual reports which are published so late are almost irrelevant.  The new board should not just have a duty to file a report but the Minister should have to publish it and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  While the public may not be aware of the concern they should have about this subject it is of great importance. It is a sector which can greatly affect people's lives.  It will be the licensing authority for drugs and medicines and will also be in charge of blood and blood products.  When something goes wrong in this area we have seen the devastating effects it can have on people's lives.</P>
    <P>We should be concerned about this sector and the report should be brought before the Oireachtas annually; it should be produced before a specified date at the end of each year.  There is no point telling us what happened in the Blood Transfusion Service Board five or six years ago; we want to know what is happening now.  I welcome what the Minister and the Department are doing in relation to the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the action taken as a result of the Hederman-O'Brien report.</P>
    <P>The procedure for licensing these drugs has been established in other European countries.  Will we accept that drugs have passed through the advisory boards or medicine boards, or their equivalent, in other European countries? Is this good enough for us or will we have to thoroughly investigate them again?  These are issues which would have a bearing on the running costs of the boards, and, in turn, would have an effect on the fees we are going to charge pharmaceutical companies.  If these agencies, including ours, conform with the guidelines of EU legislation, that would be acceptable to us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the speed with which the Minister has responded to the <Col N="1872" /> Hederman-O'Brien report.  I also welcome the fact that procedures will be more streamlined, that it will be a management board and that it will have two expert committees to advise it, one on medicines and one on veterinary products. However, I would like to see some form of reporting system which would enable both Houses to keep an eye on what is happening.  I hope we will never again have anything like the horrific hepatitis C scandal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a necessary, efficient, housekeeping operation. The Minister is tidying up the situation and making it more efficient, which everybody welcomes.  He expresses the hope that the board will become self-financing.  How will this finance be generated?  Will subventions be made by the drug companies?  If so, will it be open to abuse?  Will it come from the veterinary professional organisations and medical groups?</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, which went through the House, if I recall correctly, in the wake of a tragic case where a young man died while undergoing a drug trial.  At that stage we were trying to regulate the situation to ensure that no further tragic accidents occurred. Also at that time, a lively group, centred on the old Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, appeared to be about to launch a kind of world programme.  I understand this venture either failed or has dwindled away, which is regrettable because I was invited to be a member of its advisory ethical committee and I was looking forward to having my say on the matter. However, following the difficulties which the group got into, I was never contacted by it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sections to the Bill covering veterinary medicine and human medicine.  Many lay people believe there is a kind of crossover here, especially because of the increased use of antibiotic drugs in veterinary medicine. There are concerns among the public that this crossover effect can be damaging.  For example, if cattle and <Col N="1873" /> sheep are saturated with drugs and if we eat too much of this meat we will develop a resistance to these very useful drugs.  I presume that this matter will also be monitored by this new agency.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will accelerate the proper acceptance, after some investigation, of new drugs, or of drugs that are not currently available in this country. This is particularly important in the area of frontier medicine, especially when we are dealing with AIDS.  People look for drugs that are on the frontiers of medicine but which may not be available because the necessary trials have not been completed.</P>
    <P>If people are in a terminable condition, they may wish to grasp whatever straws are available and they may, at their own risk, take some of these preparations. I know one must be careful in this area, but it is important that people be given access to whatever opportunities are available, especially at their own wish, and that they should be able to make use of these drugs.</P>
    <P>I say this with some feeling because a number of years ago I was contacted by Mr. Jim Foster, whom I had met at a human rights conference ten years previously, and who had become the City Health Supervisor of San Francisco, which was dealing with its AIDS situation. He was prepared to make available to the country a stock of aerosolised pentamidine worth $500,000 which, at that stage at any rate, was regarded as being useful as an early intervention in the infection.  I do not know if this was subsequently proved to be the case, but it was strongly felt in American medical circles that taking aerosolised pentamidine before the onset of pneumocystis carinii could inhibit the development of that disease.</P>
    <P>Drugs worth $500,000, which would have been welcomed by a number of AIDS patients were offered, but the country was unable to accept what was a very generous gift because of various difficulties relating to the question of clinical trials and so on.  It ran into an enormous amount of bureaucratic problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> I hope that in this area of medicine, the establishment of the Irish Medicines Board will speed up the process where patients who are seriously ill, who have made a choice and wish to avail of frontier medicine, will be assisted so to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who took part in the debate.  I welcome the cross party support for the legislation.  The debate was wide ranging and constructive.  There is one issue to which I should refer at some length because it was raised by a number of Senators.  I agree with the view expressed by Senator Honan regarding the safety of certain oral contraceptives. This area has attracted considerable media attention following the statement last week by the UK's committee on safety of medicines.  It is important that the possible risks associated with any pharmaceutical preparation are made clear to those for whom it has been prescribed. However, it is also important that these risks be interpreted in a balanced manner and that new scientific evidence is fully assessed and validated.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that all pharmaceutical products marketed in Ireland must be licensed.  This has been the essence of our debate this evening. Licences are issued on foot of scientific assessments of their safety, quality and efficacy which are carried out by the National Drugs Advisory Board.  This is the position as of now.  The board ensures that doctors are made aware of risk factors and it also monitors reports of adverse reactions.</P>
      <P>It has long been known that certain oral contraceptives involve a slight risk of thromboembolism.  The NDAB has always ensured that doctors are aware of this risk and that the risk may be greater in some patients with predisposing factors.  The prescribing data and the package leaflets contain details of these possible risks and of the appropriate precautions to be taken in prescribing these products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter issued by the UK's committee on safety of medicines advised <Col N="1875" /> restrictions on the use of so-called third generation oral contraceptives because of a suggested increased risk of thromboembolism compared with other oral contraceptives.  The National Drugs Advisory Board has advised me that this recommendation was based on the results of scientific studies which have not yet been completely reviewed and validated.  The results of the studies were made available on 18 October to the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products in the European Union, of which the NDAB is a member.  This committee has decided to evaluate the data as a matter of urgency and is convening a meeting for that purpose.  The NDAB will contribute to this and will follow it with the appropriate action if required.</P>
    <P>The most important message that should go out this evening is that the risks concerned are very small.  The NDAB has advised me that it is not even clear as yet that the risk is any greater than with earlier, less advanced oral contraceptives when the patients concerned are strictly comparable.  As suggested, increased risk would still be small in absolute terms and smaller than the overall risks associated with pregnancy. I am satisfied that the approach being taken by the NDAB in this matter is an appropriate and responsible one. Any patient who has specific concerns about her treatment should consult her doctor.  The NDAB will participate in the evaluation of the new evidence and will issue further information or advice as necessary.  I have dealt with this matter in some detail because of the concerns that have been expressed recently.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran asked for more detailed information about the regulations. The regulations will be similar to existing regulations under the 1947 Health Act with amendments to apply to appeals &mdash; an issue that came up in the Dáil and which I agreed to address under the regulations &mdash; and to put the named patient system on a formalised basis.  There will also be amendments in relation to fees.  The regulations will go <Col N="1876" /> through the democratic process and will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If Deputies, Senators or political parties are not happy with them they can use the democratic process to make their concerns known.  The spirit in which this legislation is presented is constructive and open to ideas and suggestions from Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>It has been said that extra functions were given to the NDAB while there was no corresponding significant increase in resources.  The staffing levels in the NDAB show that in 1982, 22 people were employed there and by 1994 the number had increased to 59. Extra duties and functions were certainly given to the board but there was a corresponding increase in staffing levels. More importantly, however, consultants are looking at the NDAB at present with a view to recommending changes in structures and resources to enable the new board to fulfil its functions.  It is important on the changeover &mdash; and this relates to a number of points made by Senator McGennis &mdash; that the emphasis is on management and streamlining at board level.  Allied to that, the technical staff of the new board will carry out a great deal of work on behalf of the board.  There is provision under the Bill for the use of the two advisory committees and for the establishment of special sub-committees if that type of advice is necessary in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the matter of fees.  The fees can only be set by the Minister for Health with the approval of the Minister for Finance. Concern was expressed that if the fees reached too high a level they could have a depressing effect on our pharmaceutical industry.  Effectively, the fees we are discussing in this context apply to products for the Irish market.  It was decided by the previous Government &mdash; a decision that was endorsed by the present Government &mdash; that the board should be self-financing.  The matter of fees would relate to a specific or particular product.  There is also the matter of charges.  Senator Henry dealt at length <Col N="1877" /> with this and I concur with the thrust of her argument.  Obviously charges for work carried out on behalf of the European agency would be important in the overall financing of the new board.  With regard to ministerial approval for fees, it is normal practice that the approval of the particular Minister &mdash; in this case the Minister for Health &mdash; and the Minister for Finance is necessary.</P>
    <P>I accept the arguments advanced by Senator Henry with regard to the named patient scheme and the fact that aspects of the situation were unsatisfactory. Senator Norris, without referring directly to named patients, also dealt with this area.  At present a doctor can prescribe a particular drug for a patient if there is no other alternative and his or her professional judgment is that the pharmaceutical preparation could have a good effect on the patient.  However, the recommendation of the Hederman-O'Brien report that this be put on a statutory basis by way of regulation will be carried out.  I accept the thrust of the arguments put forward in this regard by Senator Henry and Senator Finneran.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran was concerned about the responsibility of the board and its accountability.  The annual report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important to stress that the board will be appointed by the Minister and can be replaced by the Minister. The board's report must be presented to the Minister within six months of the end of the financial year. The report, in the normal course of events, would soon be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, I must sound a note of caution in this context. A report might contain sensitive material and the Minister of the day might be advised that the report in its entirety at that particular time should not be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for legal reasons.  That sort of thing can arise and it is very difficult to legislate for it.  It is a reasonable time scale.  I accept the Senator's criticism in relation to the reports of the National Drugs Advisory Board not being available, <Col N="1878" /> but my advice is that they will be available very shortly so the six months time scale is reasonable.  In regard to accountability to the Oireachtas, the Minister of the day, I have no doubt, would present those reports rapidly and the Government Whip would decide whether it would be necessary to make time available to discuss them.  It is always open to Members who are part of groups to use Private Members' time or other parliamentary devices to pursue any area about which they are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran asked to whom the chief executive officer would be responsible. The chief executive officer would be responsible to the board.  The issue of immunity was raised by a number of Senators.  The immunity enjoyed at present by the National Drugs Advisory Board as set out in the Control of Clinical Trials and Drug Acts, 1990, will also apply to the new board.  There are another couple of points which I should clarify here because Senators have raised them.</P>
    <P>The carry over of immunities as provided for in section 34 covers all of the functions of the Irish Medical Board and is not limited to the functions of the National Drugs Advisory Board.  This is achieved by the deletion of the words &ldquo;under article 4 of the National Drugs Advisory Board establishment order, 1966&rdquo;.  The section will now refer to the discharge of any of the board's functions. Senator Henry referred to clinical trials.  All committees, including the clinical trials committee, will be covered under section 5 (2) as amended.  These committees will be established under section 9 of the Bill and, in addition, responsibility for clinical trials is specified as a function of the board in section 4.</P>
    <P>I should bring another aspect to this to the attention of the Seanad.  Notwithstanding the immunities provided, it is always open to any person or company to seek to take action in the courts and it will be ultimately a matter for the courts to interpret and rule upon the immunities provided in a particular <Col N="1879" /> case.  In the event of any awards being made against the board, the question of whether the costs would be borne by the Minister is a matter that would be decided in the overall context of the financing of the board at that time. However, section 15 would allow the Minister to make a grant to the board.</P>
    <P>The matter of time limit was raised by Senator Finneran.  We will be bound by the EU directive in relation to time limit which is 210 days, but this is on a &ldquo;stop the clock&rdquo; basis so if, as the processing is progressing, extra information is required, it is open to the board to stop the clock at that point.  The 210 days recommences when that information has been provided.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran raised the matter of co-operation with industry.  I totally accept the need for co-operation, but no matter what legislation is in place, goodwill is very important and I have little doubt that the board will be, as the National Drugs Advisory Bord was, open to full consultation with the industry and will treat all matters with due confidentiality.  Not alone do I agree with co-operation with industry in principle, but I believe it is very desirable in the context of the new board.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the matter of named patients and the delay in getting a licence, with which I dealt earlier.  She also raised the matter of the fee for items which have small usage, which is a very important point.  There is a provision at present which states that 5 per cent of the standard fee can be applied in such cases and I have little doubt that that will continue in the new situation.</P>
    <P>Homeopathic medicines are included in the 1993 EU directive enacted by the 1994 amendment to the licensing regulations. The Win RHo Anti-D product was also mentioned by Senator Henry. The product was brought in on an emergency basis and licensed as a matter of urgency.  Any delay which occurred was the result of delays in obtaining information from the company.  It would have been improper to licence until the National Drugs Advisory Board and the <Col N="1880" /> Minister were satisfied that all safety aspects were covered.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with monitoring after licence.  The board will have the same responsibility as the National Drugs Advisory Board to monitor for adverse reactions on an ongoing basis.  I referred to the assessment of EU dossiers earlier and we are <i>ad idem</i> on that.  It is very important in the context of the prestige of the board and its staff and so on that the board becomes involved in this area and receives an ample supply of dossiers. The income accruing would not be unwelcome either.  It is very important that we are at the coalface in all those areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry dealt with reaction reporting.  There is no doubt that any adverse reactions should be reported. There is an obligation on the licence holder, as a condition of their licence, to report any adverse reactions to the board.  I would obviously be concerned about any failure to report such reactions and I reiterate the responsibility of the pharmaceutical companies in that regard.  There is a grave obligation and responsibility on pharmaceutical companies to report to the Medicines Board any adverse reactions to their products. The thrust of what the Senator is saying is very important but it is part of the licensing process.  The board will be very vigilant and will deal urgently with any such information as it becomes available.</P>
    <P>We dealt with the oral contraceptive issue earlier but again there is a need for balance in all these areas and there can be scaremongering.  I am not suggesting that that happened in this Chamber; it did not, but it is always a danger.  Equity applies in both directions. There is a grave responsibility on companies who market licensed products to immediately and fully make the Irish Medicines Board or the National Drugs Advisory Board aware of those difficulties.</P>
    <P>Immunity from prosecution for the board, its staff and members of committees, is provided for in the Control of Clinical Trials and Drugs Acts, 1990. <Col N="1881" /> The immunities will apply to the new board for all its functions.  Any legal action is likely to be against the board in its corporate entity and not against individuals.  Whether such immunities are constitutional is ultimately a matter for the courts.  Frankly, I cannot see what more we can do in the Bill to provide this immunity and protection.  At some future date the courts may make a particular decision but, in the context of all the legal advice available to us now, it is the firm intention that there would be full and comprehensive immunity for the board, its staff and committees.  At the end of the day, the courts interpret the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney spoke about the drug Prozac.  My information is that there have been many confusing and misleading reports in relation to Prozac. Prozac is an antidepressant drug and is only available to people on prescription. People on this drug are monitored by their doctors.  Equally, like all drugs, it is subject to ongoing monitoring by the board.  I will discuss the issue with the Senator after this debate.  If there is information that should be provided to the board, I will be happy to see that is done.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis asked how different things will be under the new set up when the Minister will no longer be licensing pharmaceutical products.  The Bill does not merely transfer the power of licensing to the new board.  The new board and how it will operate will be radically different to the National Drugs Advisory Board.  Consultants are to advise us, as I reported earlier, on the changes and structures necessary to provide an effective and efficient licensing system and the resources necessary for this.  The whole thrust is about removing what is identified in the Hederman-O'Brien report and also by a Government decision in 1991 as a cumbersome process.  As Senator Henry stated in her contribution, if there are particular products and everything points to them being of real benefit to patients, the sooner we can make those available to patients the better, with the <i>caveat</i> at all <Col N="1882" /> times regarding safety.  The essential point is to have streamlined, more effective and efficient measures.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis asked whether or not, if the board is to be self-financing, this could lead to the board being compromised.  I do not see how that could apply against a set of fees which will have to be approved by both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health.  The bottom line is that the board be self-financing.  Like Senator Henry, I share the hope that worthwhile and substantial incomes will accrue from the European agency, but I do not frankly see how self-financing could in any way compromise the board.</P>
    <P>The functions of the board was another area that Senator McGennis alluded to in her contribution.  She made a point regarding how the various functions are listed and the order in which they are listed.  Each of those functions is equally important and, essentially, it does not matter in what sequence they are listed.  Their importance does not relate to where they appear on a list; it relates to their necessity and the board will so treat them.</P>
    <P>Adverse reactions to drugs was raised by Senator McGennis.  I have already alluded to that in my reply to Senator Henry.  Senator McGennis was also concerned about the fact that the legislation was not specific about the minimum number of meetings the board should hold in the course of a year.  Quite frankly, I cannot see that it is prudent to put any such limit into legislation.  At the end of the day, the Minister has the final sanction relating to the most important issue &mdash; whether the board is doing the job properly or not.  He or she can disband the board in the future.  The important issue is the quality of the meetings and how the board carries out its duties to make sure that we have an efficient and modern assessment and licensing system for pharmaceutical products.</P>
    <P>Recognition of the product authorisations from other regulatory agencies was another point raised by Senator McGennis.  There is provision under EU <Col N="1883" /> regulations for mutual recognition of licences by other authorities.  This will be mandatory from 1998 onwards. Senator McGennis also spoke about the ministerial approval of charges.  The board will carry out its statutory functions and the Minister, as is standard practice &mdash; I dealt with this point earlier &mdash; will be the person who, at the end of the day, will clear the actual level of fees.</P>
    <P>Veterinary medicines and the fact that they are provided for under this legislation was also raised by Senator McGennis.  The licensing of veterinary medicines being dealt with by the same authority as deals with human medicines is usual practice.  It is the normal practice throughout Europe and in the European Medicines Agency.  Senator McGennis also spoke about the selling of expertise to other countries.  In principle, it is desirable that expertise can be made available to developing countries and countries which have a real need to develop their health services to a modern standard.  I have no difficulty regarding that and it is something that will emerge in practice.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan spoke of the annual report.  I have already dealt with that. Within six months of the end of the previous financial year, the report must be given to the Minister and, all things being equal, I would see that being rapidly available to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is also the business of recognition of product authorisations from other states.  I have already mentioned that being mandatory from 1998, but the final <i>caveat</i> is that the responsibility for safety is paramount.  There is some evidence of corruption in this area in at least one member state of the EU, so we have to be careful how we proceed. That particular issue is a sensitive one but, for all that, it is also a fundamental and important one.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris spoke in general terms about the named patients system and he also mentioned the cross over between veterinary medicines as residues in food products into the human food chain. <Col N="1884" /> The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will address this through the various means available to him and I am sure it will be dealt with by the new board.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt comprehensively with the main points which were raised. If there are other areas about which Senators have concerns, they can talk to me about them or write to me.  There is nothing confrontational or adversarial about how the Bill is being presented.  It is important that we get it right and the package we are presenting is as far as we can go at this point.  The Bill contains wide ranging provisions which enable the Minister to give other functions to the board by regulation as the need arises.  The regulations which give concern to Senators, specifically those which are the subject of concerns expressed by Senator Finneran, are in line with the Health Act, 1947, along with the three areas I mentioned.  I commend the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, recognising the urgent need to create jobs in the services sector, calls on the Government to implement immediately the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Forum Report No. 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1885" /> I thank the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, for coming to the House tonight.  Rarely has anyone put down a motion so long in advance and had such good fortune in terms of what was announced in the newspapers today on the same topic as I.  We tabled this motion on the jobs potential in the services sector some time ago.  Today we had welcome news in the labour force survey about the increase in employment.  There has been a real increase of 49,000 jobs.  This must be very satisfactory from the Government's point of view given that the number on the live register has gone up and down so much and has not shown a great improvement.  It shows that, although the number on the live register is regrettably high, there has been a welcome increase in the number with jobs in the past year.  I gather it is the largest increase in the near history of the State and it is the largest increase <i>per capita</i> in the European Union.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note that, of the 49,000 jobs created, 38,000 are in the services sector.  Most surveys I have read on jobs in the services sector have suggested that they are all low paid and mainly for women.  However, this survey showed that 50 per cent of the jobs were for men.  I have no idea how well paid they are, but I will address that later.</P>
    <P>The services sector is an important area of employment in a developed economy.  The more developed an economy the more likely it is to have plenty of jobs in the services sector.  We pride ourselves on becoming a more developed economy.  It is a labour intensive sector and there is normally a lot of room for expansion.  We have the smallest proportion of employees in the services sector in the European Union.  We are far behind the United State where 70 per cent are employed in that sector. The public is beginning to realise the importance of this sector.</P>
    <P>Recently when the jobs at Intel in Leixlip were announced, one of the first things we heard was that it would create at least another 1,000 to 2,000 spin off jobs in the services sector.  I was <Col N="1886" /> delighted to see a young man who owned a small Italian restaurant in Leixlip being interviewed about the possibility of increasing the size of his restaurant. He said he would increase its size and he would go up market.  He pointed out that if people were employed in manufacturing in the area they would come out at lunch-time and in the evenings for celebrations.  He graphically illustrated how improvements in employment in the manufacturing sector can have a spin off effect on the services sector.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the National Economic and Social Forum.  The most useful report we produced was that on the jobs potential in the services sector.  As I said, the jobs potential in this sector is well known.  However, such jobs have always been looked down on because they were often part-time, temporary, with low status and considered of little value to the economy.  I believe this has been due to poor employment practices. Now the quality of service has been improved, many jobs have improved.  It is difficult to categorise whether a job is in the manufacturing or services sector because so many services are involved in industry today.  I do not see why we should look down on part-time jobs because it is likely that there will be fewer 39 or 40 hours per week or 52 weeks per year jobs for life.  We should remember that Denmark has a high number of part-time employees and it is a prosperous economy.</P>
    <P>One of the most important elements in the forum report was the urgency with which the Government must tackle the development of closer co-ordination between taxation and social welfare services. We were promised a social welfare-taxation card, although I have not yet seen it.  This is a serious impediment to people accepting jobs which may not be long-term because they are afraid of losing benefits and they will need to be on unemployment benefit for weeks before they return to their previous situation. It is not the money which worries people but the loss of fringe benefits, in particular the medical card.  I <Col N="1887" /> asked previous Ministers when discussing unemployment to try to ensure that the position of children is not affected so that parents would be encouraged to take up even short-term employment.</P>
    <P>The public sector has a considerable number of employees.  I am fascinated when I hear people calling for cuts in the number of people employed in the public service.  Are they calling for cuts in the number of nurses, medical personnel, gardaí or teachers?  I will spare civil servants' blushes by saying they are also valued members of the community. Earlier today we spoke about the establishment of the Irish Medicines Board &mdash; an area in the State service where there is enormous potential for job creation.  Dossiers on the evaluation of drugs valued at £50,000 each will be sent out from the Central Medicines Evaluation Agency in London.  Because these drugs will be partly in the public service area, will we say we cannot do these evaluations when we know it would create an enormous amount of employment for those in the technical and professional areas?</P>
    <P>Sometimes I think it is amazing that there is a private services sector in this country because we have done little to encourage it until recently.  The setting up of the county enterprise partnership boards was a good move and the much maligned FÁS has done a lot in terms of training.  A large part of this report on the jobs potential in the service industry focuses on training as well as taxation.  Unfortunately until recently we looked on training as something which people picked up as they went along.  Someone once said to me that most waiters in this country appear to be waiting to go back to college. However, with the improvement in the tourism industry and the demand by visitors for improved services in hotels and restaurants, we have had to set up better courses in CERT and Cathal Brugha Street.  I commend both on their efforts. Without high standards in these services we will not get return visitors and that <Col N="1888" /> must be an important aspect of education and training.</P>
    <P>Manufacturing firms devote too little time to research and training.  It is important to remember that both areas provide employment.  Very little time is spent in firms on managerial reorganisation and think tanks.</P>
    <P>The area of help with domestic chores within the home has been seriously neglected. I ask the Minister to look at the taxation situation in this regard.  We spend an enormous amount on carers and some very highly paid people have to give up work to care for elderly people, in particular.  It must be within the remit of the Department of Finance to make tax exempt the employment of those who look after the elderly in their home, so that the person whose responsibility they are can go out to work.  The same applies to the employment of those who mind small children. That would allow people who have to give up lucrative jobs, where they contributed a great deal to the economy from the point of view of taxation, to stay in their jobs and to employ someone else who will be paying taxes.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why there are such difficulties with this, but it is an area which needs to be addressed.  The report strongly recommended that this should be made possible and that child care provision should be made affordable, accessible and available to parents and their children.  It is important to remember that these child care facilities will employ other people.</P>
    <P>I received the banks' charter for small business customers in the post this morning.  People have great difficulties in getting bank loans or financing to start small service industries.  It appears to be easier to borrow £1 million than to borrow a few hundred pounds to buy a sewing machine in order to start a small repairs business which might employ one or two people.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that he should try to make the banks more realistic as they seem to look on such people as bad debts.  I know that one must save with a credit union before one can borrow <Col N="1889" /> from them.  However, they have told me that they frequently give loans to people to set up small businesses in the services sector and that they have a 100 per cent repayment record.  Therefore, such potential borrowers should not be automatically regarded as liabilities.</P>
    <P>I wish to commend First Step, which was set up by Mrs. Norma Smurfit and some friends and which has done some of the most imaginative work in this country in giving small amounts of money to people wishing to set up small enterprises.  They say that they have an enormously high success rate and very little defaulting on repayments.</P>
    <P>I know that it is important to employ 200, 300 or 1,000 people.  However, if one reads the report in todays newspaper and considers how many small enterprises were involved in creating those 38,000 jobs, one realises that far more attention should be paid to promoting in every way possible the services industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion, on which Senator Henry has very competently and capably spoken I am delighted that this Minister is here tonight because he does not need to be educated in this area.  He has clearly identified that jobs in the future are unlikely to be in the manufacturing area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985, I visited the company in Japan which makes the weighing scales for my supermarket company.  I had never before seen robots in action and they took the sight out of my eyes.  The weighing scales moved along a plant line and in two seconds a machine with eight arms screwed in eight screws to join two plates together.  The owner of the factory explained to me that not only was this more efficient in time and, therefore, less costly, but he did not think that the most sldlled craftsman could do the job as accurately and well as the robot could.  On that day ten years ago it jumped out at me that jobs in manufacturing would be threatened unless they could rely on crafts which could not be done by machines.  However, <Col N="1890" /> there are very few such jobs as it seems that machines are capable of doing a large amount of the work in manufacturing. Therefore, most manufacturing jobs in the future will be threatened.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the United States, where smaller and smaller numbers of people are needed in agriculture to produce enough food for the world and where very small numbers are needed to produce enough products for the world.  People will be needed in the services sector, where the United States has been so successful.  Senator Henry is right that Ireland has one of the lowest levels of service employment, which is an opportunity rather than a threat.  We need to ensure that is understood around this country because many sectors of the economy do not believe that jobs in the services sector are real jobs. That is a selling job which we must do as a nation if we are to overcome the hurdle of recognising that jobs in the future will be from the services area and that such jobs are real jobs.  However, they must give a value, which they have not always done in the past.</P>
    <P>Tourism is one of the areas with the greatest potential for jobs.  I arrived at a very big, multistorey American hotel last year after travelling to San Diego via Dublin, London and Los Angeles. As our taxi pulled up at the door of the hotel, the boot opened automatically. The doorman opened the door and said &ldquo;Mr. Quinn, you are very welcome, delighted to have you here&rdquo;.  I was very impressed that he recognised me and was very puzzled how he did it.  He asked me where I had come from and I said from Dublin.  He asked if it had taken a long time and I said that it had taken 16 hours and my wife and I were quite tired.  He said for me to go straight to the reception desk and they would bring my bags to my room.  As I walked to the desk the receptionist looked me in the eye and said &ldquo;Mr. Quinn, you are very welcome, we are delighted to have you here.  You must be exhausted having come all the way from Ireland.  Did it take you about 16 hours?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" /> I was very impressed with the level customer service, but I was puzzled.  The following morning I strolled down with my newspaper under my arm and I watched what happened.  The driver of the taxi which pulled up to the door automatically opened the boot so that the doorman could see the name on the luggage.  He opened the door and said &ldquo;Mr. Butler, you are very welcome, glad to have you with us&rdquo;.  As Mr. Butler unloaded his golf clubs the doorman asked if he had stayed there before.  Mr. Butler replied that he stayed there in November when he had shot a marvellous round of golf.  The doorman asked him about this and he said that he had shot his best round of golf ever and was only two over par.  As Mr. Butler went into the reception area I could see the doorman speaking into the little microphone inside his jacket pocket.  He was telling the receptionist that was Mr. Butler who shot a round of 72 in November.</P>
    <P>That is a marvellous story because it shows how technology helped customer services which were beyond what the competitors were able to do.  We are in danger of not recognising our competitors and, therefore, losing out to them. The French Minister for Tourism undertook a <i>bon jour</i> campaign to try to make visitors more welcome because the French doormen and waiters have a name for not being the most hospitable. Ireland has fewer returning guests than most of our competitors in the tourism business.</P>
    <P>We must change the attitude of the powers that be, including the large number of people who do not believe that service jobs are real jobs.  We must also change the attitude of those involved in getting customers to return and we must recognise that we need technology to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, joined me for lunch two weeks ago in the Dáil restaurant where we met a group of Americans &mdash; I met them in June &mdash; who were planning to open a factory in <Col N="1892" /> Ireland.  It was an interesting discussion. I asked them what the most important factor was in setting up their business. They said they were producing a product for a customer in Milan whose most important factor was time delivery. They asked him how long he was willing to wait for delivery of the products to his warehouse.  He said he was not willing to wait longer than four days.  The Minister heard them say that was why they wanted to set up their plant close to Rosslare or Dublin so that they could get to places such as Milan in four days.</P>
    <P>The west is disadvantaged as regards manufacturing services.  However, thanks to communications the services industry can now be located anywhere in the country.  Opportunities exist to place service industry jobs in the west. The Government should consider decentralising some of those industries which do not rely on transport, but on telecommunications, to the west.  We should avail of the opportunities which exist at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for raising this issue which is, perhaps, tailor made for me because in Opposition, as Senator Quinn knows, I published a White Paper on the services sector.  I was encouraged to do that at the time because manufacturing worldwide was stable, if not declining, and growth in employment was coming from the services sector.  That is not to say that manufacturing is not important. Certain services in that area which were provided in-house can now be successfully developed outside it, either in the research and product innovative area, where there might be a buy-in service, or in the marketing and customer services area.  Those elements of the manufacturing equation are becoming footloose. Senators have correctly pointed out that Ireland is well placed to avail of the opportunities of the growing footloose nature of those services.  They can now travel across the globe and locate in countries which offer the necessary supports, including talented people and <Col N="1893" /> a proper working environment.  There are great opportunities in this area.</P>
      <P>Since the internationally traded services became an area on which IDA Ireland and Forbairt focused &mdash; that happened in the past ten years &mdash; employment has grown threefold in those sectors.  Our focus has been too narrow in the services sector in that we focused exclusively on those relatively limited areas of Internationally traded services.  The services sector is larger than that and it is proving to be the dynamic sector in terms of employment growth.  It has a lot of advantages.  It costs less to establish a job than in manufacturing and it tends to employ considerably more labour as a proportion of sales.  It also tends to purchase more materials locally than the manufacturing sector does; it sources its materials closer to home.  As a result, it is well placed as a sector which levers up activity in the rest of the economy.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, it was appropriate that the National Economic and Social Forum addressed this issue in its report. I was on the National Economic and Social Forum when it first approached this matter.  There was a lot of commitment by members to develop this opportunity.  I have the privilege of being the person who is trying to put into operation some of the principles it suggested.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned that 49,000 extra jobs were created, which is unprecedented; we have never enjoyed that much growth before.  It is notable that of the 49,000 jobs created, 36,000 were in the private market services sector, which is represented by Senator Quinn, among others.  It is clearly a dominant sector.  That growth is not just a flash in the pan this year.  Over the past 20 years employment in the services sector grew by approximately 54 per cent, while industrial employment grew by only 1.5 per cent.  It illustrates that it has been performing well over a long period.  The ESRI predicts that will be repeated in the future and that we will continue to see the bulk of extra employment coming from the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> It is also interesting to note that we tend to have lower employment growth than the other OECD countries.  There are reasonable grounds for hoping that although services have been exceptionally strong in Ireland in recent years, they are still performing short of their full potential.  That background gives us a great platform from which to launch an aggressive policy on the services sector and to release its potential.  At a time when we recognise that unemployment is still our top priority, it is an important sector which is well suited to the comparative advantage of the people and is well attuned to addressing our employment needs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>A Government of Renewal</i> also recognised that in the past we ignored the potential of the services sector.  It states:</P>
    <P>The traditional approach of supporting industrial development has been expensive for the taxpayer, but has failed to produce sufficient jobs or a strong indigenous sector.  It ignored the potential of services, by focusing primarily on manufacturing. Alternative approaches will be examined. These will embrace increased attention to services, including tourism, as well as manufacturing.  Here will be a concerted programme to help small business in the creation of enterprise and employment.</P>
    <P>We have consistently addressed that agenda since we took office.  Senators will be aware that in the last budget we addressed one of the critical issues for the services sector, the cost of employment. If a sector for which the wage bill is two and a half times the importance of the manufacturing sector, it will be more sensitive to wage costs.  The measures we took in the last budget, including the reduction of employers' PRSI, the introduction for the first time of an allowance for employees' PRSI and the extension of the employers' PRSI exemption, were designed to narrow that critical tax wedge.</P>
    <P>We have also for the first time recognised it is anomalous that heretofore the service sector should have paid four <Col N="1895" /> times the rate of corporation tax of the manufacturing sector.  We have started to address that by reducing the standard rate of corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  There is a clear recognition that what we have started in the tax area must continue in the future.</P>
    <P>However, we are also trying to introduce specific measures that will help address the needs of the service sector. Many Members will be familiar with the small business operational programme, which I launched recently.  A key measure in it is what is called the access to finance scheme.  To answer Senator Henry's point, it does address the issue of access to bank loans, which can be a problem for emerging businesses.  It is essentially a subsidised loan scheme with money at 6.5 per cent over seven years.  For the first time this scheme has been opened to include the service sector as well as traditional manufacturing. It is a breach in the dams in that we are openly recognising that the service sector has as much to offer as the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have to be sensitive to what the economists would describe as displacement.  We cannot use State money to subsidise a service activity that is in direct competition with another service activity.  There must be a test to ensure there is no wasteful use of such money.  The four banks involved have to look at what is being proposed and ensure that no copycat enterprise, which may put another firm out of work, is set up.  It has to add value and employment.  However, the principle is important.</P>
    <P>There are two other important measures in the small business operational programme.  The first is the opening up of public procurement to small companies.  There is great potential in the Public Procurement Bill, which it is estimated will run to £500 million a year &mdash; I am not speaking <i>ex cathedra</i>&mdash; and that will open up opportunities for our smaller companies; they are our most predominant service companies. We have a thriving small native <Col N="1896" /> software business and we need to open up public procurement for those businesses. The measures in the programme will first be designed to provide the information sought by the public sector and second to assist the smaller companies in preparing successful tenders.</P>
    <P>The other important element of that programme is a new innovative programme which will be run by Forbairt. It intends to look at the new service business opportunities that are emerging. Technology in particular is throwing up many new activities where Ireland arguably has strong opportunities to advance.  This programme will identify those opportunities; promote new startups and develop existing service businesses into the identified areas; try to build networks, business alliances and partnerships across Irish service firms and look at the electronic information services area where there are undoubtedly new and exciting opportunities.</P>
    <P>Since I am working on the NESF and am putting together a response for the Government in this area, I have been looking at the many recommendations that refer to the services sector. Senators will be familiar with the proposal that surfaced on a few occasions in different reports &mdash; developing a threefold categorisation of support to services.  Traditionally, manufacturing was the dominant sector while all others were left out.  Internationally traded services were then allowed to qualify. What is now sought from Government is the idea that there would be fully and partially eligible activities, activities that would qualify simply for information purposes and broad, not specific, types of supports within the company.  There would be access to information and mentoring, but specific support would be confined to areas where we saw potential.  That area has been recommended by both the task force on services set up by the previous Taoiseach and the small business task force.  It is a challenging area and is one I would like to address.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> This also throws up the difficult issue of designation because one has to find out what activities should be singled out.  However, it is exciting because there are exciting opportunities in the environmental and energy management services, media design and logistics and other services that have been spawned by technology.  We need to recognise that we should be trying to support them and help them get off the ground.</P>
    <P>Senators will also know that the services are fully eligible for support under the county enterprise board.  We are pushing the boat out in supporting service industries and not confining our attention to the traditional manufacturing area.</P>
    <P>The tourism operational programme is a significant vehicle for employment opportunity in the service sector.  Under that operational programme it is planned to invest £652 million in Irish tourism by the end of the century.  Some £84 million will come from the Exchequer while £369 million will come from the EU.  It is the largest ever planned investment in Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>The programme has set itself ambitious targets.  It wants to achieve annual foreign exchange earnings of £2.25 billion by the end of 1999, create 35,000 jobs in the sector, improve the seasonality factor &mdash; 75 per cent of visitors to come outside the peak as compared to 70 per cent at present &mdash; and improve the product range and quality and improve the service standards and value for money.  Senators recognise that this important area should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we still have remnants of anti-competitive and restrictive practices and they often make it difficult for people to establish their businesses and get them up and running.  We should strengthen our existing competition Acts in this area.  We are unique among European countries in having a competition authority that cannot pursue third party complaints and take enforcement action against cases of believed anti-competitive or dominant practice.  We should have a competition authority <Col N="1898" /> that can, fearlessly and independently of any political party, pursue an agenda of opening up competition and prevent artificial barriers to entry for people who want to get started.  Legislation on this matter is currently before the House and I hope to press ahead with it.  It has been held up because of difficulties with the merger area, of which many Senators will be aware.</P>
    <P>What will ultimately drive the services, like any other sector, will be profit and the opportunity to compete vigorously. As a Government, we must ensure we do not put obstacles in the way through our tax laws or other actions of Government or tolerate anti-competitive practices.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the question of training and research.  Anyone looking at where Ireland Inc. will be in the next ten years will see that our main challenge is to reposition our economy.  We are facing global competition from lower cost countries.  The only way we can stay ahead of the posse and continue enjoying our current living standards is to invest in training, innovation and research.  That requires not only spending in this area but a change of management approach.</P>
    <P>The recent studies of world competitiveness revealed that Irish management tends to have poorer capability to frame long term business strategies and as a result downgrades innovation and investment in human resources. However, it is those factors which will at the end of the day maintain our competitive position into the next century and ensure we are a vibrant economy. My Department is keenly addressing those areas.  The research side is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, following on from the STIAC report.  In the training and human resource area I am involved in drawing up a White Paper to address those extremely challenging issues ahead.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for raising this issue because it is important we keep it before us in this manner.  There is always a danger that reports will fall by the wayside <Col N="1899" /> and be forgotten but I can assure the House we will endeavour to put in place clear and positive responses.  We have already taken some measures and will continue to build a coherent response to the challenge and opportunity offered by the service sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion put down by the Independent Senators and I am glad they raised this most important issue.  I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.  On the last occasion we debated the industry sector, I said one good development in terms of job creation in the last few years has been the setting up of the small business section in the Department of Employment and Enterprise. The work done by the section is bearing fruit and I compliment the Minister on his initiatives in this regard; those of his predecessor were also most welcome.</P>
      <P>However, this report points to the major difficulties facing the small business service sector.  It outlines the many barriers to employment creation, such as the competitiveness of the sector; the anti-employment bias of our taxation system, mainly the preferential treatment of manufacturing over service industries; and most importantly, the heavy compliance costs of small industry, which applies to both manufacturing and service companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report states that many of the services mentioned are currently carried out by people from their homes or in the black economy.  Unfortunately, the message from the Seanad tonight is that those people must stay in the black economy &mdash; and I do not make that comment lightly.  Unless and until we politicians come up with fundamental, radical changes in those three areas, there is no way anyone from this sector can come out of the black economy.  It does not matter whether the Minister is from Fine Gael, Labour or Fianna Fáil, we all stand indicted in our failure up to now to make those changes.  I hope we see in the forthcoming budget the changes necessary to bring people out <Col N="1900" /> of their homes or the black economy to create sustainable jobs in this sector, because we all know it has potential to do so.</P>
    <P>The forum's main concern is:</P>
    <P>to decisively alter the anti-employment bias of our taxation and social insurance systems... Against that background, and in the interests of moving forward from the present ad hoc and piecemeal adjustments made each year at budget time the Forum recommends that a medium-term tax strategy should be put in place, with more clearly defined targets over the next few years[.]</P>
    <P>I hope in the budget next January we see fundamental changes in the taxation and social welfare arrangements which are the most significant barrier to the creation of jobs in this sector.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>the aim should be a further reduction of the tax wedge at low income levels through reductions in income tax and PRSI burdens, including greater integration between the tax and social welfare systems[.]</P>
    <P>That is the major inhibiting factor to job creation in the service sector.  In my clinic this week I heard two examples of the practical position which applies at present.  In the first case, a woman recently obtained a job in the service sector.  Prior to her employment, her husband was in receipt of £147 unemployment assistance plus a mortgage subsidy of £30 per week.  Her employment in a nine-to-five, 40 hour a week job gave her £177 gross pay and her husband's unemployment assistance was reassessed so that he received £18.  The net difference of his wife working a 40 hour week was £18.  The obvious message from us politicians to that woman is that she should stay at home for the sake of £18.</P>
    <P>I was involved on the previous Joint Oireachtas Committee on Unemployment and one initiative we recommended was that the husband should be <Col N="1901" /> allowed to work one or two days a week and earn perhaps £60 instead of the £18. Every Department we dealt with, save the Department of Enterprise and Employment, came up with obstacles which prevented such a person working on a voluntary basis for some of the unemployment assistance he received, or obtaining more assistance money for work beneficial to the community.</P>
    <P>The second example concerns two brothers, one of whom had left a job as an electrician while the other had sold his house in Dublin to return to Galway. They wanted to set up a small business and went to one of the four commercial banks.  The brother who sold his house had lodged the £25,000 proceeds with the bank and wanted to borrow on the strength of it &mdash; he did not want to put the proceeds into the business.  The most the bank would lend him was £20,000, even though he had £25,000 on deposit, and would give him no other assistance, even by way of overdraft or a leasing arrangement for a vehicle critical to the business.</P>
    <P>There was no mention of the subsidised finance for that type of start-up small business.  I approached the bank, who told me it operated the same lending criteria for such a start-up business &mdash; it did not feel this was appropriate to the start-up finance scheme.  Those two brothers have been given no incentive from that banking arrangement to start a small business and they now have to rethink it.</P>
    <P>The four banks came to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Business and Services to tell us about the progress they were making in the allocation of that money.  It was clear they were not prepared to take risks for jobs.  They will give that money to the best customers which will give them the safest risks.  Unless we can get over our difficulties on taxation and the banks' approach to lending money to small business people, we will not get the jobs in the service sector for which we so earnestly strive.  I hope a radical approach will be taken in January which has not been taken by either party in <Col N="1902" /> Government up to now.  If that is done, some of the practical difficulties on the ground may be overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I compliment the Independent Senators for the opportunity to discuss this important issue which all Members encounter daily. Senator Fahey mentioned some of the problems which arise.</P>
      <P>During the debate last week I commented on the cost of employment.  All Members are aware of the real problem encountered by people who wish to employ others.  Up to recently if one spoke to anybody in the employment sector, such as small business operators, one would hear that at the end of any given year they hoped to reduce the number of people they employed over the next 12 months.  This problem arose as a result of the cost of employment.</P>
      <P>I recognise the work carried out by the Government this year in reducing the cost of PRSI.  This will give an incentive to employers to take on extra workers.  However, it would be welcome if a once off major injection of £200 million or £300 million was made available by the Government for a budget provision towards reducing the cost of PRSI to employers totally.  This would be a major step.  It would be a statement by Government that it wants employers to take on extra people and that this employment will not be taxed.</P>
      <P>We should consider the number of people employed in the services sector in recent years and the figures produced yesterday.  Approximately 39,000 people are employed in this sector and it shows the initiative of many people throughout the country.  It also demonstrates the efforts of the many agencies in helping those people to get off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county enterprise boards have been a help to individuals who wished to start their own small business but who were not in a position to receive help from the IDA or others.  The boards have not solved all the problems and they are sometimes wary of allowing somebody to start up in competition <Col N="1903" /> to another operator.  However, as I pointed out previously, competition is the life of trade and if people have a good idea they should be given an opportunity and help to get up and running.</P>
    <P>Many people have been helped recently by schemes and the county enterprise boards.  Some Members of the House have complained bitterly about the lack of progress being made by some of the boards, but it ultimately comes down to the amount of funds made available to them.  Nevertheless, they have made an input to helping some people start their own business and it would be wrong not to recognise this point.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned the banks and the difficulties faced by individuals who do not have bank records in getting funds to start their own business.  There is an old saying that if one owes millions of pounds to a financial institution, the institution will play ball because that is the only chance it has of getting its money back.  However, if one seeks £4,000 or £5,000 or one owes that amount, the institution is in daily contact by telephone.  If somebody is overdrawn by a small amount of money, the institutions almost live with them. People who want to start their own business are frightened and decide against taking out a small loan to do so.</P>
    <P>The figures produced indicate the number of people who have started businesses or who are employed in the services sector.  They show that many of the jobs which were in the black economy have been removed from there because of the help provided by the county enterprise boards and others. Progress in this area has helped to reduce the numbers in the black economy.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Henry about the position of individuals who take up jobs but immediately find that their medical cards are withdrawn.  The Government should decide that the children of these individuals will continue to be covered by the medical card.  If that were the <Col N="1904" /> case the people concerned would be quite happy; they are left in a difficult position when they are cut off completely once they go over the limit.  This affects many people at present and prevents them taking up employment when they consider the overall costs involved and the loss of the medical card if they have a young family.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned tourism.  I have a deep interest in this area and I have had the opportunity to examine changes the industry should make. There are plans to invest £653 million in the tourism industry under the operational programme up to the end of the century.  Of this, £84 million will come from the Exchequer and £369 million from the European Community. However, I have major difficulties with the way in which assessments are carried out with regard to tourism investment.</P>
    <P>We have reached a position in October 1995 where many foreign companies are willing to consider investing in this country's tourism sector.  Many companies are around as result of the huge increase in the number of tourists who visited Ireland this year and the fact that the ceasefire is heading into its fourteenth month.  We hope it will continue and that further progress will be made in that area.  I have no doubt the Taoiseach and others are working diligently in that regard.</P>
    <P>More than 4,000 boats used the recently reopened canal between the Shannon and Ballinamore.  It is mind-boggling when one thinks of what can happen when proper foresight is available and proper investment made. There is no doubt this area will reap the benefit of the investment made there when one considers the number of boats which used the canal this year.  It is quite staggering.</P>
    <P>If investors are available, particularly foreign investors and the many companies in Ireland which are willing to invest in improving the tourism base and product which exists, there should be no delay in dealing with and approving <Col N="1905" /> their applications if the proposals stand up.  The powers that be should be allowed to get on with investing foreigners' money in this country.  This will ensure that when the extra people arrive we will get the benefit of the extra jobs those investments create.  There are undoubtedly some people who would prefer developments to go down the tubes rather than get behind them and give them the push they require.  I hope attitudes will change in that regard, as has been the case in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this motion dealing with the enhancement of the growth of jobs in the services sector.  I deal with young people in the transition from school to work and it strikes me that the financial services sector provides a great opportunity for those who are inclined in that direction and great potential for job creation, particularly in light of ever increasing links with Europe.  Another area of potential employment is tourism. Tourism provides opportunities at all levels in the food and hotel industries.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the National Economic and Social Forum for its recommendations. Hopefully, we will find a way to have them implemented.  We must also examine the leisure activities sector which has great potential for job creation.  So many people from all walks of life are stressed out nowadays and here is a golden opportunity to develop that industry.  There is potential for young people to get involved in many related courses now coming on stream.</P>
      <P>There should be jobs available in what I will call household services &mdash; helping the old, providing cleaning services and household repairs, for example.  We all know how difficult it can be to find a carpenter or a plumber when we need one.  There are untapped opportunities in this sector.  There should be a list of such services available in every area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> In considering how we can implement the recommendations I would approach the matter from an education and training viewpoint.  There are opportunities for the long-term unemployed to get back into the workforce via the link between education and work.  Courses should be available in each area aimed toward child care services.  There should be a national policy involving the local authorities and every time there is jobs development in an area a créche should be set up.  There should be a local child care service for people in the area.</P>
    <P>We have to start again at local level. Small is beautiful; if we adopt too centrist an approach we do not always succeed. The county enterprise boards provide an opportunity to involve all the local initiatives &mdash; the banks, the unemployed and local representatives &mdash; toward identifying what job creating services may be viable in their areas. This report provides an opportunity to move forward quickly.  It is not a large programme but it is a question of resources.  The main employment growth is to be found in this sector.  It has increased by 54 per cent over the last 20 years and it should grow further over the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social economy, child care and education, there are many new courses coming on stream but it can be difficult to get accreditation for the courses.  The Minister cannot work alone on this matter as it is slightly outside of his remit, but FÁS, which is the Minister's responsibility, and the Department of Education could work together.  When some people complete a course they should have an opportunity to move into a training programme with FÁS who would have links with industry.  That is not happening in relation to apprenticeships.  At present if one does not have an employer as sponsor one cannot get an apprenticeship. No matter how well we educate our young people with technological and hands-on skills they will be lost if <Col N="1907" /> they cannot get an employer to sponsor them.  We have an obligation to involve local industry and FÁS.  There is an imbalance between FÁS training and industry.</P>
    <P>The new leaving certificate applied programmes have not been fully tested as yet so they cannot be used to side-step FÁS.  That will happen: education will side-step FÁS if we do not get cooperation. I ask the Minister to look at how FÁS links in with the educational sector.  This is a way in which these recommendations can be implemented in relation to marketing, management and language skills which involve a continuity from the education sector.  We have to see how best we can link in with young people who are not necessarily academically oriented but might be very good in hands-on apprenticeships.  Such apprenticeships would tap into a much needed resource.</P>
    <P>We need local initiatives which are small in scale and are involved with local industry, banks.  FÁS and education authorities.  That would be a good recommendation to put in force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry and Senator Quinn for putting forward this motion and giving us the opportunity to discuss this report.  The Minister played his part in the NESF when he was a member of it.</P>
      <P>It is important to record a welcome for the figures of the labour force survey which show an increase of 49,000 in the number of people at work in the financial year from April 1994 to April 1995. As Senator Henry said, it was the biggest annual increase recorded in a labour force survey and the highest growth rate of the industrialised OECD countries.  It is a remarkable increase which sheds some light on the gloom and doom of unemployment figures. However, the number of people on the live register is a source of serious concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1908" /> On the Order of Business this morning Senator Mulcahy indicated that the number of people unemployed was 300,000.  He grossly exaggerated the figures; they are nowhere near 300,000, although they are high.  Unemployment has to be the major focus of our attention. The labour force survey put the figure at 192,000 at the end of April 1995 and the live register at the time put them at 276,000.  We must examine how these statistics are compiled as there seems to be a disparity between the labour force survey and the live register figures for unemployment.  Questions have to be asked as to what are the correct figures.  I think such an investigation will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government will meet tomorrow to discuss long-term unemployment.  While these figures, together with the general growth rate, indicate that there is good news on the jobs and economics fronts, there is also a sector of society, the long-term unemployed, which appears to be completely untouched by this good news.  I am aware that actions have been taken, especially in response to the National Economic and Social Forum Report No. 4, such as the local employment service, which has been put into operation this year and is now beginning to have an effect.  However, there is a need to focus strongly on this sector of the community, as it is still very much untouched by many of the good things that are happening.</P>
    <P>The labour force survey indicates that the highest growth rate in employment is taking place in the services sector, the sector we are focusing on this evening. We are right to do so as this sector is very labour intensive and, therefore, has the greatest potential to create jobs.</P>
    <P>It is not true to suggest that Government policy with regard to tax, PRSI and so on has not been helpful in this area.  Other Senators, especially Senator Fahey, have indicated that the Government has not been taking much notice <Col N="1909" /> of the problems of job creation in the services sector.  However, the last two budgets &mdash; the Senator's party was involved in formulating one of them &mdash; have made considerable progress in this area, especially with regard to employer's PRSI and other areas the Government was asked to address by the task force on small businesses.  In the last budget, for example, a new employer's PRSI rate of 9 per cent was introduced in respect of those being paid annual salaries of up to £12,000. This includes those who are paid up to £231 per week, which represents a big step in making it easier for employers to employ people in that wage bracket.  It encompasses many of the kind of employees we are addressing.  It is, therefore, not fair to say that the Government has not been addressing this issue.  I hope it will continue to address it in future budgets.</P>
    <P>It is important that we focus on lasting jobs, because many jobs are created that do not last.  Figures indicate that of the jobs that were grant aided in 1983, half had disappeared ten years later.  It is, therefore, important that there are proper business plans and access to help and assistance when it is needed, not when the jobs are on the line and almost gone, as it is often too late at that stage. There must be a system in place to ensure that those who create jobs can be supported when they need it, whether it be in terms of clustering or help with marketing, research and development and so on.</P>
    <P>In this respect I take issue with Senator Ross, when, in a debate in the House last week, he launched a tirade against the need for any State involvement on the basis that those engaged in job creation should be let at it. However, the fact is that indigenous industries did very little when we let them at it in the past.  It is not, therefore, fair to suggest that interventions are not doing any good: they are doing a lot of good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1910" /> I support Senator Ormonde's remarks on training and the trades and the need to have the educational and training services, whose ultimate aim is employment, linked together, so that we are training people for the kind of jobs that will be available.  It is especially important not to let people out of school without trying to focus on where they are going.  Many young people leave school and perhaps go into a youth training scheme or whatever, but often they fall into the big black hole of unemployment which they find very difficult to climb out of.  It is, therefore, important that such people are held on to and that they are guided in some way into something that may be marketable in the jobs market.</P>
    <P>It is important that there be a good infrastructure.  For example, a number of services industries from abroad have located at the Plessey Technological Park because everything was laid on for them &mdash; they were located close to the University of Limerick and so on.  The availability of money is also important.</P>
    <P>With regard to the kind of jobs that are available in the services sector. Senator Quinn focused on tourism.  It is important that we have good jobs in tourism as opposed to any old jobs. Many people are being taken on in the tourism industry and they are not being properly paid.  They do not have proper hours of work and are very unprotected. In this respect we must focus on the area of protection for workers.  We must also focus on the need for marketing in the tourism industry, as evidenced by reports yesterday, where people in the UK were unaware that there are hotels in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the question of the black economy.  When employers take on people in the services sector, much of the time they are competing with others who are employing people in the black economy.  It is, therefore, very difficult for them to compete.  We must look at areas where people are <Col N="1911" /> working but are not registered as working. They are claiming unemployment benefit with the collusion of their employers.  In addition, the areas of the black economy identified by Senator Henry with regard to personal services, such as child care and work being done in the home, must be challenged in some way.  The report makes reference to, and a recommendation on, a home service system that the Danish Government is trying to implement, where it would be advantageous to people to employ others in these personal services in the real economy.  We should consider this.  It has not worked very well in Denmark, but we have such a big black economy in Ireland that perhaps it may work somewhat better here.</P>
    <P>Much of the time we appear to suffer from what has been described as paralysis by analysis, and many of these reports are left on shelves.  I therefore welcome the fact that the Minister is actively pursuing the recommendations in the report and that he will be reporting back to the Government with regard to the specific recommendations. I hope they will be acted upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister acknowledged that in a previous life he sat on the forum.  Both of us sat on the forum and I could not help thinking that he has done well since.  In the best competitive spirit, I hope I can aspire to at least a part of what the Minister has achieved since we both soldiered together on the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still honoured to be a member of the forum and wish to commend my colleague, Senator Henry, for taking the opportunity of providing us with a debate on the report.  It is timely, because I attended the first meeting of the reconstituted forum yesterday and the question of the media perception of the forum arose.  It was the subject of some weighty debate.  The point was made that perhaps the forum's reports <Col N="1912" /> were gathering dust, were not being analysed and were not being acted on to the extent they should be, considering the amount of time, effort and energy that had gone into them.  It is a subject the forum will be returning to during its term of office.  It is not a priority, although it will be discussed.</P>
    <P>The main priority of the forum is concentrated on the question of job creation.  In discussing our work priorities for the coming session, I proposed that education and skills training should be a priority for debate, and this was adopted.  In this I am grateful to my colleague, the Government representative on the forum, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Fitzgerald, who was anxious that this issue be dealt with sooner rather than later.  There was a great deal of consensus across the three strands that these issues be considered.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked: are we educating our youngsters to meet the challenges of the modern labour market? Two areas especially have received significant Government support over the past ten to 15 years &mdash; tourism, and, more recently, the film industry and the arts generally.  CERT has an enviable record &mdash; almost 100 per cent &mdash; on placement, while Ireland is fast developing as a major location for feature films.</P>
    <P>However, a recent FÁS report, published before the summer, and which the Minister is probably familiar with, stated that Ireland was losing big budget feature films to the UK and other European countries due to the lack of availability of a skilled workforce in the various areas that are particular to the industry.  On the one hand, therefore, while we have been welcoming the advantages that have accrued from the implementation of section 35 of the Finance Act, the industry has, on the other hand, become something like our burgeoning tourism industry.  We are fast reaching a point where perhaps we have <Col N="1913" /> not got the workforce or the skills necessary to take advantage of this phenomenal growth.  It must start in the schools.</P>
    <P>As a member of the board of studies and communications and the arts at the National Council for Vocational Awards, the question of providing suitable modules in our vocational schools sector to respond to the changing nature of the jobs market is now a matter that is exercising the minds of the various boards of studies, who are, in effect, establishing the modules that will be providing the educational vehicle for those in the post leaving certificate phase.</P>
    <P>That topic has been touched on by practically everybody tonight.  It appears that education is where we must concentrate our energies and we must look at it in much more detail.  An inter-departmental approach between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Education is required to analyse if we are doing the right thing in the education sector.  Only last week Kieran McGowan raised the spectre of an immediate future where we would be unable to take advantage of our economic growth because we would not have the skills necessary to adapt to changes in the labour market. The acknowledgment in the late 1960s of the then changing needs of the labour market resulted in us having a skilled and educated workforce readily available and that was the priority in selling Ireland as an industrial location.  Those now involved in attracting inward investment are sounding alarm bells and the problem can be traced back to the educational sector.</P>
    <P>The results of the annual CSO labour survey published today confirm what many of us have believed for a long time.  There is no doubt that the major growth in jobs in the Irish economy is in the services sector.  The figures confirm that 39,000 new jobs were created in the services sector on a year to year basis <Col N="1914" /> up to April this year.  This growth has been achieved despite Government neglect of a sector which has been positively discriminated against by successive administrations.  In that regard, however, I acknowledge, as the Minister said earlier, that one of the most significant initiatives adopted recently has been the small business operational programme he launched last month.  I wish it well.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in referring to the operational programme, talked about inculcating best practice among small businesses. Best practice is a term I have heard my colleague, Senator Quinn, use <i>ad nauseam,</i> and I mean that in the nicest possible way.  He is involved in the commercial sector and I know what he means.  I hope the Minister's term coincides in meaning with Senator Quinn's interpretation of best practice &mdash; to improve and enhance rather than have the dead hand of bureaucracy falling across the services sector under the operational programme.</P>
    <P>During the debates in this House about bureaucracy in the State and semi-State sector the activities of the county enterprise boards, which are the responsibility of the Minister's Department, have received a certain amount of criticism.  The Minister is aware of these criticisms and I hope he will address them.  The bureaucratic overhang that is now inculcating itself into the county enterprise board culture is having an inhibiting effect on people who wish to get involved in the industrial sector and create jobs.  That attitude started many years ago in our society.  The Minister mentioned the anti-competitive nature of Irish society.  It is no secret that the lack of enthusiasm for recognition of the valuable contribution which the services industry is making to the Irish economy emanates from a culture in our Civil Service that does not understand how the industry operates and refuses on some occasions to encourage it to grow by placing obstacles in its way.  I do not <Col N="1915" /> subscribe to the view Senator O'Sullivan ascribed to our colleague, Senator Ross, which is to &ldquo;let them at it&rdquo;.  I agree that one does not &ldquo;let them at it&rdquo; but at the same time there must be balance and sometimes the balance is not achieved.  Sometimes, when a quango is set up, the dead hand of Civil Service bureaucracy lets the Department get its hands on it and ensures, come hell or high water, that whatever the Minister's or Government's views or proposals are, they will be obstructed in some way.</P>
    <P>I endorse the conclusions and recommendations of the forum report, especially in the following areas: a thorough reassessment of the underlying policy approach to the non-trading sector; a definitive declaration of the distinctions between some services in the manufacturing sector; a definite policy commitment to supporting the further development of the sector by ending the relative neglect by successive Governments through a more balanced treatment of all sectors in the areas of taxation and State aid.  This strategy should be implemented across all areas of policy and any resistance among individual Departments to this new approach should be ruthlessly overcome in the interests of tackling more decisively our unemployment problem.  Bord Tráchtála should be made available to the services sector, with the board acting in concert with individuals and/or firms in identifying areas of import substitution and overseas consultancy services.</P>
    <P>I asked a question at the forum yesterday and perhaps the Minister might answer it.  Why is it that the United States of America can operate on the basis of a 6 to 7 per cent unemployment rate &mdash; it rarely has a high unemployment rate &mdash; yet we in this country and in Europe have endemic unemployment? Why is it that the wealthiest region in this country, Dublin and the east, still has the highest level of long-term unemployment?  Perhaps if we <Col N="1916" /> looked at these comparisons we might address the issue.  The culture the Minister and others referred to is not healthy in any society and the sooner our leaders understand this the better it will be for society generally.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate on the National Economic and Social Forum Report No. 7 dealing with the jobs potential of the services sector.  The report emphasises once again the value of this broadly based forum which includes not just politicians but also representatives of the social partners and various interest groups.  The report is a credit to all those involved.  It is not just a valuable contribution to the debate on job creation in this area but it also provides a clear programme of action and sets out many logical and practical proposals for job creation.</P>
      <P>This debate is particularly timely following the publication of the annual labour force figures which show an increase of 49,000 in the numbers at work.  It is worth recalling that unemployment reached over 100,000 in the 1970s and there has been a rapid and constant growth in the following two decades.  A major feature of the problem is the existence on the live register of a substantial number of long-term unemployed. Of those who have been out of work for a long period, almost half have been out of work for more than three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the 1970s because the problem started in the 1970s and 1980s.  The employers in this country decided that whatever else they would do, they would reduce the numbers employed. They had the assistance of the State in doing that.  People were made redundant on the one hand, but on the other hand were re-employed within months by the same employers on a seasonal basis.  These instances were scandals in their own right.  Jobs were being lost but it was a deliberate strategy by the employers to reduce the number of <Col N="1917" /> people in employment.  They planned it and got away with it.  They are getting away with it to this day under the guise of the cost of employing a person.  That aspect of the issue must be examined. There was the same experience in the dairy industry.  It was making huge profits but laid people off for three months of the year to draw unemployment benefit and get a tax refund &mdash; to think that such a thing can happen in a country whose economy is only trying to get going.</P>
    <P>Training and targeting are the keys to getting people off the dole and into productive and useful jobs.  In this regard the recent establishment by the Government of the local employment service is particularly welcome.  I hope it will shortly be extended to all areas of the country.  The focus on training must begin before people leave school.  It is not acceptable that so many should leave school with little or no qualifications for employment and that as many as 6 per cent are leaving without even the junior certificate.</P>
    <P>A swathe of economic and social devastation is being cut, not just through areas of our cities but also through many towns and villages in rural Ireland and it has to receive the political priority it deserves.  In this regard I welcome the decision to hold a special Cabinet meeting on the whole unemployment issue.</P>
    <P>There is no simple solution to the problem of unemployment.  Any effective strategy will have to be carefully thought out and will need long-term political commitment.  A start can be made, however, in next year's budget by focusing resources on the long-term unemployed and in particular by ensuring that school leavers have access to job related training.  The present level of unemployment cannot be allowed to continue.  This Government promised to make jobs a priority and it is now up to all of us on this side of the House to ensure that this promise is honoured.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> I have read page 31 of the report with great care.  It shows that the European Commission estimates that up to 3 million jobs could be created in the European Union in the areas of local services. They include home services, neighbourhood shops, counselling and assistance for young people and house improvements.  It is about time the Government introduced a home improvement grants scheme; we have not had such a scheme for a number of years.  Many jobs could be created if the Government put a home improvement grant scheme in place.</P>
    <P>Since the early 1980s Cork County Council has submitted a document to the Minister for Social Welfare, which we have updated in recent years, which shows that if there was some consultation between the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Finance, Social Welfare and the Environment, a large number of people could be employed by the local authorities.  The difference between the rate of social welfare paid and the basic rate paid in the local authority is not great.  If somebody worked on that aspect a great number of jobs could be provided by local authorities.  This is a fairly well researched document.  We have given a copy to the Minister for Social Welfare and I will send the Minister present a copy within the next couple of days.  Our experience of FÁS and community employment schemes indicates quite clearly that large numbers of people are willing and able to get out there and work.</P>
    <P>NESF points out that the service sector can play a crucial role in job creation.  There is clearly considerable scope for expansion in the sector and the report highlights the fact that services in this country account for 58 per cent of gross domestic product compared to the EU average of 64 per cent. I discussed this with some people who are worth talking to in matters of employment.  The way the use of technology <Col N="1919" /> has developed in this country is crazy.  The cost of installing, improving or increasing technology seems to mean nothing to employers.  The cost of maintaining it seems to mean nothing, so long as it will result in fewer people employed.  Somebody must look very seriously at this question because many people are put on the dole queues as a result of the introduction and development of technology which is not always necessary, and they cannot be absorbed into the workforce.  There is a need to look at that situation as well.</P>
    <P>Jobs in the services sector have often been regarded less favourably than those in productive or public sector areas.  Part of the reason for this has been the perception that pay levels for service jobs are automatically lower than those in other sectors.  While this is not true of all service jobs, it has to be acknowledged that pay rates in some parts of the services sector are below the levels required and this often reduces the attraction of taking up these jobs for the unemployed, particularly when the loss of other benefits is taken into consideration. That was mentioned here previously.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, is currently engaged in a wide ranging review of the various obstacles facing unemployed people who are presented with job opportunities with a view to removing these obstacles and making it more worthwhile for them to take up employment. The Department of Social Welfare pays £23 million to 11,000 employees supporting around 31,000 children because their pay is so low.  There is clearly a need to look at extending to the services sector the concept of minimum wages, which we have in particular industries covered by the joint labour committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report which seems to be a very good report.  I would like to make a number of comments, <Col N="1920" /> however.  I welcome the stress in the report on the interdependence between the service and manufacturing sectors because occasionally they can be portrayed as being almost mutually exclusive.  It is a mature way of looking at the interrelationship between the manufacturing sector and the service sector but I am a little hesitant about some of the comparisons, about the percentages of the service sector ascribed to various countries and the imputation that Ireland is lagging a bit behind.  It may be that we are, but it is very hard to know what the correct criteria are, if there are correct criteria in comparisons of this type.</P>
      <P>I do not know if this will come as a shock to Senator Ross, but our public administration and defence sectors lag well behind the average size of those sectors in the EU which, of course, is mainly ascribable to defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We could remedy that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as we have had the great foresight to let others look after us.</P>
      <P>Our service sector has done remarkably well given the hindrances and obstacles it has had to overcome and which, no doubt, have been described and discussed in detail so far.  However, the way we should look at it is not that we are doing badly but that if we can do this well, given the number of problems which the sector faces, we could do exceptionally well if a number of those obstacles were removed.  I am encouraged by the performance of the sector so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A feeling of <i>déjá vu</i> is beginning to hit me this session.  It is as if one were going back over the same reports time and time again and finding the same arguments coming up time and time again.  There is, for instance, a tribute to the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and to Seán Healy's work which, I think, is actually very impressál <Col N="1921" /> ive and potentially a very important work, but it is pretty well the same reference we had to it about a year ago, and I remember asking then whether this was being expanded if it was successful, and if it was not successful why it was being kept on.  The figures quoted in this report are much the same as the figures quoted a year ago.  I wish to ask the Minister what is happening in that direction and if there is the potential the report says for the developments in that area.</P>
    <P>The social economy sector which is stressed here is one of the most encouraging emphases in the report.  One can have quibbles about individual aspects of it but the emphasis in this carries one back 35 years to one of the first economic books one ever read &mdash;<i>The Affluent Society</i> by Kenneth Galbraith &mdash; where the whole question of social economy was addressed in his inimitable prose.  Since it takes about 30 years for an idea to penetrate through into policy making consciousness one is pleased to see that, by the early 1990s, it is beginning to achieve a foothold in our thinking; that is commendable.  I will not linger over the details again, but I would be supportive of developments in that direction.</P>
    <P>I have two questions.  The first is about the emphasis on home services. That has social as well as economic implications and there is a way of looking at home work here.  Paragraph 3.23 of the report states that &ldquo;There are considerable labour resources tied up in unpaid work in the home.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is an interesting phraseology for that particular issue.  At one level one might say that the Government and the rest of us ought to grateful that there are considerable labour resources tied up in unpaid work in the home, because if that labour supply was on the market, as it is in most other OECD countries, our unemployment statistics would look distinctly worse than they do, whether <Col N="1922" /> one is talking about those released yesterday or those given for the live register. There is, of course, an ideological perspective involved in that phraseology as well with which I do not entirely disagree, but that needs to be teased out, and the implications need to be teased out, in terms not just of the type of economy but in terms of the type of society we are thinking of.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make concerns the role of education and training. If we look at paragraphs 5.10 and 5.11 of the report, under the heading &ldquo;Education and Training&rdquo;, what do we find? We find there is virtually nothing about education; it is virtually all about training. We have a way of blurring these two as if they are the same thing.  There is an overlap between them, but they are conceptually quite different. Important though training is &mdash; let me not be misunderstood because I am not for one moment speaking against training &mdash; thinking in training terms is not sufficient for the rapidly changing world in which we find ourselves.  It may be that for the unfortunate current long-term unemployed that is, in a sense, the best one can do because, if they are to have any chance of getting back into the job market, they must have training. They must have short-term pressurised input to try to make them employable but, if we keep thinking of training as the ultimate we are aiming for in terms of many of the least privileged in our society, then we will inevitably, over time, condemn them to the scrap heap.</P>
    <P>Training, in the sense of technical skills and competence in a fairly specific narrow area, however useful to an employer in the short term, will have those people on the scrap heap quickly again.  Retraining and retraining will not make them long-term employable. There must be an education input in terms of a concept of what they are doing, why they are doing it, other ways of doing it and so on.  Therefore, I urge that, for the younger people, we think <Col N="1923" /> of training as far as possible in a wider educational framework because, in a world of such rapid change, specific clusters of skills will inevitably become obsolescent relatively quickly.  Unless there is the capacity to readapt to those changing circumstances, one is building labour obsolescence into even the most intensive and, in the short term, best devised training programme.</P>
    <P>Let me finish with the observation that, in the context of the services sector, where so much depends on interpersonal relations and the capacity to relate to other human beings &mdash; it is much more a personality driven area than is manufacturing industry in the classic industrial revolution sense &mdash; the education system must take more on board at all levels the topic of personality development.  We used to call it character development; &ldquo;character&rdquo; has prejudicial implications nowadays.  At both youth and adult level education that is a dimension that must not be neglected or the fruits of the investment will be much less than they could be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say how grateful I am to Senator Lee because, if I had to listen to him in full flow, I would find it difficult to follow.  It was the only speech I heard &mdash; and I have heard them all &mdash; which has not, on this particular motion, taken the opportunity to weep crocodile tears for the unemployed, congratulate everybody in sight for producing the report and identifying with the good parts in it.  I personally feel that debating this report in the Seanad this evening is a waste of time.  It is simply a means for everybody, once again, to express their own point of view, reaching a consensus and saying something nice about the National Economic and Social Forum, which we are all supposed to believe is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the National Economic and Social Forum?  It is a group of 49 people <Col N="1924" /> brought together by the Government in 1993 to paint the picture that politicians were concerned about unemployment. The 49 people went to Kilmainham, in front of the cameras, they sat around and talked about unemployment.  Guess who was the first person to be thrown out at the first meeting?  It was a member of a group for the unemployed; he was not allowed in because this was for people to impress the press and the public that politicians and others actually had a great concern about those who had no work.  It is a bogus organisation. It was set up as a cosmetic organisation and now we are wasting the Seanad's time debating its reports.</P>
    <P>I do not need the NESF report to tell me that the services sector can produce employment.  It is ridiculous that we should be doing this.  This particular body has had one great innovation: it formally allowed three members of the unemployed in to talk about unemployment. Up to then, we had the extraordinary situation where the people in charge of this country and the people in charge of solving the employment problems, excluded the unemployed from even talking about unemployment. Apparently, they were the only people who did not know anything about it.  We had the trade unions, the farmers and the so-called &ldquo;social partners&rdquo; reaching an agreement on what was good for the unemployed.  The NESF was the first body to let them in to talk about it.  It did not let many of them in: as far as I know, it let three of them in to what the Minister called &ldquo;the third strand&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This third strand is the great gesture towards the disadvantaged in our society and it includes the disabled, the unemployed and &mdash; guess what? &mdash; women.  There is a special place in this forum for women.  Wonderful; how good of the Government.  Unfortunately, women do not need special representation on this group because the majority of the Oireachtas Members are women.  I do not know what they are <Col N="1925" /> doing at this forum because they have plenty of other forums to talk about unemployment.  Yet they must have women in as a women's group to represent women there as well.  Since the majority of the members of the National Economic and Social Forum are women I do not know, nor do I understand, why they must have extra representation on this forum.  Apparently, they are so disadvantaged now that, even when they are in a majority, they need extra representation. The chairman is also a women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with it, but I do not see why women, when they have a majority, need an extra three members.  They are doing very well.  People like Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Henry, who are on the forum, and others are capable of representing women without having extra token women members being appointed to represent women.  This is an absurd forum and everybody knows it.  I know it is ridiculous because everybody agrees it is a good thing.  The one problem with politics in this country is that, when one hits what is supposed to be a national consensus, one must question it.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum is the great escape for politicians to pretend they are concerned about unemployment.  The proof of this particular pudding is in the eating.  It is an academically good report but it is a message which, unfortunately, we have all heard before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stated in all newspapers every day that the services sector is the key to <Col N="1926" /> resolving the unemployment problem. Unfortunately, despite us knowing what this key is and the massive quango in Kilmainham, we have not solved this problem.  Despite the Minister's great success last week in bringing more jobs to Intel Ireland, which I acknowledged, and the extraordinary figures which were issued yesterday and which directly conflict with other figures which have been issued, we have a disgraceful unemployment problem which has not been tackled in a serious way.  I was disappointed with much of what the Minister said because the real way to tackle unemployment is by a radical approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The solution does not lie in anything Senator Ross might say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this will work but I know that shovelling money at the unemployed and keeping them off the dole queues, which is what Senator Sherlock's party believes in, has not worked.  Giving the unemployed what the Minister refers to as assistance or support means giving them grants.  It means that every time there is a problem, such as the possibility of a factory closing, etc., we provide money to maintain jobs and do exactly the same when the problem arises again.</P>
      <P>This is not the way to tackle unemployment. The way to do that is the only way we have not tried, and that is, to create wealth and not jobs.  If we create an environment in which business and enterprise can flourish, jobs will follow. This will not be done by giving grants and creating quango after quango which pretend they are concerned about the unemployed.  It will not be done by giving money to the IDA and Forbairt for factories or by giving money to the county enterprise boards to get people off our backs.  A radical fundamental approach is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> To read the NESF report is one thing but to take it seriously is another.  The NESF is a cruel joke; it is an offence against the unemployed to create bodies like this to give the impression that something will be done by them.  The forum provides academic reports for this House to debate in a vacuum while everybody knows that nothing will be done at the end of these debates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The report of the NESF highlights the importance of the services sector as a source of employment.  I am glad it refers to the key role this sector plays in providing job opportunities for women. For many women, this type of employment, which does not have the same rigidity as industrial employment in terms of working hours, provides them with their only means of access to the jobs market.</P>
      <P>The report clearly highlights the extent to which the sector's job creation potential is being frustrated by the economic policies we are currently pursuing. As the report illustrates, the services sector is still relatively under-developed in Ireland compared to other OECD countries.  Only 57 per cent of total employment here is in this sector compared to corresponding figures of 69 per cent in the United Kingdom and 72 per cent in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key issues in creating jobs in this and all other sectors are corporate and personal taxation.  We have a serious unemployment problem, although the figures which were issued yesterday, if they are to be believed, seem to suggest we are paying unemployment assistance to people who are not officially unemployed. We impose huge taxes on work and the average employee is liable for income tax, PRSI, and employment and health contributions at a very low level of pay.  Somebody who works in a shop, restaurant or factory for £4.50 an hour, <Col N="1928" /> which would give a weekly income of £180 a week, pays almost £42 a week to the State.  It is hardly surprising in these circumstances that the unemployment problem is as bad as it is.</P>
    <P>The report makes sensible and practical recommendations as to how we can facilitate job creation in the services sector. However, we have had many reports but little action, particularly in the areas of taxation and labour market dynamics.  I hope we do not continue to produce reports but will act on this report and endeavour to get it right.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and the Senators who contributed to the debate.  The forum has an importance for those on it who were described by the Minister as the third strand because it is their only opportunity to directly communicate with those of us who are elected.  It is important that Members of the <Col N="1929" /> Oireachtas who are members of the forum keep their mouths shut because this means we learn an enormous amount from those who can tell us the exact problems on the ground faced by those who are out of employment, are disadvantaged or are part of the 50 per cent of the population who have been granted three additional seats in the forum.</P>
      <P>The Minister and others spoke about training.  I take seriously Senator Lee's important point about education not being the same as training.  It would be worthwhile to make sure our training programmes are up to international standards and have international certification.</P>
      <P>We should not worry too much about competition.  We spoke about the banks not lending to one group if this resulted in competition which would cause the failure of a similar industry nearby. Everybody said the courier business would be the end of An Post but the company is doing as well as it ever did while, at the same time, there are more and more couriers, whether on bicycles or motor bikes, all over the city and they are part of thriving small businesses.  I know a person cannot be a motor bike courier into old age but such jobs are certainly a start and they gave a great deal of employment to people who had few job opportunities at the time.  We should not under-estimate any area which can produce employment.</P>
      <P>Some women Senators spoke about the home care and child care sectors, which are important.  We must also deal with the black economy which is an important source of employment for women.  We should make it more structured from the taxation and training points of view and we should provide tax free allowances for those who employ people in that sector.  I thank the Minister and I appreciate the initiatives he has taken in this area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and I am sure he will ably stand in for the Minister for Justice and pass on my comments to her.</P>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this important matter which is causing difficulty for people buying and selling properties and for the legal profession.  I have received a number of representations on this matter. The problem relates to delays in the issuing of copy folios by the Land Registry. No doubt the Minister will be aware that the Land Registry, like other great bodies in this country, is coming into the age of the computer.  However, it has only partly gone down that road.  Unfortunately, many counties lag far behind. In certain counties there is a six to eight week or more delay in the issuing of folios.  That is not satisfactory in this day and age.  It is causing difficulties and delays in land sales.</P>
      <P>From discussing this matter with colleagues in the House and from representations received, I understand some people are experiencing difficulties in some counties and that there is a shortage of staff in some areas.  I ask the Minister to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Justice and to support the case for the appointment of extra staff to certain areas in the Land Registry. I understand from the recommended figure of 540 that there is a shortage of approximately 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Registry deals with the availability of folios, mapping queries and questions on title, etc.  There is no doubt that this must be improved.  I ask <Col N="1931" /> the Minister to respond to counties experiencing special difficulties. Recently a case in County Cavan was brought to my attention which concerned the transfer of a small cottage. The person in question was informed that there would be a delay of at least eight weeks or longer in the issuing of a folio.  This is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>A lot of work has been done manually in certain areas to get the system on stream.  However, there is a considerable backlog and there is a shortage of staff.  Staff supposedly involved in computerisation should possibly be directed elsewhere.  It is unacceptable to ask people to wait eight to ten weeks or longer for the issue of a folio where other sales may depend on it.  I am sure the Minister would agree.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to relay to the Minister for Justice my concerns, those of the Law Society of Ireland, practitioners and the public.  I am a member of a profession which, I am the first to admit, has not been without its difficulties. However, it is being blamed for this, although it has nothing to do with the profession.  I am joined here by my colleague, Senator Enright, a fellow practitioner.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond positively and to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Justice.  This matter is certainly worthy of support if it comes before Cabinet in the coming weeks.  I am sure there are practitioners in the Minister's area of Galway city and county who are aware of this difficulty. In some counties people will have to wait until possibly after Christmas for a copy folio.  If the sale of a person's house, land or cottage is delayed, people are affected.  Could I share my time with Senator Enright?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Cosgrave on this matter.  I have dealt with Land Registry staff for over 30 years and I have found them exceptionally <Col N="1932" /> helpful, courteous and obliging. They will help anyone who approaches them for assistance.  I accept what Senator Cosgrave said about delays in issuing folios and file plans.</P>
      <P>A similar situation arises where a person has been allocated land by the Land Commission.  They must register it in the Land Registry to obtain a folio number. They are allocated a schedule number and then they must go on a waiting list.  I hate to say this, but there is approximately a four year delay, which is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that a change in that will be difficult if not impossible because I have tried.  I ask the Minister to see if he can help.  The Minister represents a rural area as well as a city.  People face delays as regards set aside and headage payments and other grants because they cannot lodge the proper folio, file plans and maps with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Much of this relates to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and I am not sure if the Land Registry is under this Department or the Department of Justice. I ask the Minister to look into this. I thank you, a Cathaoirligh, and Senator Cosgrave for allowing me to speak on this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to speak and to give Members an up to date report on the current work situation in the Land Registry.  I assure both Senators that I will convey their detailed remarks to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, who apologises that she could not be here tonight, but she is attending to other urgent business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge this issue is a matter of concern to both Senators and to the people on whose behalf they have raised this issue.  As I am sure most Members of the House will be aware, an arrears situation has existed in the Land Registry for some time.  Basically, the arrears situation arose due to staff shortages <Col N="1933" /> over a period of time.  However, I am happy to be able to report that significant progress has been, and is being, made in relation to speeding up the processing of all transactions in the Land Registry.  I should say I have a personal source of information in that my wife was a former staff member of the Land Registry.  She has her own unique view on the cause of the delays.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific item to which Senator Cosgrave referred, the average time taken to process the issue of a copy folio is now down to seven days from receipt of an application.  The average time taken to process the issue of a copy map is 13 days from receipt of an application.  I am sure Members will agree that the time taken in respect of both of these cases is not overly long.</P>
    <P>The majority of applicants nowadays seek a copy folio with the relevant copy file plan map attached.  Each month the registry receives about 10,000 applications for copy folios or copy maps and virtually all the applicants receive their folio map within the acceptable time-frame I mentioned.  Where there are exceptionally large inflows of applications for a particular county or where particular complexities arise, the preparation of the copy folio can take longer.  Senator Enright made a good point in this regard, which I will convey. The time taken to process applications will, of course, vary from county to county and is affected by matters such as the level of computerisation of the Land Registry records in relation to the county.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are certain counties where the building in which that particular section of the Land Registry is located will not support computerisation. In view of the impending computerisation programme planned for the Land Registry, the Minister is discussing this matter with the Minister for Finance, with a view to getting more suitable accommodation for the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave indicated that he is particularly interested in the issue of folios in County Cavan.  The section <Col N="1934" /> dealing with the Cavan region is, unfortunately, located in the building which will not support computerisation. However, in relation to the issue of filed plans, which is a copy folio and a copy map combined, I understand that where a copy map of the relevant parcel of land exists, a filed plan is issued within seven to 12 days.  Where a copy map does not exist, the preparation of the filed plan takes about five weeks.</P>
    <P>At this stage the Minister has asked me to point out that a considerable investment is being made in computerisation and information technology in the Land Registry.  In this regard the IT unit in the registry is currently working on the development of a title registration information system specifically for the Land Registry and it is hoped that considerable progress will be made in this regard during 1996.</P>
    <P>Vital development work is also being undertaken in relation to digital mapping, training, strategic management and the installation in the registries of modern financial and accounting systems. An IT manager was appointed in 1993 and a qualified accountant was appointed as financial controller in 1994.  When fully operational, all of the measures I have outlined will significantly improve the capability of the Land Registry to cope with its workload.</P>
    <P>While we are on the subject of the Land Registry's workload, I think that it is important for me to say that over each of the past four years annual output in the Land Registry has exceeded the annual intake of business, thus reducing the arrears level.  The Minister has also asked me to highlight the fact that there has been a significant increase in the volume of Land Registry business, which can be gauged from the fact that the Land Registry workload figures for 1994 show that new records were set in relation to both the intake and output of business.  The increase in the business of the Land Registry is, I have no doubt, directly attributable to the Government's sound management of the economy, <Col N="1935" /> which has led to the present buoyancy of the property market.</P>
    <P>While accepting that in the past there have been problems with the registry and that it has not been in a position to provide the speed of service which is required, I must point out that it sometimes unfairly gets the blame for delays when the fault actually lies elsewhere. Senator Cosgrave referred to this matter. Although the vast majority of applicants supply all the necessary information, for whatever reason some applications lodged with the registry are either incomplete or incorrect, which causes delays.</P>
    <P>Handling of the substantial volume of incorrect and/or incomplete applications gives rise to non-productive work and represents poor utilisation of the registry's scarce resources.  The Land Registry management, in co-operation with the Law Society, have made efforts to bring about improvements in the quality of work lodged.  However, the results to date have been somewhat disappointing. This is a matter which will have to be tackled and requires further action by solicitors and the Law Society. The registry is most anxious to assist solicitors in any way it can to improve matters.</P>
    <P>At this stage I know the Minister for Justice would want to pay tribute to the Registrar of Deeds and Titles and her staff, whom she considers to be first class.  To date, they have displayed an admirable devotion to duty.  I want to acknowledge their efforts and success over the past number of years in reducing delays in the registry.  She has also asked me to mention the Interim Board of the Registries, under the chairmanship of Mr. Joe Moran, which is currently involved in advising her Department on the preparation of the legislation required to support the transition of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds to semi-State status and on the establishment of the financial systems and controls to ensure that the registries will operate on a sound commercial footing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> I am confident that the registries have a bright and exciting future ahead of them and that they will continue to respond to their clients' needs and to provide enhanced service to the public and the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to again assure the House that it is the Minister's intention to ensure that the level of resources necessary for the improvement of the Land Registry service to the public is maintained.  I accept fully the contributions of Senators Cosgrave and Enright tonight and I will refer their remarks to the Minister for Justice and my colleagues in Government.  The Senators may be assured that we will do our utmost to ensure that the organisation operates efficiently and professionally.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Office of the Chief Herald.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister to respond to recent correspondence in the national media on proposed changes in the Office of the Chief Herald which suggests that this ancient office has been abolished as a result of a &ldquo;turf war&rdquo;, to use the American parlance, which seems to have broken out between that office and the National Library.  I refer specifically to a letter by Dr. Susan Hood of Portrush, County Antrim, to <i>The Irish Times</i> last week in which she referred to this development as &ldquo;both surprising and shocking&rdquo;.  She pointed out that the office has become the focus for people throughout the world trying to trace their Irish roots or have their coats of arms confirmed in Ireland.  Dr. Hood made the significant point that the Genealogical Office operates on behalf of citizens on both sides of the Border and thus transcends the political divisions created since Partition. The Minister in his well reasoned reply to Dr. Hood's letter indicated that he believes the Genealogical Office's interests are best served by placing the supervisory role, inclusive of the granting of coats of arms, clearly under the <Col N="1937" /> executive authority of the director of the National Library.</P>
      <P>The origins of the Genealogical Office date back to 1552, long before the establishment of the National Library, which was founded in 1877, based on collections acquired by the Government from the Royal Dublin Society, the beginnings of which are also predated by the Chief Herald's Office. In 1552, King Edward VI formally introduced heraldry to this country by establishing the Office of the Ulster King of Arms, generally known as the Office of Arms.  The first King of Arms and principal Herald of Ireland, Mr. Bartholomew Butler, was required by his terms of appointment to &ldquo;ratify existing coats of arms and assign new ones to meritorious individuals&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In 1943, the Office of Arms was transferred from British to Irish administration and was then located in the Bedford Tower in Dublin Castle.  It was renamed the Genealogical Office and was headed by a State official, the late and much respected Dr. Edward MacLysaght, whose contribution to reorganising the office cannot be overstated, as I am sure the Minister will agree.  It is interesting to note that the original title of Ulster King of Arms was probably used because when the Irish office of arms was established by King Edward VI in Dublin in 1552, Ulster was not yet subdued by England, which is a rather strange irony in the context of the current relationship between Britain and Ireland.  However, as Dr. Paisley might say, that was then and this is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interestingly, in 1922, when all branches of the Civil Service came under the control of the new Irish Government, the Office of Arms was for some reason an exception &mdash; the Minister might be able to enlighten me on that as he is a student of history &mdash; and it continued to function under British control.  On the death of Sir Neville Wilkinson, the last Ulster King of Arms, in 1940, no successor to the office was appointed by the Crown and the registrar, Mr. T.U. Sadlier, carried on in his <Col N="1938" /> capacity as Deputy.  The first director of the National Library, Dr. R.J. Hayes, put in a claim to the Government in 1943 that if and when the Office of Arms was transferred, it should be attached to the National Library under the Department of Education.  As no other Department of State showed any interest in the matter, the National Library was given jurisdiction almost by default.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that no appointment was made for three years.  In the current controversy, although I use the word advisedly, the Minister in his recent reply to Dr. Hood's letter stated that he has arranged as a priority for an appointment to fill the relevant vacancy in the Genealogical Office to facilitate the continuance of the important work being done now, as in the past, and that it is expected that this appointment will be made soon.  Perhaps he will be able to tell us when that appointment will be made because I draw his attention to what happened in the interregnum between the death of Sir Neville Wilkinson in 1940 and the taking over of the Genealogical Office by the Irish Government in 1943.</P>
    <P>With regard to Dr. MacLysaght's early days in the office following his appointment, suffice it to say that his reference in his diary to &ldquo;cleaning up messes&rdquo; is appropriate.  His worst experience was what confronted him in the Office of Arms in April 1943.  It seems that the registrar, Mr. Sadlier, seldom kept a copy of a letter, most of his official registers were months in arrears and he possessed only the most rudimentary ideas of account keeping.  Dr. MacLysaght also said that there were no letters in the in-tray because Mr. Sadlier did not keep them.  According to Dr. MacLysaght, he was also an unrepentant Unionist, having nothing but ascendancy contempt for the new Irish Government regime.  However, the good doctor said that he liked the man and had some sympathy with him.</P>
    <P>It seems that when Mr. Sadlier was offered the position in the Irish Civil Service during the changeover of the <Col N="1939" /> Administration in 1922 he refused and said he was not prepared to work under the Irish Government because of his predilection to Unionism.  As the Office of Arms was still under British administration, the only Civil Service position he could find in the Republic &mdash; one must be grateful he wanted to stay in this country rather than leaving &mdash; was in the Office of the Ulster Herald.</P>
    <P>He said the result of his refusal to work for the Irish Government was employment in a subordinate and badly paid post in the library of the Kings Inns.  He had reason to believe that when he lost his job in the Ulster office on the transfer of powers by the British Government to the Irish Government in 1943, he would be given a similar job in the College of Arms in London. However, his appointment was never made because the printers of <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> were familiar with his name and the then Garter King of Arms &mdash; the equivalent of the Irish Genealogical Herald &mdash; was particular in such matters. Mr. Sadlier ended his life in penury.</P>
    <P>On 1 April 1943 Dr. MacLysaght was appointed as the Irish Chief Herald under the jurisdiction of the National Library and immediately set to work on the vexed problem of the Irish chiefs.  I am not sure if you, a Chathaoirligh, sought to become an Irish chief, but at the time you and I would not have had any problem doing so.  It seems that anyone could choose to call himself the &ldquo;Mac This&rdquo; or the &ldquo;O That&rdquo;.  Such people, without much difficulty, could get themselves included in the list which appeared annually in <i>Thom's Directory, Whitaker's Almanac</i>, and elsewhere under the heading, &ldquo;Ancient Irish Chieftains&rdquo;.  The situation verged on the ridiculous when a Mr. Phelan became known as O'Phelan Prince of the Decies and half a dozen other people were quasi-officially designated by titles to which they had no right.  It was a fulltime job to sort them out and, according to Dr. MacLysaght, the sheep were eventually separated from the goats.  We <Col N="1940" /> can rest easy in the knowledge that anyone who has been designated a chieftain of Ireland since 1943 lays some credible claim to the title.</P>
    <P>Time does not allow me to relate other examples of the earlier difficulties faced by the new Chief Herald. However, I refer to Dr. MacLysaght's opinion of heraldry as it was practised during his time.  He said it was a bogus operation.  This does not apply to the official Office of Arms.  Scotland, for example, has legal sanctions to enforce its decisions.  Dr. MacLysaght was referring to what he called commercial heraldry where some unscrupulous firms &mdash; there are honourable exceptions as most firms are responsible &mdash; thought nothing of giving a customer, for whose name no arms was recorded, an illustration of one which sounded something like it. For example, if a Mr. Brain visited one of these unscrupulous people he might get a coat of arms for O'Brien and so on.</P>
    <P>Even when one of the required names is available, it is not pointed out that, apart from the sept arms &mdash; the original family arms &mdash; the arms only belong to the descendants of the person or the persons named in the grant or confirmation. The Cathaoirleach would need to prove a direct line from the family which originally got the Naughten coat of arms in 1552.  I am sure he would have no difficulty doing so, as I and the Minister would have no difficulty proving our lineage.</P>
    <P>This does not apply to the important work of the Genealogical Office.  I would be glad if the Minister could assure me that the unique character and functions of the office will be explicitly provided for in statute to preserve and safeguard in the long term the important facets of Irish life represented by it.  Earlier I referred to Scotland having legal sanctions to enforce its decisions, does the Minister intend to give the same legal effect to the Office of the Chief Herald and, if so, what are his proposals in that regard?  The purpose of this exercise was to put on record the importance of this office, its <Col N="1941" /> unique history, its context in our life and its tourism value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of the position of the Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer in the Genealogical Office, as I am aware that some concern has been expressed about my recent decisions relating to the office consequent to the recent retirement of the keeper in the National Library whose position is known as Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer.</P>
      <P>I assure the Senator that the Genealogical Office is not being abolished, nor is the work of the office being in any way diminished.  I accept, however, that the specifics of recent decisions taken are somewhat complicated in their detailed effect and that the opportunity afforded by this debate allows me to offer some explanation.</P>
      <P>Pending the filling of the relevant keeper vacancy, I have taken the decision to add to the Director of the National Library the formal title of Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer. The purpose and effect of this decision has been to place primary responsibility for supervising the work of the Genealogical Office on the Director of the National Library.  As I heard the story of the unfortunate Mr. Sadlier, I realised that the Senator had made a case for supervision.  While it is expected that an appointment to the relevant vacancy will shortly be made, I should say that the title is not envisaged to be given to the person filling the vacancy. I emphasise that this does not entail any diminution of the work of the office.  In the interim, I have provided for the continuance of the practice of issuing coats of arms, such arms to be prepared and executed by the official with particular expertise and who acts as deputy to the Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the decision requires giving some attention to the technical detail of what is involved.  The Genealogical Office was formally <Col N="1942" /> recognised in Irish statute by virtue of the Allocation of Administration (Genealogical Office) Order, 1943, which provided for responsibility for the business and the administration of the Genealogical Office to be allocated to the Minister of the day, a responsibility that currently falls within my remit.  A separate Government decision also in 1943 provided that the practice of granting of coats of arms should continue and be performed by the Chief Genealogical Officer or his deputy.  Since 1943, by virtue of the Allocation of Administration (Genealogical Office) Order, 1943, the Genealogical Office has existed as a distinct entity within the framework of the National Library, as well as being linked administratively to it.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the power to continue the practice of granting arms does not stem explicitly from the genealogical functions set out in the Allocation of Administration (Genealogical Office) Order, 1943, nor is any reference to prior legislative practice made in the Government decision.  The origins of the practice of granting arms in Ireland derives from a royal permission given in 1552 in which the King appointed for life a person with the title of the Ulster King of Arms.  This person was charged with the function of ratifying within the whole of Ireland existing coats of arms and assigning new ones through the issue of letters patent to meritorious individuals.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to note that the costs of running the Office of the Ulster King of Arms continued to be borne by the British Government after the advent of Independence in 1921 until 1943, at which time the senior person in the office transferred to a position in the United Kingdom College of Heralds. Thereafter, the records and manuscripts of the office came under the care of the State.</P>
    <P>In 1947, in order to lend more status to the work of granting of coats of arms and as an administrative measure, the appellation Chief Herald was added to the name of Genealogical Officer.  In the period since 1943 the administrative <Col N="1943" /> arrangements underpinning the overall structure have gradually proved detrimental to both the Genealogical Office and the National Library, with the former regularly feeling obliged to assert its independence and the latter its jurisdiction. It became manifestly clear that it was not in anyone's interests that there should be ongoing difficulties of this nature.</P>
    <P>As part of my consideration of forthcoming legislative proposals for the establishment of the National Museum and National Library as autonomous bodies, I considered that the functions of the Genealogical Office constitute a valuable cultural resource for the country and that the interests of the Genealogical Office would be best served now and in the future by placing the supervisory role under the executive authority of the National Library.  Accordingly, the Government recently decided that the functions and practices of the Genealogical Office should be explicitly provided for in statute within the framework being provided for the National Library.</P>
    <P>I believe that the decisions taken and in train will be seen as necessary to provide for the future prosperity of that office.  I note that even those critical of my decision agree that the lack of clarity in the past has not been helpful to the work of the Genealogical Office.  I also note the view expressed that the Genealogical Office might be better served by <Col N="1944" /> being established as an entirely separate entity.  While I do not accept the contention in that respect, I will be happy to listen to the arguments put forward and examine any points made on their merits, once the broader legislative proposals are published and as they are proceeding through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>On the specific point as to whether, for example, I intend to emulate the Scottish practice, I assure the Senator that whatever I do will be within the ethos of our sovereignty and position as a republic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister.  When the Genealogical Office and the Office of the Ulster King of Arms was formally recognised after the transfer of administration in 1943 its functions were transferred <i>in toto</i> with one notable exception &mdash; the right to continue the Order of St. Patrick.  Can the Minister give thought at some stage to reintroducing this old and much valued order in the context of distinctive orders to people of merit in Ireland, which would be in keeping with our republican ethos as much as anything else?</P>
