      <P>I have notice from Senator Kelleher that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide adequate resources for the Southern Health Board to ensure proper security at psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to examine the threshold levels of stamp duty on the transfer of property having regard to raising house prices.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mulcahy on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement in relation to the proposed physical education hall for St. Macdara's community college, Templeogue, given that the children attending this school have been deprived of proper physical education facilities and given that the promised funding for the design and planning phase of this hall, announced on 6 <Col N="698" /> April 1995, has not as yet been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to publish the review of services to people with physical and sensory disability which was commissioned over three years ago.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to change the eligibility criteria for payment of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance to non-regular dockers in Foynes Harbour, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Kelleher's and Senator Cosgrave's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before announcing the Order of Business, I am sure all Members join me in complimenting the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on their achievement yesterday evening.  No one claimed any solutions had been found but the peace process is back on track and there is now a framework in which problems can be tackled with a hope of solution.  All Members will wish them the best on a job well done last evening, which gives us hope again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> The Order of Business today is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1 is purely technical and will be taken without debate.  We will take Second Stage of item 2 and if it finishes early we will not commence item 3, the resumption of the Harbours Bill, until 6 p.m. so that Members will know when it starts.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow we will have the debate on the universities, which will be taken in Government time.  In order to ensure all who wish to speak are given an opportunity to do so and that time is divided as equitably as possible, I ask Members to give the Chief Whip notice of their intention so that we may make arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  We will let the Leader know how many speakers we will have for the debate on the universities so that everyone who wishes to contribute will have the opportunity.  What legislation does the Leader intend bringing to the House before the end of the session?  What motions will be taken in Private Members' time in the next few weeks?</P>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil and on the eve of President Clinton's visit, I welcome the move forward in the peace process following last night's Anglo-Irish summit.  I hope the international commission's preparatory talks will provide a basis for genuine progress and a way through existing difficulties and disagreements. We must bear in mind that when a firm date is set for all-party talks in February, we cannot rely on another visit by President Clinton to sort out the impasse.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my party I compliment the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and all the senior civil servants who were involved in the success of last night's summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to mark what has been a momentous week in Irish politics.  It is also important to state that this is a good week for politicians. The courage to a greater or lesser extent of all the party leaders on last week's referendum is to be commended.  In <Col N="700" /> terms of leadership, it is good for politicians that that should have been the case.  We have often been critical of ourselves for not being prepared to take a stand on specific issues.  I think the party leaders did very well over the last number of months.</P>
      <P>Continuing on a positive note, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste deserve our heartiest congratulations for moving the peace process forward.  Whether this was the result of the deadline imposed by President Clinton's visit is not relevant. Next spring we can find somebody else to create another deadline. All negotiations need a deadline anyway; it is one of the first requirements.</P>
      <P>From a personal point of view, I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on the work which they and their back up team have done.  Congratulations must be extended to the other party leaders who have been supportive all the way.</P>
      <P>It is important we get an opportunity over the next 24 hours to express our view on last night's developments.  I have been pushing for a discussion on the intergovernmental conference, and I am pleased this matter will be dealt with tomorrow afternoon, but I would be prepared to agree to have that replaced by a discussion on the peace process if that would facilitate matters.  There are many papers on the intergovernmental conference to be published over the next week and there would not be a lot lost by postponing that debate for a week.  It is crucial that we find the opportunity to offer our view at this stage.  This is a time when public opinion is crucial; it is a time when a topical debate on a matter of central interest could be important in moulding opinion. I ask the Leader to consider giving time for that over the next 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming the agreement which was reached last night between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the officials who have obviously worked so diligently over an <Col N="701" /> extended period to bring the situation to this point.  All we can say is that it is not the whole of the jigsaw but a part of it and it is an important step along the road.  It is my wish, and I am sure it is the wish of the House, that the parties in Northern Ireland will subscribe to this agreement and work with it in an effort to bring lasting peace to the island as a whole.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure I agree with Senator O'Toole about a debate on Northern Ireland.  I have been one of the people who joined him in seeking such a debate but on these occasions I always think of what the late Senator Wilson would have said.  On this occasion he probably would have said we need some time and space before we actually comment.  Perhaps the Leader might think about that.</P>
      <P>The other matter I wish to raise has to do with the currency.  We need a debate on the economy.  Today we were told that the punt has risen to 103.3 pence sterling.  That obviously imposes huge restraints on exporting industry and it is something we could usefully examine between now and Christmas.</P>
      <P>Will the Second Stage of the Harbours Bill, 1995, conclude this evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask this because the Leader did not give us a time at which we would adjourn.</P>
      <P>The House can safely assume that the entire Progressive Democrats Party will contribute to the universities debate tomorrow.  In the event that there are a number of people offering, I suggest the Leader extend that debate to lunchtime rather than have a sos at 1 o'clock; we might extend the debate to 1.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I join with the Leader and other Senators in congratulating the two Governments, particularly the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, on getting the twin track process moving last night.  It entailed a great deal of work, determination and commitment to the peace <Col N="702" /> process and those qualities must now be shown by the political parties in Northern Ireland and particularly the political leaders.  It is appropriate to evoke the spirit of Senator Gordon Wilson on this occasion because he always had a positive attitude to encouraging and developing every little step in relation to the peace process.  This is the attitude which will have to be taken by all the political leaders in Northern Ireland. The message should go out loud and clear that the two Governments are committed to working and keeping the momentum going and that determination will also have to be shown on all sides in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As spokesperson on Northern Ireland for my party, I would like to be associated with our leader in the Seanad and our leader in the Dáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in their tributes to both Governments on the agreement they reached last evening on the twin track approach.  Hopefully this will form the basis of a new framework for discussions which will enable all parties to engage in fruitful and positive dialogue and lay the foundation for a secure, permanent and just peace in Northern Ireland and throughout the island. There may be something in what Senator Dardis said.  Even though all our debates in the Seanad have been restrained and responsible, perhaps it is a time for reflection.  We will await the outcome.  I pay particular tribute to my good friend, Peter Temple-Morris, who is chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  At all times, he has had a positive and benign influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make an observation on the matter to which Senator O'Toole referred.  While the referendum has been held, it is not appropriate at this point to single out one element for courage. The Senator will recognise that those few of us who spoke against the referendum proposals found ourselves &mdash; I want to put this on the record &mdash; not only in a minority in the Oireachtas <Col N="703" /> but also as far as the media was concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the House and the other speakers in complimenting the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  The Irish people are relieved today that agreement has been reached between the British and Irish Governments. I would also like to put on record that I was proud of the fact that at 9.40 p.m. last night on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; Deputy De Rossa, the Minister for Social Welfare and Leader of Democratic Left, was the first to speak on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It was obvious from the manner in which he spoke and his knowledge of the situation that he had had a good input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> Will the Leader inquire as to the progress, or lack of progress, of the Waste Bill?  All over the country, and particularly in our area, we have great problems with waste management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in commending the efforts of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in getting the twin track process in operation.  It is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the debate on the universities to be held tomorrow.  All the university Senators have just come from a meeting with the Minister for Education who has shown herself to be very accessible.  The debate will really open up the argument, and for this reason I urge that the suggestion made by Senator Dardis be taken on board by the Leader of the House, that the time should be extended across lunchtime to allow everybody to participate.  It is appropriate that the Bill should be introduced in the House, first, because of the university representation and, second, because of the consultative nature of this Assembly.</P>
      <P>We are still at a fairly fluid stage in this debate and the matter may still be affected by the debate in the House, which is proper and democratic.  I will consider reserving my main artillery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I like making speeches. That is why we are here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the visit to the Oireachtas by President Clinton, the final part of item 1 on the Order Paper states: &ldquo;...the time of the joint sitting shall be 3 p.m.: provided that in the unlikely event of President Clinton being unable to attend, the Ceann Comhairle shall be empowered to postpone or cancel the joint sitting.&rdquo;  Does this conceal some special knowledge because I do not recall it being in the <Col N="705" /> wording, as framed, for previous visits. Is there something behind this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a company trawling the country presenting itself as an evaluation team and drawing up front money from others.  It is a complete con.  Major rate payers are asked to believe that they can withhold rates from local authorities.  This is a serious matter and must be tackled immediately by the Minister for Justice.  This company has succeeded in obtaining money up front from large companies, which are withholding the payment of rates to the local authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I purposely named the company because the Garda are investigating it at present, and I trust the Minister for Justice will take positive action with the assistance of the Leader of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for concluding last night's agreement.  Has the Leader had a response from the Minister for Health to the measures I called to his attention last week to resolve the nurses disputes in Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar hospitals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I welcome a group of parliamentarians from South Africa who have been in Ireland since Sunday.  They are <Col N="706" /> led by Senator Mushawana, and represent all African parties, including the ANC, of which Senator Mushawana is a member, the National Party, the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Freedom Front, the Pan African Congress, the African Christian Democracy Party and the Democratic Party.  I would especially like to welcome Mr. Micheál Ellis from the Democratic Party who is also an Irishman.  We wish them well and hope-they enjoy themselves in Ireland.  We are happy they are with us and extend our congratulations on the excellent work that has been done in South Africa.  Not so many years ago, they could not have visited us but they are most welcome now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the other Members in welcoming the initiative taken by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  I doubt that what has happened will mean the end is near but at least progress is being made.  I also join Senator Neville in welcoming the members of the South African Parliament. It is good to see that, in a short time, South Africa has emerged as a real democracy rather than becoming a fantasy democracy as is the case in other countries.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked about the money that was supposed to be provided for flooding.  Flooding has commenced again in various areas after last night's rain.  I am told there are problems with the Environmental Protection Agency and other bodies.  Could we have a statement from the Minister about exactly what is happening in order to allay the fears of people who are again falling victim to what happened last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that President Clinton is visiting Ireland.  Today is the United Nations day of solidarity with the people of Palestine.  We must not forget <Col N="707" /> Palestine.  The United States, the United Nations and other countries are involved in Bosnia at present.  We sincerely hope there will be an initiative on the North as a result of the Clinton visit. I ask the United Nations, President Clinton and other nations not to forget that they have made agreements with the Palestinian people.  There are also agreements in force between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  We must not leave these matters on the back burner.  On the United Nations day of solidarity with the Palestinian people, the Taoiseach should attempt to ensure that the initiatives that have been taken in that area are not forgotten and that he will ensure elections will take place on 20 January as has been agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>We are approaching Christmas and I sought a debate on agriculture some time ago.  With the reduction in export credit refunds and current sheep prices, it would be appropriate to have an indication from the Leader if there will be such a debate quite soon.</P>
      <P>There is devastation in west Limerick and Limerick city where Neodata has announced it is closing two factories, one in Newcastle West and the other in Kilmallock.  There has also been a layoff of staff at Krups in Limerick city.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment should be asked to come to the House to explain the closure of the factories in west Limerick.  The headquarters of Neodata is in Limerick city. Newcastle West is 20 miles from Limerick while Kilmallock is 16 miles, yet it was decided to close these two factories and leave the factory in Listowel open although it is 50 miles away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision is very strange.  Can the Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to come to the House today &mdash; that is how urgent the matter is &mdash; and explain why these two factories are being closed?</P>

      <P>I join other Members in offering best wishes to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the British Prime Minister, John Major, and everybody concerned in their work over the last few days and since the peace initiative 15 months ago. I concur with Senator Dardis's remarks on the serious situation that faces manufacturers and exporters due to the recent strength of the punt.  I told the Leader many months ago that, as an exporter, I could see major problems ahead and there will be serious difficulties. It is a serious matter for our export industry and we should debate it.  The punt seems to be heading towards £1.05 sterling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support it.</P>
      <P>I also want to ask the Leader about the Green Paper on broadcasting.  Various programmes will be broadcast about it on radio and television this week.  It has been discussed in many sections of the media and it is about time we discussed it as a matter of urgency.  Many worthwhile contributions could be made here.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator O'Kennedy's views on the divorce referendum.  I totally dissociate myself from the remarks Senator Norris made last week about his Holiness, the Pope.</P>

I had the experience and privilege, with other parliamentarians, of being there during the elections less than two years ago.

    <P>The Leader of the House will be aware that I have asked for a debate on health on numerous occasions this session but, to date, it has not come about. Many issues could be dealt with under this heading.  A White Paper on health <Col N="710" /> was published but we have not yet debated it.  However, our psychiatric service is working under a 50 year old legislative framework.  I call for a debate on health which is long overdue.  Many other matters come under the heading of health &mdash; the new health cover insurance companies, the crisis in nursing homes, the nursing profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Kiely's call for a debate on agriculture.  Up to 10,000 sheep farmers demonstrated outside the House yesterday.  There is a crisis in the sheep industry and the EU must respond to the call from the Government and farmers for an increase in the EU premium.  The change in EU structures for export credit could have a knock-on effect and result in a loss of £150 per head of cattle.  This is important.  We should have a debate on agriculture to address those matters.</P>

The debate on the Harbours Bill, 1995, will be taken until 8 p.m., although Second Stage may not be completed. Senator Wright asked about the legislation for the rest of the session.  I hope the Harbours Bill, 1995, the Powers of Attorney Bill, 1995, the Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995, a Seanad Bill from the Dáil and to which a few amendments need to be made, the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995, the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1995, and the Appropriation Bill will be completed by the <Col N="711" /> end of the session.

I assure Senator O'Toole that I will not postpone statements on the intergovernmental conference. However, if he wishes to postpone the debate on the universities, I might be prepared to listen more sympathetically. I will extend the debate on the universities tomorrow if a sufficient number of speakers offer.  I agree with Senator Sherlock on the contribution of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  Last evening's achievement was a team effort.  I will find out about the Waste Bill, 1995, but it will not be taken in this session.</P>

      <P>The Bill will provide the legislative backing to the securitisation scheme.  We will securitise certain <Col N="714" /> moneys due to local authorities from the repayment of mortgages financed originally from loans from the local loans fund.  Securitisation is common in the United States of America and some countries in Europe.  Essentially, in securitisation, a stream of future income is sold for an up front payment.  This is what the Bill involves.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware of the background to the problem which has arisen from the need to fund payments to meet our equal treatment obligations. However, I will briefly review the background. An EC directive on equality of treatment for men and women in social security was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 19 December 1978 with a deadline for implementation of the directive on 23 December 1984.</P>
      <P>Equality of treatment in accordance with the provisions of the directive was provided for in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which was enacted in July 1985.  The provisions of that Act were brought into force in two phases with effect from May and November 1986. Consequently, the provisions of the directive were not fully provided from December 1984, the implementation date for the directive, to November 1986.</P>
      <P>There were four areas of the social welfare code which were discriminatory within the terms of the directive during the period of delay: first married women received a lower personal rate of benefit than men and single women in the schemes of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefits; second, married women were entitled to unemployment benefit for a maximum duration of 12 months as against 15 months for claimants generally; third, they were precluded from qualifying for unemployment and, fourth, as a general rule, they did not qualify for increases in respect of adult or child dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1986 when the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, became operational many married men lost entitlement to an increase in respect of their spouse as an adult dependant and <Col N="715" /> in certain cases to half of the increases in respect of children.  The Government decided to introduce transitional payments to avoid any sudden reduction in family income for those concerned. These payments, which were paid to men but not to women, were subsequently found by the courts to have been discriminatory.  The payments were reduced from 1988 onwards on an annual basis and they were discontinued entirely in July 1992.</P>
    <P>Arising from the delay in implementing the necessary measures in accordance with the requirements of the directive, court proceedings were initiated by a number of married women in which they sought to have their entitlements in the period of delay determined on the basis of the rules applied to married men.  They also sought payment of the transitional payments to them on the same basis as applied to men.</P>
    <P>In the High Court on 3 February 1995 in what was, effectively, a test case, Miss Justice Carroll found that the married women were entitled to be paid on the basis of the rules applied to married men in the period of delay and that they were also entitled to transitional payments paid to men in similar circumstances. The judgement also provided for the payment of compensatory interest at a rate equivalent to the consumer price index on the arrears of benefit up to the date of payment.</P>
    <P>A commitment was given in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to pay the legally determined entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments. To fulfil this commitment the Government authorised the Minister for Social Welfare to implement the High Court decision.  An estimated 70,000 women involved are now receiving payments. The total cost of implementing the judgment is estimated at some £260 million of which up to £200 million will have been paid by the end of 1995.  The remaining £60 million will be paid in 1996 and 1997.  This is in addition to the approximately £40 million paid prior to <Col N="716" /> the court cases.  The total cost of the arrears, therefore, is close to £300 million.</P>
    <P>There was a need to make provision to meet these payments and in this year's budget £60 million was provided for the payment of these obligations. This, of course, was prior to the High Court decision.  In the budget speech it was indicated that if it was necessary to pay more than £60 million this year we would consider disposing of certain State assets so as not to adversely affect our budgetary targets.  It was in this context that the Minister for Finance asked for an examination of the means by which certain assets of the local loans fund could be realised as a cash payment to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency suggested that certain assets associated with local loans funds could be realised.  They suggested a sale of the proceeds of the mortgages to the private sector.  This proposal was useful in two respects.  First, it enabled the money to be raised without any effect on the budgetary position this year and, second, the proposal would encourage the financial markets in Ireland to look afresh at the idea of securitisation of mortgages.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious that the financial markets should develop in Ireland.  In addition, we hope to continue improvements in the markets so that any short-term fluctuations in the financial markets do not adversely affect business.  To this end the development of a new investment instrument in the form of fixed rate bonds to be issued in this scheme will provide an investment opportunity for investors.  In particular, it is important to develop opportunities to attract investment from Irish institutions and to offer a substitute for foreign investments.</P>
    <P>The local loans fund was established in 1935 under the control of the Minister for Finance and financed by the Exchequer to provide a system of capital funding for local authorities.  Since then it has provided loan capital to local authorities at fixed rates of interest for <Col N="717" /> various purposes, including on-lending to individual house purchasers who satisfied a means test.</P>
    <P>Since 1988 lending by the fund has been very limited.  Direct Exchequer grants have now replaced the local loans fund as a route for funds for local authority capital projects.  In the case of the housing loans, the Housing Finance Agency has since 1986 provided the local authorities with the requisite funds at variable rates of interest.  Total loans outstanding from the local loans fund to local authorities are of the order of £480 million.  These include loans for harbour developments and other areas.  Of these, about £440 million are Small Dwelling Acts loans.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline the scheme for the House.  The scheme was designed by the National Treasury Management Agency after consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment as well as various financial institutions and the local authorities.  Broadly, the proposed scheme is as follows.  A special purpose vehicle, or SPV, will be established in the private sector but managed by the NTMA.  This SPV will raise £140 million in the current year by a bond issue to investors and pay the proceeds to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, with the help of the National Treasury Management Agency, will agree a pool of mortgage repayments, the revenue from which will be assigned to the SPV.  The SPV will fund payments to the bond holders from this assigned revenue.  All payments by the local authorities to the SPV will be routed through the local loans funds which will act as agent for the SPV.  As a local authority makes payments through the local loans fund to the SPV, it will be deemed to have made a repayment of its local loan fund debt.  The local authorities will continue the existing practice of paying over the mortgage payments as they become due to them, even if not collected.</P>
    <P>In the very unlikely event of a local authority defaulting on its payments, the Minister would pay to the SPV the <Col N="718" /> amount due and pursue the local authority by way of the local loans fund's legal powers, which give it a charge on the local authorities' general revenue. In the event of early redemption of a mortgage in the pool, the sum can be passed to the SPV by the local authority and this would be invested by the SPV. Any surplus remaining in the SPV will be handed over the Exchequer on the winding up of the company.</P>
    <P>Essentially, as a result of this scheme the Exchequer will receive a lump sum up front in exchange for a stream of income that would have been payable to it from local authority sources over the coming years.  While the proposed scheme may appear complex, similar schemes are standard financial market practice for securities bonds and a special purpose vehicle is almost always a feature of such schemes.</P>
    <P>The structure of the scheme is necessary because the Government wishes to ensure that the underlying mortgage asset is not affected in any way by the proposed securitisation scheme and also that the local authorities are in no different a position under this scheme than they are at present.  I want to emphasise this point.  There will be absolutely no change in the existing relationship between the individual mortgagor and the local authority and there will be no adverse effect whatever on the finances of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The local authorities will have their local loans fund debt reduced to the extent of the payments made to the special purpose vehicle.  As each payment is made, it will be deemed to be a repayment off their local loans fund debt.  In the event of non-payment, the Minister for Finance will pay the shortfall and pursue the local authority under powers existing in the local loans fund's governing legislation.</P>
    <P>This is no different to the present position where the local loans fund can pursue a defaulting authority.  In any event the possibility of a default by a local authority is largely theoretical; no local authority has ever defaulted on its <Col N="719" /> debt to the fund and I do not anticipate that any ever will.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil a number of Deputies raised the issue of the impact the scheme might have on Government finances.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement will be unaffected as the £140 million to be raised under the scheme in 1995 represents the balance between an original £60 million provision for equal treatment on budget day and the £200 million being issued to the social insurance fund for this purpose. While the current budget deficit will be higher, the capital deficit will be correspondingly lower than anticipated, because issues to the social insurance fund are treated as current expenditures in the Estimates volume but the proceeds of the scheme are classified as an Exchequer capital inflow.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to nail the myth that this is the sale of a capital sum to fund current expenditure.  While the arrears payments are classified as current expenditure they are a once-off cost and not an on-going future liability. To that extent they are unlike the generality of current expenditure.</P>
    <P>In terms of qualifying for the third stage of economic and monetary union we must meet certain criteria.  These include the requirement that the annual general Government deficit should be held to 3 per cent or less of GDP.  The general Government deficit will be unaffected by this scheme.  Under the accounting conventions from which this deficit is derived &mdash; on a standardised basis &mdash; in each member state, loan and equity transactions are not counted as either receipts or expenditure.  These international conventions view such transactions as &ldquo;financial&rdquo; or balance sheet transactions.  It follows that the proceeds of the scheme will not appear on the revenue side of the general Government accounts.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the legislative framework within which the current securitisation scheme can take place.  It also allows future securitisation of local authority mortgages should this be <Col N="720" /> required.  We must make provision for all eventualities and not be too restrictive but this should be balanced by a need to keep tight control of the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill is a definition and interpretation section.  Section 2 specifies the purposes for which the Bill can be used.  The immediate proposal is for the financing of part of the social welfare equality arrears payments.  As I do not wish to restrict freedom of action in the future we have also included provision that the Bill can be used for other purposes but only with the approval of the Dáil.  As I said earlier, this will act as an assurance that the scheme will not be abused or lead to a weakening of the ongoing commitment to our budgetary targets.</P>
    <P>Section 3 refers to the existing power under section 14 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, whereby a local authority, at the direction of the Minister for the Environment, shall transfer, sell or assign mortgages.  This power is now defined as including assignment of the debt secured by a mortgage and it is provided that such an assignment shall be deemed to be an equitable assignment.  The special purpose vehicle will not have any right of enforcing the debt directly against the individual borrower.  There will be no circumstance in which the SPV can give notice to, pursue or otherwise deal with the individual mortgagor &mdash; that is out of the question.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives the Minister for Finance the power to designate the body which will, in return for a lump sum, receive the assigned payments and to arrange for its management.  The management of its designated body is a function which will be delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency under section 12.  Provision is also made to allow the Minister to own a company as the designated body.  This provision, while it will not be utilised for this securitisation, is included to ensure flexibility in the future should a Minister wish or need to establish a company for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The existing local loans fund legislation provides that the fund will have a lien on the general revenues of local authorities in respect of borrowings by the authorities from the fund.  Section 5 excludes the amounts assigned by local authorities to the SPV from the general revenues for the purpose of that lien. This provision ensures that these revenues are ring-fenced in favour of the SPV and that the Exchequer can have no call on them.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that any payments made by a local authority for the purposes of the Bill to a designated body will have the same effect as a payment directly to the local loans fund.  In this way there will be no change in the arrangement for making their biannual payments to the local loans fund.  The local authorities will make their payments as at present to the local loans fund.  It is only at that point that the allocation of payments due to the designated body will be made.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a guarantee by the Minister for Finance of the amounts assigned by a local authority to the designated body.  The reason for this provision is that the SPV is barred from recourse to the mortgagor.  In a straight commercial securitisation, this recourse is the ultimate security for the bond holder.  In the absence of this recourse in the present case, the Bill provides for a Government guarantee as the ultimate security for the bond.</P>
    <P>Other sections deal with related matters, such as the tax treatment of the designated body and securities issued by it; delegation of powers to the National Treasury Management Agency; management of the assets and liabilities of a delegated body and provision of information by local authorities and expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act.  The accounts of the designated body will, under section 16, be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that this innovative scheme is designed to raise the money needed for the equal treatment arrears payments, to help develop the Irish financial <Col N="722" /> markets and, at the same time, to ensure there will be no change in the position of the mortgagor of the local authority.  All Senators, I am sure, are conscious of the need to observe the budgetary parameters yet, at the same time, meet the once-off costs of the social welfare equality payment arrears. Without this scheme, there would be a need to meet the payments through extra borrowing or taxation; neither course is attractive or possible.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and it is a great pleasure to be here with him.  It is a pity that we are not discussing something other than this particular proposal, which I regard as an extraordinary, sleight of hand arrangement, where we have a backdoor through which we can boost borrowing.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the Minister said.  Of course, the Minister's defence of the concept of securitisation is valid.  There is nothing wrong with the concept of securitisation.  It is used, particularly in banking circles and large private corporations in the United States, as a way to release funds which are effectively tied up with the future flow of capital in order to create new possibilities for capital investments in the short term.</P>
      <P>Nobody can argue with the first seven pages of the Minister's speech.  The payment of the social welfare equality arrears represents a payment of a debt which the State owed.  The State owed that debt, incidentally, because it was imprudent when it first negotiated Ireland's entry into the European Communities. It took a rather extraordinarily cavalier view of Article 117 of the Treaty of Rome and, specifically, to the equality provisions of the that treaty. Senior public servants in the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs at that time were warned that there were some difficulties here but they took the advice of officials in Brussels which, at the end of a series of court judgments, proved worthless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> It is proper and appropriate that the State should meet all its debts, particularly in this case where these debts were owed to a large group of women in the State.  They should, of course, be paid in the shortest possible time.  None of that is in contention on this side of the House.  That is not at issue in the Bill.  The question which arises is the approach which is being adopted by the Government to meet its bills and debts, the impact this will have of effectively privatising local authority mortgages and the alternative uses of a system of securitisation if that were the route we chose to take.  The point I am making here is that I do not have an argument about the payment of the debt and I do not have a principled argument against the concept of securitisation.  Contrary to what the Minister said, I take the view that we are effectively borrowing to pay current debts.</P>
    <P>Securitisation, the device we are using and creating today, is being used as a sleight of hand device.  It is a sophisticated piece of creative accounting which is being employed to disguise the fact that the Government is borrowing funds to meet a deferred revenue or current account debt.  The Minister acknowledges that if the securitisation device could not be used in this particular case and the bills were all to be met this year &mdash; in fact, a portion of the bill was being made this year &mdash; it would have to be met from current revenue or from borrowing.  The Minister said, and I agree, that neither method is a particularly attractive prospect.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Houses of the Oireachtas empower the Government to sell off the mortgage book of the local loans.  There is nothing particularly startling about that.  In effect, this amounts to the Government cashing in its future flow of income.  It is borrowing today by selling tomorrow's income at a discounted price.</P>
    <P>Since 1987, successive Governments have enforced a firm degree of economic discipline on our public accounts. This has had a positive impact both <Col N="724" /> domestically and internationally.  What we are engaged in here is a piece of economic self-delusion which does not augur well for the future.  Borrowing, no matter how well it is dressed up by the spin doctors, is still borrowing.  In principle, borrowed money should not be used for anything other than capital purposes. Again, I accept what the Minister said that the debt which has been accumulated here is likely to be a once-off. Hopefully, that is so.  Nonetheless, it is still a debt on the current account and borrowing should never be used for current expenditure, or even for deferred current expenditure, which is what this amounts to.</P>
    <P>When this Government took office, the economy was performing positively and the national finances were universally accepted as being in good order. Firm public financial controls had been accepted as the order of the day by a series of Administrations since 1987. That economic discipline has now been set aside in effect by this Government and we can see in this provision another incremental step to setting aside that firm discipline.  It is clear, not only in this action but over a whole series of economic decisions, that this Administration is prepared to make a dangerous trade-off between short-term political advantage or expediency and the type of slipshod economic behaviour which caused this country so much hardship in the past and for which a whole series of Administrations of different political hues must bear some guilt.</P>
    <P>All the danger signs of a slip back into the bad old days are there for us to see if we wish to see them.  This year's OECD survey, for example, spoke of Ireland continuing to face high levels of public debt and of the need for tighter control of public expenditure.  It would be criminal if we failed to take heed of these warnings.</P>
    <P>There is a second reason for being critical of the Government's line.  It can be argued with some conviction that cashing in the local loans mortgage book is not wrong in itself.  I have said already that I have no principled argument <Col N="725" /> about the concept of securitisation. As the Minister said, securitisation can create a new device for use in the financial markets, one which is relatively under-utilised in Europe but which is quite well established in the United States.  The process is, as I said at the outset, fairly widely used in financial circles in the United States, particularly when they wish to raise capital for current capital purposes or for productive capital purposes.  If the Government decides to use the funds yielded from securitisation for a purpose, few could argue against it.  We all know, for example, that local authorities all over the country are stymied because of a lack of funds.  There is money for major projects, by-passes, motorways and major sewerage plants; there is even additional and welcome money for housing.  However, there is an abundance of smaller capital schemes at local authority level which could produce employment and would certainly have a beneficial impact.  If we were going to raise funds through securitisation I suggest a more prudent utilisation of those funds would be the capital purposes found on every local authority's books.</P>
    <P>A lack of capital funding means that many major and minor local authority works are permanently at a standstill. All over the country housing projects are awaiting funds in spite of the additional funding.  These would represent a particularly appropriate investment for capital realised from the securitisation of the local loans fund.  My own local authority area is starved of funds for a variety of public purposes, including small sewerage and water schemes. I remember from the Minister's by-election that there is also an abundance of such schemes in Cork.  If we are going to release funds through the securitisation device, this would be a more appropriate use.</P>
    <P>We all know the damage done to the Irish economy in the past by the invalid use of capital funds.  We know the impact borrowing has had on public expenditure.  Borrowing and the cost of servicing borrowing has hung like a <Col N="726" /> millstone around the neck of the Irish taxpayer.  The problem has been caused in the past and I regret that the Government seems to be turning a blind eye to the lessons of the recent past.  This is an imprudent use of funds.  If they are to be released, they should be released for capital purposes and not used to pay off debts which should have been met from current revenue.</P>
    <P>I would contest in particular some of the views put forward by the Minister. He argued that the Exchequer borrowing requirement will be unaffected as the £140 million to be raised under the scheme in 1995 represents the balance between an original £60 million provision for equal treatment on budget day and the £200 million being issued to the social insurance fund for this purpose. This is nonsense because all this statement does is simply describe the arithmetic of the transaction.  It does not obviate or avoid the suggestion that this is a means of borrowing under another name.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he would like to take the opportunity to nail the myth that this is the sale of a capital sum to fund current expenditure, but it is precisely that.  If we met our requirements under the Treaty of Rome from 1973 onwards, they would all have been met from current expenditure and not from quasi-capital funds.  There is another point in the Minister's contribution with which I have a problem.  He stated:</P>
    <P>While the current budget deficit will be higher, the capital deficit will be correspondingly lower than anticipated, because issues to the social insurance fund are treated as current expenditures in the Estimates volume but the proceeds of the scheme are classified as an Exchequer capital inflow.</P>
    <P>I am sure that is correct linguistically and I am certainly not challenging it. However, by whom are the proceeds classified?  They are actually classified by the Department of Finance and we all know that classifications of certain items in the Estimates and the national <Col N="727" /> income and expenditure tables have been subject to question over the years. This particular classification is being used at the behest of the political masters of the Department of Finance to produce this defence for this abuse of capital funds.</P>
    <P>I see what the Minister is doing.  If we are to start the process of securitisation and enact legislation it certainly would be arguable that one should allow the devices created in that Bill to have a continuing use.  However, we are being distracted in this matter by the use being made of the funds, a use with which none of us disagrees.  Nobody is arguing that we should not pay the social welfare debt.  However, the fact that we all politically endorse this use is being used to distract us from certain dangers and from a wider discussion of the process of securitisation.  The Minister said that section 4 of the Bill, while it would not be utilised for this securitisation, is included to ensure flexibility in the future should the Minister wish or need to establish a company for this purpose.  We seem not just to be committing ourselves to securitisation in the short term for this one off payment but effectively deciding that this device will have a use in the future.</P>
    <P>I am very unhappy with this arrangement. I agree with the principle that debts which have been incurred by successive Governments of all political hues must be paid as expeditiously as possible.  The original arrangements announced in the budgetary arithmetic had no major critics, either in the public domain or in the body politic.  We are, in effect, creating a new form of borrowing and engaging in accounting sleight of hand.  Because of the way we classify our accounts or the way the Department of Finance chooses to classify certain items, we can delude ourselves into thinking that this is not borrowing.  This is borrowing; these are capital funds and the Minister knows in his heart that they should be used for capital purposes and not to meet debts on current accounts. <Col N="728" /> It is not an appropriate use of this device.</P>
    <P>I have no argument with the principle of securitisation.  The principle advanced by the Minister can be defended but I certainly have a problem about the way we are using the money. It is a retrograde step given the kind of financial and fiscal accounting criteria and disciplines we have tried to apply to ourselves since 1987.  This is a step in the wrong direction and I hope we will not regret it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is before the House because of the Government's obligation to pay women the arrears owed to them arising from a High Court ruling on the EU directive on equality of treatment in social security payments. The sum of £260 million, which the State is now liable to pay married women by reason of our failure to obey the laws of the European Union, is an enormous amount which should never have accumulated.</P>
      <P>If the Department of Social Welfare had been properly administered and advised this huge bill would never have accumulated.  These arrears could have and should have been paid over many years as current spending.  We should have made provision for such payments in the Estimate of the Department of Social Welfare annually.  Given that we have no option but to pay this money the question which arises is whether it is right for a Government to liquidate capital or borrow against future revenue to defray accumulated current expenditure liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As pointed out by the Minister, four areas of the social welfare code were discriminatory within the terms of the directive during the period of delay. Married women received a lower personal rate of benefit than men and single women in the schemes of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pensions and occupational injuries benefit; they were entitled to unemployment benefit for a maximum duration of 12 months as against 15 months for claimants generally; they were precluded <Col N="729" /> from qualifying for unemployment assistance and, as a general rule, they did not qualify for increases in respect of adult or child dependants.</P>
    <P>There was a need to make provision to meet these payments and, in the budget, the Minister for Finance provided £60 million for the payment of these obligations prior to the High Court decision.  In his budget speech, the Minister indicated that if it were necessary to pay more than £60 million this year, he would consider disposing of certain assets so as not to adversely affect the budgetary targets.</P>
    <P>The existing loan fund legislation provides that the fund will have a lien on several revenues of local authorities in respect of borrowings by the authorities from the fund.  Section 5 excludes the amounts assigned by local authorities to the SPV for the general revenues for the purpose of that lien.  This provision ensures that these revenues are ring fenced in favour of the SPV and that the Exchequer can have no call on them. Does this mean that one local authority can, and will, pay more than other local authorities and when will the funding of this be finished?  More such questions can be asked on Committee Stage.  With regard to the payments the Minister put in place in the budget, the money is coming on stream to the people who reightly deserve it, which is one of the reasons there is not much interest in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I can only agree with the sale of State assets if their effect is to reduce the national debt or to provide for capital expenditure.  However, we must meet our obligation which was incurred as far back as the early 1980s.  As this is a once-off payment, the Minister has rightly provided for it.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche asked important questions as to the way this measure is funded.  This SPV could raise approximately £440 million.  Could this money be used to fund small sewerage schemes by local authorities as many sewerage and water schemes will not come under EU provisions for the period 1995 to 2000?  If so, this would be one way of <Col N="730" /> alleviating some of the local authorities' problems with regard to providing sewerage schemes over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>The county councils notified all people who had received SDA loans and set out the criteria involved in this procedure, which were established by the Minister for Finance.  I hope this will not adversely affect any members who have an SDA loan, whether they would be cashing in the loan or continuing it to full term.  Since I am not in the same privileged position as Deputy McCreevy as regards receiving a SDA loan, I do not have a vested interest in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The number of local authority loans that councils are handing out now, including my own local authority, is small in comparison with the numbers handed out in the 1980s.  Will this have any effect on the amount that the National Treasury Management Agency will raise under this measure?</P>
    <P>I will leave most of my questions for Committee Stage.  I am against selling State assets for day to day expenditure, unless it is for the purposes of capital expenditure to reduce the national debt. On this occasion I agree with the principle of what the Minister has done; this is a once-off payment to the women who should have received such payments throughout the 1980s.  There is an onus on us all as public representatives to provide the money for them.  I must, therefore, agree with the measure on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Roche and Senator Burke for their contributions.  Senator Roche made a number of points to which I must respond, even though the Minister may wish to respond to him on Committee Stage.  The Senator used the term &ldquo;sleight of hand&rdquo;.  If the Government was adopting a sleight of hand approach, the last thing it would do would be to bring a Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas as that would be the most obvious forum to expose anything of this kind.  This is a very open <Col N="731" /> and transparent operation.  It may be complex but I would not accept the comment that it was sleight of hand.</P>
      <P>This Government, or any Government confronted with a court order for the immediate payment of £200 million in a scenario which the Senator rightly describes as the careful financial management of the economy, has few options to adopt.  The Government and the Minister for Finance searched for an innovative way to deal with the problem, which would not impact in an adverse way on the national finances and it succeeds in the sense that it does have a level of innovation about it.</P>
      <P>The measure constitutes the sale of an asset; it is not borrowing.  It is true that, generally speaking, the proceeds of asset sales should best be used for capital projects or for the elimination or reduction of the national debt. However, confronted with the need to meet a payment of £200 million, only £60 million of which was provided for in the budget arithmetic, I believe this is a legitimate once off use of a scheme of this kind.  There are no plans to adopt a similar scheme in the future for this or for any purpose.  The legislation allows for securitisation in the future, but the Government has no plans to use securitisation for any purpose at present.  The suggestion by both Senators that such a scheme might be used for the purpose of funding capital projects for local authorities is worth examining and I have noted this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comments made by Senator Roche with regard to the management of the economy are wide of the mark.  It is correct to say that we inherited a well managed economy.  It is the view of the Minister for Finance and I that this careful and prudent management of the economy is continuing and will continue for the lifetime of the Government.  The best evidence for this will be when the Senator sees the published Estimates early next month.  All the discussions around these Estimates are predicated by the fact that the Government has set down very rigorous targets for current <Col N="732" /> expenditure and for borrowing, and we will maintain those targets.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the 1995 OECD report.  It is true that the report commented on the need to be vigilant regarding borrowing and so on, but the Senator must agree that it was a predominately favourable report on the Irish economy.  With regard to his other comments on the crying need for more capital expenditure and so on, the needs clearly exceed the capability of a prudently managed economy to pay for all of the things we would like to see.</P>
    <P>In 1996 we will be able to increase our 1995 capital programme by between 9 and 10 per cent while maintaining the Maastricht criteria.  We will borrow up to that level and invest the money as prudently as possible.  There is no suggestion that we are cutting back on capital expenditure; the reverse is the case.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche also referred to things being classified by the Department of Finance.  I must say they are rigorous taskmasters.  Any politician who has worked in the Department of Finance will know that they are the last people who would be involved in classifying things that would be seen by the markets as being sleight of hand.  In fact, they are constantly warning their political masters to be cautious and careful about that.  The markets have not reacted in an unfavourable way to this scheme; perhaps the reverse was the case.  The Senator's comments about Department of Finance officials classifying things to suit themselves is wide of the mark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister forgets that I was a Department of Finance official for almost as many years as I have been a politician, so I know what goes on there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had forgotten that. The Senator also mentioned that there were provisions in the Bill which allow Ministers to do things in the future. When drafting legislation of this kind <Col N="733" /> one wishes, on the one hand, to focus it specifically for the immediate purpose while, on the other, one does not wish to tie future Ministers into a straitjacket so that a perfectly good scheme could not be utilised in the future because it is so tightly drawn.  It is clear in the legislation, however, that the approval of the Dáil must be sought for an expansion of the scheme in the way described.  As of now the Government has no plans for further securitisation schemes although there is no reason one should not contemplate them in the future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the contribution made by Senator Burke, this scheme has no effect on current or future loans or the ability of local authorities to make loans.  It has no connection with that area.  My assurance that it has no effect on any mortgage or on the finances of local authorities is equally true.  Senator Burke also said he did not approve of selling State asset for any other purpose but reinvestment in capital projects. That would be the general approach of this Government as well.  However, the Senator generously conceded that this was a special case.  It certainly was.  The possibility that a Government would be confronted with a bill for £200 million out of the blue as a result of a High Court decision and which was not provided for would, I hope, never occur again.  The Government had to react in an innovative way and it has done so.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>After a lot of pressure over a long number of years, the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, established the Commercials Harbour Review Group in October 1990.  Its task was to identify those aspects of existing legislation which constrained a modern port.  The structures of harbour ports needed to be examined as to the extent of ministerial and departmental control on the day to day activity of ports.</P>
      <P>The review group included a broad representation of interests associated with ports &mdash; the Irish Ports Authority Association, IBEC, a transport economist, a port user, a local authorities representative, a SIPTU representative and representatives from the Department of the Marine.  The group presented its report and recommendations in July 1992.</P>
      <P>The key recommendation of the review group was that, to facilitate commercialisation, commercial State companies should be set up to manage certain ports.  The group also recommended that the commercial mandate on which the new port company would operate should give it flexibility to operate as a truly commercial enterprise.</P>
      <P>This Bill is based on the main recommendations of the review group.  It provides for the setting up of commercial State companies to manage and operate the ports of Arklow, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Foynes, Galway, New Ross, Shannon, Waterford and Wicklow. At present these ports are managed by harbour authorities in accordance with the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the setting up of a State commercial company to manage and operate Dún Laoghaire harbour, which is at present managed and operated by the Department of the Marine, the functions of the company so established <Col N="735" /> and the revision of the law relating to pilotage.  It is important that ports are viable and represent the regions in which they are situated.  Because of industrial relations and other problems in ports like Dublin, they have not operated as they should to our advantage and many firms export through Northern ports which are considerably cheaper.  The Minister should examine this because it does not make sense for exporters from Wexford to haul their produce through Dublin and Louth to Belfast but, unfortunately, this is happening at present.  The setting up of the new boards should see a change in this area.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to people about the ports in Northern Ireland.  They have claimed that there is a certain amount of subsidisation which, as far as competition is concerned, is in their favour.  It does not make sense to haul produce from Wexford to Larne.  What is the position in respect of the subsidisation of these ports which gives them an advantage over our ports?</P>
    <P>While I accept and commend the Bill to the House, I have difficulty barring MEPs &mdash; although they are never available &mdash; Senators and TDs from membership of the new port companies.  We are always biased against Senators and TDs.  By and large, Senators and TDs, particularly backbenchers, provide an important link between the ports and departmental officials because they are on the spot.</P>
    <P>We talk about accountability and transparency.  Who is more accountable than a TD, Senator or county council member?  TDs and Senator must go before the electorate every five years.  I have always said, even when I was a Minister of State, that the Department of Finance seems to interfere in this area, and I object to that.  Why should a Senator or TD not be a member of these boards?</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with light dues and harbour charges which affect ports in County Wexford and, to a lesser degree, in County Waterford.  Ships bound for <Col N="736" /> the port of New Ross must pass through part of Waterford harbour.  At present these ships are charged light dues at the same rate as vessels which proceed to Waterford, despite the fact that the New Ross ships use less than half the lights in the estuary.  Waterford Harbour Commissioners collect £45,000 per annum in light dues from New Ross bound ships.  This charge is excessive and does not relate to the cost of providing the lights; it is making New Ross uncompetitive.  There is no basis for these charges and I will seek an amendment to this section.</P>
    <P>The amendment made by the Minister for the Marine to section 13(8) on Committee Stage in the Dáil allows this inequitable situation to continue.  We accept that if a port provides facilities or services which are of benefit to ships going to another port, then the first port should be able to recover a fair proportion of the capital and operational costs of providing them.  However, these costs should be recovered from the other port company rather be levied on each ship.  This would result in an equitable and transparent situation between the two ports.  In my view, section 13(8) as it stands should be deleted and the following inserted:</P>
    <P>If, by reason of the situation of any harbour, it is necessary for a ship proceeding in such a harbour to enter or anchor within the harbour of another company, then, where a ship enters or anchors within the harbour of such a company for that purpose, and the purpose only of proceeding to the first mentioned harbour, the said company may not impose any harbour charges in respect of such entry or anchoring by that ship, provided that where the said company provides services or facilities which are utilised by such ships, it may recover a fair proportion of the capital and operational costs incurred in providing such services or facilities from the first port company.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider deleting section 13(8) and replacing it <Col N="737" /> with my amendment.  This would be a most fair and equitable system.  The Waterford Harbour Commissioners would probably argue the opposite. However, in fairness, New Ross is a small harbour and an annual payment of £45,000 to Waterford Harbour Commissioners is over and above the real cost of providing these services.  We know that and they know it too.</P>
    <P>Section 60 deals with pilotage.  We carefully examined this section and while we agree with some parts we disagree with others.  Pilotage is compulsory for in bound vessels in the Waterford Estuary.  In many cases ships proceed to Ballyhack-Passage East before a pilot embarks.  This practice is especially prevalent in poor weather which prevents pilots boarding at Dunmore East.  Pilotage outward from Ballyhack-Passage East is not compulsory for coastwise vessels.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the following points.</P>
    <P>Pilotage should be optional for vessels of less than 8,000 tonnes deadweight from Dunmore East to Ballyhack-Passage East.  Current practices indicate that compulsory pilotage in this area for ships of certain sizes is unnecessary.  The review group is prepared to put this argument forward. New Ross pilots should board at Ballyhack-Passage East and proceed through the Barrow Bridge to New Ross.</P>
    <P>This move would improve safety by giving New Ross pilots a chance to become familiar with the handling characteristics of the ship before the Barrow Bridge, which is the most dangerous and challenging area of navigation in the entire passage.  The current position is unsatisfactory as the New Ross pilot boards just as the ship approaches the bridge.  The pilots are boarding far too close to the bridge and it is more dangerous to do this than not to board at all.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this point.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage in the Lower House, the Minister of State recognised that pilotage in the Suir estuary should be examined and he announced the establishment <Col N="738" /> of a review group comprising representatives of both ports, an independent expert and an official from the Department.  I understand the review group is due to meet before the end of the month and it is envisaged that its report will be submitted in approximately three months.  The Minister has powers under sections 43, 70 and 80 of the Harbours Bill to implement the review group's findings without the need for any further legislation.  People in the Wexford area are concerned and we hope the review group will examine the argument between the Waterford and New Ross Harbour Commissioners. We hope a satisfactory outcome can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The links to Europe, including the southern Irish Sea corridor and the southern land bridge, have not been mentioned so far in the debate.  This aspect is most important in terms of exits from ports.  Improvements to the road network serving Rosslare, Ferryport, New Ross and Waterford on the Irish side and the ferryports of Fishguard and Pembroke Docks on the Welsh side have been an issue for many years.  Some improvements have been undertaken over the past few years but these have been more cosmetic than real.  People involved in transport have argued this point for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Such has been the concern that in July 1993 a conference was held in west Wales with the aim of establishing a standing conference to ensure the future development of the southern Irish Sea corridor links to Europe, which includes the southern land bridge concept. Throughout the conference there was great play on the need to urgently improve road communications serving the ferry port of Rosslare, New Ross, Waterford, Fishguard and Pembroke Dock.  There has never been parity with the expenditure made available for highway improvements serving the ferry ports in the North, particularly Larne.  I do not have the figures but I consulted people in Pembroke and they claim it is far above any amount invested on the Welsh side.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> This debate on the need to drastically improve the road network serving Rosslare, Fishguard and Pembroke Dock was carried on in a seminar workshop held in Wexford.  There was a consensus that improvements of significance were required to sustain the viability of the southern Irish Sea corridor and the emerging importance of the southern land bridge leading to the English south coast ports which have aligned themselves in support of development of the southern Irish Sea corridor.</P>
    <P>The Assembly of Welsh Counties with the support of the Association of Welsh District Councils has produced a Welsh transport strategy to be used to acquaint members of the EU with the strategy needed for Wales.  This report emphasised the need for improvements to the trans-European network linking the Welsh ferry ports with Ireland.  It contends also that it is equally important to develop a good network of internal roads, including Irish roads.  We have some extremely bad routes, such as the route from Enniscorthy to New Ross.  The route from New Ross to Waterford has been improved in the last four to five years but there are other routes that require a lot of improvement to reach the necessary standard.</P>
    <P>The southern Irish Sea corridor is a vital link in the communications chain joining Rosslare, New Ross and Waterford with the west Wales ferry ports, English south coast ports and the European mainland, providing a direct and efficient trade route between Ireland and the heart of Europe which is where we sell our produce.  It is contended that a high quality road system is essential to establish links between the peripheral south-east Irish and Welsh and west coast sub-regions and trans-European networks.</P>
    <P>In the west Wales context Dyfed County Council's transport policy programme has made the case to the Welsh Office over many years for major works to be undertaken on the A40 route to Pembroke Dock.  The policy programme <Col N="740" /> seeks to make the A40 west from St. Clears a dual carriageway and to have specific schemes implemented along the A477.  Providing a dual carriageway west from St. Clears has been consistently refused by the Welsh Office on the grounds that it is not merited having regard to the volume of traffic predictions. It is understood &mdash; I do not have the figures &mdash; that traffic movements tions.  It is understood &mdash; I do not have the figures &mdash; that traffic movements increased substantially this year and last year.</P>
    <P>As to quantifying traffic movements on the roads in west Wales, Dyfed County Council has recently retained consultants to investigate traffic movements between west Wales ferry ports and Rosslare.  The aim of the study is to stimulate cross-Border activity which will contribute to the cultural and economic development of the Border regions.  It is contended that selective improvements, such as the Whitland bypass, do not address the overall problem of an inadequate west Wales road network.</P>
    <P>To address the problem it is necessary for Irish south-east local authorities to join with the local authorities in west Wales to develop a unified road strategy and the study mentioned could be the basis for presenting such a strategy.  The findings of this study should be formally presented to the Irish and UK Governments, in particular to the Welsh Office. It should also be brought to the attention of EU Transport Commissioner, Mr. Neil Kinnock.  The transportation subcommittee of the west Wales task force discussed the transportation links with Mr. Kinnock who recognised the unfair allocation of resources to west Wales.  He recommended that continued pressure should be placed on the UK Government but cautioned that the sovereign states of Europe retain the right to approve or veto plans put forward by the European Parliament.  He said he would give all possible assistance in support of improving the transportation system through the west Wales area, which will also serve the Irish side.</P>
    <P>When one arrives at the port of Rosslare from Fishguard there is a 60 <Col N="741" /> mile stretch of very poor roads which we wish to have upgraded.  Will the Minister of State take a personal interest in this and give us some support? I was chairman of Wexford County Council and the two councils met on a couple of occasions.  We went to Wales to meet their council &mdash; which has been discontinued with three councils merging &mdash; and we are having a further meeting shortly.  It is very important for this to be taken into consideration in any future policy.</P>
    <P>In addition to seeking the support of the EU Transportation Commissioner, it seems appropriate to make use of the INTERREG II programme as the vehicle to develop cross-Border networks of co-operation between Wexford County Council, Dyfed County Council and, from April 1996, Pembrokeshire County Council. INTERREG II has a transport measure aimed at improving and overcoming the problems related to poor economic development through progressing improved transport communications. There should be a joint aim to ensure the provision of high quality road and rail access to the ports of Rosslare, New Ross, Waterford, the rest of the south-east coast, Fishguard and, in particular, Pembroke harbour.</P>
    <P>I have listened to all the debate and I feel it is very important to take into consideration the entrances and exits to the ports.  Airports are different as they are near cities but ports have very bad access roads.  We are the only island nation in Europe and it is vital to ensure, particularly in the south-east, that the road network is brought up to a reasonable standard as, unfortunately, Larne is taking the business from that area.</P>
    <P>I have every reason to believe that this is an exceptional deal for which we have waited for some time &mdash; with the exception of the two small points which I mentioned.  The Minister has set up a commission and I sincerely hope that satisfactory results can be arrived at in favour of New Ross port, otherwise it <Col N="742" /> will continue to face serious problems in the coming years.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this legislation is the restructuring of the framework of the port authorities.  The existing legislation has been in place since 1946 and is very outdated.  I welcome any changes necessary to modernise the ports.  The review group was set up in 1990 and identified problems which needed to be examined in order to modernise our ports and harbours to ensure future prosperity.  We are an isolated island dependent on the rest of Europe for our external trade and our ports must meet the highest international standards.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of good reading in the Minister's speech last week.  I also looked at the recommendations of the review body which contain great detail about who will be on the boards. The local representatives, councillors or otherwise, should be part of the board because they understand the area, the operation of the boards and the people and ethos from which the boards derive. It is important that we do not neglect local democracy.</P>
      <P>The object of the new companies is to operate, develop and promote investment and to take action on safety, harbour charges and the acquisition and disposal of land.  The Minister will be empowered to act if necessary.  This is to be welcomed because it will streamline our thinking and we will have a framework within which we will do business in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had no difficulty with the Bill until I read what would be done in each new port company which is to be set up.  I did not know much about Foynes Harbour but I like the area and became interested in it.  If I thought that harbour and its tradition were being neglected, I would be concerned and would suggest that the Minister should take note of this and smaller harbours.  The new Shannon port company will have jurisdiction over the Shannon Estuary; I hope the Minister can confirm there will be separate jurisdiction for Foynes Harbour <Col N="743" /> and that it will be under the control of its trustees.  If that is so it is to be welcomed because they are two different entities; Foynes Harbour is market driven while the Shannon port would be an administrative company which would not be tuned into the finer details of a country area.  I trust the two separate jurisdictions are copperfastened by the Bill.</P>
    <P>A mediator has been operating between Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees on the extension of the jurisdiction and limits to facilitate larger vessels coming to the harbour.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners expressed their concern that large vessels coming into the approach channels of Foynes Harbour would have difficulty navigating to other destinations as a result of the change of jurisdiction.  I ask the Minister to consult with both harbour bodies so that vessels will not have problems.  I have listened to each group; I understand their concerns and I wish to ensure they are accommodated accordingly. It is important that each has its say.  I welcome the independent jurisdiction of Foynes and the extension of the limits for large vessels, because this is where the deep water berths are.  It will create prosperity, economic development and employment for the town.</P>
    <P>I stress, again, that local representation is very important when dealing with local areas.  It reflects what is happening in the area.  There is nothing better than local democracy for finding out what is, and is not, good.  I ask the Minister to ensure we do not lose sight of local democracy.  I reiterate there is some confusion.  The Limerick Harbour Commissioners feel their business is being jeopardised.  This point can be worked out around the table.  There should be room for both sides to operate, each should recognise its role.</P>
    <P>I now wish to address the problems of pilotage and charges at New Ross harbour. I spoke to two deputations about this issue.  I know the area well because <Col N="744" /> I have travelled from Dunmore East to Cheekpoint, where the route separates &mdash; one route goes to New Ross and the other to Waterford.</P>
    <P>The charges problem arises from the fact that there is a common approach from Dunmore East to Cheekpoint. New Ross claims it is being charged too much.  Waterford Harbour Commissioners maintain that is where the quay lights are and they maintain that part of the estuary.  There seems to be a problem but I cannot understand why it cannot be sorted out.  There are harbour commissioners at New Ross and Waterford. The Waterford commissioners maintain these charges are fair while those at New Ross say they are excessive because they relate to charges from Dunmore East to Cheekpoint and from Cheekpoint to New Ross.  I ask the Minister to bring the two groups together, to sit them down and thrash out this problem.  It can be done.  I do not think the Minister or I should be dictating terms to people who know what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Pilotage is another problem.  The Minister said each pilot can have a certificate but there can be exemptions.  I do not understand this.  If a pilot can apply to be exempt so he can pilot a ship from Dunmore East to New Ross or from Dunmore East to Waterford, that is a new development in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to explain this.  All I am saying is that there is no better way to solve a problem than consultation between the Foynes group and Limerick Harbour and New Ross and Waterford. No decision should be made which would draw attention to any group.  We are looking for fair play.</P>

      <P>This is important legislation.  It will enable small and large ports to develop to their full potential in order to be of maximum economic benefit to the region they serve.  This is necessarily a detailed Bill; it contains over 100 sections.  Some of them are technical but this is necessary if we are to facilitate the safe and productive use of our ports.  I hope this legislation will <Col N="745" /> enable us to achieve this for the next number of decades and beyond.</P>
      <P>There are two guiding principles in the development of ports and harbours &mdash; economic benefit and marine safety &mdash; and they must go hand in hand.  The Minister is faced with a number of difficult areas and will probably need the wisdom of Solomon to deal with two particular cases where the interests of one port conflict directly with the interests of another.  Some of these were mentioned earlier and include combinations such as Dún Laoghaire and Dublin, Waterford and New Ross and Limerick and Foynes.  I wish the Minister luck in resolving these problems.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer specifically to the Shannon estuary.  Much time in the Dáil and Seanad debates has been spent discussing the effort to reach a decision on the operational arrangements between Foynes port and what will become Shannon Estuary Ports under the new legislation.  The Bill retains the current limits but it has been made clear that there is an intention to change those limits.  I have no problem with giving Foynes more scope and I acknowledge that extra room is required to develop the port.  However, we must balance the needs of both Foynes and the Limerick Harbour Commission's area, which is to become Shannon Estuary Ports.  The consideration in this specific area, as well as in the general area, must be maximum economic development while maintaining the paramount importance of safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the need for development at Foynes.  There are plans, particularly in the Mount Trenchard area, to extend berthing areas.  I do not know how immediate those plans are or whether they are in a financial position to carry out those developments.  There are problems relating to dockers as well as &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo;, which has been discussed in the media, and I assume those problems will be addressed.  I accept the need for Foynes port to extend and develop and I do not have a problem with that.  The mediator was appointed by the Minister in July to look at the <Col N="746" /> issue, to talk to both companies and to come up with some proposals.</P>
    <P>Looking at the need to develop Foynes to its maximum potential, it is important that we do not threaten the established economic activity in both Foynes and the area under the jurisdiction of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners. I dispute Senator Ormonde's perception that Limerick port is not market driven.  Limerick port has the second highest throughput after Dublin; Dublin has 7.88 million tonnes while Limerick has just over 7 million tonnes.  It is by no means a small or an unimportant port.  It includes Aughinish, Moneypoint, Tarbert and the oil coming into Shannon and Limerick docks; there are over 2,100 jobs directly dependent on these port operations.</P>
    <P>There are plans for development in Limerick.  A development which would presumably benefit both ports is the proposal to deepen the bar at the edge of the estuary which presents a problem for larger boats.  I understand it would cost about £4 million and it would enable both ports to develop even further and allow the large Cape size boats to come in on a 24 hour basis.</P>
    <P>My concern relates not so much to future developments as to what is happening at present.  I am particularly concerned about the large Panamax vessels coming into Aughinish on a 24 hour basis.  Senator Ormonde mentioned this. At present they have flexibility and full freedom of the channel.  However, there are often very bad weather and strong currents in this area and it is important that these concerns are taken into account and that these vessels would have the flexibility of a full channel in order to come to Aughinsh on a 24 hour basis.</P>
    <P>I am not a technical expert but concern has been expressed by pilots who operate in the estuary.  There is also concern about the question of anchorages in these areas where it is known that boats can drag their anchors.  Such concerns should also be taken into account; they have been expressed to the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> The Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, announced earlier his intention to respond to the report of the mediators, and he indicated the boundary lines to the west and the east.  These would allow for development in the Mount Trenchard area.  I have no problem with these boundary lines and accept them.  Will the Minister consider the concerns expressed regarding the northern boundary before Committee Stage?  He did not spell out these concerns in the House last week but they are genuine.  They do not involve any major changes; nevertheless, when drawing the exact boundary line he should take them into account.</P>
    <P>There are some economic issues to consider with regard to Limerick and to possible delays arising from the proposal to extend the Foynes boundary in this area, northwards rather than westwards. Will the Minister look at these concerns before Committee Stage and before we insert the exact definition of the boundary lines into the Bill?</P>
    <P>The mediation process was initiated in July and the first report was dated 12 October; it was described as an interim report.  The Minister said on Report Stage in the Dáil that the interim report needed to be tested and developed further and that there were issues relating to navigation, hydrographic issues and so on, which had to be taken into account.  A second report was submitted on 15 November.  Have these areas of concern, especially the technical areas, been looked at in the period between the first and second reports?  While it may have been understood from the beginning, when I heard about the setting up of the mediation process, I did not understand that there was to be an interim report followed by a final report.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, altering boundaries is going to be difficult.  There are interests on both sides and I wish the Minister well.  However, it is important, when enshrining this in legislation, that we get it right.  I want to have these issues addressed before Committee Stage to <Col N="748" /> ensure that, when the legislation is enacted, all the issues are fully addressed, the concerns expressed about the boundary line are taken into account and the technical expertise would be brought to bear on the details of the navigation channel.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will regulate our expanding maritime trade for decades to come and that it will be to the economic benefit of the country.  Taking this into account, it is essential that all the details of the Bill are as good as they can be.  I am happy with the overall thrust of the Bill; indeed the Bill does not cause me any problems apart from the fact that Foynes needs an extension. It is just the specifics of the northern boundary I am concerned about.</P>

      <P>The harbour authorities of Ireland have made a major contribution to Ireland's economy.  In terms of employment and economic development they have been a very strong instrument of economic growth and have made good progress in creating jobs and helping to generate prosperity in the regions in which they have some responsibility and impact.  In addition, they have generally helped tourism and business to flourish and develop.</P>
      <P>At a time of growing challenge and change it is now opportune to look at the legislative framework which governs the management and operation of the harbours and to modernise that legislation to deal with the challenges that face us in the future.  I wish to put on record my appreciation &mdash; I worked with them for some time &mdash; of the valuable contribution made by the members and personnel of harbour boards and authorities throughout the country and by the harbour masters, pilots and staff who have given dedicated and loyal service in dealing with these complex areas of administration.  In many respects their diligence and hard work have never been fully recognised and appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last 20 years three attempts have been made to modernise the ports legislation or some aspects of it.  Deputy <Col N="749" /> Peter Barry, when he was Minister in 1977, and Deputy Jim Mitchell in 1986 attempted to do so.  In 1989 I, as Minister for the Marine, introduced the Shannon Harbours Estuary Bill, 1988. The purpose of that Bill was to establish a development corporation to undertake the management and development of the Shannon Estuary.  These previous Bills, all of which lapsed with the calling of elections, differed in many aspects. The proposals were well intentioned and mine died the same death as the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable to say that the delay in dealing with harbours legislation has hampered the prospects of developing an important sector of the economy.  It has resulted in the stagnation of trade in many areas, delayed the prospects of developing Ireland as a strategic trans-shipment base and generally tied the hands of the progressive harbour authorities who were denied the legislative framework to enable them to follow a developmental role and carry out their work.</P>
      <P>We have failed to exploit many opportunities and advantages which our unique geographic location offers.  The result has been the loss of thousands of jobs and million of pounds in revenue while the legislators have delayed in taking the necessary action to streamline our laws.  Furthermore, opportunities for large scale European Union funding for major port investment were not fully availed of resulting in an absence of the infrastructural requirement which is so essential for prosperous and successful shipping and harbours related industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> Is it any wonder that people in the business are disillusioned and frustrated when they see that even the estimate for State harbours for 1995 was reduced by 15 per cent to £2.75 million while less than £750,000 was provided for grants for the improvement of commercial secondary and other harbours?  The real lack of interest by Government in Ireland's ports can be seen from the scant attention which has been given to ports in the Government document <i>Ireland's Community Support Framework 1994-99</i>.  I will not delay the House by quoting from it, but one of its paragraphs states that the main emphasis and investment will be in Cork and Dublin andthat other ports that have development plans will be evaluated. What it really says is that if there is any prospect of investment in these ports, it will have to be so fully evaluated that we will see further delays, frustrations and lack of action.  It will be subjected to a ministerial and departmental stranglehold organised and supervised by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Minister of State in his work in the Department and urge him to continue it.  I also strongly support this legislation.  It is vital we have modern sophisticated ports capable of handling the changing pattern of business activity, such as dramatic changes in cargo handling.  When 80 per cent of the volume of our total trade is handled through our ports, it is not good enough that such scant attention is paid to port development in these Government framework proposals.</P>
    <P>One of my main objectives is to give the port authorities some autonomy so that they will not be hamstrung by ministerial directions and controls.  If this new legislation reinforces the system under the Harbours Act, 1946, there will be a lack of development, investment and initiative and rather than advancing Irish ports, their development will be retarded which would be damaging.  I suggest a loosening up of the ministerial stranglehold over harbour and other authorities to enable them to meet the <Col N="752" /> requirements of customers and develop new opportunities and business in partnership with people in the trade.  The harbour authorities could not avail of these opportunities under the old legislation.</P>
    <P>The new harbours legislation will offer the opportunity of putting these authorities on a sound commercial footing. I strongly urge the private sector to explore the possibility of working in partnership with the harbour authorities so that the availability of substantial funding from the private sector can be utilised to open up and expand trade and develop more business.</P>
    <P>Public representatives or Members of the Oireachtas have been denied membership of the new boards.  That has been a feature of most of the Bills that have come to this House in the last while.  However, I am not sure it is wise not to give the chambers of commerce a role under this legislation.  While I do not have a mandate to speak on their behalf, many progressive chambers of commerce are modernising their procedures and becoming more active and involved in local activities and businesses should have a role in these new authorities.  While keeping in mind the local authority representation, it is important when appointing his nominees that the Minister keep in mind leading people in the chambers of commerce and the business community.  As part of these new development corporations we can have the benefit of their advice, help and money.  Some of them have substantial access to badly needed financial resources.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to expect that the harbourmasters, who have played a key role in the development and management of harbour activity, would be members of the boards of these new companies.  I appreciate the magnificent work done by our harbourmasters who have played an outstanding role in the development of our harbours, admittedly in many respects with their hands tied behind their backs due to lack of finances.  They have a part in the overall management and development of the <Col N="753" /> new companies and I hope there will be a place there for the harbourmasters to act in some capacity.  I intend to follow this matter up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are expert and skilled pilots on the lower Shannon, which is a tricky estuary.  The volume of traffic on the river has increased substantially, especially with the developments at Aughinish and Moneypoint.  In the years since I first became aware of the Shannon Estuary in my dealings with the Kilrush Harbour Commissioners, Kilrush Urban Council and the Shannon pilots, people of the highest calibre and skill have navigated that estuary in difficult circumstances and their safety record is second to none.  I cannot recall any major accident or misadventure on the River Shannon in the last 30 years. We owe a great debt of gratitude to those people who have, in their own dedicated and skilled way, navigated the often turbulent waters of the River Shannon and have made a large contribution to the overall development of the port.</P>
    <P>Even in the international arena, estuaries and harbours can get a good or a bad name for safety.  When I was Minister for the Marine, I visited many foreign harbours in my research on the ways in which we might modernise our legislation.  Many of the pilot associations I met abroad were loud in their praise of our navigation skills, the systems we put in place and the way in which we did our business.</P>
    <P>I thank the members of Kilrush Harbour Authority, which will be wound up under this legislation.  It managed Cappagh Pier and the area adjoining it.  It was not successful because it did not have either the power or the finances to undertake the work that needed to be done there.</P>
    <P>In spite of what was said about investment in the development of the Kilrush Creek marina adjacent to Kilrush, it has been one of the best projects in the west in the last 30 years.  It will more than adequately pay for the investment made in the long term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> The Minister of State will also be aware that the initial cost for the development of Howth marina was £2 million but it finished up costing £14 million.  We hear little about these matters if they happen in Dublin but if they occur in the west coast, we are lambasted in every newspaper.  This was a first class investment and development, which is why I welcome the legislation and the responsibility which has been given to the new harbour authorities.  In giving them these new responsibilities, one is not neglecting to give them a role in the development of marine leisure recreation facilities.  This is a welcome development because it was one of the major disadvantages in the old harbours legislation.</P>
    <P>The fastest growing recreation is marine leisure activity.  Anybody who is familiar with developments in that area will know about the considerable sponsorship and involvement in the marine leisure business throughout the world.  But we have been slow to exploit to the fullest the marine potential of the Shannon Estuary and Dún Laoghaire, which is close to the Minister's heart. Thankfully change has also taken place there.</P>
    <P>There is no need for conflict between the development of commercial traffic and business which is essential to maintain economic prosperity and development and marine leisure and recreational facilities which are equally important.  They can go hand in hand. There is no need for dispute between those involved in the recreational area and those concerned with important activity for the creation of jobs and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I will deal with technicalities on Committee Stage.  This Bill is a start and it makes up for some of the neglect in modernising our ports legislation over the past 20 or 30 years.  If passed, it will be a major start to a new era in port activity and development.  Harbours and ports will make a valuable contribution, far greater than at present, to the overall economic prosperity of this island. <Col N="755" /> Whether we look at this locally, nationally or internationally, Irish harbours have an important role to play in relation to future economic progress and development.  We should give any support we can in terms of streamlining legislation, strengthening it or providing additional powers to deal with what is necessary because it will be a long time before we will be back here to debate another Harbours Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary, although it is a little unfair to many harbours. I have been a member of the Port of Cork and a representative of that area for many years and I am mystified as to why we now want a major restructuring of harbour authorities.  However, I am not saying it is not needed from the point of view of an authority and a board.  The situation in some port authorities in terms of losses is frightening.</P>
      <P>Clarification of amendments passed in the other House were sent by the Minister's Department to the relevant port authorities.  It should be noted that amendments passed in the other House must be passed by both Houses.  I do not understand why they were sent to port authorities before this happened.  It is disturbing that these amendments were discussed in detail at the meeting of the Port of Cork last Monday week, although they have not been discussed in this House.  Many of the amendments passed in the other House commit the Government to ensuring &ldquo;buck stop&rdquo; guarantees to particular ports.</P>
      <P>In many respects, this Bill is before us to protect port authorities which do not have their houses in order, in particular Dublin Port which has suffered heavy losses because of work practices that need to be rationalised.  Other port authorities which put their houses in order by rationalising their ports and workforces &mdash; unfortunately, people lost their jobs as a result &mdash; must suffer the consequences of this Bill, particularly the Port of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Buck stop&rdquo; guarantees will protect port authorities which have made no <Col N="756" /> attempt to protect themselves or their workers from an apprentice's point of view.  The cost to the State will be enormous in terms of the money which must now be provided to ensure workers are protected.  Workers did not receive protection because of bad management and the boards of these authorities, particularly those in Waterford and Dublin, which will get money from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is easy for people to say these port authorities have been working well. However, that is not the case when compared to port costs and so on in other areas, for example, the Port of Cork which may reasonably ask if it did the right thing by putting its house in order and ensuring that its workers were properly protected.  I do not believe it did the right thing because it is not getting the recognition for doing so, while other ports are getting &ldquo;buck stop&rdquo; guarantees which is very unfair to those which have been working well.  Although the Port of Cork has been working well, I recognise it has received an enormous amount of money from State bodies over the years for upgrading the port. The Minister guaranteed money for the lower harbour in Cork.  Ports which are not working as well as the Port of Cork and other ports like Limerick should not be given this recognition.</P>
    <P>This Bill is before the House because Dublin Port is in such a mess, its losses are somewhere in the region of £22 million or more; I do not have the up-to-date figures.  Was it necessary to change, rationalise or restructure all ports because of the situation in Dublin Port? Centralisation in this respect is very worrying.  We should decentralise and not give guarantees to ports which do not have their houses in order.  We should recognise those ports which, unfortunately, have had to rationalise by reducing staff so that the board could operate properly, with which I do not agree &mdash; I want more people working.  I would like a guarantee that if we rationalise we will be given a commitment from central Government which is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> Other Senators discussed the problems at Foynes and Limerick.  We should not say that people should lose out because others can do a better job as that is not always the case.  The port of Kinsale or Courtmacsherry should not lose out to Cork, and I speak for these areas.  The authority responsible for the port of Kinsale has worked well and the facilities there are good.  In general, these areas should be protected. Kinsale is not just recognised for tourism but also its deep water facilities and safety.  It and ports such as Foynes and Dingle should not be undermined.  The hard work of committees over the years to upgrade ports should not be undermined because more money is being spent on bigger ports which may not be working well.  I am concerned about this aspect.</P>
    <P>While ports on the east coast are closest to mainland Europe is too much money being spent on these facilities in comparison to other areas?  Are the ports being upgraded the best choice? In the early 1980s, B&amp;I and other ferry companies pulled out of Cork.  Local people and the port authority had to get their act together to ensure ferry services continued from Cork.  In many ways, the dedicated people on committees are hitting their heads off a stone wall when one considers the amount of money which can be provided for bigger ports which may not be working as well as others, such as Cork.  I can only make comparisons with Cork port because I know it best.</P>
    <P>Rosslare Harbour is working to its full potential.  Ireland has gained many advantages from Rosslare which it would not otherwise have achieved. However, it is claimed that ports on the west coast, in the north and the southwest, including, for example, Dingle, are also capable of doing a good job.  The Bill concerns money and the restructuring of harbour authorities.  In this regard, there is an emphasis on the new authorities.  We are aware of the commitment of members of port authorities</P>
    <P>As a member of a large authority I am aware of the personal benefits some <Col N="758" /> people gain through their membership of the body.  I resent this very much. Some consider that these people have a divine right to be members of such authorities because, for example, they are stevedores or are directly involved in the workings of the port through ferries or shipping.  These people do exceptionally well as a result of their membership of the port authority.  The Government has taken a strong line against cosy cartels and golden circles through which some people may make personal gains. Other Members mentioned this aspect which should be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Members of the new authorities must be careful.  I have been a members of a board for a long time and I received no personal gain.  However, I am aware that cohesions have been formed by certain people.  The Minister of State is conscious of this point and I am aware of his thinking on this matter.  As an authority member, a Cork harbour commissioner and a public representative I am worried about these cohesions.  New authorities will be established but public representatives will not receive any real recognition.</P>
    <P>One public representative will join the new authority for Cork port and this is not good enough.  I do not mean, just because I am a Member of the Oireachtas, that I should be appointed to the board.  However, we should not allow the ports to become commercialised. It cannot be said that Cork port is not commercialised but the danger is that by having commercial authorities, certain people are in a position to gain. It is not easy for me to make this point because I must go back to Cork and listen to people repeating statements I made in the House.</P>
    <P>Public representatives are the first to say they should not be members of certain bodies.  If I am a member of an authority, whether it is a health board, the board of a voluntary hospital, a vocational education committee or the Cork port authority, I represent the public.  Public representatives, irrespective of party, are the best people for <Col N="759" /> such positions because they will be straight.  However, there is the view that the number of public representatives on boards should be reduced.  I resent that suggestion, particularly when I am aware of what is happening on an authority of which I am a member.  Some groups will continue to make personal gain through their membership.  This occurred over the years and has not helped Dublin port.  We must recognise this.</P>
    <P>Who made money in Dublin port when it was profitable?  Who created the problems in the Dublin port authority? Was it the worker directors or were the workers aggravated by others?  In all honesty, it cannot be said that throughout the 1980s and up to the early 1990s the workers were out to aggravate the situation.  They could not have been because they needed work.  The Minister of State knows this is the case.  Did certain people on boards adopt a particular strategy or did others, who were informed by members of the board, decide to adopt a particular line to ensure they gained the most?  I have information on this in my head and that is probably the best place for it.</P>
    <P>We should examine the cost and division of shipping to ports.  I mention the position in Cork as I know it best.  In comparison to other areas, the cost there can be either higher or lower. What are the costs in each area?  A port must receive a certain amount of money per tonne and ship docking fees.  The heavier the ship and load the better for the port because this is how a better infrastructure can be built up.  This has been done over the years.  The Ringaskiddy area in Cork is now bringing in very heavy tonnage and we want to ensure our costs are reasonable to encourage ships to continue to dock there.  There was a great deal of rationalisation with the result that fewer people are working.  Approximately 60 per cent of the workforce of seven years ago is now employed.  I do not like this because I want people working.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> However, I must consider who gained from these measures.  The port gained because the costs were low, but those who lost most were the people who wore the overalls, the workers who no longer have their jobs.  Others working in the port did not lose.  They are doing exceptionally well compared to other ports.  When will this issue be resolved? Will the new authorities deal with such matters?  The best people to ensure that will happen are elected representatives. They will watch the issues much closer than others.  I am in a position to query costs and ask who gained from certain measures.  The Minister of State is aware that for too long certain groups made all the money in certain ports. This is what happened in Dublin and the result is that approximately £9 million must be provided because no money was earmarked by the authority to ensure the workers received their pensions when they retired.</P>
    <P>The job of a docker is not easy and never has been.  It is dangerous, although not as dangerous as it was 50 years ago.  There is modern machinery for lifting and container work.  However, pensions for retired workers at these ports must be funded by the Central Fund because money was not provided by the port authorities.  The work now done in these ports has to be funded from Central Funds because pension funds have not been provided for.  Other authorities which provided for pensions are suffering because of this, including Cork.  I would like to know why.  What benefits are the ports which have put their houses in order gaining from the new set-up?</P>
    <P>There is all-party agreement on this Bill but we should not allow the Bill to pass without question.  Boards which have put a lot into the ports over the years are to be undermined.  It would not be fair to them to say we should take authority or jurisdiction from them because another port upstream deserves it more.  Under no circumstances should Waterford dictate to New Ross or Limerick to Foynes.  If ports are working well we should leave them to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> We are in a situation where we are prepared to make sure the ports rationalise, work to the future and become more commercialised.  We talk about the proper commercialisation of CIÉ, Telecom Éireann and the ESB and it should also apply to the harbours. However, we must also make sure that a certain few do not benefit from the infrastructure built up over the years in the ports.  That is happening at present and may happen more with increasing commercialisation.</P>
    <P>There is a danger I should like a socialist or somebody who does not want to look to the future.  However, that is not so.  I have already been involved in rationalisation; I had many fights with managers and trade union officials to ensure Cork port stayed open.  I will continue to work for Cork port and the people there.  This Bill is not strong enough.  Are we selling some of the family silver?  Some may ask what we would lose with the harbours and their authorities but the danger is that one may give all the benefits to particular groups without a watchdog.</P>
    <P>The new authorities will have on average one member from a public body.  In Cork, for example, one member of the new authority for Cork port will be from Cork Corporation.  That is not good enough.  I have seen many examples of avenues which authorities may use to ensure Departments are not involved in their business.  A good example of this happened in the recent past with a particular authority which wished to sell a site in Cork.  There was no public representative involved who might have opposed the sale or insisted on transparency.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can confirm whether I am right or wrong.  I cannot be all wrong because I have been on the Cork Harbour Authority for too long. The direction we are taking with this Bill is not better for us as people.  We must always ensure those on the boards are accountable.  We did not do so in the past and it led, for example, to the recent case in CIÉ.  The board in CIÉ decided to eliminate a certain committee <Col N="762" /> and sell off a certain site without accountability.  I have seen port authorities transfer sites from one authority to another without considering whether they might go for open sale and get a better price.  I have seen that happen as a managerial function in the authority with which I am involved.</P>
    <P>My local authority could not build a public toilet without getting sanction for the funds from the Minister for the Environment, yet some of these boards have the right to pass a site from one authority to another, as happened in the Cork port authority.  I do not say what it did was right or wrong, but I question the way it was done.  Will these circumstances arise again with this Bill?  Does the Bill provide enough protection to ensure that the fine harbours taxpayers have built up through the years are run with accountability?  I do not want an authority to have the power to transfer sites without accountability to public representatives, members of Government or the people.</P>
    <P>The Bill puts a strong emphasis on details.  However, on a more profound level the main reason the Bill is before the House is that many port authorities did not put their houses in order through the years and are now looking for money to protect their workforces. In many ways I welcome that but it should have been done in the past when others who made money out the ports did not re-invest in the infrastructure of the ports.  They took the money and put it elsewhere.  The stevedores in particular gained greatly from the people of Ireland and that must not continue.</P>
    <P>I may not get many changes to the Bill but we will have a strong discussion on Committee Stage.  When people are appointed to the new board structures we must ensure they have no commercial or personal interest in any authority. If not there will be backbiting and personal gain.  I refer again to what happened in Cork in the last few months.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in many respects because it tightens up many aspects, particularly what happens in Dublin, Waterford and elsewhere.  It gives a <Col N="763" /> guarantee to people that their pensions will be covered.  Those pensions should have been covered in the past.  Others were not just covering their own pensions but lining their own pockets.  That is a sad reflection on us as public representatives. We are facing a situation again where a public representative will not have the authority to question except at Oireachtas level.</P>
    <P>We must take a serious look at who should be on these boards.  I do not wish to fly the flag for any public representative, myself included.  I admit I can say many stupid things but I can envisage a situation, particularly on port authorities, where people may make great personal gains.  What happened in Dublin, Waterford and elsewhere that money was not put in funds to cover the workforce?  Over the last ten years, an average of £15 million in profits was made by the Port of Cork because of good management and rationalisation. Half that was put into a scheme over the last ten years to ensure that the workforce was protected.  What benefits are we getting from it now?  Other people did not put their house in order.</P>
    <P>Could the £7.5 million contributed by Cork port over the last ten years have been invested elsewhere?  Could we have improved our harbour structure or bought another ship?  Could our deep water berth be better?  Could we have better berthing for liners to come into Cobh?  Of course we could.  However, instead we made sure that, as part of the rationalisation programmes, workers got proper wages and bonuses.  People in other areas did not get any benefit but certain people did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  I will be very brief as I am not an expert or an authority on this subject.  I welcome the general thrust of the Bill &mdash; at least, I did before Senator Cregan spoke.  Now, I am confused but I have confidence in the Minister and I sure he will take cognisance of what he deems to be valid in the points made by Senator Cregan.  There is nothing sacred <Col N="764" /> left in politics at this stage as Senator Cregan has become a socialist and I have become a reactionary &mdash; there are no points of the compass on which one can rely for guidance.</P>
      <P>As a matter of courtesy, rather than leaving it to Committee Stage, I will indicate now that I was very impressed by the vigour, energy and enterprise of the representations made by New Ross and Foynes harbours to every Senator. I am aware that there are alternative ways of looking at matters, some of which we heard from Senator O'Sullivan in the cases of Foynes and Limerick harbours and from Senator Ormonde in the cases of New Ross and Waterford harbours.  I was so impressed by the strength of the representations made that I am strongly disposed to vote for amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I hope that this is not an adversarial issue in terms of party politics.  I also hope the Minister deems that a good case has been made and he will take it on board and table Government amendments so that it will not become a dog fight across the floor of this very civilised Chamber.  It was for that purpose that I wished to indicate my intention at this stage.  I would greatly appreciate if the Minister arbitrated to some extent on the conflicting points raised by the parties to these disputes to give those of us disposed to go one way an opportunity to review the situation before we cast our votes.  However, as matters stand, I have been impressed by the vigour of the representations.  I am almost cross eyed and, with apologies to those in the Visitors' Gallery from New Ross, I could almost pilot a boat under that bridge on the Barrow myself at this stage.</P>
      <P>It is, in general, a very welcome Bill which could be improved by amendments. I hope that the Minister will see his way to proposing amendments which, in light of the discussion in this House, he feels are worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to make a few comments on this Bill.  I take my brief from <Col N="765" /> the various interested parties which have made submissions, which indicate beyond any doubt the great significance of this legislation.</P>
      <P>New commercial State companies formed to manage port operations will attract investment in harbour development, as well as enabling ports to reach their full commercial potential, which I am not sure is happening at present.  Of course, there are always problems and Senator Cregan is very familiar with the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  I am rather surprised at their statement at their board meeting on 16 October when they voiced their unanimous disapproval of a number of key provisions of the proposed new harbours legislation. They were particularly critical of the apparent abandonment of the Government's declared objective of granting greater commercial freedom to ports.</P>
      <P>I think that this is what this Bill is doing.  They went on to say that the Harbours Bill confirms that &ldquo;far from permitting ports to operate more commercially, there will be much greater centralised control over their activities&rdquo;. The existing harbours legislation dates from 1946 and it is time for a review. This Bill, which has 105 sections, covers that very nicely.</P>
      <P>The statement by the Port of Cork mentioned employees' pensions which is covered in sections 40 and 41, so I do not know what the issue is there.  I was very concerned by the point made by Senator Cregan.  Section 32 deals very specifically with the disclosure of interests by directors who will be required to disclose any personal interest in any contract or agreement to which the company is party.  Does that not adequately cover the point?  There is no reason it would not be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is possibly the most significant legislation affecting port management since the foundation of the State and, inevitably, attracted controversy.  I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the concerns expressed by Cork pilots regarding the vulnerability of Cork Harbour <Col N="766" /> following its designation as a chemical industries harbour.  This designation will significantly increase the amount of dangerous cargo handled by the port.</P>
    <P>I received a submission from the pilots 12 months ago which stated:</P>
    <P>The pilots of Cork Harbour are a professional highly skilled body, self employed and operating as licensees of the Port of Cork.  While the pilot's duty is to the master of the vessel that is employing him at the time, he also has responsibilities regarding the Port of Cork and the environment therein.</P>
    <P>Cork Harbour has been designated specifically as a chemical industries harbour, thereby increasing significantly the amount of dangerous cargoes which would normally be carried. Inside the harbour is situated the only oil refinery in Ireland, contributing heavily to the amount of dangerous cargo continuously traversing Cork Harbour and on the River Lee as far as Cork city.  Pilots are an important part of any port structure. However, in the case of Cork Harbour their importance cannot be overemphasised and the continuing presence of pilots on vessels carrying dangerous cargo is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>The Murphy report on commercial harbours and pilotage policy [which is dealt with in section 59 of the Bill] and legislation recommends that pilot exemption certificates should not be granted to masters of vessels which carry dangerous cargo.  [Having listened to the submissions, I think that this will be taken on board by the Minister].</P>
    <P>It has been made clear to us by the Port of Cork management that they intend to grant pilot exemption certificates to masters of container vessels under the new legislation.  As these vessels normally carry dangerous cargo the granting of such PECs would be in direct contradiction to the recommendations of the Murphy report.  The same stands good for oil <Col N="767" /> tankers, LPG vessels, ammonia tankers and various product tankers carrying an assortment of dangerous cargoes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to emphasise that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde ably discussed the dispute between Waterford and New Ross.  We received much representation about that and I am sure the Minister will take the matter on board.  We received material on many other matters also.  With reference to the pilots' submission, in the aftermath of the potential disaster at Ringaskiddy we are aware of the dangers posed to the environment and public safety by handling hazardous chemicals.  I urge the Minister not to grant pilotage exemption certificates to masters or mates of ships carrying dangerous cargoes.  As I said at the outset, while I welcome the establishment of the commercial State companies to handle port operations, I am sure the Minister shares this concern. One will never go too far wrong if one has regard to the research and recommendations previously carried out.  In this regard I place great store by the Murphy report on commercial harbours and pilotage policy.  I am glad of the opportunity to contribute on this Bill, which will have a great effect on the development of our harbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation. I come from Killybegs and anyone who comes from a sea port will realise the Bill's significance.  In general I support the Minister's approach.  The Bill has highlighted various disputes, to which I shall refer.  A number of Members referred to the exclusion of Senators and county councillors from some of the companies which shall be established.  There is a case for public representatives being on the boards. The current trend is for people to be unnecessarily shifted from boards and that should reversed.  My experience of vocational education committees, semi-State bodies and similar organisations <Col N="768" /> is that public representatives fulfil their role well in what is often a thankless task.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister state if the companies which are to be set up will have any responsibility to discharge in developing fishing?  This is an important source of income for the country and but it is a totally underdeveloped and underfunded industry.  There are problems concerning tonnage and quotas but there may be scope in this Bill to do something on the matter.</P>
      <P>The legislation has brought other disputes to light, such as that between the ports of New Ross and Waterford.  A review body has been established to examine the problem, which is the proper approach to take.  I am sure the Minister will take its conclusions on board.</P>
      <P>The problems in Foynes have also been highlighted.  Some points were considered by the mediator, Mr. Patrick J. Murphy, who examined the request by Foynes Harbour for an extension of its limits.  The mediator's report was issued on 15 November 1995 and was accepted by the Minister when introducing the Bill to the House.  The limits recommended were not those originally sought by Foynes.</P>
      <P>When the limits are put before the House on Committee Stage, one hopes everyone will be reassured on the questions of safety.  This matter was raised before the mediator by the licensed pilots but his report stated he was satisfied the new limits for Foynes Harbour would not pose any safety risks for incoming or outgoing ships navigating the estuarial channel for destinations other than Foynes.  However, as the Minister said the Bill will not only extend the limits of Foynes but will enshrine the limits of Limerick Harbour for the first time ever.  This clear definition of jurisdiction in the Shannon Estuary will in itself contribute to the safety of operations.  For the first time control and responsibility in the river will be clearly defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point about safety of operations in this part of the estuary is that <Col N="769" /> a ship navigating there, whether within the limits of Foynes or Limerick, will be under the pilotage of a qualified person appointed for the pilotage district.  In addition, it will be subject to directions by the appropriate harbourmaster.  At meetings of boards of these companies it should be not merely desirable but mandatory for the harbourmaster to attend.</P>
    <P>The harbour limits recommended by the mediator and accepted by the Minister separate ships manoeuvring to use Foynes Harbour from those on passage through the estuary.  It has long been recognised by the UN International Maritime Organisation that the best way to avoid collisions between ships is to keep them on separate routes rather than to rely on tactical rules for avoiding each other.  This is how it is done in St. George's Channel, the Irish Sea and channels all over the world.  Apart, therefore, from the need to keep ships for Foynes Harbour separate from those passing through the estuary is the need to keep those passing well clear of any berths which may be developed in Foynes in time to come.</P>
    <P>Everyone would like to have more water and the mediator was appointed by the Minister to achieve a compromise. A number of specific points arise and I will put them to the House so it can be reassured that the limits to be fixed by the Minister, on the recommendation of the mediator, provide the best solution to the problem of sharing the available water in the greatest safety.  It should be recognised that the mediator was concerned with safety of operation, not just in the context of the present state of development of the harbours and the estuary but of the future expansion which it is hoped will take place in Foynes and possibly Limerick under the new régime to be implemented by the Bill.  The study of the potential of the Shannon Estuary, published by An Foras Forbatha in 1983, identified the area now to be brought within the limits of Foynes Harbour as having high development value <Col N="770" /> as a deep water facility for Foynes and the natural capacity and the landscape to absorb offshore wharfage.</P>
    <P>Three other issues were raised by the licensed pilots and these are important matters which must be addressed one way or another.  The first concerns large vessels in the channel, the second is the proposed anchorage and the third is the entrance channel into Foynes.  On the issue of large vessels, perhaps bound for Aughinish Alumina, it must be recognised that equally large vessels would be bound for Foynes Harbour and somehow they must share the waterway together.  The waters within the limits of Foynes must be available for use by vessels bound for Aughinish, should they wish or need to use them, just as the waters of the rest of the estuary will be available to ships bound for Foynes. However, at this part of the estuary the deepest and safest waters are to be found at the north side of the channel, away from Foynes Harbour.  Rinealon Point on the Clare shore is lit and presents no danger to ships passing close by.</P>
    <P>The currents around there are predictable because they are away from the confluence of Foynes island channel with the main channel where they meet. It needs to be recognised that this is one of the safest stretches of the estuary.  It is eight cables wide at this point &mdash; that is approximately one statute mile in width.  It has no shoals at this point except for ships entering Foynes.  It is well sheltered from the sea and is rarely fogged, which is one of reasons it was used as a transatlantic base for the Sunderland flying boats long ago.  That was long before they heard of Shannon Airport, which was developed afterwards. If you examined the meteorological records or recent years for the Shannon Estuary, they would confirm that this is an area which is usually clear of fog.</P>
    <P>The limits recommended by the mediator and accepted by the Minister leave a clear five cables &mdash; that is about half a nautical mile &mdash; to the north for ships to pass without crossing the new limits for Foynes.  Only 2.8 cables of the <Col N="771" /> available width is given to Foynes for the likes of harbour works and moorings and for ships manoeuvring to use these facilities.  Clearly such ships will have the use of the Limerick water just as those bound for Limerick will be free to use the Foynes water.</P>
    <P>A fairer division might have been for the mediator to have fixed the limits in the middle of the water thereby allocating four cables width to ships on passage through the estuary and four cables to Foynes harbour, and I think this has been sought by Foynes.  It seems fairly logical and perhaps it might be done yet.  I think someone suggested that all the water should come under the jurisdiction of Limerick.  I do not think that would be fair and I will give my reasons later.</P>
    <P>I suppose the mediator had to give due weight to the professional opinion of the licensed pilots.  In the light of that opinion, the mediator has reached a compromise and has left some two-thirds of the available width of the estuary at this point outside the limits of Foynes Harbour.  I suppose one cannot but reflect that the pilots on whose representations this was done are the same pilots who bring ships through Tarbert Race.  Tarbert Race is a dangerous place and that is where ships encounter a meandering and narrow navigable channel with dangerous shoals and rocks and strong cross-currents.  The representations of the licensed pilots are aimed at obtaining large margins of safety for passing vessels near Foynes but this is done, I am afraid, at the expense of the margins of safety for vessels using Foynes.  I would not like to suggest or imply that the licensed pilots are doing more than voicing concerns.  They have to raise these concerns because that is their job but I wonder &mdash; and I am only wondering &mdash; whether their conclusions are based more on their own convenience than on looking at the overall picture.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think anyone can take seriously the suggestion that the fixing of the limits, as recommended by the mediator and as accepted by the <Col N="772" /> Minister, could result in the scaling down of operations at Aughinish Alumina Limited and lead to a reduction in the number of ships there.  If this were the case, Panamax ships would never be able to enter Cork, they would not be able to enter many of the harbours of the world and, in fact, the would not even be able to enter the Panama Canal.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point I wanted to address; that is the proposed anchorage.  The advice of the licensed pilots in relation to anchorages within the new limits of Foynes is of great interest because the anchor holding ground around Foynes is not good but the area is well sheltered and both harbour boards are agreed that the anchorages here can be enhanced with permanent moorings, which would make them safe.  Foynes's proposal for establishing a mooring buoy here was recently tested by Limerick Harbour Commissioners with absolute success so both agree on that.  The use of such safe moorings &mdash; and these types of moorings which have been used in harbours throughout the world without any difficulty &mdash; will result in considerable cost savings for vessels waiting to load or discharge cargoes which, it must be borne in mind, will contribute to the overall safety in the estuary by reducing the river's Scattery Island traffic.</P>
    <P>I would like to address the Foynes entrance channel itself before I conclude. A review group on commercial harbours and pilotage policy and legislation published its findings in 1992.  It recommended the legislation now before the House and that harbour limits should be redefined to include the navigational channels into each harbour. That is an important point.</P>
    <P>To put the record straight in relation to the Foynes submission to the mediator, I would like to quote from their submission to Mr. Patrick Murphy. It states that at present when ship of the size of over 5,000 deadweight tonnes commence the approach of the narrow channel, they are irrevocably committed to entering the harbour yet at this stage of the approach they are approximately <Col N="773" /> over one mile from the existing limits of the harbour.  The entrance buoys themselves are in excess of half a mile outside the existing limits and when an approaching ship is a mile from the existing limits, she has only half a mile to run to the entrance buoys.  Since the channel is already narrowing, she can no longer turn back without carrying out emergency manoeuvres.</P>
    <P>The licensed pilots make two specific points in relation to the Foynes entrance channel.  First they say Panamax vessels drawing up to 12.5 meters have been successfully swung up to the entrance of Foynes at a distance of one mile from the existing limits.  Surely this is a case for saying that such vessels do not need the huge margins of sea room sought for them rather than that the approach limits to Foynes should not be extended beyond the entrance buoys, where margins of safety are measured in feet rather cables or parts of a mile.  Second, in the pilots' professional opinion, large vessels assisted by tugs are not committed fully to the entrance until they are less than two cables from the entrance buoys.  It is difficult to see why pilots continue to raise this point as the new limits to be fixed on the mediator's recommendation are just two cables from the entrance buoys.  I think the pilots' opinion influenced the mediator to cut back the limits to two cables at this point.  However, it is unfortunate that the professional opinion is based on the assumption that tugs will always be available to assist.  Clearly one reason a vessel would need to be turned back is if one of her tugs suffered engine failure or had parted a towline and was no longer able to assist the vessel.</P>
    <P>The limits which the mediator has recommended and which are accepted by the Minister are somewhat less than those which Foynes would like to deal with in these operations and in developing the estuary at Foynes to its full potential.  The limits to be fixed might not give enough to Foynes and more to the rest of the channel.</P>
    <P>Historically that estuary is shared by all who live there and it can be shared <Col N="774" /> now and into the future.  Foynes is just a small town, and that is why I speak so strongly about it.  There were a number of dynamic people there who got together and built up the port so that it is now a major port.  Nobody asked them to do it, nobody paid them to do it; it was mostly done by people who were concerned and interested that their part of Ireland should contribute to the overall economic development of the country. They are to be commended for that.</P>
    <P>If the other end of the channel is not working to capacity, there is an opportunity for everybody in Limerick to develop their port without interfering with Foynes.  There is a huge estuary; it is about 150 miles in length.  I do not know the exact distance because it is a long time since I sailed there, but Foynes is only a small part of it.  Surely that is not a lot to give people who developed the business themselves.</P>
    <P>I am confident I speak for most people here when I say we will be able to reach some sort of solution which will be fair and equitable for everybody sharing these waters.  This is an important issue.  Senator Cregan said that the people who put in the effort down the years must be rewarded.  He may not have been referring exactly to what I have said, but the point remains the same.  If you put in the effort and work hard, I see no reason that a person should not be rewarded at the end of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of Government funding to the Southern Health Board for security in psychiatric <Col N="775" /> hospitals for a simple reason.  I come from an area in Glanmire which has one of the largest psychiatric units in the Southern Health Board area.  The people of Glanmire and the residents in the vicinity of the hospital are very concerned, not just for themselves but for the safety of the patients in the psychiatric unit.  It is apparent that there is no security available either for the residents in the vicinity of the hospital or the patients themselves.</P>
      <P>I will cite some extreme examples.  A few weeks ago a patient left St. Stephen's Hospital at 5 p.m. and proceeded down a very dark road to a local hostelry where he consumed some alcohol. On the way back the patient decided that he could no longer journey towards the hospital in Glanmire and decided to sleep in a car parked outside a house near the hospital.  The occupant of the house range St. Stephen's Hospital and could find nobody to whom he could speak about the patient.  This patient had been committed to St. Stephen's Hospital yet nobody was able to come and collect him.  It eventually fell to the resident concerned to take the person in the car back to the hospital.</P>
      <P>St. Stephen's Hospital is held in high regard by the local community.  It was a general hospital from 1976 until recently, and prior to that it was a sanatorium for people suffering from TB.  The situation has now come to a head.  If St. Stephen's Hospital is to function as a psychiatric unit where patients are allowed to move freely between the hospital and the local village or the city, some form of security and scrutiny must be put in place.  Being psychiatric patients, these people are not as responsible as the Southern Health Board would like to think.  They are inclined to wander and create difficulty for people travelling on buses to and from Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not only speaking for Glanmire because the overall situation in the Southern Health Board area is that there is no security and no monitoring of patients in psychiatric units.  We all agree that patients should be allowed <Col N="776" /> freedom.  Integration in the community is of vital importance and is recommended by members of the medical profession. However, we must be realistic. Psychiatric patients who are committed to a hospital for treatment at least deserve the respect of some form of security and scrutiny whereby the health authorities know their whereabouts.  At present there is no such system in the Southern Health Board area, particularly in St. Stephen's in Glanmire where patients wander around at all hours of the night and in dangerous terrain.</P>
    <P>There have been some tragedies in St. Stephen's Hospital.  The gardaí and local people in Glanmire have spent nights searching for patients who did not return to the hospital.  The area includes a wood and a river.  I have spent a few hours at night searching my own land for patients and, at this stage, it has gone beyond the realms of reality.</P>
    <P>There was a recent welcome proposal &mdash; I welcome any form of advancement regarding child care &mdash; to establish a unit at St. Stephen's Hospital for children who have been abandoned or children detained by the Southern Health Board under the Child Care Act. However, there was no form of consultation with the local residents in the Glanmire area.  I mentioned to members of the Southern Health Board and the staff that the people of Glanmire have been very supportive of this hospital and its activities over the years. However, when a proposal was put to the Southern Health Board the residents in the area were not consulted. This new child care unit will house up to eight children with behavioural problems and there is still no security in the psychiatric unit.  Something will have to be done.  Either the hospital will close or the residents will have to revolt, for their own safety and that of the patients which is the primary concern.</P>
    <P>In 1991 some patients went missing and for many weeks we could not ascertain whether they just left the premises or had been collected by relatives.  In the end they were found dead.  The <Col N="777" /> authorities could not confirm or deny what had happened to the patients until local people found their remains in a river.  I fully support the integration of psychiatric patients and allowing them freedom to do as they please but there must be some form of monitoring.  I am confident that what is happening in St. Stephen's Hospital, which is one of the largest psychiatric units in the Southern Health Board area, is also happening throughout Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <P>I make a plea to the Minister that some form of funding be provided. Everybody is supportive of the psychiatric services that the Southern Health Board is trying to provide, but I ask the Minister and his officials to ensure some funding is provided as the security and monitoring of patients is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>The bus service from the city to the local Glanmire village passes the St. Stephen's Psychiatric Hospital.  However, there have been many cases of psychiatric patients, due to their condition, intimidating and frightening students and young people travelling on the bus to school or their place of work. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There are genuine fears in the community which I would explain and elaborate on if I had time.  I appeal to the Minister to make some funding available immediately to the Southern Health Board, to permit it to provide safety and security for psychiatric patients, and the residents in the vicinity of St. Stephen's Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of aspects with regard to the provision of security in psychiatric hospitals.  First, there is the need to protect vulnerable patients who are resident in psychiatric hospitals from breaches in security from outside. Second, there is the need to provide secure facilities for that small proportion of patients who present with challenging behaviour.  Finally, there may be concern about threats by psychiatric patients to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> I am informed by the Southern Health Board that it has no specific difficulties with regard to security in psychiatric hospitals in its region.  The board is satisfied with the level of security it provides to its psychiatric patients. It informs me that the only building for which it has had to provide special security in case break-ins occurred was the Grey Building in Our Lady's Hospital, Cork city, which had become derelict and which, the Senator will be aware, was recently sold by the board.</P>
    <P>At national level, a working group is currently examining the care of patients with disturbed behaviour with a view to drawing up a national policy on the care of such patients and to recommend the kind of secure accommodation appropriate to their needs.  The working group is expected to present a report to the Minister for Health in the middle of next year.  This development should be seen in the context of an evolving mental health service which has moved in a short period from acting as a catch all for much of society's ills to a service which can answer the mental health needs of individual patients.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board is satisfied with the services currently available to its patients who present with challenging behaviour.  Following a clinical assessment of individual patient need, appropriate intensive facilities are available to this small number of patients in hospitals in Cork city and Killarney, County Kerry.  The board intends to open a secure unit in the grounds of St. Stephen's Hospital, Cork, for children who would be detained there on foot of court orders.</P>
    <P>The Senator will be aware that in 1995, the High Court ordered the Southern Health Board to detain a young girl who was out of control and whose needs could not be met within the existing range of child care services.  The board pleaded that it did not have a suitable facility to provide the care required in a secure setting.  The court allowed the board time to put in place an appropriate facility to provide for the girl's needs and ordered her to be placed in Oberstown <Col N="779" /> Reformatory, operated by the Department of Education, pending the development of the service by the board.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board established a project team to develop a special intensive care unit for out of control children.  The team examined a number of sites and selected a location for the unit at St. Stephen's Hospital, Cork.  The 1995 Child Care Action Plan for the board included approval of the necessary resources to develop the facility.  Work on the refurbishment of the unit is proceeding and phases I and II of the development will be completed before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The special care unit will operate independently of the psychiatric service provided in St. Stephen's Hospital, with security commensurate with both the needs of the community and the children placed there.  If there are any specific problems with regard to security at specific facilities, and the Senator has outlined difficulties in respect of St. Stephen's Hospital, I would invite him to bring them to the attention of the Southern Health Board who will follow up the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, which was centred on the new child care facility.  This is not the problem. I am concerned with security for the present psychiatric patients located at St. Stephen's, Cork.  I will raise the matter with the Southern Health Board, but I also wish to appeal to the Minister to ensure funding that is so urgently required is provided to ensure that psychiatric patients are safe in their surroundings.</P>

      <P>There is no specific problem in the Southern Health Board area, but if the Senator makes his concerns known to the board, raising the cases he mentioned, it may or may not come back to my Department with a proposal. I ask the Senator to make the local health board aware of the difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The matter I raise is very pertinent, given the arbitrary and excessively high tax on the transfer of houses.  However, given also the Exchequer situation, I am sure the Minister will not be able to give me a positive response.  I am advocating that the thresholds should be looked at, especially when one reaches the highest rate on a house that is valued at only £60,000.</P>
      <P>As a practitioner I know that a house valued at £60,000, especially in the Dublin area and even in the Minister's home city, will not buy a huge mansion nowadays. There should be a review of the various thresholds.  At present there is a nil threshold in respect of houses valued up to £5,000.  From £5,000 to £10,000 the threshold is 1 per cent, from £10,000 to £15,000 it is 2 per cent, from £15,000 to £25,000 it is 3 per cent, from £25,000 to £50,000 it is 4 per cent, from £50,000 to £60,000 it is 5 per cent and from over £60,000 there is a flat rate of 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>The reality is, therefore, that, very quickly, one is on the top rate.  In Dublin, one bedroom apartments and small two bedroom town houses are attaching this top rate, and very small properties are probably attaching high rates.  All one gets for this tax is the honour and glory of having one's deeds stamped.</P>
      <P>There must be a realistic review of the thresholds.  One should not reach the highest rate until the value of one's house reaches a realistic figure &mdash; possibly between £90,000 and £100,000.  In addition, houses valued under £20,000 to £25,000 should be exempt, or have a 1 per cent rate applied.  In this day and age, there is not much one will buy for under £25,000.  For example, if one buys a disused cottage, the chances are that it will not have basic facilities such as sewerage, water or even electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue needs to be looked at, including the consanguinity relief, where duty is charged at half the normal rate where the ownership of property is <Col N="781" /> between members of families. Obviously this must be examined particularly in light of the referendum as there will be certain exemptions where matters will be decided by the courts in relation to separations and so forth.</P>
    <P>At present there is an unfair advantage for those buying new houses.  First time buyers receive grants and are exempt from stamp duty if the floor space of the new house is under a certain limit.  However, many people are considering buying second hand houses. They should also be given encouragement if they wish to generate business in the market.  After all, they take out mortgages over 20 or 25 years, pay auctioneers and solicitors fees and so forth and then must pay this flat rate of stamp duty.  It is high time the thresholds were looked at.  The top rate should be increased to a realistic level and the 4 per cent and 5 per cent rates should be staggered to a greater extent because all too quickly one arrives at the top rate. In this modern day a person is not purchasing a mansion if he is buying a £50,000 to £60,000 house.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister might only give me limited support this evening. However, I ask him and his colleague to look at this matter.  It warrants attention, particularly for people who are selling their family home to buy another.  This duty is anti-family and anti-social and militates against people who are trying to buy a better house.  If they wish to do so they are hit by this penal tax.  A review is overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I do not know if I can give him much solace just yet.  The rates of stamp duty on property transfers depend on the amount or value of the consideration for the property and currently range in graduated steps from 1 per cent on property between £5,000 and £10,000 to 6 per cent on property over £60,000.  The present rating and structure have largely applied since 1975, except for the introduction of the 5 per cent band in 1988 <Col N="782" /> and a readjustment of the lower bands in 1990.</P>
      <P>These levels of stamp duty must be viewed in the context of the overall tax policy.  A key element in the tax reform strategy of successive Governments over recent years has been to maintain as broad a tax base as possible and to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute an increasing share of total revenues.  Stamp duty on property, as a major component of capital taxation, has an important role to play in this regard.</P>
      <P>The yield from stamp duty on all property, including second hand houses, is estimated at £160 million this year. This is a large component of the capital taxes yield and makes a significant contribution towards the cost of implementing the Government's important social and economic programme. Capital taxation also contributes towards greater fiscal equity and stamp duty on property provides a fairness and balance in shifting some of the burden of taxation away from wage and salary income and on to property.</P>
      <P>I accept that house prices have been rising in some areas at a rate greater than inflation in recent years and that a similar increase has not been made to the bands for stamp duty on property. This increase in the price of houses is to the advantage of anyone who has been fortunate to have been in a position to have invested in a house a number of years ago and who now is selling.  It should be stated, however, that it is by no means certain that a reduction in the rates of stamp duty would be passed on to the purchaser of the property, particularly in a buoyant property market.  It is very possible in such circumstances that reductions in stamp duty would be captured by the seller in the price of houses.  This would benefit the house owner with little or no benefit accuring to the purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, the Senator might be interested to know that in the October 1995 issue of &ldquo;Sherry Fitzgerald Update&rdquo; the managing director of <Col N="783" /> Sherry Fitzgerald, Mr. Mark Fitzgerald, makes the following comments:</P>
    <P>Although, in my view, inequitable, it has to be admitted that the high rate of our stamp duty &mdash; 6 per cent on second-hand house sales over £60,000 &mdash; has served to dampen speculative investment.  In particular, it has discouraged speculative investors from getting involved in our housing market in the hope of making a reasonably quick profit.</P>
    <P>This has served to keep the Irish house market &mdash; in contrast to that in Britain &mdash; an owner-occupied market: 95 per cent of houses in Dublin are purchased by people buying for their own occupation.  By contrast, in the late 1980s in Britain, where stamp duty was a flat 1 per cent, the boom was investor led with one-third of houses in some parts of the country being bought by speculative investors ... for, like all mainly speculative markets, the British housing market of the late 1980s peaked and then began to collapse, as quickly as it had climbed ... the scars on British society are still unhealed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make too much of this but I draw the Senator's attention to a number of important reliefs and exemptions which are primarily aimed at assisting house buyers to purchase new homes.  There is full exemption from stamp duty for transfers of new houses with a floor area below 125 square metres.  Transfers of new houses with a <Col N="784" /> larger floor area attract stamp duty based only on the site value, subject to a minimum site value of one-quarter of the full house value.  The targeting of these stamp duty reliefs in favour of new houses takes account, <i>inter alia,</i> of the fact that most new house sales are subject to VAT at 12.5 per cent whereas sales of second hand houses generally are not.</P>
    <P>There is also 100 per cent mortgage interest tax relief for first time buyers of both new and second hand houses and a reduced rate of relief for other mortgage holders.  A generous £3,000 new house grant is also available for first time buyers.  All these reliefs and exemptions help to moderate the cost of housing generally and also play an important role in promoting employment within the construction sector.</P>
    <P>In framing taxation policy, the Government must have regard to both the budgetary implications of changes in the tax code and the possible effects of such changes on other aspects of Government policy.  The primary rationale for considering the merits of any changes in rates or further reliefs in the taxation system is the creation of employment and it is with regard to this that all proposals for changes in rates and tax reliefs are assessed.  The Government will keep the levels of stamp duty under examination but, frankly, there are no plans at present to alter the current scheme.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 November 1995.</P>
