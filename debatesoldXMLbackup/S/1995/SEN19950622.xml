    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business I wish to make a brief point.  It has always been the practice of this House, during the term of the last Leader, Senator Wright and during my term as Leader, that Ministers are expected to treat it with courtesy. However, there is another side to this. Last evening a Minister was not treated with courtesy when a Senator who had been granted permission to raise a matter on the Adjournment did not turn up without notice, thus inconveniencing the Minister and his officials.  We should not allow this to happen again.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to take items 1 and 2. Item 1 is to be completed not later than 1 p.m. and speeches are not to be longer than 20 minutes.  At 2 p.m. we will take all Stages of item 2.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter raised by the Leader, I also regret that the Senator who had been granted time to raise a matter on the Adjournment was not present in the House.  I can assure the House that this was a complete oversight on the part of the Senator who very much regrets it and will convey her regrets to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> We agree to today's Order of Business as outlined by the Leader.  I thank the Leader for providing our office yesterday with an outline of the proposed business for the remainder of this session. He has a heavy programme of work in mind.  I hope it is not intended to take all Stages of all the Bills outlined in that programme before the end of the session.  While I agree to taking all Stages of the Investment Intermediaries Bill today on the basis that it is non-controversial and that its early passage is desirable, the Leader has on many occasions in the past expressed reservations about rushing business through the House, particularly at the end of a session.  I agree with the point made by the Leader and many other Senators in the past that there should be time for reflection between the Second and remaining Stages of Bills.  I hope to have an opportunity to have further discussion with the Leader on his intentions for business before the end of the session.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to use every means at his disposal to bring about an early resolution of the Dunnes Stores dispute.  If it drags on, it will have the most serious implications for hundreds of suppliers throughout the country and for jobs in these firms.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister the serious concerns of Members about this dispute persisting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mullooly's point in respect of business between now and the end of the session. I thank the Leader for circulating the proposed business from now until then, which is useful to us.  However, I remind him of what he said, when on this side, about legislation being rushed through and I am confident he will do everything to ensure this will not be the case and that we will have time to consider Bills, particularly between Second Stage and Committee and Report Stages.  On the first day the Seanad met after the new Government took office, we took all Stages of a Bill.  At the time we indicated <Col N="187" /> to the Leader we accepted the circumstances but that in future we would be unhappy with this and he accepted that point.</P>
      <P>Item 1 consists of a motion on the OECD Economic Survey of Ireland, 1995.  It would be useful if we had read the document before debating it.  I know from the history of the Seanad that not reading documents does not preclude us from commenting on them.  Nevertheless, the Leader gave an undertaking yesterday that he would try to have the document supplied to us.  Around 4 p.m. yesterday the conclusions but not the full document were circulated to us. This was satisfactory to some extent.  In the context of the Minister for Education spending several hundred thousand pounds to circulate her picture in full colour around the country and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, appearing with the ESB bill, would the Leader not agree it is reasonable to expect that this document should have been circulated to all Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to raise two questions with the Minister for Social Welfare.  The first concerns old age non-contributory pensions.  A person who has £10,000 invested in the bank at around 2 per cent interest, which is the going rate, has an income from that investment of about £5 a week, but is assessed for the purposes of old age contributory pensions as earning £19.48 per week.  This is a downside of the current low interest rates and means that such person would lose approximately £15 per week.  Would the Leader point out to the Minister for Social Welfare that these people worked very hard, lived frugally all their lives, were not a burden on the State and saved some money for their old age, which they now find is a big disadvantage? Would the Leader make the Minister for Social Welfare aware of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second question is in regard to those in receipt of social security pensions <Col N="188" /> from Great Britain.  I was approached last week by a person who got a cheque from the UK for £400 and the bank charged £18 to process the transaction.  When there was a greater exchange rate difference between the punt and sterling, this scandal passed by unnoticed.  However, now that the punt and sterling are almost at parity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is quite noticeable that the banks are ripping these people off.  It is outrageous to stop £18 out of a cheque for £400.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make the Minister for Social Welfare aware of that fact and try to get something done about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to follow up on the point which was raised by Senator Dardis.  We spoke about discourtesy to the House this morning and the unavailability of the OECD report is a definite discourtesy to the House.  Three copies of the report were placed in the Library but those copies have been borrowed and are not available to Senators for today's debate.  Yesterday I asked somebody in the Department of Foreign Affairs to get me a copy of the report. He contacted the Department of Finance and was told that they could not supply a copy of the report and they sent a copy of the conclusions which were sent to Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about the business of the House, the Minister for Finance and his officials should be serious about allowing us to have a debate here.  It is absolutely disgraceful that they will not or cannot supply copies of the OECD report, which has major implications for every area of Irish society.  I ask the Leader to convey the feelings of the House on this matter.  Are we going to have to listen to the Minister's speech in <Col N="189" /> order to decide on what parameters the conclusions of the report are based?  If we do not know on what bases the conclusions were reached, we cannot have a meaningful debate here this morning; it is a farce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on all sides of the House have often stressed the importance of promoting the arts in Ireland.  Would the Leader ask the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to congratulate Kathy Prendergast, who won the Venice Biennale prize for art in competition with 44 countries?  That is an incredible achievement and should be noted as a great success for Ireland and not just a personal success for Ms Prendergast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader arrange for a debate on the findings of the review of the Foyle Fisheries Commission? I feel that I have to labour these matters when I raise them in the Seanad, although not with the Leader of the House.  When we discuss emotional matters and the troubles in the North, it is customary for a bandwagon to develop.  The Foyle Fisheries Commission has been in existence for 50 years and it is the only structure which has been managed jointly.  The two Governments commissioned a careful study of the complications and difficulties and quite useful recommendations are made in the report which is now available.</P>
      <P>This House should be consistent in its concern and its contribution towards the functioning of business between the North and the South.  This is the only body which is managed jointly.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister to the House so that we can make a constructive contribution towards the future of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request to the Leader to ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to intervene in the Dunnes Stores dispute.  This dispute is heading into its second week and will have devastating effects on <Col N="190" /> many other jobs throughout the country. We appeal to the management to consider entering into negotiations, which will have to take place at the end of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The first item I wish to raise concerns the response of the Government to the flooding which occurred earlier this year.  There were many debates on the issue here and it was raised many times here.  Certain commitments were given and local authorities were asked to submit major plans for flooded roads &mdash; at their own cost, it now appears.  There has been no response from the Minister for the Environment.  Will the Leader ask the Minister when moneys will be paid out? I understand that some local authorities are going to have to put their staff on a three day week.  The weather is fine now and the sun in high in the sky, but we cannot forget what happened between January and March of this year.  The local authorities are strapped for cash and need a response from the Minister for the Environment as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Last night in this House the Minister of State at the Department of Justice made a statement which contradicted all other statements to date from the Government regarding the deferral of the Castlerea prison project and the women's prison project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Members of the House have been contacted by university graduates who are unable to get places on higher diploma in education courses.  The Minister for Education dealt somewhat with this matter last year when a similar situation arose and after her intervention some additional places were provided in the colleges.  A substantial number cannot get places because of the method of selection used by the universities.  A haphazard system of lotteries, or whatever, is used which does not distinguish between those who genuinely want the qualification in order to teach and those who pursue the course just to enhance their job opportunities but do not wish to teach.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House when it is intended to have a debate on the Green Paper on Broadcasting. How far advanced are the proposals of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins, in the legislative area?  Will a Bill be published before the end of the year and will it be initiated in this House? Will the Leader establish whether the Minister has responded to the submission made by RTE to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation?  The comments made at that session two weeks ago relating to the extension of broadcasting into Northern Ireland by RTE received scant publicity, ironically from RTE.  It is an important progression in establishing and harmonising relations between the two traditions on this island.  In that context, it is an important suggestion and I would like to know if the Minister has, or will, make a response to that particular initiative.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Mullooly and Senator Dardis, the document I circulated yesterday is not the final one.  I wanted to give Senators an indication of the workload between now and the end of the session so they could order their business.  Obviously, a final decision will be taken after consultation with all parties.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the question of Dunnes Store.  I am not sure if any useful intervention can be made at this stage when one side to the dispute resolutely refuses to speak or to listen.  It takes two sides to sit down and to talk.  I do not believe the Government can do anything useful apart from putting pressure on to ensure that all the machinery available is used.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator Lanigan asked about the OECD report.  I endeavoured to have copies of the report circulated to all Members, but that was not possible for reasons of costs.  I was told that each party would receive a number of copies and I regret that did not happen.  Senator Townsend raised a number of issues which I will convey to the Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa.  I will also convey the message from Senator Henry.</P>
      <P>Although I would like a debate on Foyle Fisheries, we will not be able to have one this session, but it will remain on the agenda.  The debate I promised Senator McGowan on cross-Border aid will take place next week.  Senator Finneran asked about flooding.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, will be in the House this afternoon and I will speak to him then to see if we can arrange statements or a short discussion on that subject. I will try to get clarification from the Minister of State on the future of Castlerea Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Daly that the situation as regards the higher diploma in education is unsatisfactory.  I am not sure what the reason behind it is, but it is causing great difficulties.  A number of Members will have received representations. I will speak to the Senator and <Col N="194" /> I will endeavour to provide maybe a half an hour next week when the Minister for Education could come in and discuss the matter with us.  Senator Mooney raised a number of questions on broadcasting to which I do not have the answer.  The broadcasting committee will meet in the next couple of weeks.  I have been told by the convenor that a meeting is scheduled for the near future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate on the recent OECD Economic Survey of Ireland.  I refer to some procedural points raised in relation to the distribution of the report.  The report was published on 8 June and copies are available from the Government Publications Office at £16.50.  We are prohibited by copyright law from photocopying the report, although summaries of it were made available.  Following strong representations by the Leader of the House to my Department to make copies available, I understand a limited number were made available.  However, there appears to have been some difficulty in distribution.  Not every Member of this or the House will want to read the report, but some must do so.</P>
      <P>For future reference, we should look at procedures within the relevant committee of the House for the distribution of these reports.  It would cost £3,500 to give a copy to every Member of both Houses.  Not even the Progressive Democrats would like me to be that flaithiúlach with the taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>The OECD is an independent expert organisation which commands worldwide respect for the quality and objectivity of its work.  Its regular surveys of the policies and performance of countries provide authoritative, disinterested assessments of achievements and prospects of the 25 states which comprise its membership.  The surveys are aimed at enabling members to stand back from day to day minutiae and to consider fundamental issues of policy. The purpose is to help member countries, by putting them under a microscope from time to time, towards a better future.  The OECD goal, always, is to offer constructive insights so that the better aspects of policy can be built upon and any weaknesses highlighted for action.  Of course, few countries will agree with everything the OECD may say.  But commonsense indicates that we should listen hard to the disinterested commentary of experts.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the Seanad has decided to debate this year's survey of Ireland.  I hope that today's debate will strengthen the recognition of how well Ireland has been performing and &mdash; equally, if not more important &mdash; will focus attention on issues which are important to Ireland's future wellbeing.  I know that good news is not attractive from the point of the media.  However, we should as a people, take account of progress that has been made and the position within which we now find ourselves.  This is not an occasion for political point-scoring but rather one for reflection about how we achieved what we have achieved and how we might, for the benefit of all, continue to make substantial progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me now turn to some of the main messages of the recent OECD survey. Looking back over seven years, the survey notes that: &ldquo;Since 1991, Ireland has recorded the fastest expansion of any <Col N="196" /> country in the European Union&rdquo;.  Looking forward, it takes the view that: &ldquo;the economic outlook for 1995 and 1996 remains favourable, with output growth projected to be near 5 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senators may not be fully aware that this assessment, completed in March last as the survey was being finalised, has been superseded with a more optimistic view.  The latest edition of the twice-yearly <i>OECD Economic Outlook,</i> which was published only on Tuesday and is based on assessment made during May, forecasts still higher growth.  The OECD now believes that Irish output will expand by 5.75 per cent in 1995 and by 5 per cent in 1996.  These are the fastest rates of forecast growth among all the 25 OECD countries.  We should recognise the significance of this and take confidence from it.</P>
    <P>The OECD indicates that Irish exports have captured an increased share of international markets in recent years and forecasts that we will continue to build market share.  While the high technology sectors make the major contribution, the survey notes that other sectors are also doing well.  It attributes our increased share of world markets to Ireland's &ldquo;competitive strength&rdquo; as well as to the improving quality of our work-force. Indeed, it attributes 0.8 percentage points of our average annual growth rate between 1960 and 1985, using economists' jargon, to &ldquo;growth in human capital&rdquo;.  Particularly from the latter part of 1993, it notes that growth has been broadly based, with strengthening business and household confidence boosting investment and consumption. More important, its view is that growth this year and next will be equally broadly based.  It suggests that &ldquo;continued growth in employment and disposable income should sustain personal consumption&rdquo;, that &ldquo;activity will also benefit from increased exports, led by demand for traditional products from continental Europe&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;business investment...should increase&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The survey note that &ldquo;while employment fell in the EU in 1993, the growth <Col N="197" /> of output in Ireland generated significant job gains&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;the continued rise in employment contributed to a decline in Ireland's high unemployment in 1994&rdquo;.  Looking forward, it see &ldquo;continued growth in employment&rdquo;, of 2.4 per cent in 1995 and 1.9 per cent in 1996. This, it says, &ldquo;should be sufficient to ensure a further reduction in unemployment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our employment record over the past number of years merits greater attention. Over the seven years to April 1994, total employment has increased by 86,000, or by approximately 8 per cent. This compares with an increase of approximately 3 per cent in respect of the EU of 12 member states.  Non-agricultural employment has increased by 110,000, or by approximately 12 per cent.  Private sector non-agricultural employment has expanded by approximately 120,000, well above a 15 per cent increase over the past seven years.  This is clear evidence that there is no question of Ireland experiencing jobless growth, and that on jobs we are far outperforming our fellow EU member states.</P>
    <P>Whether one relies on the OECD expectations, which I have cited, or on those of my budget last February, the outlook is that this will continue.  The OECD forecast for jobs in 1995 mirrors my own.  I had suggested that total employment would grow by 31,000, or by approximately 2.5 per cent this year. Such indications as we now have suggest that employment is continuing to expand rapidly.  For example, notified redundancies for the first five months of the year are 25 per cent lower than in the same period last year; employment related revenue receipts offer supportive evidence; employment in building and construction is approximately 7.5 per cent up on last year; and, according to the IBEC monthly survey, business employment expectations are now the most upbeat that they have been in over four years.</P>
    <P>This robust employment growth is reflecting itself in lower unemployment. Last year the live register fell by an <Col N="198" /> average of 14,000.  At the end of May, total unemployment was 8,000 below its level a year earlier.  Unlike previous periods of falling unemployment, employment growth rather than net emigration appears to be the main factor.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, remains deeply conscious of the need to build on its considerable successes to date, to further increase employment and reduce the unacceptably high level of unemployment which we still face.  We have a rapidly growing labour force. The natural rate of increase is approximately 24,000 per year and the continuing upward trend in labour force participation by women adds to this increase in the labour market.  We therefore need very high levels of employment growth just to stabilise unemployment and avoid emigration.  This is part of the reason why our unemployment levels are not falling even faster, given the strong job gains we have been achieving.</P>
    <P>However, we should also view the fact of a rapidly growing young labour force as a major asset.  It means that we can have higher rates of economic and employment progress without inflationary pressure and hence with lesser risks of setbacks.  It also means that we face into the next century, when ageing populations will place major strains on pension systems and health care budgets in many OECD countries, with less exposure to these kinds of problem. While we will eventually have to face up to the consequences of an ageing population, it would appear that we will have more time to plan for this eventuality than others and will have had the opportunity to learn how best to meet this challenge from the experiences of others.  Indeed, ongoing work in the OECD on this issue will be of great assistance to us in planning for the future.</P>
    <P>I now propose to turn to some issues of policy which the survey mentions.  It touches on exchange rate developments over the period it covers.  As Senators will be aware, the Government's Programme for Renewal makes it clear that <Col N="199" /> a stable exchange rate for the Irish pound within the exchange rate mechanism will remain the cornerstone of monetary policy.  Price stability &mdash; reliably low inflation &mdash; remains the objective of exchange rate policy.  This is not a theoretical concept.  High rates of inflation impoverish the weak and vulnerable in our society.  They also attack our competitive position in our external markets and so reduce real employment opportunities.  It is also the objective of interest rate policy.  This is a matter for the Central Bank, which is independent from the Department of Finance and the Government.  The OECD survey comments positively on interest rate developments over the past two years.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread international consensus that focusing exchange rate and interest policy on price stability represents the best contribution these areas can make to the overall objective of achieving the maximum sustainable economic growth.  This stability oriented stance must be supported by the other areas of policy, and especially by sound management of the public finances. Ireland has a very good record in this respect, as is shown by the fact that the EU Commission has, both last year and this year, deemed Ireland to be among the small group of EU member states not to have an excessive deficit under the Maastricht Treaty excessive deficit procedures.  The Government's firm determination is to keep achieving a low annual deficit and to maintain downward pressure on our debt-to-GDP ratio.</P>
    <P>The OECD notes that inflation, which has been moderate, remains under control.  Doubtless this prompted its comment that our growth and employment performance reflected Ireland's competitive strengths.  However, while recognising that inflation is currently under control, the survey, in considering the risks to the positive outlook which it forecasts, remarked that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> ...one possible risk to the economic outlook is an acceleration of inflation... The continuing decline in the number of jobless might put upward pressure on wage rates, and consequently on domestic prices...</P>
    <P>This should be seen as sound advice regarding desirable future cost developments rather than as a risk that the OECD believes is seriously threatened. The evidence to date is that the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> are being adhered to.  While the consumer figures for mid-May 1995 showed some pick up in headline inflation, this reflected the springtime increase in mortgage rates rather than any underlying upsurge in prices. Indeed, excluding the effects of the rise in mortgage rates, inflation was a little lower at mid-May than at mid-February. Eliminating an inflationary psychology from our economic landscape has been one of the great success stories of Irish macroeconomic management in recent times.  It is a success story for which all parties of this House and the other House can claim credit.</P>
    <P>However, we should especially recognise the pivotal role played by the social partners and the three national agreements in this regard.  Indeed, an eminent Irish economist, Joe Durkan, acknowledged this fact on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on Friday, 9 June, when he conceded that his fears about the inflationary effects of such agreements have turned out to be wrong.  I wish that some of the right wing commentators, both inside and outside the House, and economists who get such media space would recognise this point.  It is my intention that we remain a low inflation economy so that we will continue to garner the benefits of a stable price environment and remain comfortable within the inflation criterion for European Monetary Union membership.  The OECD confirms this as an appropriate stance.  It goes on to state that &ldquo;if such developments are avoided, the economy would be firmly ensconced on a high growth, low <Col N="201" /> inflation path that might well continue until the end of the decade&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are balancing comments in the survey which must be taken into account in interpreting views which may appear critical of our social partnership approach to incomes development and to broader economic policy formulation &mdash; to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> agreements.  The survey argues that these agreements have exerted upward &ldquo;pressure on public expenditure&rdquo;, that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&ldquo;...commits Government to boost social welfare spending and to reduce the tax burden on workers&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it constitutes also a constraint on fiscal policy which could in the long run undermine the priority attached to reducing the public debt&rdquo;.  However, it would be misleading to look only to these comments.  The survey also acknowledges that the &ldquo;budget position has remained under control&rdquo; and that such commitment as these arrangements might entail have to be &ldquo;within the limits of the authorities' fiscal goals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A further critical comment with regard to centralised agreements is that &ldquo;by reducing the responsiveness of wages to shifts in the relative demand for labour, the centrally determined pay increases implied by such agreements may tend to introduce further rigidities into the labour market&rdquo;.  Again, looking elsewhere in the survey, one finds acknowledgement that &ldquo;this type of agreement proved to be successful in limiting inflationary pressure and promoting social cohesion&rdquo; and that &ldquo;inflation remains under control&rdquo; and, of course, there is the recognition, of which I have already spoken, that Irish employment growth has been much stronger than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the survey does not advocate an end to the social partnership approach.  The various pay agreements have balanced the employment needs of the economy with rising living standards for the average worker. <Col N="202" /> They have brought a stability and calm to industrial relations.  The competitiveness of the economy has been improved through moderate pay increases, facilitated by reductions in the income tax burden on workers. They have helped to build up a more trusting and responsible relationship between both sides of industry and Government which help us to define and pursue common goals more confidently.</P>
    <P>The survey acknowledges that the &ldquo;budget position has remained under control&rdquo; and notes that the &ldquo;actual deficits in 1993 and 1994 [were] lower than initially envisaged&rdquo;.  It could say no less, since the annual borrowing of the Government has remained well below 3 per cent of national income for several years now.  However, it is critical of the pace of expenditure growth, noting that the &ldquo;overall Government expenditure increased by 17 per cent in the past two years despite an increase in the price level of only 4 per cent&rdquo; and commenting on 1995, that the budget deficit &ldquo;suggests a somewhat pro-cyclical stance of fiscal policy&rdquo;.  It also indicates a preference to use any additional budgetary resources arising from growth over the medium term to further reduce the level of debt to GDP rather than to increase spending or reduce taxes.</P>
    <P>Since 1990, current supply services spending has increased by about 5 per cent per annum on average in real terms, that is above the rate of inflation. Spending of this magnitude allowed little scope for any reduction in the overall burden of taxation and was clearly unsustainable.  The upward trend in public expenditure has to be contained. All the benefits of economic growth over the past five years have been fully absorbed by higher spending.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the comment on this year's budget is accompanied by positive recognition of the approach of this Government.  Indeed, the importance which this Government attaches to strict control of public expenditure is manifestly clear in the commitment <Col N="203" /> which we have made in <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> where we have agreed to limit the growth in current supply services expenditure to 6 per cent in 1995 and to an average of 2 per cent in real terms over 1996 and 1997.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that benefits of future growth are used in substantial measure for tax reform which would favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap and encourage enterprise development and employment growth. The OECD makes special note of this commitment.  Indeed, it says that &ldquo;the current expenditure targets are consistent with reducing the debt ratio towards 60 per cent [of GDP] by the end of the century&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government has already demonstrated in this year's budget and Estimates its commitment to respect the tough spending limits set out in its programme. The increase in gross non-capital supply services expenditure this year will be 6.9 per cent.  I hope Senators on all sides of the House will accept that figure and not some of the crazy figures &mdash; as high as 11 per cent &mdash; that were mentioned by commentators.  Indeed, the leader of the main Opposition party was using an 11 per cent figure on a radio programme last Sunday.  The correct figure, taking one year with another, is 6.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is, admittedly, about 1 per cent over the increase of 5.8 per cent provided for in my budget last February. The increase since budget day is due almost entirely to the addition of £140 million for equal treatment payments on top of the £60 million provided for in the budget following the Government's decision to accept the judgment of the High Court on the entitlements of women under the EU Equal Treatment Directive.  I can assure this House, however, that meeting these liabilities does not indicate any weakening of the Government's resolve to contain public spending.  The House will be aware that the extra equal treatment costs will not count in determining the spending ceiling for 1996.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> We took advice following the High Court judgment and were told that if we appealed the decision, in all probability we would lose it and that the full cost, instead of being £260 million, would be closer to £340 million.  When we had ended and exhausted the legal route, the court may have directed us to pay that money in full and immediately. Therefore, the impact on our budgetary figures for the year in which that judgment would finally be delivered would have been far more damaging than our decision to take the responsibility to pay out the additional £140 million on our budget position of 8 February and I make no apology to anybody for making that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that we did not argue our case as forcibly then as I am now.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned that the OECD noted the &ldquo;somewhat pro-cyclical stance of fiscal policy&rdquo; for 1995, which decoded from its jargon means that we are pushing the accelerator a little faster than we need to because we are coming down the hill with the wind at our back. Their comments in this regard are both guarded and circumspect.  It is important that I emphasise that our approach to fiscal policy is not designed to temporarily lift the economy.  The challenge we are addressing is to ensure that the fruits of growth are shared in a way which is as supportive as possible of continued output and employment growth into the future.  In this context, the OECD comment with respect to 1995 is that &ldquo;the principal changes to tax and expenditure are all oriented towards improving work incentives at lower income levels&rdquo;.  This point made by the OECD has been ignored by many ill-informed attacks upon the budget, some from within parties represented in this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While one goal of the ongoing strategy is, as I have said, to ensure that the benefits of growth enable pro-employment <Col N="205" /> reform, a second goal is to ensure that, when the time comes, we will be able to participate in the final phase of Economic and Monetary Union.  This involves maintaining a current budget deficit within the Maastricht limit while reducing the level of our debt to GDP ratio at a satisfactory pace towards 60 per cent.  Our recent decision in ensuring that we maintain our expenditure target in 1996 is an indication of our willingness to take early corrective action and it is a clear demonstration of our commitment to fiscal responsibility over the medium term as one key to remaining within the Maastricht criteria. I should mention, of course, that we are only one of three countries deemed to have met these criteria last year by the EU Commission, the other two being Germany and Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The OECD survey indicates a preference for making greater use of any additional budgetary resources arising from growth over the medium term to further reduce the level of debt to GDP rather than to increase spending or reduce taxes.  While the choice of reducing the level of debt at a faster pace is, of course, a desirable one, the use of resources in this way must be weighed against the potential benefits of alternative uses.  The choice of how to use the &ldquo;fruits of growth&rdquo; must be considered in the context of the overall priority of Government policy, which is to sustainably reduce the level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the allocation of resources, it is necessary to strike a balance between reducing the level of debt on the one hand while also committing appropriate resources to other desirable objectives.  I will listen with interest to views on this issue.  As I have already noted, the OECD assessment of the limits we have already set ourselves on spending is that they are consistent with substantial further reduction of our debt burden over the period ahead.</P>
    <P>The OECD recognises that unemployment, particularly long term unemployment, is a serious problem facing <Col N="206" /> our economy.  I share its view.  It argues that:</P>
    <P>...the rate of long term unemployment in Ireland is indeed partly related to the lack of incentives, particularly for young people with low levels of education, for the unemployed to take low-paid employment.</P>
    <P>There may be some element of an incentive problem of the type described here by the OECD, but essentially that lack of incentive is for married persons with large families of four children or more.  If there is an overall problem, I doubt that it is widespread.  I also doubt that young people lack incentives to take up employment, low paid or otherwise, although given our high unemployment, I would be slow to deprecate low paid jobs <i>per se</i>, even though one would wish that all jobs could be more productive and hence capable of supporting higher earnings.</P>
    <P>I consider that our long term future lies in creating a high productivity economy which offers well paid employment to all who wish to work.  This is something which will not happen overnight; it involves investment in education and training by workers themselves, employers and the Government.  It also involves creating and maintaining an economic environment which is conducive to high levels of investment and entrepreneurial activity.</P>
    <P>There is a more fundamental problem, however, that of structural unemployment, not just in Ireland but within the whole of the European Union.  I have written and spoken about this at length and on different occasions.  I refer Senators to the contribution which I made to the NESF last autumn, when I was Minister of Enterprise and Employment.  Conventional economic models in our mixed market economy will not solve this growing problem, but neither can national Governments deal with it in isolation, having regard to the common labour market within the European Union.  Accordingly, the framework of an effective and lasting solution can only be designed by the <Col N="207" /> European Commission in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the need to improve work incentives, the 1995 budget adopted a more integrated approach to improving the position of families on low and middle incomes.  The significant reductions in the levels of income tax and social security charges were coupled with a first step in the reform of the way the State provides income support for dependent children.  Entitlement to the wide range of child supports in the social welfare code has traditionally been based on the employment status of the parent.  In the past these conditions have been a major contributory element to the unemployment trap.  Improvements in the supports for children were concentrated this year on the universal system of child benefit rather than the child additions to weekly welfare payments. It is our intention to refocus our approach to one which provides that support on the basis of family income, regardless of the source of that income, rather than on employment status.  The survey recognises this as one of the steps &ldquo;oriented towards improving work incentives at lower income levels&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The EU White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment noted that employer social security contributions in Ireland were among the lowest in the European Union. However, they remain higher than those in the United Kingdom with whom we have shared a single labour market for many years.  This places considerable pressure on labour intensive indigenously owned Irish companies in particular. Government policy nonetheless accepts that reducing indirect labour costs will assist employers in maintaining and creating employment.  The 1994 budget provided for a restructuring of the employer contributions with the introduction of a new lower contribution rate of 9 per cent in respect of employees earnings less than £9,000.  This measure was designed to assist employers in the low paid labour intensive sectors and was partly financed by <Col N="208" /> increasing the contribution ceiling in respect of employees generally.  The policy was continued in 1995, with the earnings threshold for the lower rate being increased from £9,000 per annum to £12,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Other measures taken to reduce indirect labour costs include the removal of the obligation on employers to pay the health contribution &mdash; 1.25 per cent &mdash; and the employment and training levy &mdash; 1 per cent &mdash; in respect of employees holding medical cards. Employers are also exempted from making social insurance contributions in respect of additional employees taken on from the register of unemployed persons. The unemployment condition for this exemption was removed in the 1995 budget in respect of employees under 23 years of age.  These measures, together with improvements in income tax and employees' social security contributions, form part of the Government's policy aimed at rewarding work, promoting enterprise and strengthening social solidarity.</P>
    <P>The prospects for a continuation of strong employment growth, assisted by measures of the kind I have just outlined, and of further declines in unemployment, are good.  The Government is aware, however, that economic growth alone will not be sufficient to solve the problem of long term unemployment. Additional efforts, particularly aimed at reintegrating the long term unemployed back into the labour force, are also needed.  This Government's policy agreement contained a proposal that an intensive guidance and placement service for the long term unemployed be established.  Provision was made to set up such a scheme on a pilot basis in this year's budget.  Since the budget a task force on long term unemployment has published its recommendations.  The Government will base its final decisions for a nationwide integrated local employment service to meet the needs of the long term unemployed on these recommendations.</P>
    <P>The OECD survey acknowledges the progress we have made on taxation <Col N="209" /> reform.  However, it calls for more, arguing that further reductions in taxation would improve work incentives and, implicitly, the pace of jobs growth. Of course, all reductions require financing. The OECD suggest that resort be had to base-broadening, and in particular suggest that:</P>
    <P>...a wider tax base could be achieved by reducing the scale of schemes designed to favour investment in certain enterprises, which have proved costly to the public finances.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, gave a commitment to review the &ldquo;economic efficiency of all tax expenditures including BES, section 35 and section 23 and others&rdquo;.  However, I suspect that we are somewhat ambiguous when it comes to base-broadening.  We are pleased to reap its benefits but unhappy to face its burdens.</P>
    <P>The OECD country surveys always devote one chapter to a special topic.  In this survey on Ireland the topic is education and training.  I should say at the outset that the survey represents a welcome contribution to the ongoing process of building an education system for all, a process to which this Government is committed.  It should be noted that the survey was prepared before the publication of the White Paper on Education on 12 April last by my colleague the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach.  As the House will be aware, the White Paper &mdash;<i>Charting Our Education Future</i>&mdash; represents the culmination of several years of consultation among all the partners in education and will form a blueprint for progress for many years to come.  In my view, the most interesting aspect of the OECD study is the degree to which its analysis and recommendations are in harmony with the considered principles and priorities set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The main theme of this chapter in the survey is the central role of education and training in the process of economic <Col N="210" /> growth and the reduction of social inequality.  The OECD points out that:</P>
    <P>...one of the essential components of fast economic growth in Ireland over the past three decades has been a rapid improvement in the average level of education of the work force.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that successive Governments have allocated considerable resources for education over the years. The proportion of GNP devoted to education is well up the international league table.  This Government is committed to maintaining a strong education system in order to underpin continued economic growth and employment creation. In addition, the Government is determined to prioritise our educational resources to reduce inequalities and improve social solidarity.  It is our firm belief that these twin objectives are not just compatible, they are dependent on one another.  The OECD has endorsed this position by stressing that improved access for low income groups to high quality education, especially at third level, is essential to sustain economic growth and combat unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is pertinent to note at this point that.  30 years on, we have benefited considerably from the major study undertaken with the help of the OECD entitled <i>Investment in Education.</i>  Most of the recommendations of that report have been implemented and the results are now manifest.  It is to be hoped that the White Paper will have a similar, positive effect in the future.</P>
    <P>There is broad agreement between the OECD and the Government on measures required to further strengthen the role of the education system.  The White Paper is a very comprehensive document, setting out a clear agenda for progress across all aspects of the system. My colleague, Deputy Bhreathnach, will spearhead the implementation of the White Paper.  All of us who are concerned with developing a strong and positive educational system for our children may take heart from the general endorsement provided by the OECD for our current policies.  For our part, we <Col N="211" /> in Government will continue, within a prudent fiscal strategy, to work proactively through the education area to strengthen the foundations for continued economic progress in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will reiterate what I said at the outset.  This report is to be welcomed.  It is a favourable report that recognises our achievement, which cannot not be stated often enough, as &ldquo;the fastest growing economy in the European Union&rdquo; and the prospect that we will continue to experience substantial economic and employment growth over the next number of years.  Of course, it urges us to do even better, particularly in the area of expenditure control and debt reduction.  I have dealt at some length with our concern to better balance our use of the benefits of growth.</P>
    <P>With macro-economic policy credibility well established and the prospect of lasting peace on our island becoming more of a reality with each day, we can look forward with greater optimism than, I would hazard to say, at any time since the foundation of this State.  We still have problems to overcome, particularly that of long term unemployment and its attendant social consequences. The acknowledgements in this survey of our progress and prospects suggest that we have in place the policies appropriate to tackling these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record my appreciation of the Oireachtas Library staff for having made available to me a copy of the report.  That gave me an opportunity to look through it quickly yesterday.  The report is broken down into four main divisions and underlines that despite the good performance in the economy, we still face the twin problems of high levels of debt and, of course, high unemployment.</P>
      <P>It also reviews the monetary and fiscal policies, which reminds me of a nursery rhyme that went:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> Arithmetic just makes me sick, said little Mary.</P>
    <P>The figures never act the same, they're always so contrary.</P>
    <P>I can never really come to grips with these complicated monetary figures. Somebody told me once that money is made wrong to go wrong, but it seems to me that anyone doing an assessment can come up with any kind of conclusions. We need to have firm Government policy and in this respect there are some indications in the report that the Government needs to be vigilant.</P>
    <P>Part III analyses the progress in structural reform, or perhaps we should say the lack of such progress, because while quite an amount of structural reformation needs to be attended to, for one reason or another it has been slow to develop.  Part IV, as the Minister outlined, looks at the special study of the Irish education and training system.</P>
    <P>The survey we are discussing today is probably the most favourable report on the Irish economy that we have seen for some time.  However, recent trends under the new Government are a cause for some concern and have overtaken this report.  I am sure that if the review committee was reporting now they might have some critical remarks to make about present Government policies. However, the report of the Economic and Development Review Committee gives a very clear picture of the present state of the economy and its conclusions highlight the favourable trends which should help to reduce unemployment levels.</P>
    <P>The review concludes that our economy has achieved the fastest growth in the European Union over the past three years.  Output increased by almost 4 per cent in 1993 when the rest of Europe was into recession and it increased by a further 5.5 per cent in 1994.</P>
    <P>The expansion in activity was led by exports from the modern manufacturing sector.  Confidence in the building and business sectors following devaluation in January 1993 facilitated a recovery in domestic demand in the second half of <Col N="213" /> 1993.  As a result of these and other measures the unemployment rate declined, but it is still the third highest in the OECD.  In spite of the favourable economic indicators, unemployment is not being reduced significantly or substantially.</P>
    <P>The high unemployment level is a major cause for concern and must be addressed by the Government as a matter of the highest priority.  The inflation rate of 2.5 per cent was mainly due to wage moderation and appreciation of the currency which took place after devaluation.  Even though the inflation rate was stabilised, its stability may be eroded &mdash; there are already indications that it is &mdash; by the type of stop-go policy decisions we are getting from the new Government.  The Government should take note of this.  The Minister indicated the necessity to stabilise inflation and the devastating effect it would have if this did not happen, but the indications are that the Government is not taking this into account in some of its decisions.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that the economic outlook for 1995 and 1996 remains favourable and it expresses confidence that growth in employment and real disposable incomes should sustain personal consumption even though higher interest rates might slow down development in the house building sector.  The fact remains, however, that a huge number of people are still out of work, and an economy that cannot resolve this central issue is not a successful one.</P>
    <P>The report also indicated that the budget position had remained under control, with lower deficits in 1993 and 1994 than had initially been envisaged. It did, however, indicate the necessity, for various reasons, to slow down the increase in Government expenditure. The recent panic measures by the Government are no substitute for sound planning and financial management. The people, and in some cases many politicians, suffered severe pain and hardship to gain control of Government finances from 1986 to 1992.  It would be suicidal if the Government were to let <Col N="214" /> the situation slip back into that kind of trap with the disastrous and devastating consequences such a failure would have on the economy generally.</P>
    <P>In numerous references the report draws attention to the high levels of long term unemployment.  It concludes that our rate of long term unemployment, the highest in the OECD, is partly related to the lack of incentives for the unemployed, particularly young people with a low level of education, to take up lower paid employment which may be available.  Many young people find it more advantageous to stay at home rather than work.  This lack of incentive needs to be addressed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The necessity to improve the level of education for young people should help to make a more effective and successful transition from school to work, thus minimising the risk of unemployment.  I am disappointed by the Government's performance in this regard.  It has sufficient reports but shows no sign of activity to resolve these issues.</P>
    <P>In my experience of dealing with these matters for a long number of years, the transition from school to working life is an area of activity that has not been fully researched or examined. That transition should be eased by the provision of career guidance counselling and other expert professional advice in those critical years, but this is something which has been neglected.  It should now be dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>The most critical time for many young people is the period immediately after finishing their second or third level education when they must make critical choices.  Unfortunately, there is a marked absence of the type of counselling and career guidance that is so necessary in dealing with this matter. Even in the White Paper on Education this area has not been given the attention it deserves.  The successful transition from school to working life is one that will chart the future course of many people in the labour market.  Currently, it is a market where employers have the benefit of a variety of young people <Col N="215" /> leaving schools and colleges seeking employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that many young people are being exploited by employers.  I do not wish to divert from the purpose of this debate, but I had personal experience of exploitation last weekend.  A young person was asked to work from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday every week as part of his normal week's work at a very basic minimum wage.  This is scandalous and should not be tolerated.  Employers who behave in that fashion, asking young school leavers to work from 6 a.m. to 6 o'clock at night on Saturdays and Sundays every weekend, should be brought to the notice of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment as well as the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The expansion of higher education has made Ireland second only to Japan in the proportion of young workers with a scientific or engineering degree.  This is a very positive trend.  Unfortunately, however, as has been found in many cases, some of these young graduates are leaving Ireland not so much because of the lack of opportunity here but because of the high levels of personal taxation, especially in the early years after graduation when they must repay university loans or whatever.  This forces many of these young graduates to seek employment opportunities abroad.  This is a big loss to the economy and there should be some mechanism whereby young graduates, with huge burdens of debt for their education, could get some concession in taking up their first employment.  The Government are moving in that direction according to some recent indications.</P>
    <P>The report acknowledges that education in Ireland has improved significantly over the past 30 years.  Public expenditure at or around the OECD average indicates the efficient use of resources devoted to education. However, the report indicated that there are structural and policy changes required urgently which we are not getting from the Government.  It concludes <Col N="216" /> that the Irish education system lags behind that of most advanced countries. Almost 25 per cent do not complete a full secondary education.  Children from the lower socio-economic backgrounds are almost five times as likely to leave school with low qualifications and face a 50 per cent probability of being unemployed one year after leaving school. Resolving these weaknesses in the education system should help Ireland to boost productivity and incomes to levels comparable to those in continental Europe.  That is broadly what the report states.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated earlier that the report was prepared before the publication of the Government White Paper.  In my opinion, the OECD would have been in touch with the Department and would have been fairly familiar with the proposals for the development of the White Paper.  Nevertheless, there is a clear, strong link demonstrated now, both internationally and nationally, between long term unemployment among young people and the lack of a proper education system to help them. The problems have largely been identified in the Government White Paper on Education.  I would like to see the Minister for Education adopt a more progressive attitude to resolve these problems and press ahead with the recommendations in the White Paper on Education.  We want action now, not platitudes and good intentions.</P>
    <P>I fear, however, that we have a lazy Minister for Education who is not making any significant impact in that Department.  Without in any way giving any credibility to the tabloid newspaper assessments of the performances of individual Ministers, we saw in one of the Sunday newspapers that the present Minister for Education got probably the lowest rating of any one of the present Ministers; she got something like three out of ten.  Now I do not place any significance on this type of media speculation; my own marks used to be pretty low when I was a Minister in Government. Nevertheless, I think it indicates a clear message from the Department of <Col N="217" /> Education.  We do not see action there. This White Paper has been talked about by Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Séamus Brennan.  So many Ministers for Education have announced this White Paper that it must be a pale shade of blue at this stage.  The fact is that there is no action in it.  I would like to see some of the proposals &mdash; especially in relation to training in education which is so important &mdash; implemented even though there may be tedious legislation to be prepared before effect is given to some of these areas.  We did have a vocational education system that operated successfully for about 20 years without the required statutory legislative framework.  In my view, there is nothing to prevent the Minister and the Government from pressing ahead with some of the important decisions in relation to matters identified in the report and following on with legislation in due course.  It is not necessary in some cases to have the legislative framework set down in tablets of stone before one takes action to deal with some of the problems that have been highlighted, not only nationally by numerous reports but again by this OECD report.</P>
    <P>The report indicates a trend which is a cause for some concern.  It states, in page nine, &ldquo;when measured in a common currency Irish wages fell 4.4 per cent relative to the other OECD countries in 1993&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister may be able to give us some explanation of this phenomenon because it seems to be a contradiction of what appears to be the situation.  Wage levels, we were led to believe, were increasing and improving. This looks like a reversal and I would like to hear some explanation from the Minister about how that is happening.</P>
    <P>It also indicates a trend which needs to be addressed &mdash; the negative growth in export markets in the traditional manufacturing sectors as distinct from the high-tech industries.  Almost all of the 10 per cent growth in total exports in 1993 came from the high-tech sector. The fact that there has not been any <Col N="218" /> great expansion in traditional markets is something which needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>The report does not go into any great detail in relation to the fall off in agricultural employment.  This is an area which now needs to be studied.  I am not aware of any detailed study having been carried out in recent times of the huge job losses in the agricultural area and whether some of this fall off in jobs could not be slowed down.  In this age of organic farming there is the prospect of many more jobs.  It has been accepted in every circle, economic and political, over the past number of years that the fall off in agricultural employment was a trend which was inevitable and could not be reversed or halted.  At a time when new opportunities are opening up for us in the areas of markets and commodities, we have an agricultural industry which could sustain quite a sizeable number of people in employment but they are being forced from agriculture and are seeking employment opportunities elsewhere.  The time is opportune to conduct an in-depth, detailed study of agricultural employment and to come up with recommendations which might halt or slow down the decline in agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>The report indicates housing investments also fell by about 4 per cent in 1993.  These were mainly discouraged by the high interest rates in the first half of 1993.  However, housing investments recovered in 1994 but this does underline the volatile nature of the building industry and the urgent necessity to keep Government finances in order so that interest rates can be stabilised.  In stabilising interest rates, we could see a further boost in the building industry.</P>
    <P>The success or otherwise of the building industry has often been used as a measure to determine the success or failure of the economy generally.  There were significant gains in employment in building construction in 1994 which, to some extent, offsets the fall off in the agricultural area.  Nevertheless, in maintaining confidence and expanding the building and business areas it is imperative that the Government watch its <Col N="219" /> expenditure so that we will not have a repeat of the previous situation.</P>
    <P>The report states the number of employed jumped by 30,000 in 1994. New jobs were concentrated in the services sector where employment increased by 40,000 over the two year period.  Unemployment was down to about 14.6 per cent by the end of 1994. Although this improvement in unemployment is welcome, an unemployment rate of 14 per cent is excessive; it is not acceptable and must be reduced in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>In the report net emigration was estimated at 6,000 in 1993 and 10,000 in 1994.  Of course, it was well below the 1988 and 1989 levels when it exceeded 40,000 per year.  However, there is no room for complacency here.  The flow of young people into the labour market has been reduced by Government employment schemes, rising emigration figures and, of course, more young people staying on in higher education and despite the reduction in total unemployment, the proportion of long term unemployed has continued to increase. That is a disturbing trend.  The long term unemployed now account for almost half the total of unemployed and the shortcomings mentioned in this report underline the urgent necessity to deal with their problems.  Nevertheless, the report projects Ireland's GNP will expand by 5 per cent in 1995 and by 4.5 per cent in 1996.  The growth is expected to be led by private domestic demand. Continuing employment growth and low inflation should ensure real wage gains.</P>
    <P>While the report is welcome and encouraging, it underlines basic shortcomings in the economy which should be addressed.  I am not convinced this Government has the courage to take the decisions necessary to get the economy on the road to real prosperity, offering the prospect of employment to the many people urgently seeking indications from reports like this that they have a prospect of a job at the end of the next period of planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and Minister of State to the House and I welcome this debate on the OECD economic survey.  The Irish economy has achieved the fastest growth in the EU over the last three years.  Output increased by almost 4 per cent in 1993, while the rest of Europe fell into recession by a further 5 per cent during 1994.  The expansion and activity was led by exports from the modern manufacturing sector, which offset depressed conditions in the domestic market in the first half of 1993.</P>
      <P>The report points out that a second ingredient in the growth was the removal &mdash; following the 10 per cent devaluation of currency within the EMS in January 1993 &mdash; of exchange and interest rates associated with the disruption of European exchange markets in the autumn of 1992.  This allowed a rapid easing in monetary conditions which boosted household and business confidence, thus facilitating a recovery of domestic demand in the second half of 1993, led by the consumption of and increased investment in housing.  As a result the unemployment rate declined significantly in 1994, although we still have a high rate compared to other OECD areas.</P>
      <P>The economic outlook for 1995 and 1996 remains favourable and output growths are projected to be nearly 5 per cent.  Continued growth in employment and real disposable income should sustain personal consumption.  Although higher interest rates may slow the growth in house building, interest rate development over the past two years suggests monetary policy has helped establish confidence in the markets and the stability of the new rate of the Irish pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the money market rates fell from the peak of over 40 per cent at the beginning of 1993 to just over 6 per cent at the end of 1994, the differential between German and Irish short term interest rates has come back to the level seen prior to the currency market reductions in the early part of 1992. Likewise, by the end of 1994 the differential <Col N="221" /> between the Irish and German long term rates had fallen to below the level observed in the middle of 1992. However, Irish long term interest rates remain more in line with UK rates, rising faster than German rates in the early part of 1994 before stabilising in the second half of the year despite further upward pressure in Germany.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government and the Minister for Finance on the way they are handling the economy.  The Minister said recently in the Dáil that the economy is in good shape and I have no doubt that it is in good hands as well. He stated business and investment in structures and buildings should increase, that the expected growth should be sufficient to ensure a further reduction in unemployment and that Government borrowing should remain lower than the debt to GDP ratio; it is projected to fall to 85 per cent by the end of 1995.  The current expenditure targets are consistent with reducing the debt ratio to 60 per cent by the end of the century.  Continuous growth in employment and real disposable income should sustain the personal consumption category.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned three factors which should keep the economy on a sound footing.  First, the OECD survey noted that inflation, which has been moderate, remains under control.  He said the one possible risk is an acceleration of the inflation rate.  No one wants this country to return to the inflation and interest rates we had in the early 1980s, which were disastrous for business, employers, workers and the economy.</P>
    <P>Second, the Minister said the report was favourable about the social partnership approach and said it should continue. I also believe it should, because the social partners have done great work in stabilising the numbers employed in the economy.  Labour relations have been excellent in the last number of years, which is a credit to everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>Third, the Government is committed to the long term unemployed.  However, as the Minister said the Government is <Col N="222" /> aware economic growth alone will not be sufficient to solve their problems.  It is up to us all, as employers, workers, tax payers and public representatives, to take the measures and put in place the processes necessary to tackle long term unemployment.  It is a growing concern and I extend good wishes to those who take on this task.  Any possible initiatives should be taken with haste because it is a growing concern.</P>
    <P>With the peace process and the expansion in the tourism industry, the Irish economy will expand in coming years.  There is enormous potential for expansion in tourism.  The only worry is that the Irish pound is not in a favourable position against Sterling.  This could also affect exports to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance to check the commission levels tourists and other visitors are charged by the banks and other agencies.  Recently I was told by one institution that I would get less than £8 Irish for £10 Sterling.  That is discouraging to any tourist from Britain or Northern Ireland.  Those are our biggest tourism markets and they have been the best tourists here for many years.</P>
    <P>Strict Government control of public expenditure is important.  The Minister has stated the Government is firmly committed to ensuring the fruits of economic growth are not fully absorbed by the higher public spending which has occurred in recent years but will be used in substantial measures for tax reform which will favour the incentive to work, to tackle the poverty trap and to encourage enterprise, development and growth.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Government commitments were given to limit the growth in current supply services expenditure to 6 per cent in 1995 and an average of 2 per cent in real terms over the years 1996 to 1997.  I hope the Government rigidly adheres to those figures.  I am glad we must stay within the Maastricht Treaty guidelines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> I welcome the OECD Economic Survey of Ireland, 1995, which was published recently.  That report stated that Ireland was the fastest growing economy in the OECD from 1990-94.  This was based mainly on job gains in the country and a decline in our unemployment rate.  I welcome comments which are favourable to this country's economy because too many bad ones were made during the 1980s.</P>

      <P>The OECD report is timely and its conclusions are positive in a number of areas.  However, they also warn us that if we are not careful, the benefits which have accrued over the past number of years as a result of the way the economy has grown could be eliminated in a short period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are deficiencies in our education and training systems and anyone who has examined our unemployment situation over the past number of years knows that they do not provide for the needs of a large number of young people.  It is great to look at this report in macro economic terms and say everything is all right in Ireland.  However, when one looks at any town, village or country area, one will see that unemployment is not decreasing at the rate it should.  This shows that for various <Col N="224" /> reasons, mostly economic, there are too many people in this country who are not able to avail of the benefits of education.</P>
    <P>The report shows that those who are educated are more likely to get jobs than those who are not.  Unfortunately, the person who photocopied the report missed pages 53 to 101 and educational matters were discussed on page 67.  The report shows that approximately 18 per cent of those who leave the educational system at second level will be long term unemployed.  This compares with 1.5 per cent of those who complete third level education.  The report also shows that people from the lower socio-economic classes are unlikely to get into third level institutions, while those from the higher socio-economic classes will if they have the educational qualifications because they have the money to further their education.</P>
    <P>An attempt will be made over the next 12 months to alleviate this situation, but it is a negative step.  Fees for the next academic year will either remain the same or increase, but parents will only have to pay half the fee charged by the university.  However, fees do not dictate whether certain children can get third level education or not.  A number of people will be kept out of the system if their parents have no income or cannot get benefits from the State to keep them in college, although the fees have been reduced. We must address the issue of funding for those who need second and third level education in order to get sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>There is a growth in the number of jobs for untrained people, particularly in the leisure sector.  Many people downgrade these jobs by saying they offer low wages.  However, they are part of the economy.  It would be better if those with plenty took less in order to ensure that those who need more can get it.  This is not only a problem in Ireland, but also in the Third World and the western world, which is always fighting for a bigger share of the economic cake.  This means that people in the <Col N="225" /> Third World are left behind.  We all hear people suggesting that the World Bank, the IMF, the UN and the EU should help the Third World.  The trade between northern and southern countries is greater than that in the opposite direction.  People in the western world are looking for better standards of living, while leaving the Third World behind.  If this trend continues, the next major threat will not be an east west confrontation between the USSR and the west, but an attack on the western world if it does not stop its economic gains at the expense of the Third World.</P>
    <P>We should not say that everything is all right when it is not.  The unemployment situation is terrible.  The report states that 14.5 per cent of our population are unemployed, which is the third highest level in the OECD.  We cannot boast about that, because although the standards of living in Ireland are superior to those in most places in the world, those who are unemployed are not benefiting from the so-called fastest growth in the European Union over the past three years. Although economic outlook remains favourable, with output growth projected to be approximately 5 per cent, Government spending has increased rapidly over the past 12 months.  The Minister for Finance has recognised this and is now trying to redress the damage done over the past few months, but if he tries to take £70 million out of the allocations made to Departments, that will create problems.  I do not know how he will do it without creating further unemployment.  There is a need to control spending in the public service, but we must be careful that the control of spending is not allied to an increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>There have been fears over the past few months that interest rates could rise due to world problems.  Apparently, however, there has been a slowing down of the US economy and a restatement of the economic situation in Germany. It is suggested that because of this, long term interest rates will fall or remain <Col N="226" /> static.  This will be of benefit to anybody who has had to borrow.  For anyone planning in the long term it is essential that interest rates remain low rather than have a return to fluctuating interest rates, which generally meant interest rates increasing.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say that Government borrowing remains low; it is still much to high.  It is projected to fall to 85 per cent at the end of 1995 from 97 per cent in 1990.  That is not something of which we can be proud.  It is essential to slow down the rate of Government expenditure.  There has been an increase in demand in the domestic market and this is shown in the increase in the number of new vehicles sold.  The more new vehicles sold the greater the pressure put on our foreign debt in that we do not manufacture motor vehicles in Ireland.  Therefore, the more that are sold the more currency goes out of the country to purchase them.</P>
    <P>Incomes in the public service have risen much faster than those in the private sector.  The private sector is the most productive in the economy.  There is no productivity in the public service. The service given by the Garda, the nurses or the teachers is essential to the running of the country.  It would be unfair to suggest that teachers do not play a major part in the creation of employment and they are, therefore, more productive than others in the public service.</P>
    <P>The rate of long term unemployment is far too high.  We do not have riots from the long term unemployed because they have, to a degree, been cushioned by reasonable social welfare benefits to date.  It is unfortunate that the level of increase of benefits this year has been the lowest for many years.</P>
    <P>Education is an area of concern.  We must examine the expansion of proper training.  There are few who would suggest that the FÁS training schemes have been anything but a success, but there has not been a monitoring of the numerous available schemes.  If anybody decides to set up a training scheme and applies to FÁS they will be allowed to <Col N="227" /> run that scheme.  I do not think any monitoring has been done of the long term benefits of the majority of these schemes.</P>
    <P>It might create problems initially but if it is not examined now in a cohesive way huge amounts of EU and national moneys will have been wasted with no productive jobs or long term employment created.  That matter should be dealt with in the near future; it should be a priority for Government in the next couple of months.  If the OECD can examine the matter and conclude that the training schemes have, in the main, not worked, it will not be long before the EU and others will examine them and cease their funding.</P>
    <P>The report states there are a lot of weaknesses in the area of scientific education. Not enough emphasis is placed on research and development in our educational system.  There is very little research and development training taking place in our colleges and universities. We have an excellent third level educational system, but we are not benefiting to a large degree from it.  There are many who have had to emigrate having got their degrees as they could not get jobs in Ireland.  That is far too high a waste to the Irish economy.  We must examine the courses done in universities with a view to increasing the number of courses which carry with them the probability of getting jobs in Ireland so that the economy can benefit from the huge amounts spent on our third level system.</P>
    <P>One is not supposed to say it, but the standards of teachers in schools, universities and regional technical colleges should be monitored.  It does not appear to many that there is a proper monitoring system.  It seems to many that one can not do anything about a bad teacher in a school or a bad professor in a college. This gives rise to major problems, especially with a view to getting jobs after third level.</P>
    <P>We in Kilkenny have found a great growth in small craft industries which, in the main, are small in terms of the <Col N="228" /> numbers employed but they stay in business and generate other businesses.  It is an industry which FÁS or the National College of Art and Design should examine with a view to developing training in that field.  The reports states that such industries should be examined in order to improve the job opportunities of those who might not be cut out for universities.</P>
    <P>The vocational education system has proved to be important in the past and provided for education in crafts and other such skills, which have to a large degree gone from the system.  It is time these skills were brought back.  It is hard to come by the skills of the carpenter, plumber or mason nowadays.  If an effort was made to get back to education in those skills, jobs opportunities would arise.  People who would not have the capacity to attend college could get work and do a good job for Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is an optimistic report and it is nice to see that somebody can come in from outside and give a reasonable assessment of what is going on.  Nevertheless, we have to be extremely careful in the areas of inflation and unemployment. We have to be more than careful because we are in a fragile situation, depending so much on foreign trade. We must also ensure that public spending, which has started to go out of kilter again, does not force us back into the situation that we were in during the decade prior to 1991.  The facts are that we now have a relative chance of achieving economic growth and achieving growth in employment, which is the most important thing to me.  The one thing that Europe has been more successful at in the last 25 years is unemployment.  If we do not take unemployment into account and eliminate it as much as possible, we are facing social unrest at a level we have not seen before.  Educated people can become more uneasy than people with lesser education and they will not put up with Governments who will not provide the basic needs for them.  Employment in the most basic need that people have.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, who was here previous to him.  It is often said that economists are exponents of the so-called dismal science.  However, the recent OECD report on the Irish economy does not exactly make for dismal reading.  Having said that, there is no room for complacency as far as our economic performance is concerned.  I welcomed aspects of the Minister's speech this morning, especially where he said that the report recognises our achievements as the fastest growing economy in the European Union.  I come from the town of Letterkenny, which has been described over the last five or six years as the fastest growing town in Europe, so I have a double achievement when I read reports like the OECD report.  They are most welcome.</P>
      <P>According to the OECD's latest report, Ireland's economic growth rate this year will be the highest of any industrialised state.  The OECD has forecast GDP growth of 5.8 per cent this year and 5 per cent in 1996 compared to GDP growth of 3 per cent in the EU and 2.75 per cent in the OECD group of countries during a comparable period. As a result, demand in the Irish economy will grow further this year. This growth, combined with this year's budget changes in tax and social contributions, will translate into significant income growth.  In short, more people will have more money in their pockets and purses.  Against a backdrop of such good growth figures, it is only fair to compliment the Government's management of the economy over the last number of years.  Our sound fiscal management of the economy is now beginning to pay dividends for the people of this country, which is most welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject suggestions that our economy is overheated or that there is any evidence that there are inflationary pressures at work.  The OECD report is positive on this particular point.  Having said that, the Department of Finance and the other monetary institutions should be <Col N="230" /> watching for the slightest blip on the inflation graph.  I am fully confident that the Minister for Finance will take the necessary corrective action.  However, it is not necessary at this point in time.</P>
    <P>Good growth and a falling GDP-debt ratio are one thing, but if one is unemployed they mean little because one is outside the system.  Men and women without jobs will not benefit from increased growth in incomes because they have been marginalised and in many cases excluded.  One finds it annoying to see situations whereby young unemployed people, who are getting £52 per week on the dole, are refusing to go onto community employment schemes, which will net them something like £80 per week.  It is rather disappointing to see this kind of an attitude and I have come across it around the country on a number of occasions.  It is imperative that the Government concentrates on increasing job creation and employment.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that there is still a massive black economy in this country which has to be tackled.  We cannot close our eyes to people fiddling the system day in and day out.  We are losing millions of pounds because of it.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Lanigan in relation to our attitude to the Third World.  We see some of it at home also.  We have a situation where people seem to want more at the expense of others.  It is hard to have it both ways and these are areas we have to keep a strong eye on.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that the Labour Party is committed to ensuring that job creation will remain at the core of this Government's activity.  It is complete nonsense to talk about the economy doing well unless this extra wealth is shared among all people and more jobs are created so families can benefit from increased wealth.  Job creation is the central plank of Labour's economic philosophy.  I have no doubt that, come the next election, it is our achievements in relation to job creation that we in Government will be judged on.  Indeed, the OECD has forecast that unemployment <Col N="231" /> will fall to just below 14 per cent this year and to just over 13.5 per cent in 1996 and inflation is forecast at 2.5 per cent in 1995 and 3 per cent in 1996. These unemployment rates are still too high.  They are scandalous and must be brought down.  There is no acceptable level of unemployment either &mdash; we must create enough jobs to ensure that all those who wish to work have an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>In this context it is wrong for us to depend on the market to create jobs. Market forces are not sufficient to solve unemployment.  We in Donegal have been lucky in that a group like Fruit of the Loom International have come into that county and now see themselves as the fourth or fifth highest employer in this country.  The benefits that have accrued from Fruit of the Loom International providing 4,000 jobs in one county must not be ignored and must be commended.  The State must play a role in creating employment if we are to really confront the jobs crisis.  Many commentators in banks and stockbroking houses talk about the health of our economic fundamentals &mdash; low inflation, high growth and falling debt &mdash; but unless we radically reduce the level of unemployment, good economic fundamentals are of benefit to no one.</P>
    <P>I commend the members of the Government who went to Washington recently, including the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and Ministers of State. The work that they did there was extremely commendable and I have to comment on it.  They did not leave any stone unturned in their attempts to meet with the correct people in Washington, to see what the Government could do to possibly improve the situation in this country and I commend them for it.</P>
    <P>I am confident that over the next number of years the Government will ensure that high economic growth is turned into new jobs and extra wealth is generated.  One of the main ingredients of this process will be the National Development Plan, which will be a <Col N="232" /> major boost to the Irish economy as a whole.  However, the plan is of even more importance to economically developing areas around the country such as County Donegal and the northwest in general.  I have no doubt that the peace process has helped the situation.  We have seen a marked increase in tourism in both Northern Ireland and the Border counties due to the peace process.  It is important that we work on this and see that it lasts.</P>
    <P>Finally, the OECD report should undoubtedly be welcomed, but it should also remind the Government of the necessity for sound fiscal management while it pursues policies which improve Ireland's economic strength and, most importantly, create extra jobs.</P>

      <P>I will hardly need it either.  As the Minister has said, this is an opportunity for all of us to review the performance of Ireland in recent times and also to analyse the current fiscal strategy and the outlook for the future, based on the projections which are established in the budget and in the fiscal parameters.  There will be no disagreement that the OECD's analysis of the performance of the Irish economy in recent times is very positive.  It makes plain why it reached the conclusion that not only have we recorded the fastest expansion of any country in the European Union but that our fiscal policy in controlling budget expenditure, particularly current budget expenditure, and reducing the level of inflation is a key component in the achievement acknowledged. That clearly makes the point that it is essential to adhere to the same disciplines which brought about the <Col N="233" /> happy position in which we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>The key to this has been the control of current Government expenditure and the consequent reduction of the deficit, linked to the overall reduction in Government borrowing.  These three elements are interrelated.  I join with others, including the Minister, in acknowledging the role of the trade union movement, particularly the Congress of Trade Unions, and the disciplined, responsible and positive approach they adopted in a partnership programme with Government since 1987.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> were examples of disciplined, mature and courageous responsibility on the part of the trade union movement.  It enabled the Government in 1987 to set about laying a solid foundation on the basis of those commitments which, I am very glad to say, were fully honoured.  They were not just understandings; they were commitments.  After all, the trade unions would be under most pressure to seek what they would see in the normal course as justifiable increases in the public sector employment bill and in general terms.  However, they took a responsible, restrained approach and the result is there for all to see.</P>
      <P>Their priority was the generation of employment which could not be achieved without a favourable climate. The records show, as the Minister mentioned, a growth rate of 8 per cent in employment, which is about 86,000 extra jobs since 1987.  I was in Government for those negotiations and it is a tribute not just to Government foresight but to the responsibility of the trade union movement in helping us in partnership to achieve that desirable pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the periods when we had high inflation and patterns were very different. I had many discussions at European Council level, in Bremen and elsewhere in 1978, 1980 and 1981, with the then <Col N="234" /> Chancellor of the Federal Republic, Helmut Schmidt.  He always made the point that he based his economic policy on reaching agreement in advance with the trade union movement on a disciplined approach which would in turn react to their benefit.  That was the basis of the German economy under all Governments.  During the period of the Social Democratic Government and the alliance with the Free Democrats, they were able to maintain the consistent pattern of discipline and growth.  That is the pattern from which we have benefited in the analysis the OECD makes.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we must note a slight worry that we will not adhere to that discipline and pattern.  The first trend emerged in the economic expenditure arrangements of the Government when, at a time when inflation was running at about 3 per cent, there was a deliberate Government decision to increase Government spending, on the current side particularly, by 6 per cent. There was a 3 per cent differential between the inflation rate and Government expenditure, while in the years that brought about the success the OECD survey acknowledges, current Government spending was, if anything, below the level of inflation.  Apart from the problems it would cause in the economy itself, that is the wrong signal.</P>
    <P>There is no case for Government action increasing the pressure on those parameters, be it the rate of inflation or interest rates, which are directly linked, although, obviously, external factors will affect interest rates to a considerable extent.  From 1987 to 1989, when international trends and interest rates were running higher than in this economy, our small open economy was in a position to pin down its inflation and interest rates.  This was contrary to the adverse trend abroad.  It was very much in contrast with the position that obtained in the mid 1980s when the trend outside was benign, low interest rates and low inflation, while we were experiencing quite the opposite.  There is a clear message.  The discipline we impose on ourselves and consistency in <Col N="235" /> applying that discipline are most important rules and guidelines which we should continue to follow.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the Government's attitude to public expenditure, both in the allocations at the beginning of the year and more recently in the adjustments to Government public expenditure. The OECD makes reference to what they call a somewhat pro-cyclical stance on fiscal policy.  That is a euphemism for a lack of total and constant consistency.  The last thing we need is a cyclical stance.  We need a permanent, consistent and strong stance.  It must be noted that the comment was made before the expenditure allocations for this year were fully available.  The 1995 report is based on the 1994 performance. If it were to be written now, one would find a more vigorous comment on that pro-cyclical stance in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>If we are to draw any message from this, it would be to adhere to what was proven to be disciplined and correct, with all the beneficial consequences we experienced.  We should avoid any temptation, particularly on the Government side, to inject any inflationary element into the economy.  I agree with every Senator about the priority of jobs and opportunities for our young people, but the reality is that in order to achieve that, one must take other difficult decisions first.  Not every mother whose children are waiting for jobs will see the relevance of that.  Her first priority, and that of the young people themselves, would be to get a job as soon as possible. They will not necessarily appreciate the importance of fiscal discipline, but the truth of the matter is that one can never respond to their rightful demands for the dignity of work in their own place unless one adheres to those disciplines.  There are worrying trends and I would endorse the actions of a Minister for Finance who decided, even in midyear, that adjustments were necessary.  However, in the context of giving signals to the outside world, the OECD comment next year or the following <Col N="236" /> year on this move will be interesting.</P>
    <P>Within a short time of generating the extra public expenditure ourselves, it is necessary to come back and reduce the Estimates, rather than the actual out-turn, for public expenditure.  If that is not an example of what one might call a pro-cyclical stance of fiscal policy, I do not know what is an example.  Surely the Government which introduced the expenditure allocation at the beginning of the year knew at that time the impact its decisions would have on public expenditure.  Surely it knew then it was essential that whatever projections were made would be adhered to throughout the year since these would be seen externally and domestically as evidence of consistent effective management and control.  However, the opposite happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister understandably seems irked by what he calls media comment and right wing commentators.  This is the lot of most Ministers for Finance, but the Minister will accept that the views of commentators, whether they are economists or media personnel, are received in the world outside.  There is no point complaining about the interpretations of others who take an independent stance of the economic performance or economic discipline when it is within our hands to ensure there could be no cause for such complaint.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to go back through the records of comment, either by the media or independent commentators, from 1987-90.  He will not find any evidence of what he considers unfair and unwarranted criticism.  There was only one area of which there was constant unfair and unwarranted criticism regarding control and discipline.  It came from this House and the Minister's party in particular.  I was one of a number in the Dáil who were criticised for taking what were considered very stringent, unfair and unreasonable attitudes in terms of reducing public expenditure on the current side in the Department of Agriculture by obliging reductions in various expenses or commitments for <Col N="237" /> bodies such as ACOT and the Agricultural Institute.</P>
    <P>This was not easy and nobody has a greater awareness of the importance of agriculture to our economy than I. However, having achieved that, despite criticism from the Opposition but not from the trade union movement which was very responsible in its co-operation, we now find the numbers are almost the same as they were then, before I was able to bring about that rationalisation. For the first time farmers were prepared to pay for services being provided on the basis that a service worth getting is one worth paying for, as I put it to them. They eventually accepted this point.  No element in our community benefits more from low inflation and low interest rates than the primary production sector in agriculture.  This was the case I continually made to the farm organisations and they eventually accepted it.  They have reaped the benefits ever since. However, I am concerned about this area.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to acknowledge that we have much to learn from the manifesto days of employment through public sector injections.  This is not the basis on which an open economy such as ours can perform.  The risks of undermining the positive climate for growth must be on the mind of every Minister. However, it would be reasonably acceptable if the indications were not that the underlying trend in public expenditure may be well above 7 per cent at the end of the year.  How can one hope to maintain a low level of inflation, by which we are judged in terms of international competitiveness, while injecting public expenditure ourselves? Much is in the hands of Government, even in a small open economy, but I have serious reservations about Government action in relation to public expenditure at this stage.</P>
    <P>I endorse all the comments in the report with regard to education.  If we prioritise our investment in the added value of knowledge, for the benefit not just of the young people themselves but the overall economy in the future, the <Col N="238" /> objectives as outlined in the report will be achieved.  In itself it will generate not just employment but also effective competitiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank him for his earlier contribution, which I followed with interest.  The elusive document had surfaced by carrier pigeon, post or whatever on my desk when I returned to my office this morning.  However, I stand by my criticism that it is a little unreal to debate an issue without having the document before us.  Even taking the point about public expenditure into account, a good dinner in Tinakilly House for the Cabinet or senior Department officials would pay for this. Members of the Oireachtas should be circulated with matters if they are to debate them in any meaningful way.</P>
      <P>This is particularly so in the context of the Minister for Education spending several hundreds of thousands of pounds on the circulation around the country of her glossy document.  I stand by my criticism and I will not withdraw it.  It is difficult to analyse the document, given that we had such a limited time in which to read it in depth.  The conclusions were circulated yesterday evening at 4 p.m. and if the Minister's remarks about copyright are to be believed, I do not understand how the conclusions could be circulated by way of photocopies but the document itself could not be circulated in that way.</P>
      <P>Aspects of the report are worthy of self-congratulation from the point of view of how the economy has been managed over the past several years. However, it is not all rosy.  The central question is: who will benefit from the growth which is documented in the report?  It is orthodox economic theory that the unemployment level should fall by a corresponding proportional figure when there is growth of that particular dimension.  In other words, if growth increases by more than 1 per cent, unemployment should fall.  However, that connection does not exist.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's point.  However, that direct connection has not been very evident in our economy in recent years.  Why is this the case?  Aspects of the report point to why that connection is not there; this is to do with public expenditure and other related matters.  I endorse Senator O'Kennedy's point about public expenditure, although I do not have time to go into it in detail.</P>
      <P>The 17 per cent increase in public spending over the past two years is alluded to in the report.  The introduction states that, despite its good growth performance, the Irish economy continues to face high levels of public debt and unemployment.  It also states that buoyant tax revenues and the fall in debt interest payments kept the general Government deficit at about 2 per cent of GDP in 1994 and consequently there has been a significant decline in the debt to GDP ratio to 90 per cent.</P>
      <P>This is a long way from the Maastricht figure, but we accept we must go in the right direction and this is what we are doing.  The introduction goes on to state that tighter control on public expenditure appears to be necessary in order to sustain progress in reducing this ratio, as specified in the Maastricht Treaty, and to make room for a further reduction in the tax burden.  These points are elaborated on in the report.  I agree with some of the remarks made about education and there are substantial criticisms about this area.</P>
      <P>One disappointing aspect concerns agriculture, an area where things are not so rosy.  The impact of GATT and what it will do to us is covered in the report. Chapter 3 states:</P>
      <P>The GATT agreement should lead to a significant reshaping of the Irish economy moving it further away from an agricultural base towards industry.</P>
      <P>It continues, in words that are somewhat depressing if one is from a rural background:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> Although there may be a gain on the industrial side, this will not be the case for agriculture.</P>
    <P>It talks about what CAP reform has achieved and its effect on reducing output and prices.  It continues:</P>
    <P>The remaining changes from the reform of the CAP and the implementation of the GATT agreement that come into effect after 1995 may reduce agricultural output by some further 3 per cent, leading to a fall in agricultural employment of about 4,000 people and an expected fall of about 7 per cent in agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>There is not much in that to encourage people living in rural Ireland.  It is significant that when the survey looks at growth and discusses where it has originated, particularly in exports, it is seen to originate in the high tech sector. Nearly all of the growth that took place in exports was in the high tech sector. That is welcome.  It is good to see those companies locating here.  However, that indicates the vulnerability within the economy &mdash; our basic indigenous industries cannot flourish and grow.  That is a wide ranging and difficult issue but it must be addressed by this and successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I thank the Acting Chairman and Senator O'Kennedy for allowing me to make this brief intervention.  I would have liked to have discussed it in more detail but perhaps we might return to it on another day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> The OECD's perception of our economy is important for all of us and particularly for the Minister in his negotiations at European level.  I have confidence in the Minister's ability to conduct those negotiations.  However, one aspect of this issue concerns me.  It is terrible that the Minister is in shackles and that he is forced to do certain things that actually damage the country's economy. Speaking honestly and sincerely and without waving a political flag, I urge the Minister to stand his ground and do what is right for the country.  I have a gut feeling that he will do that.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are people in the Government who have other priorities and that is a matter of concern.  I could speak for an hour on this topic.  I was talking to somebody last night who advertised in the newspaper for a housekeeper. Over a period of four or five days nearly 20 people were interviewed. Not one of them was prepared to work legally.  All of them wanted to sign on for the dole and draw rent subsidy for their flats while working.  This practice has reached the stage where it is affecting the economy and its cost is a problem for the Minister.  Rent subsidy now costs this country £44.8 million.  Mortgage subsidy costs £54 million.  The cost of rent subsidy increased from £6.1 million in 1989 to £44.8 million in 1994.  I am not blaming the Minister for this but I am indicating my concern about it.</P>
    <P>If such trends are appearing in other areas such as social welfare, health or education and there is an element within the Government which wants to make political capital out of urging people not to pay water rates and other charges &mdash; in effect, saying that one is entitled to a free society &mdash; I sympathise with the Minister.  He is also expected to perform in the mainstream of the European economy.  The Minister has a tough job.  He has our understanding despite the fact that we are obliged to oppose where it is necessary in the interest of the country.  We must express ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must stand firm regardless of the political price he <Col N="242" /> might have to pay.  That is my honest conviction.  There is a serious situation and the Minister is carrying a heavy responsibility.  There are those who would want him to continue down the slippery slope of giving everything to all for free.  However, there is no end to that because it is contagious.  The taxpayer will never get relief and the job creation policies we would like to see implemented will be impossible.  It is a tragedy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the House for this debate.  I apologise for the difficulties we had.  We will address that in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to concentrate on a number of points.  The report is good but we have no reason to be complacent.  Senator Dardis and others have clearly pointed out that while our economy is growing, our expenditure is growing faster than our income.  That is simply not sustainable. However, a false impression is being created about two matters: first, that this Government's control of public expenditure is lax and is therefore out of control; and, second, there is an implicit suggestion in the criticism of Senator O'Kennedy and, to a lesser extent, of Senator Daly that the problem started in January this year.  That is not the case.  I will not discuss the history of Senator O'Kennedy's party. <Col N="243" /> When a chronic alcoholic gives up the booze and stays off it we should not remind him of the horrid days when he was drinking.  I welcome the conversion of Fianna Fáil and its abstinence from political alcoholism so I will not berate them.</P>
    <P>All of us can take some degree of credit for our current situation.  The question is: where do we go from here?  The real increase in public expenditure is not about increases in public pay <i>per se</i> but increases in numbers.  Numbers have been increasing since 1990 by an average of about 3,200 per annum.  That is not sustainable.  How do we respond to this?  We must find ways in the public sector &mdash; and I invite Senators from all sides of the House to engage in this debate &mdash; of doing more with less in exactly the same way as has been achieved in the private sector.  How do we increase the productivity of teachers, civil servants, gardaí, nurses and others? It requires change and the embracing of change.  It is a painful exercise.  People in the private sector who have done this have survived.  The people who did not do it are now unemployed workers for companies that have gone into liquidation. That is the major challenge implicit in this report.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to say, as did Senator Lanigan, that public expenditure is out of kilter.  I wish to refer to two points. Our type of agriculture has serious problems.  However, I am sure the Progressive Democrats, of all parties, do not want us to return to the gross distortions of a market economy which the Common Agricultural Policy was.  There are other ways of addressing that issue but they are not without pain.  The numbers, regrettably, are likely to follow the trend in Denmark, Britain and other European countries, excluding the continental countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The report gives some attention to education.  All independent studies clearly show that there is a strong correlation between education and employment.  They do not say that people who graduate obtain the jobs they want or which are as well paid as they would like.  There is a clear correlation between a leaving certificate qualification and employment prospects. People without such a qualification are seriously disadvantaged.  In 1980, 60 per cent of school pupils completed the leaving certificate.  In 1994, the figure was 79 per cent and it is our intention to increase it to 90 per cent by the end of the decade.</P>
      <P>This will address the problems of those entering the labour market but will not address the problem of people in it with poor qualifications and we will have to deal with this.  We should come back to consider the analysis of FÁS and the relationship between it, the employment market and education and training.  I agree with Senator Lanigan that there is a need for an additional study in this regard.</P>
      <P>I recognise the unique wisdom, skill and experience of Donegal Senators and the people of that county when it comes to the operation of the black economy.  I suspect there is no county better fitted to give lessons on how that economy works.  Employment cannot be found for people in many cases in Letterkenny and County Donegal.  There is possibly full employment in Donegal in one sense.  Yet, official statistics demonstrate that unemployment there is high. The vigour and health of the Donegal team is denied by the fact that the proportion of people in Donegal with medical cards is 50 per cent higher than elsewhere. There is a clear mismatch between the economic performance of Donegal and official statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Maloney is absolutely right. We have our cultural attitude to the black economy.  There are approximately 80,000 people employed in the construction industry.  Only 19,000 of them are in the Construction Industry Federation's pension scheme.  The <Col N="245" /> unemployment sector and the general support system about which the Senator spoke are ripped off by the black economy to an enormous degree and we must change our attitude.</P>
    <P>Every 1,000 people on the live register cost the taxpayer £3.4 million a year. The savings which would result from taking 10,000 people off the register are potentially enormous.  I am not talking about taking people who cannot get jobs off the register but about people who are working and drawing unemployment assistance at the same time.  It is partly because of these problems that we are not getting the kick-in effect to structural unemployment which we should.</P>
    <P>The report is good, we have made progress, but we still have a long way to go.  This Government is committed in its programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, and I am committed, as Minister for Finance, to suffer the political pain in ensuring we meet the target of a real increase in spending of no more than 2 per cent next year and no more than 2 per cent in 1997.  This will be an achievement from which all of us will benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Investment Intermediaries Bill is the latest in a long series of legislation required by the rapidly changing nature of the financial services industry.  The Seanad recently considered the Stock Exchange Bill, now enacted as the Stock Exchange Act, 1995.  This Bill has much in common with that Act, so Senators will already be familiar with many of the Bill's provisions.</P>
      <P>The Investment Intermediaries Bill reflects the need to provide regulatory structures to keep pace with developments in financial markets as well as with developments in European law.  It provides for the implementation, in respect of non-Stock Exchange firms, of two closely related EU directives, the Investment Services Directive and the Capital Adequacy Directive.  These directives require particular standards of regulation for investment firms, which are defined as firms providing a range of services in relation to transferable securities.  Transferable securities include the whole gamut of financial instruments traded on capital markets, from ordinary stocks and shares to the more exotic financial instruments known as derivatives.</P>
      <P>Implementing the Investment Services Directive is very important.  That directive will allow investment firms based in Ireland to have the benefit of a single passport to operate in the European Union.  In other words, once such firms have satisfied the Irish authorities that they are fit to do investment business, they will be able to operate in other EU member states without having to seek a separate authorisation.  The Investment Services Directive requires that firms trading in a member state other than their home member state will have to abide by local code-of-conduct rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish financial system is modern and sophisticated.  The handling of huge sums of money and complex financial instruments is a daily activity for many participants in that system.  State-of-the-art information technology and skilled <Col N="247" /> personnel allow firms in Ireland to market their services around the world.  We must ensure that the reputation of Ireland as a centre for financial services is maintained and enhanced.  To do so, it is essential that we put in place a modern regulatory system which meets European standards.  Moreover, we must go further than merely meeting the requirements of the relevant EU directives. This is because there are gaps which must be filled in our domestic system of regulation, in areas which are not within the scope of these directives.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this Bill provides a regulatory framework for a wide range of investment businesses, including not just firms covered by the directives, but also firms in the investment area which are not covered by them.  For example, investment intermediaries which act primarily as conduits for business to larger financial institutions but which do not generally have any discretion in the management of clients' funds, are not covered by the directives but are dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deposit agents and deposit brokers who act on behalf of credit institutions will also be dealt with by the Bill.  In addition, firms which have discretion over client investments and which therefore act as managers of clients' investment portfolios will also be regulated under the Bill.  So will firms which only give investment advice and do not actually involve themselves in carrying out transactions for clients at all.  I should mention that the Bill has been the subject of consultation with a wide range of interested bodies.  These include the European Monetary Institute, which has provided a formal opinion indicating that it has no difficulties with the Bill. Copies of the institute's opinion are available.</P>
    <P>The Bill nominates two key regulators, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Central Bank.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment is already the regulator for the insurance industry and many of the firms dealt with in the Bill will already <Col N="248" /> be doing business as insurance intermediaries under the Insurance Act, 1989.  The Central Bank is the other key regulator: it already regulates the vast bulk of Irish credit institutions as well as a range of other financial undertakings.</P>
    <P>I now turn to a description of the basic structure of the Bill.  Two main categories of firms are to be regulated by the Bill.  They are not mutually exclusive &mdash; there will be some overlap. The two categories are investment product intermediaries and other investment business firms.  Investment product intermediaries are firms which, for example, take and transmit orders for unit trusts to a unit trust provider, or orders for shares to a stockbroker or bank, or orders for prize bonds to the Prize Bonds Company, or which act as deposit brokers, for example, arranging for a client to make a deposit with a bank, or as deposit agent.  In this instance the key example is the building society agent, prominent in many smaller towns, who acts almost as a <i>de facto</i> branch of a building society.  Some solicitors and accountants will also fall into the category of investment product intermediaries.</P>
    <P>All investment product intermediaries will be covered by what I will refer to as the &ldquo;written appointments regime&rdquo;, in other words, each will require a written appointment from any institution to whom it passes orders. The written appointment means that where an intermediary takes funds on behalf of an institution, the payment will be treated as having been made to the institution.  This is an important protection for clients.  The client must be in a position to show that a payment was made, and for that reason it will be an offence for an intermediary to fail to give a receipt for a payment.</P>
    <P>Before an institution gives a written appointment to an intermediary, it must take steps to ensure that the intermediary is an appropriate person for such an appointment.  The institution must, therefore, ensure that the intermediary is a member of an appropriate representative body with rules which require <Col N="249" /> compliance with the Bill or is regulated by an approved professional body, or that the intermediary has an authorisation from and is regulated for investment business by one of the two supervisory authorities under the Bill, the Central Bank or the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  If the intermediary is not in any of these categories, then the institution giving it a written appointment must itself ensure that the intermediary is of good character and complies with the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The investment industry very recently raised a concern about the unlimited liability in section 28(4) on institutions to honour payments made by clients to an intermediary they have appointed. As I have already indicated in the Dáil, the Bill will not be implemented all at once.  It was always the intention that a number of sections of the Bill, including the written appointments regime in Part IV, would not come into effect for some time.  This delay is unavoidable because it will take some time, for example, for intermediaries to arrange written appointments for the institutions on whose behalf they are acting.</P>
    <P>While this is taking place, the Department of Finance will be exploring the difficulty raised by the industry with the relevant industry groups in the context of discussion on an overall system of compensation for clients of investment firms.  Such discussion would have taken place at an early stage in any event, because the EU Investor Compensation Directive is nearing completion in Brussels and will have to be transposed into Irish law by means of a separate Bill.</P>
    <P>If it is decided that an amendment of section 28(4) is appropriate, it will be included in that Bill and section 28(4) will not be brought into effect until a decision on that issue has been made. That Bill will take cognisance of the compensations provisions in the EU directive and will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  The Government's objective will naturally be to provide appropriate protection for <Col N="250" /> investors in the context of a competitive financial sector.</P>
    <P>The basic rule of the Bill is that all firms covered by the Bill must have an authorisation from the Central Bank or the Department of Enterprise and Employment to do investment business. However, where a firm does not provide any investment services other than the services of an investment product intermediary, and where it does not handle client funds other than when acting as a deposit agent or exercise any discretionary powers over clients' investment portfolios, it is called a restricted activity investment product intermediary. In view of the restricted nature of its business, such an intermediary will be allowed to operate without an authorisation from a supervisory authority provided it has a written appointment. It will, naturally, be subject to rules and codes of practice.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment will, of course, have various powers to make rules for, and carry out inspections of, restricted activity product investment intermediaries.</P>
    <P>There is a small category of firms not far removed from the restricted intermediary type, which has a small amount of discretion in respect of switching clients' portfolios from one investment product to another with the same institution. While these firms would not handle clients, cash, they will nonetheless have to get an authorisation from the Department of Enterprise and Employment to carry on their business, and will be subject to ongoing regulation by that Department.</P>
    <P>All other investment business firms will come within the remit of the Central Bank, either directly or indirectly. The indirect sort includes accountants who are members of professional bodies and who do investment business only in an incidental way.  These may be exempted from the requirement to be authorised and regulated directly by the Central Bank, provided their professional body has been approved by the Central Bank.  In this case the professional body regulates the accountant, <Col N="251" /> and the Central Bank overseas the regulatory system of the professional body. I emphasise, however, that this system will only apply where the investment business being done by the accountant is incidental to his or her normal professional practice as an accountant.  It will not apply where an accountant is heavily involved in investment business.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, all investment business firms must be regulated directly by the Central Bank.  This means that they must get an authorisation from the bank to enable them to operate and that the bank will monitor and supervise them on an ongoing basis.  This category will include the fund management firms operating in the Irish market and the IFSC, for example, those providing fund management services to large corporate clients.  However, the directly regulated category will also include small businesses or individuals who, on a professional basis, provide investment services to clients where they have control or discretion over client funds.</P>
    <P>I have set out the categories of firms which are included in the Bill.  I now wish to mention certain types of firm which are exempt from the definition of investment business firm and, therefore, from most aspects of the Bill, though not necessarily from the requirement to hold a written appointment if acting as an investment product intermediary. These exemptions are mostly for technical reasons.  They include the bodies charged with the management of public debt, the Minister for Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency and An Post, but only when the latter is acting on behalf of the State.  Banks, insurance undertakings and certain collective investments, and member firms of stock exchanges, are also excluded from the definition of investment business firm; these are already catered for under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Solicitors are covered by the Bill in the same way as any other investment firm if they do investment business in a manner other than incidental to their legal activities.  However, they are <Col N="252" /> excluded from the definition of investment business firm if they carry on investment activities only on an incidental basis in the course of their profession. The reason for this is that the Law Society is already operating a substantial regulatory system under the Solicitors Acts, including the recent Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.  That system is also backed up by a compensation scheme and by appropriate professional indemnity protection.  In these circumstances it was not considered necessary to include solicitors doing incidental business under the definition of investment business firm.</P>
    <P>The Law Society can be expected to continue to maintain an appropriate standard of protection of solicitors' clients, but if the Minister for Finance were to come to the view that the Law Society was not performing its functions adequately, the Bill provides that the Minister may, by regulation and after appropriate consultation, bring solicitors doing incidental business within the definition of investment business firm.</P>
    <P>One final thing the Bill will do is to extend the definition of investment company within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1990, to include closed ended investment companies.  These are a type of collective investment fund. The effect of the change will be to bring such companies within the regulatory scope of the Central Bank, which already regulates other collective investments.</P>
    <P>I now move on to a more detailed description of some key provisions of the Bill.  Part I contains standard provisions about commencement, definitions and expenses.  Section 2 sets out the definitions used in the Bill and is especially important because in so doing it effectively defines the scope of the Bill.  &ldquo;Investment business firm&rdquo; is defined as a person providing investment advice or certain investment business services to a third party on a professional basis.  &ldquo;Investment business services&rdquo; include a number of services provided with regard to investment instruments.  The term &ldquo;investment <Col N="253" /> instruments&rdquo; is defined to cover the range of securities and derivative instruments traded on domestic and international financial markets.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with authorisation of investment business firms and related matters.  Under section 9, it will be an offence for a firm to act as an investment business firm, or to claim to be one, unless it is authorised to do so by a supervisory authority in Ireland or by a competent authority in another member state, or unless its activities are such that the Bill allows them to be carried on without such an authorisation.  A foreign firm which has neither a branch nor a subsidiary in Ireland may carry on investment business with Irish companies and institutions without an authorisation from the Irish authorities. However, such a firm providing investment business services or investment advice to Irish individuals, that is, other than investment professionals, will be regarded as operating in Ireland and will have to have an authorisation from the Irish authorities or from a competent authority elsewhere in the EU.</P>
    <P>Section 10 sets out the conditions which must be met by firms seeking an authorisation.  An authorisation under this Bill can be subject to conditions laid down by the supervisory authority, and the supervisory authorities will have various powers to issue conditions or requirements or make directions in respect of investment business firms.</P>
    <P>Section 12 makes provision for Irish based investment business firms to operate in other EU countries on the basis of their Irish authorisations while section 13 makes transitional arrangements for firms already operating as investment business firms, giving them time to arrange the necessary authorisations, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 16 allows a supervisory authority itself to revoke the authorisation of an investment business firm in limited, technical circumstances.  More importantly, a supervisory authority may apply to the High Court for an order revoking the authorisation of a firm if the firm has acted in a manner <Col N="254" /> which it is felt should disqualify it from doing investment business.  This will allow the court to disqualify firms which can no longer be regarded as being fit and proper to be involved in investment activities.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with various aspects of the regulation and supervision of investment business firms. Section 20 sets out the general principles for such regulation.  It provides that the supervisory authorities will administer the system of regulation and supervision of investment business firms in the interests of investor protection, the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of investment business firms and that of financial markets and subject to any guidelines which may be issued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 21 equips the supervisory authorities with a general authority to issue directions to investment business firms and their directors and management in the interests of proper and orderly regulation of investment business firms or the protection of investors. In certain circumstances these directions can extend as far as a direction that an investment business firm should cease trading.  There is, of course, provision for appeal to the High Court. Section 22 enables a supervisory authority to apply to the court for an order to wind up an investment business firm if it believes, for example, that the firm is or is likely to become unable to meet its obligations to its clients or creditors.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 and 24 make various provisions for restrictions in advertising.  It will be an offence to advertise investment business services where the provision of such services would be an offence.  Senators will realise, of course, that powers on advertising are an important aspect of the regulation of the activities of investment business firms.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the written appointment regime applicable to investment product intermediaries.  As mentioned earlier, this type of firm is engaged either in part or solely in a more limited form of investment, consisting mainly of passing customers' <Col N="255" /> orders to larger financial institutions; the definition is set out in section 25.</P>
    <P>A restricted activity investment product intermediary, defined in section 26, may do business without a specific authorisation from a supervisory authority because it is not generally allowed to take clients' cash or to have discretionary power over clients funds.  I have already dealt with the position of clients of firms operating under the written appointments regime and these are detailed in Part IV.</P>
    <P>Part V makes various provisions in relation to auditors of investment business firms in line with the corresponding provisions in the Stock Exchange Act. Among other things, this Part obliges the auditor of an authorised investment business firm to report to the supervisory authority if he or she has reason to believe that there are circumstances which affect the investment business firm's ability to meet its financial obligations or that there are defects in its accounting systems or records or in its safeguards for client money or investment instruments.  The auditor must also report to the supervisory authority if he or she has reason to believe that the investment business firm has breached the rules of any approved professional body of which it is a member.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with probity and the competence of persons involved in investment business firms, with codes of conduct and provisions for regulating acquisition of significant shareholdings in investment firms, as well as with bonding for investment business firms and the protection of clients' money.</P>
    <P>Section 36 contains provisions relating to disqualification from employment. Where, on application by a supervisory authority, the High Court finds that a person is not suitable on grounds of probity to be an officer or employee of an investment business firm, it may direct the employer to dismiss that person. Where the court finds that a person is incompetent, it may direct that the person concerned be removed from a particular position, suspended or dismissed. <Col N="256" /> These substantial powers mirror provisions in the Stock Exchange Act.</P>
    <P>Section 37 sets out the broad parameters for codes of conduct which will govern how investment business firms do business with their clients.  Codes of conduct will be drawn up by the supervisory authorities.  The supervisory authorities may then require that investment business firms follow these codes of conduct. Codes of conduct will cover such issues as ensuring that firms deal honestly and fairly with clients, act with due skill and care, have adequate resources, seek enough information from clients to ensure that they provide appropriate advice or services and make adequate disclosure of relevant information to clients.</P>
    <P>Sections 38 to 48 enable a supervisory authority to prevent undue or excessive influence being gained over an investment business firm by a person acquiring a significant shareholding.  These provisions meet the requirements of the investment services directive in this regard.</P>
    <P>Sections 50 and 51 deal with information about compensation and with bonding.  While the Bill does contain a significant compensation provision, it does not provide for a comprehensive compensation scheme across all investment business firms.  A draft investor compensation directive is nearing finalisation at EU level.  The Department of Finance will be consulting industry interests about legislation for it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have already explained the protection available for clients under the written appointment regime.  In addition, section 50 provides that an investment business firm must inform a client of the details of any investor compensation scheme.  Section 51 then provides for a bonding arrangement for investment business firms on the model of the bonding arrangements which apply for insurance intermediaries.  However, the minimum bond will be higher than that which applies at present in the insurance area &mdash; £50,000 rather than £25,000.  The Minister may prescribe exemptions <Col N="257" /> from the bonding requirement where an appropriate compensation scheme exists or is set up or where a firm has a high level of capitalisation.</P>
    <P>Section 52 deals with an important matter, the protection of client money and investment instruments.  The section empowers the supervisory authorities to impose requirements on investment business firms in respect of their rights, duties and responsibilities regarding the treatment of clients' money and instruments. This section also creates offences for failing to keep proper books and records on clients' money or failing to have them audited regularly.  A failure to keep client money in a properly designated account will also be an offence. It will, of course, be an offence for a firm to misappropriate client funds.</P>
    <P>An important protection for clients is that in the event of insolvency of a firm, no liquidator, receiver, examiner or creditor of an investment firm will have any right of access to clients' money or investment instruments until the proper claims of clients have been satisfied in full.</P>
    <P>Section 53 provides for an exemption from liability for the supervisory authorities unless they act in bad faith and for a disclaimer of warranty in respect of their approval of professional bodies or authorisation of investment business firms.  Under section 54, where an investment business firm is unable to pay its debts and its failure to keep proper books and records or to comply with client money obligations has contributed to its insolvency, an officer of the firm may be held personally liable for the firm's debts on a direction of the court.  In addition, a director who fails to take reasonable steps to ensure his firm's compliance with obligations regarding client money or books and records will be guilty of a criminal offence.  Such a director, however, may not be jailed unless the court believes that he or she acted wilfully.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, accountants doing investment business will be covered by the Bill in the same way as <Col N="258" /> other investment business firms, unless any investment business they do is incidental to their professional practice. Part VII of the Bill, which deals with approved professional bodies, is relevant only to this incidental business.  It provides that the supervisory authority may grant approval, subject to conditions or otherwise, to a professional body of accountants to operate as an approved professional body.  Such a body may then regulate its members in respect of investment business which is incidental to their professional activities. The members may then do such incidental investment business without a specific authorisation from a supervisory authority.  Solicitors doing incidental investment business will not be affected by this provision.  As I have already explained, such solicitors will not be treated as investment business firms for the purposes of the Bill unless the Minister for Finance prescribes otherwise.</P>
    <P>Under section 56, professional bodies must apply to the Central Bank for approval to operate as an approved professional body and the section sets out the conditions they must meet to get such approval.  Section 58 gives the bank powers to impose conditions and requirements on approved professional bodies in the interests of their orderly regulation.  Provision is also made in section 61 for the revocation of approval.  Except in certain purely technical circumstances, such revocation will be a matter for the High Court.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill deals with inspections, offences and penalties.  This Part of the Bill is closely based on the Stock Exchange Bill.  Section 64 and section 65 deal with the powers of authorised officers appointed by supervisory authorities to inspect investment business firms.  These officers will be empowered, for example, to enter premises, inspect documents and to require explanations of documents.  This section also provides that a supervisory authority may require an investment business firm to supply specified information to it.</P>
    <P>Section 66 to section 72 provide for the High Court, on the application of a <Col N="259" /> supervisory authority, to appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of an investment business firm.  An inspector appointed by the court will have wide-ranging powers of investigation, including, for example, powers to examine people on oath.  The High Court may publish, with or without omissions, the report of an inspector appointed by it. A court inspector's report will be sent in full to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who may decide to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. On receipt of an inspector's report, the court may make an order for winding up of the firm concerned or remedying damage done to any person by its conduct of its affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 73 provides for the appointment of an inspector by a supervisory authority to investigate particular matters relating to an investment business firm, including their compliance with any requirements of this or any other Act.  The bank may publish, in whole or in part, the report of an inspector appointed by it, and must forward any such report in full to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who again may decide to lay it before the Oireachtas. The supervisory authority may, on foot of a report, present a petition for a firm to be wound up.</P>
    <P>Section 74 enables a supervisory authority to set up a committee to determine whether there has been a breach by an investment business firm or professional body of conditions or requirements imposed by the supervisory authority. Such a committee will have three members, drawn from a panel of seven to be nominated by the Minister of Finance with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  If it finds there has been a breach, the committee may issue a reprimand or require payment of up to £500,000 by the relevant firm or professional body to the supervisory authority.  It should be noted that this mechanism will only apply where the firm agrees.  A firm may <Col N="260" /> appeal the determination of a committee to the High Court.  Where an investment business firm or professional body does not want the matter settled by a committee, the supervisory authority may apply to the court to make a determination instead.  Detailed provisions relating to committees appointed under section 74 are contained in the Second Schedule.  Such committees offer a mechanism whereby breaches of conditions and requirements imposed by a supervisory authority can be speedily determined without the expense of a High Court hearing.</P>
    <P>Section 75 and section 76 provide for an application for a search and seizure warrant by an authorised officer and for the admissibility of an inspector's report as evidence in civil proceedings.  Section 77 and section 78 provide for legal professional privilege and for confidentiality of documents.  Section 79 sets out the penalties for offences committed under the Act.  The maximum penalty will be £1 million or ten years' imprisonment, or both.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill consists of section 80 only and deals with the amendment of the Companies Act, 1990, which I have described earlier.  The effect will be to make the Central Bank the regulator of collective investment schemes structured as closed-ended companies.</P>
    <P>The aim of this Bill is to ensure that the activities of investment intermediaries are made subject to appropriate regulation by the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment and that these supervisory authorities will be equipped with the necessary powers to enable them to make regulation of intermediaries effective. Of course, no one can guarantee that there will never again be a rogue intermediary and the buyer must always beware.  However, the introduction of a proper system of regulation is obviously good for investors; equally, it is also good for honest and law abiding investment intermediaries.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad and I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions. I would like to point out that <Col N="261" /> a correction to the Bill is required.  On page 15, line 34 to line 35, a reference is made to &ldquo;the Solicitors Acts, 1954 to 1995&rdquo;.  The correct reference should read &ldquo;the Solicitors Act, 1954 to 1994&rdquo;. I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to direct the Clerk of the Seanad to make the correction under Standing Order No. 100.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order No. 100, I will direct the Clerk to make the correction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill.  I understand that it passed all Stages in the Dáil without amendment.  No amendments have been tabled in this House.</P>
      <P>This is a very important Bill because it deals with people's money.  The issue of investment intermediaries has been a problem for ordinary people who have lost money.  It has been a subject of scandal in almost every country in the world where people have lost money through fraudulent or negligent business intermediaries.  I am disappointed by the poor attendance of Members from certain parties.  It is not good enough that some parties do not have a representative present for this debate. Perhaps that shows that they are not interested in what is a very important&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not relevant to the Bill.  I ask the Senator to confine his remarks to the Second Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  This is a very important Bill which deals with a very complex area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if we are in danger of becoming overregulated? It is a complex area, some of the instruments are complex.  This will obviously be an enormous burden, not only on the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Central Bank, but on those firms involved.  Is the Minister satisfied that the burden of compliance with these regulations is not too <Col N="262" /> heavy?  I believe that one of the problems with commerce in the developed world is that it is becoming overburdened with paperwork, regulations, etc. The Minister did not address the issue of who will pay for these regulations. Will it be the business intermediary firms, the consumer who buys products or the taxpayer?  The question of cost is one that the Minister did not address. He might do so in his closing remarks.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the question of the division of responsibility between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Central Bank.  Under the Stock Exchange Act, the Central Bank is the regulatory authority for the Stock Exchange.  In this Bill, however, regulatory responsibility is being divided between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Central Bank. What is the rationale for dividing the responsibility?  Would it not be more appropriate that the Central Bank, given its responsibility under the Stock Exchange Act, should also be responsible for all aspects of business investment intermediaries?  I suggest that it would be more appropriate.  It would also create a little more distance between the Department and the Central Bank, which would be responsible for monitoring and supervision.  If that system broke down, the Department and the Minister for Finance could oversee the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to be welcomed in general terms.  To quote a very famous Irishman &ldquo;Property has its duties as well as its rights&rdquo;.  Anyone dealing with other people's funds, be they private individuals or companies, has a responsibility to be honest, competent and accountable. In so far as this Bill seeks to put into legislative form those types of responsibilities and standards, then it is to be applauded.</P>
    <P>I do not necessarily agree with the exclusion from the scope of this regulation of members of the Stock Exchange.  The Minister will recall that the provisions of the Stock Exchange Act do not appear to place as heavy an onus in terms of codes of conduct on <Col N="263" /> members of the Stock Exchange as is being placed by this Bill on business intermediaries.</P>
    <P>It is pointed out at great length in the Bill that codes of conduct will apply and that people who are supervised and who have been granted the power of authorisation will have to comply with those codes of conduct.  Yet, we exclude members of the Stock Exchange.  I think the Minister would agree that there have been many occasions when members of the Stock Exchange have not lived up to the expectations that would be required of them by a code of conduct.  Only a few weeks ago we debated the Stock Exchange Bill, which does not force the same type of code of conduct upon members of the Stock Exchange.  That is an anomaly which the Minister should examine.</P>
    <P>A business intermediary authorised in another member state of the European Union can now set up here, but it does not appear from this Bill that they will be subject to the same type of inspection and monitoring by the Irish supervisory authority.  In other words, it seems that we are going to take on face value the authority or licence they receive from another member state. Again I have to ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>And it goes both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes both ways, but is the Minister satisfied that the supervisory bodies of each member state will apply the same ethical standards of compliance that we would expect?  For example, the Minister will be aware as a matter of common knowledge that supervisory bodies in several European Union states have had question marks thrown over them by scandals.  So, what steps will the Minister take to satisfy himself in this regard?  What measures will the Central Bank and the Stock Exchange take to satisfy themselves that when a firm comes here from another member state of the European Union it will comply with the same standards that are expected of Irish firms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> Ireland has an excellent reputation as a member of the European Union and is, by and large, overzealous and extraordinarily honest when it comes to European Union dealings.  Is it fair to overburden Irish firms like this?  If the Minister looks closely at the Bill he will see that monitoring of such firms by the Irish supervisory authority will be considerably less than for firms which get their licences from the Irish supervisory authority in the first place.</P>
    <P>A smaller question is the exclusion of solicitors from the rigours of this Bill.  Is the Minister satisfied that some solicitors will not use this exclusion to their benefit?  He introduced the concept of incidental trading or business activity, but who is going to monitor that?  Who is going to say whether or not a firm of solicitors is carrying on investment activity in an incidental way?  Is it going to be the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Central Bank or the Law Society and how is that monitoring going to be done?  Will every or any firm be examined?  Will it be done by self-assessment? These are questions that are not answered in this Bill and have not been alluded to in the Minister's speech, so perhaps in his reply he might assist in that regard.</P>
    <P>This legislation is long overdue.  In the past the bad news about such firms has only been revealed when, all of a sudden, a notice appeared on a door, a scandal emerged and people's life savings were wiped out.  Insofar as this Bill seeks to do away with that, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The power to grant or revoke authorisation is the key to this Bill.  I am glad to see that there is a similar feature in the Stock Exchange Act whereby firms will have a period of time within which to get their licences.  It can be difficult for firms that have been living in an unregulated environment to suddenly enter a regulated one.  The Minister should ensure that his Department's officials are sympathetic and helpful to such firms.  Many people earn their livelihood from this activity in an honest and competent way and it may be diffiassessment <Col N="265" /> cult for some such firms to come in from the cold and enter this type of overly-bureaucratic and difficult area of regulation.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the Bill with which we would all agree &mdash; the protection of investors, the register of investment firms, the winding up power of the court and restrictions on advertising. A code of conduct should be drawn up for advertising because many aspects of advertising in the financial services sector can be misleading.  The Minister should address that issue.</P>
    <P>The control of auditors is important, as is the code of conduct for employed persons and, in addition, the bonding requirement is absolutely essential.  The personal liability of officers, which is in line with the Companies Act, is to be welcomed as is the appointment of inspectors.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the point of being over bureaucratic and over regulatory, I am slightly critical of one aspect of the Bill.  There is a requirement that when a business investment firm is seeking a licence it must satisfy the supervisory authority as to the organisational structure and management skills of the proposed investment business firm and that adequate levels of staff and expertise will be employed to carry out its proposed activities.  Is that type of thing really necessary?  Has a firm really got to prove that it is up to the job and can do it?  That could have the effect of stopping many people from entering the market place as investment intermediaries. Perhaps some people cannot prove themselves in advance, but they can prove themselves through their track record.  Is there a case to be made in relation to this particular requirement? It might be waived for people who are entering the business for the first time so that they could show, after a year's activity and having said they would be able to do it, how they achieved this.  It really is over-regulatory to say they must prove they can do the job in the first place, not only from the bonding or the capital ratio point of view &mdash; all of <Col N="266" /> those are absolutely important for protection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 10(5)(f).  It is overly bureaucratic and the Minister might look again at it.</P>
      <P>In general, the Fianna Fáil Party is happy to welcome the Bill because it brings consumer protection to an area where it has not been available, that is, business investment, the purchase of shares, units derivatives and so on.  It is another example of Ireland being spurred into action by our membership of the European Union.  The question arises &mdash; as in so many other areas of legislation &mdash; why we or the EU did not act before now because these provisions will be far too late to help many people &mdash; but, it is better late than never.  The legislation is generally to be welcomed and we can address the Bill section by section later.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I thank the Minister and his officials for what is a long and technical Bill.  It must have taken a long time to prepare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It has been long promised and is long overdue. It is a long time since the warning lights began flashing.  Investment firms have collapsed leaving many people bereft of their life savings, without any remedy or anybody to act as their intermediaries or on their behalf.  Of course, some acted with disastrous consequences.  The reality is that we must have a proper regulatory framework.</P>
      <P>I compliment the officials in the various Departments who contributed to the drafting of this technical Bill.  It is a long, drawn out tedious Bill and it must have taken many hours of technical advice to put it together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise it is very difficult to draft legislation which will protect the public and the investor from all types of misappropriations. The complaints bodies and the professional firms will have no problem <Col N="267" /> with the Bill.  It is only the fly-by-night operators who set up with the intention of misappropriating clients' funds who will get into difficulty with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in that it gives the State more direct control over the operations of investment intermediaries.  No supervisory body, at whatever level, will be able to supervise every investment body because an investigator would be needed every day of the week.  I welcome the fact that the Bill gives some of the professional bodies the job of regulating the activities of their own profession, such as accountants.  I also welcome the hands off approach at that level; it is about the best one can do.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes a considerable onus on auditors whose function it is to police the accounts of solicitors.  The reality is that if a rogue operator wants to mislead his auditor or hide from him clients funds, no auditor in the world would be able to discover them.  The Department of Finance has consulted a wide range of interested bodies on the Bill, which was a long time in gestation.  It will take us some considerable distance in regulating an activity which is growing every day of the week.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Government does not make itself the guarantor of investment intermediaries in the long run &mdash; and Senator Mulcahy referred to this.  The Minister should say who is going to carry the can.  I hope the taxpayer will not have to bail out those who defraud people of their life savings.</P>
    <P>The legal profession has also had its fair share of disasters but it has its own system for compensating solicitors' clients.  The Bill will regulate a wide range of firms from the smallest investment intermediary to the fund management arms of large financial institutions. There has been no similar regulatory system in the past, so the Bill is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that there are likely to be substantial numbers of bodies regulated by the Bill.  There are over 500 building society agents who <Col N="268" /> would be deposit agents for the purposes of the Bill.  Most of these would fall within the restricted activity investment intermediary category.  There are also about 2,700 insurance brokers and insurance agents, apart from tied insurance agents, so we can see this is an important Bill.  It is not, therefore, before its time coming into the House.</P>
    <P>We all have an interest in seeing that the fly-by-nights and the rogues are put out of business and that a system is put in place.  The Bill addresses most of these issues.  I hope it puts an end to the disasters and misery that have been endured by people who have lost their life savings or every single penny they had saved over a long time, to rogues.  I hope the Bill will address most of those issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that the basic rule of the Bill is that all firms covered by the Bill must have an authorisation from the Central Bank or the Department of Enterprise and Employment to undertake investment business. Can he give examples of companies that are classified as &ldquo;restricted activity investment product intermediaries&rdquo;?  I do not think any examples are given. These people and companies can operate without an authorisation from supervisory authorities and I would like the Minister to give a few examples in that area.</P>
    <P>In section 73 and 74, the Bill lays down the rules, the fines and the mechanism for setting up the board and this is welcome.  It also makes provision for the Central Bank to publish a report of an inspector it appoints.  It forwards it to the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who, in turn, can decide to lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That too is welcome.  When it is brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas the public can find out what has happened, and if there have been shenanigans, as happened in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It will go a long way towards sorting out the many serious problems that have arisen in <Col N="269" /> relation to rogue operators and it will deal with them in the long run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the comments made and welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is the first opportunity I have had to meet him in his official capacity and I wish him well in his recently appointed brief.</P>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome this legislation.  It is a measure of our growing sophistication in financial matters that this highly technical and complex Bill is before us today.  The growth of the International Financial Services Centre places Dublin, and Ireland, as one of the key players in the international investment market.  Dublin now competes with other offshore investment areas within Europe, such as the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and Luxembourg, for investment funds totalling billions of pounds annually.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable that the movement of such large funds internationally &mdash; sometimes within seconds, due to advanced technology &mdash; should attract criminal elements, people who have little compulsion exploiting the attraction of increasing one's wealth by investing in the stock market.  The effect of the Bill will be to outlaw the more unscrupulous independent investment advisers who abscond with a client's money instead of placing it in investment funds as requested.</P>
      <P>The Bill brings us into line with our EU partners and will meet obligations arising from the EU Investment Services and Capital Adequacy Directives. It is also complementary to the Stock Exchange Act which provides for the regulation of Stock Exchange member firms.  However, due to the virtual explosion of activity in financial investment services over the last ten years in this country, the vast bulk of investment firms are not stockbrokers.  This Bill provides for the regulation of investment firms covered by the Investment Services Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision whereby all investment product intermediaries will be covered by what the Minister refers <Col N="270" /> to as the written appointments regime. In future any investment broker passing an investment order to an institution will now require a written appointment from that institution which will result in the institution rather than the intermediaries being held responsible for honouring the payment in all circumstances. The Minister indicated here that this involves cases where the intermediary absconds with a client's money.</P>
    <P>The scale of potential investment in this country cannot be underestimated. For example, within the last 24 hours a major stockbroking firm in this city announced plans to raise £3.2 million under the section 35 tax incentive scheme for a new film, <i>Divine Rapture</i>, which features Mr. Marlon Brando and Mr. Johnny Depp and is due to be shot in Ireland next month.  The attractiveness of section 35 is such that for people availing of the loan facility the projected tax free return is 41 per cent over the remainder of the current tax year.</P>
    <P>On the basis of a minimum investment of £5,000, this investment is targeted at the small to medium investor, which is the growing area of investment funding in Ireland.  This is one example where unscrupulous middle men and women, operating under the existing law, could attract people who with the best will in the world can see the benefits of such an investment but might ignore the credibility or status of the individual to whom they entrust their money.</P>
    <P>This is the kernel of the Investment Intermediaries Bill.  It is an important protection for the consumer, not only in Ireland but for any financial dealings with an intermediary throughout the EU.  It should be noted that the consumer may still lose considerable funds, as dabbling in the Stock Market can be a risky business &mdash; I do not necessarily speak from personal experience.  At least the public is now protected from any misappropriation of their investment funds by fly-by-night or cowboy operators who are active in what is a potentially a lucrative field of financial investment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> The legislation does not guarantee that once the funds have been deposited with an investment house they will make money &mdash; would that it were so &mdash; but it sends a signal through the international community that Ireland is developing a growing reputation as a financial services centre and consequently will provide a high quality service in which anyone can have complete confidence.  As the Minister correctly points out, reputations are hard won and easily damaged, particularly in financial services.  It is essential we put in place a regulatory system which meets European standards.  This Bill goes much further and fills gaps in our domestic system of regulation of financial investment services.  The Minister dealt with this in great detail throughout this 80 section Bill, and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Although it is not within the scope of the legislation, we should reflect on the enormous damage done to the City of London by the failure of investments owned by the Lloyd's Names and the more recent Baring's Bank debacle.  In the latter case the evidence suggests a small group of people, operating within the bank's Far Eastern operation, diced with hundreds of millions of pounds in clients' funds in order to make a financial killing.  While they operated under the umbrella of a major banking company, the evidence points to the reality of human frailty, and possibly greed and ambition, traits which tend to emerge where large sums of money are being invested.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that while smaller firms may be more likely to fail in the financial services sector, it is of particular importance that the larger firms be regulated as well, as a failure in such cases could have consequences for the financial system as a whole.  The Minister would share my view that if a failure on the scale of Baring's or Lloyd's were to occur in the fledgling Dublin financial services centre, its impressive progress would be set back by at least a decade.  It would also have horrendous <Col N="272" /> financial implications for the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that despite the complex nature of this Bill, which encompasses 80 sections, the Minister and his Department have done a good day's work in seeking the widest possible consultation to present us with legislation which, once enacted, will provide us with valuable consumer protection in an area where the Government needs to be ever vigilant due to the rapid changes in financial services and the technology surrounding them.  I concur with the Minister's view that this Bill will provide an extra layer of confidence, not only among the public but among the financial institutions within the EU and beyond, in an activity which makes a significant contribution to the Irish economy.  I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago we discussed what is now the Stock Exchange Act, which dealt with a stock exchange set up in the last century and legislation from the early part of this century.  This Bill deals with an area where no laws or only flimsy laws existed in the past.  It seeks to tighten up the laws relating to financial services.  It is not before time. We are being prompted somewhat by <Col N="273" /> the EU, in that the Investment Services Directive and the Capital Adequacy Directive lay down European standards.</P>
      <P>We must welcome the decision that the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Central Bank will be the supervisory authorities for investment firms.  It is necessary to have the power of those bodies when regulating investments because many people have seen their life savings go down the drain.  People who had hoped to make money from their investment for their future found the bank they dealt with was gone.  They may have worked hard, saving from a small wage.  We should provide proper protection for our investors.</P>
      <P>We must also develop an element of trust.  Throughout this country people have hidden their life savings in their homes, where it is in danger from thieves who may attack them for money.  If a person goes regularly to a bank with his savings, it will be known that he does not keep money in the House.  It is important to develop that trust and to have regulations to protect investors.</P>
      <P>We need an orderly regulation of investments and of firms in that sector and we have to satisfy both Irish and European law.  If we want European standards for this country we must adjust our laws accordingly.  We must have a good name in Europe and we must get clearance from Irish supervisory bodies such as the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Central Bank so that Irish firms can go to Europe.  If a European firm which does not have a branch here wants to invest in Ireland, the same rigorous rules and regulations should apply to them as apply to our companies.  It should not happen any other way.  We must get our house in order and we hope that all other countries will do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to accountants and solicitors, who are represented by professional bodies.  In the past they have been careful to regulate their affairs properly in order to keep the high standard of their profession.  That <Col N="274" /> is recognised in this Bill.  However, how far can we stretch &ldquo;incidental to his or her normal professional practice&rdquo;? Most people will accept this in the spirit of the law, but the law must be tightened in this regard because we do not want loopholes which allow rogues to get away with things they did in the past. Most people do their work properly, but there will always be a few who will destroy the barrel of apples.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned codes of conduct. It is extremely important that firms deal honestly and fairly with their clients, that they show skill and care, that they seek enough information from their clients to ensure that they provide appropriate advice or services and that they make adequate disclosure of relevant information to clients.  We are talking about people who want to invest their life savings, therefore they should be given the best advice.</P>
    <P>Receipts for payments were also mentioned. In the past money was given to people who did not issue receipts and it was never recovered.  We have a responsibility to look after clients' money and anyone who breaches that should be severely penalised.  This aspect is covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with probity and competence of persons involved in investment business firms.  It is important that responsible people invest clients' money.  This happens in firms which have good names and which employ people to advise their clients properly. Matters should be referred to the courts in the case of a dispute.  I am glad that certain issues can be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important that items which may cost public moneys can be openly discussed in the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>This is a complicated and technical Bill, but I hope it will prevent rogues from taking people's investments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and I will answer the questions raised.  I am pleased that there is broad support for <Col N="275" /> this Bill, which has a number of aims. It will protect consumers of investment services; it will ensure that the Irish regulatory system meets European standards and, in so doing, it will ensure that Irish investment firms are entitled to do business throughout the European Union; and it will also increase the level of protection available to the financial system as a whole.  By ensuring proper regulation of the investment industry, the Bill will protect the reputation of Ireland as a centre for financial services and, therefore, protect jobs in the industry as well.</P>
      <P>Rather than reading my briefing notes, I will now deal with the questions asked, particularly by Senator Mulcahy. The first question he asked related to the danger of over-regulation.  This is a matter of balance between giving the necessary protection and imposing regulations to do so.  One of the reasons there were so few amendments in the other House and none here was that &mdash; the Senator alluded to this when he complimented my officials &mdash; there was an extremely long period of consultation between representatives of the industry and consumer associations.  It was not an imposition of regulations invented in the Department of Finance, but the reverse.  Some unduly bureaucratic elements were imposed on us by EU directives, which tend to be bureaucratic because they are written in broad terms for 12 nations.  Officials engaged in a high level of consultation over a long period of time and the balance is as good as we will get.  We cannot have the type of protection we need without a degree of bureaucratic control as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator asked who pays for the cost of regulation.  The Bill includes a provision for charges for supervision, but no decision has yet been made about imposing charges or what those charges might be.  We do not believe that the cost will be a relevant factor relative to the size of the market and the amount of protection being provided.  It does not mean the consumer will pay more; the amount will be small relative <Col N="276" /> to the overall amount of business involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it stop small firms from entering the market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so because most small firms &mdash; the restricted product intermediaries &mdash; tend to be regulated from outside the heavy side of the regulatory system.  Small firms will not be unduly imposed upon; we are concerned that this does not happen.</P>
      <P>As regards the division of responsibility between the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment and why we are using the two, the reason we are doing so is that both of these are already significantly involved &mdash; the Department on the insurance side and the Central Bank on the general financial side.  We are keeping that division and we are adding to the Department those matters which are more closely associated through insurance.  In other words, we will not impose two regulators on a company which is doing insurance business and additional business; it will continue to be regulated by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Likewise the Central Bank is the existing regulator for firms that come in under this Bill; we are trying to achieve a single regulator for each firm rather than two.</P>
      <P>With regard to the exclusion of members of the Stock Exchange from the Bill's tougher requirements, section 38 of the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, will ensure the Stock Exchange member firms will be subject to practically identical codes of conduct as is approved in section 37 of this Bill; this section was taken from that Bill.  There would be no intention of having a different level of regulation for the Stock Exchange members as opposed to the members under this Bill.  I am glad the question was asked as it is important that message would go out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator asked about the fact that EU member countries' investment firms could operate here under the EU authorisations in their own countries.  That is <Col N="277" /> true but it is a double edged sword; in other countries they might say the same about us.  I do not know if we could claim to be the best and that everybody else coming here is less regulated.  As well having the right to operate within the EU from the regulation in their own country, these investment firms would be required to fit in with the local codes of practice in each country in which they operate.</P>
    <P>The Senator may take it they would not be operating under a less regulated system than their competitors here. However, the same question could be asked of us in England or France, for example.  Part of being a member of the EU involves trying to free-up members to operate in all the states and then impose individual local regulations on them.  That is the basis of the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish firms might use that as a loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are operating within a European framework and it would not really be for us to consider that our investment could operate throughout Europe but others could not operate here.  The local codes of practice should overcome the problem to which the Senator alluded.</P>
      <P>Several Senators asked what &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; means and how it is to be determined. &ldquo;Incidental&rdquo; by its nature means a much lower level of activity than the normal run-of-the-mill business a firm is engaged in.  The only way to measure it is in relation to turnover.  There is a rule of thumb in England, but it is not included in the Bill and I do not think it could be put in legislation &mdash; it is not in the UK legislation either.  In the UK they conclude that if the activity approaches 20 per cent of turnover it would no longer be regarded as incidental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of solicitors, the Law Society would require solicitors to advise them if their turnover in this so-called &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; business is climbing and it would be regulated in that way.  I agree it is slightly imprecise but it is <Col N="278" /> hard to make it precise.  However, if it were to exceed 20 per cent of one's turnover one could no longer refer to it as &ldquo;incidental&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy also asked if officials will be sympathetic to firms who are now entering a new regulatory environment; the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I say that with some confidence.  This Bill was a long time in gestation because there was a lot of consultation and notice was taken of what was said by the industry.</P>
    <P>Advertising is an important element of this subject.  We have all read in newspapers outlandish claims of returns of 30 per cent per annum.  Those who are most vulnerable are those who get a substantial sum of money on redundancy, for example.  It may the largest, or the only, sum they have ever had. They see the banks offering 4 per cent or 5 per cent and somebody else offering perhaps 20 per cent.  That poses a great danger.  In this legislation we are taking a strong approach on advertising which is exaggerated and patently untrue and which, while it may be technically possible, does not in any sense describe the level of risk involved with such returns.  The Bill deals strongly with that.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil last week Deputy McCreevy laid great emphasis, with which we agreed, on an educational aspect.  In addition to disallowing the advertisement of things which are untrue or dangerously misleading, the State should take the lead in doing some promotion of its own to warn people against the dangers, for example, of paying cash to an intermediary when one would be safeguarded by paying a cheque to the product producer through the intermediary, or warning people about falling for exaggerated claims on returns.</P>
    <P>Education for the more vulnerable is needed and while that is not in the Bill I wanted to mention that we considered those two matters together and we will do something in that area.  There will be a code of conduct in relation to advertising.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> Senator Mulcahy also mentioned the difficulty for a new firm proving its suitability for authorisation by reason of its not having a track record but having competence.  In such a case they would not be precluded from authorisation but they might be required to restrict their expansion initially until the authoriser has more confidence that they can do what they say they can.  Other than that we would not see it as a bar to getting into business.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke asked about the restricted activity investment product intermediary.  &ldquo;Restricted&rdquo; refers to the fact that it does not take cash but that it only takes cheques made payable to the product producer.  It will generally be the smaller high street financial adviser who may often be acting for a building society as well and doing a little investment advice business in towns all over the country.  They will be regulated but it is not felt necessary to regulate them in a heavy fashion because generally they are not handling cash.</P>

      <P>The Minister outlined to us that sections 50 and 51 deal with compensation.  Will the Minister ensure that the taxpayer or the Government will not have to carry the can for rogue operators?  A number of people have lost all of their life savings, with disastrous consequences.  I hope that this Bill will rectify that situation and that people will be compensated.  How are they to be compensated in the case of something disastrous happening in the future?</P>

      <P>That is covered in a number of sections.  The regulators &mdash; the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment &mdash; are given an indemnity so that the taxpayer is not going to pick up the tab.  That is the answer to the Senator's first question. There is a bonding system whereby a minimum bond of £50,000 must be <Col N="281" /> taken out and it goes up according to turnover.  On top of that, and perhaps more importantly, there is an EU directive due on investor compensation which, if we had it now, we would have put in this Bill.  We understand that this directive is now practically complete and we will be bringing further legislation forward as soon as we get the agreed compensation directive.  That will provide for levels of compensation, so the investor will be protected much better than at the moment.</P>

      <P>I welcome sections 73 and 74 and said so in my Second Stage speech.  It is only proper that difficulties with the Bill can be referred to the people who lay down the laws &mdash; the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I commend the Minister and the people who drafted this Bill.  It is only right that when the Central Bank have appointed an investigator to deal with any misappropriations, the case can be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I welcome that provision in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do no want to hold matters up.  Is the Minister satisfied that, under section 79, the penalties provided for offences created by the Bill are sufficient in a world in which vast sums of money, as has been mentioned here, are circulating and can be lost?  Under section 79 a person guilty of an offence shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding £1,000.  I am sure that this matter has been well thought out and I do not wish to obstruct the passage of the Bill &mdash; I am raising it out of curiosity.  It seems a paltry sum in the context of a conviction being made under this Bill which might involve substantial sums of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum penalties under the Bill are ten years imprisonment or £1,000,000 or both.  That seems to send out a fairly tough message, though traditionally, over a period of time, sums of money can become less relevant.  If we ran into a period of high inflation in the future and had to update that, we would do so. We want those fines to be a serious deterrent and I think they are.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions on this complex Bill and for their support, both on Second Stage and subsequent Stages. The Oireachtas has dealt with a large volume of legislation on the financial sector in the past five or six years.  I cannot promise Senators that this will end. I hope it will end for a little while because I have been immersed in it since I came into the Department of Finance.  It has been intense over the last three or four weeks.  I have already mentioned that further legislation will shortly be necessary, arising out of the EU investor compensation directive, <Col N="283" /> which is really the completion of this package.</P>
      <P>The financial system is changing quickly and legislation needs to keep up with the pace of change, so this Bill is obviously not the last word on investment related legislation.  However, this is the first comprehensive Bill to ensure the proper regulation of investment intermediaries.  Taken together with the recently passed Stock Exchange Bill, 1994, this Bill will establish a modern system of regulation for investment intermediaries in line with modern international practice and the requirements of European law.  The Investment Intermediaries Bill, 1995, is part of a wider process under which firms providing financial services will be allowed to trade freely throughout the European Union.  This will obviously bring challenges as well as opportunities, but I am sure that the Irish financial sector is strong enough to meet these challenges and avail of the opportunities here and abroad.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Central Bank, the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Justice for their assistance in the framing of this legislation. I also thank the bodies within the industry who co-operated and provided valuable assistance in the drafting of this complex legislation.  Finally, I thank very much the officials in the Department of Finance who have done trojan work over a long period in producing this complex legislation and in getting me, who was entirely new to it and to this Department, up to relative speed in a short space of time.  I greatly appreciate that and the co-operation of this House.</P>

      <P>I echo what the Minister said about the officials in his Department. It is highly technical and complex legislation and due credit should be given to them.

He has a great knowledge of the Bill, which, while it may be a continuation of the Stock Exchange Bill, is brand new and has 80 sections.  He is to be complimented on getting to know the Bill in a short space of time.  As he pointed out, that can be attributed to the very efficient staff in his Department. They are to be complimented because it is a very complex Bill.</P>
