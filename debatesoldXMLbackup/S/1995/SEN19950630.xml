      <P>I thank Members from the benches opposite for co-operating to allow us attend the funeral of Senator Gordon Wilson yesterday by agreeing to take yesterday's business today.  I am very grateful for that.  Today's business is item 1.  It is proposed that, after Second Stage, there will be a short sos before we move on to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for his few words.  The Leader is as aware as everybody else in the House of the group of disabled persons who have been outside the House for the past week.  I ask the Leader, through his office, to speak to the Minister.  Every one of us has had an opportunity to speak with those whose cause is basically the need for facilities in Dublin Bus transport.  Every local authority in the country at the moment is working towards a programme for improvement of access for the disabled.  I know the Minister has spoken to them but I hope the Leader will pass on the message from this House and will ask him to do whatever he can to make the resources available to Dublin Bus so that those who use wheelchairs have the basic facility of access to public transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks I raised the question of the current dispute regarding testing carried out by the vets.  I have given a lot of thought to this issue in the meantime and I have read up a lot about it.  I still believe that the position of the vets has been grossly misunderstood. It is time their advice as a professional group was taken; people can point the finger at them afterwards if it does not work.  After spending a total of £1 billion on this scheme over the years it is time we listened to the one group who deal with this issue all the time and who have an interest in getting it right. A full discussion on this scheme would be very useful.  People have prejudices about the subject and there is a great need to have a full discussion on it.  Let us hear the arguments from both sides, let us hear the Minister's proposals and move forward from that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Senator Wright, these Houses only became accessible to wheelchairs when Senator Crowley was with us.  This is indicative of an attitude which is widespread. It is a fundamental right of disabled people that they should be able to move freely within our community.  I ask the Leader to do what he can to assist their cause.</P>
      <P>On Senator O'Toole's point, my attitude has shifted since he raised it.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry might consider the fact that his behaviour to the veterinary surgeons is like that of Dunnes Stores management to its workers.</P>

      <P>The way money has been wasted on the TB eradication scheme is a national scandal.  We discussed this issue before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's Order of Business is unsatisfactory. I accept there were exceptional circumstances this week and it is right and proper that we meet today to discuss the Consumer Credit Bill.  The Dáil Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy made 310 amendments <Col N="455" /> to the Bill.  The Government has tabled a further 145 amendments and there will be amendments from this side of the House.  The Bill is fundamentally changed from the one which was published. I do not know how we can debate this on Committee Stage in a coherent form.  I do not know how the staff of the House can deal with these amendments.  I regard this procedure as highly unsatisfactory.  I am not proposing an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that we should not take this business today but the Bill should have been re-entered.  It is completely different from the one which was published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the non-availability of the OECD report to the House.  The Minister for Finance replied that it would have cost the State approximately £3,000 to circulate it. This was based on the fact that the report is available from the Government Publications Sales Office for £16.50.  I presume this office is selling copies of the report at a profit.  He suggested that Members should purchase copies of the report so that we could debate it.</P>
      <P>This is symbolic of the attitude of the Minister and the Government.  It is not the first time there has been this attitude towards Members of this and the other House.  There is not a spin doctor in the country who has not had a copy of the report.  Spin doctors demand what they want from Departments when they want it and they get it.  It is time we demanded our rights as Members.  We should not have to beg for information so that we can have cogent debates.  I ask the Leader to please ensure we are not treated as anything but Members of the Oireachtas.  When matters are coming before us for discussion the relevant Ministers and the Government should provide us with the information necessary to deal with those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to call an urgent meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss the treatment <Col N="456" /> of this House by the media.  I am not talking about the faithful media servants who are here each day but the sub-editors of RTE, 98FM and the national newspapers.  The House is being treated as if it does not exist.  This was shown to be the case on Tuesday when we had expressions of sympathy on the death of Mr. Gordon Wilson.  There was no mention of the Seanad on the news that lunch time.  There was a belated interview with the Leader but everybody who spoke in the Dáil was mentioned.  It was as if we did not exist.  In newspaper reports the following day there was no mention of the Seanad of which the deceased had been a good Member.  It was reported that the Seanad had adjourned but there was no mention of what happened here.  I ask that a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be called and that the Director General of RTE be brought in and asked what is he doing about the second House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Wright's comments about the position of those outside the gates of the House in wheelchairs and other members of the public who are handicapped.  I share the view expressed by Senator Dardis that action is only taken when there is no option, as was the case with the former Senator Crowley.  Everybody is entitled to the same access and facilities as Brian Crowley because he is a citizen of the State.  Having listened to a debate between the head of Dublin Bus and a spokesperson for the handicapped, the Leader might consider a short debate in the House next week to discuss what is a difference of opinion in terms of how this matter should be addressed and the social cost, etc., for CIE.  I suggest that it is not CIE's problem but a national one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> The eradication of bovine TB and the amount of money spent on it would rank among the seven wonders of the world.  After spending £1 billion we have not moved much further forward. It is timely that some radical overhaul of that system is put in place.  I would welcome an opportunity for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to come to the House to tell us how the changes he proposes would advance the eradication of bovine TB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with previous speakers in calling for a debate on the availability of public transport facilities for handicapped people.  I concur with Senator Lanigan about coverage of this House.  The Director General of RTE should be called before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss this serious situation and the imbalance which exists at present.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the weakness of the British pound against the punt.  We are approaching the summer recess and a discussion should take place.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, should come to the House to tell us the Government's policy in this regard. Many companies in rural areas as well as in the cities will be in serious difficulty if this situation continues over the coming months.  Many companies buy three months in advance and those three months are now up.  These companies are selling at a loss because of the weakness of sterling against the punt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to come to the House as soon as possible &mdash; perhaps next week &mdash; to discuss what measures can be taken on behalf of strawberry growers in the south-east who are facing financial ruin.  This has been brought about by a combination of two factors, the late May frost and the prolonged spell of high temperatures.  In order to cover production they would need to produce two and a half tonnes <Col N="458" /> per acre.  This year because of the combination of the frost and the high temperatures they are only producing one tonne per acre at best and they face financial ruin.  If something is not done the entire strawberry processing industry in the south-east will be decimated.  This section of the farming community never got any assistance from any Government over the years and something must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what Senator Lanigan said.  I am sure I am not the only Member frustrated by the lack of media coverage of the Seanad proceedings.  This was accentuated in the past couple of weeks when, as spokesperson on three Bills, I carried out a considerable amount of research and made detailed contributions &mdash; which I am sure my colleagues will recognise &mdash; only to find that, as far as the media were concerned, it was as if it had never happened because I was not quoted.  For those who I believe I have an in-built advantage in RTE, I can assure them that after seven years as a Member, the contrary is my impression.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House consider having a debate after the summer recess on the FÁS report on the film industry in Ireland which was launched two days ago by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht?  The issues dealt with in this report are quite serious for the future development of the Irish film industry.  Its main recommendations are such that a debate would be useful and informative.  It might help to contribute to improving employment prospects in that industry and, consequently, make a further significant contribution to the Irish economy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry accedes to Senator Townsend's request for a debate on the strawberry industry, could he on the same day explain his position regarding investment in Mallow racecourse?  The Irish Horseracing Authority has approved the investment <Col N="459" /> in Mallow racecourse and it is up to the Minister to provide the funding.  Perhaps he could come to the House in the next few weeks and explain his position. This matter is of major concern to the southern region and to the horse breeding industry in particular.  It would be appreciated if the Minister would intervene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator O'Toole and Senator Dardis for a debate on agriculture.  The last time agriculture was discussed it was in the context of the vets dispute.  I am seeking a general debate on agriculture.  I also live near Mallow and I am anxious to know the Minister's position regarding the racecourse.  However, the main concern at present is the danger of the cessation of the bovine TB eradication scheme as a result of the dispute with the vets.  I have consistently said that the vets are vital to the scheme.  The scheme will not be successful, despite what Senator Magner said about the amount of money that has been spent on it, without the co-operation of the vets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I also support Senator Wright's request to meet the Minister regarding the disabled.  As a result of an accident some years ago I was confined to a wheelchair for six months so I am aware of the difficulties experienced by the disabled.  There is an urgent need for the Minister to meet them and to ensure that their needs are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wright and others raised the question of the disabled. I agree with Senator Magner's suggestion that we make time available next week to discuss it.  We will allocate an hour or two hours next week for that discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute with the vets was raised by a number of Senators.  I realise that <Col N="460" /> it was their intention to be helpful and I will convey their feelings of concern to the Minister.  Senator Dardis made a valid point about how we are conducting our business today.  I take it on board and we will not do business this way again.  I am as unhappy as the Senator about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the OECD report.  He is absolutely right in saying that in future Members should have reports in good time and there should be no question of being under a compliment about it.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges and issues concerning Members were raised.  I have had discussions with the Leader of the Opposition and other Members about issues that are of concern to Members.  I will ask the Cathaoirleach to hold a lengthy meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, perhaps the week after the House rises.  We need time because there are a number of serious issues that are of concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised the exchange rate of the punt with sterling.  I will see if the Minister can come to the House but we have a full schedule between now and next week.  I was interested to see that the point raised by Senator Howard during the week about the problems that arise <i>vis-a-vis</i> sterling received wide coverage in the media yesterday.  Senator Mooney asked for a debate on the FÁS report.  I will be delighted to arrange such a debate but it will be in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Townsend raised the plight of strawberry growers.  That issue is close to the Minister's heart since the strawberry growers are mainly located in his constituency.  Mallow racecourse was raised; the racing industry is close to the Minister's heart.  I will see if we can arrange even a short debate on those two issues between now and the end of the session.</P>

    <Title>Consumer Credit Bill, 1994: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it almost impossible to deal effectively with a Bill of this nature, which is very complex and detailed and which to a large extent has been dramatically changed since its introduction. As with another recent piece of legislation, the Government is proposing a huge number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  In view of this the proposed legislation should be withdrawn and reconsidered to see if more comprehensive legislation can be presented for discussion in a more sensible and reasonable way.</P>
      <P>The Bill attempts to modernise consumer affairs, including consumer information, with regard to those dealing with financial institutions, money lenders or whatever.  There is a grave necessity to do this.  We are all aware of the amount of damage done, especially by money lenders, in the small towns and cities where people have been ripped off for years by those who have been treating their customers in a shoddy and unfair manner.</P>
      <P>There has been much debate and discussion in the House on money lending and how it is possible to deal with rogue money lenders who have been ripping off people.  Nobody is more aware of this than the Minister himself.  When I was the Minister for Social Welfare he was in communication with me on a regular basis because of the activities of these pirates who were putting enormous pressure on people, especially on families on occasions of first communions, confirmations or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were it not for the support given by the Minister for Social Welfare to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to enable these rogue villains to be dealt with they would continue to run riot in urban areas, to exert enormous pressure on people and to send them huge bills.  The interest rates they charge are incalculable. For example, they run one loan <Col N="462" /> into another, make all kinds of offers and engage in all kinds of wheeling and dealing.  They still appear to get away with it.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about this issue it is essential that it establish a subcommittee to deal with it as it is one which involves the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister with responsibility for this area of legislation. In many cases it requires a more positive and involved attitude from the Department of Justice.  Some of the people responsible for moneylending operations are criminals who are walking the streets.  They fall into the same category as the drug pushers and hooligans who seem to be running our towns and cities at present.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pursue this any further.  I appeal to the Minister to spell out how he proposes to protect people from the rogue and disgraceful tactics of moneylenders.  At present it is not being dealt with effectively despite the best interests and intentions of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations who are involved with this problem on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister whether or not it will be possible to have more detailed information available for people who are in the process of negotiating loans, particularly hire purchase and leasing agreements, with some of the financial institutions?  Without trying to identify particular cases, I want to inform the House of a recent situation where an individual borrowed in the region of £8,000 last February to buy a Land Rover.  That person paid £700 during the first number of months and then his payments went into decline.  He had made no further payments, up to last week, on the £8,400 he originally borrowed. The hire purchase company seized the property some weeks ago and sent him a demand for something in the region of £13,000 which they claimed had accumulated in that space of time. I have not gone into the details of calculating interest in this kind of situation. It would be unfair to put the name of <Col N="463" /> such a well known and well established company on record without knowing the full details of the case.  However, the fact of the matter is that this individual, who borrowed £8,500 and paid £700 between February and June, is faced with a bill of £13,000 to redeem his property under the leasing agreement he entered with a well known financial institution.</P>
    <P>The individual involved in that particular incident contacted me to speak to the company on his behalf.  What bothered me most about it was that not alone were they not prepared to negotiate an arrangement with him to finalise the matter, but they actually felt it was their business to decide whether or not his property should be returned to him, despite the fact that he was prepared to pay the full amount due to them.  I find it extraordinary that a financial institution, which deals with people on an individual basis and negotiates payments over long periods, should decide, when repayments are not made, that the person involved should pay the full amount due and that the property should not be returned even if the full amount due is paid.  Unless this legislation can deal with the interest levels involved in such a situation, we might as well go home and not waste the Minister's time.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the legislation can deal with that kind of situation and if the Director of Consumer Affairs can give some satisfaction to clients or customers who are deeply aggrieved by the behaviour of such institutions.  It seems that the company in this particular case were unwilling to make arrangements with the individual involved &mdash; despite the fact that he was prepared to pay the full amount due &mdash; because he had not dealt with them fully during the loan period and had not returned their telephone calls.  Not only did the company believe they had a right to make decisions about the money owed but they believed they had other rights also. For instance, they felt they could decide, even though he was willing to pay the <Col N="464" /> full outstanding amount through other arrangements, they were not even willing to give him back what he felt was his property.  All such agreements which are couched in all kinds of small print need to be put in large print.</P>
    <P>We find this even in international airports. I was deceived in Heathrow not so long ago and had to take it up with the authorities there.  Special offers are on display but are dependent on the purchaser meeting some conditions that are totally beyond anybody's reach.  Is such misleading advertising covered by this legislation?</P>
    <P>I also want to deal with the question of door to door salespeople.  Does the Bill cover this situation?  The Minister will be aware that quite an amount of business is done by people who travel from door to door.  They sell books, magazines and so on.  From my reading of the Bill, it is not clear whether this is covered by it.</P>
    <P>I support what the Minister is endeavouring to achieve.  There is a grave necessity to conduct a comprehensive overhaul of the legislation in this area.  I admit it is complicated as it involves a number of Departments and Government agencies but these matters must be dealt with thoroughly now.  Can the Minister indicate whether it would be possible to have a booklet published setting out the precise details of the legislation? I doubt if many people, either in these Houses or outside of them, who could go through this detailed technical legislation and be able to put it into ordinary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;simple language that people could understand.  Before we conclude examination of the Bill, the Minister should take steps to explain the detail of it to us in language we can understand rather than the technicalities of the amendments.  Otherwise, what will we have at the end of the day when all this is concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this legislation is brought forward; it will cover some of <Col N="465" /> the gaps.  Nevertheless, there is still a lot of carry on by reputable companies and others in relation to the small print in agreements and leases which needs to be fully explained to people before they sign on the dotted line for some of these deals.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the situation where companies negotiate, especially with farmers, programmes of afforestation? Farmers have signed over their grants to private companies.  I have had some complaints from individuals who were not fully aware that when they made arrangements with planting companies they were signing away their State grants.  The grants were then paid directly to those companies.  I am not sure whether this situation is covered in the Bill.  Can the Minister of State indicate whether this type of situation can be dealt with by this legislation?</P>
    <P>One old age pensioner who was in touch with me only yesterday, has a genuine grievance.  This pensioner is in an institution.  He was awaiting a grant from the Department only to discover to his amazement yesterday that the grant of £4,000 or £5,000 had already been paid months ago to a company.  He was not aware of this and is distraught that in some way or other the company had managed to sign over his grants and entitlements.  He was not able to get any satisfaction from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>I am only giving instances of these cases so that the Minister can deal with them in a general way.  He can clear my mind as to whether this legislation is the type that will effectively deal with these problems.  First, the man planting his land and, second, the one leasing a Land Rover, who feels he has been robbed and denied his rights by clever interpretations of lease arrangements that do not tell the full story on the day a person signs on the dotted line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The way in which we have to deal with this Bill is unsatisfactory. I made this point to the Leader on the Order of Business and he agreed <Col N="466" /> with me.  I accept there is an urgent need for the Bill.  There is a need to regulate moneylending and undesirable practices in financial institutions and to protect consumers.  That is not in dispute.  The way we have to deal with the legislation is in dispute and it leads to bad legislation when Bills are dealt with in this way.</P>
      <P>I refer in particular to the number of amendments tabled in the Dáil and here.  I have never seen a Bill in my time in the House with as many proposed Government amendments.  I am prepared to accept the need for a Bill and I am sure the Minister's intentions are honourable.  However, it could lead to a suspicion that something is being slipped in that we would contest hotly if we were in possession of more facts and had more time to consider the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a Government amendment to section 13 which states: &ldquo;...in PART I, contravenes section 6 (2), 7 (10) or (11) or 11 (7), ...&rdquo; and continues in a similarly obscure vein.  As a humble farmer I am bewildered by it. Even the most eminent senior counsel &mdash; I have never heard of a senior counsel who is not &ldquo;eminent&rdquo;&mdash; would have considerable difficulty in grappling with the ins and outs of the Bill.  The Bill has been amended in such an all-pervasive way that it should have been re-entered and we could then have considered it in a more balanced way.</P>
      <P>Given the circumstances in the House this week, I am sure the Minister will understand that our attention was elsewhere. Members of the House were at the late Senator Wilson's funeral yesterday and, as a result, the business of the House was put off until today and we did not give the Bill the consideration it might otherwise have received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were about 310 amendments in the Dáil and there are over 100 tabled here.  It makes it impossible to deal with the legislation in a detailed and coherent way.  It imposes enormous pressures on the small staff of the House to try to take Opposition amendments.  I tabled two amendments and when I read the Government amendments I discovered <Col N="467" /> there was no need to table them because they were already incorporated. That is helpful, but it would have avoided a lot of problems had it been done in a clearer and less cumbersome way.  I make this point to the Minister for future reference and that our lives might be made somewhat easier.</P>
    <P>The legislation conforms with certain European directives.  It is good to see that we are bringing our legislation into line with EU directives.  We might not agree with all of the directives, because some of them unduly complicate life for citizens.  However, in this case the directives are good and it is right that we should fall into line with them.  Directives are mandatory and, as such, there is an obligation on Governments to implement them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Daly that an explanatory booklet should be circulated when the legislation is enacted to ensure consumers are acquainted with their rights in a simple straightforward way.  It is difficult to go through the legislation and understand in every circumstance what its objective is.  I recommend to the Minister that he do that.</P>
    <P>It is correct that advertising in particular should be controlled.  It is apparent from looking at advertisements on television that one needs to be quick and clever to read the little bit that is put down at the bottom of the screen.  I can think of cases where policies that are linked to the performance of equity markets or of bonds are advertised in this way.  Everybody assumes when they take out these particular policies that there is only one way that these markets move and that is upwards.  History suggests that they have moved upwards, but in the more recent past the trend has in some cases been downwards. People buy these policies in the expectation, where loans were secured on them, that they would make repayments of the loans a lot easier.  They get a terrible shock when they find that the performance of the market has declined within the previous 12 months and that therefore their exposure is increased.  It <Col N="468" /> would be welcome that when they get into these agreements, they would know from the beginning exactly what was at stake.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an assumption within banking circles that they are almost benevolent institutions and they represent themselves well in media advertisements in that way.  Of course they are not; they are hard nosed commercial businesses and that is what they should be.  I do not criticise them for being hard nosed commercial businesses but their clients need to know this in all circumstances.  We have to accept that there has been bad lending as well as bad borrowing and that in cases where there has been bad lending, the lending institutions have a solemn responsibility to help their clients and to sort out difficulties.</P>
    <P>I can recall when we had the boom period for land prices.  It was easy to go into one's local banker and not even ask for the money but to be asked if one wanted the money.  It was almost expected of you that you would take the money.  This was not offered on the basis of anticipated income but on the value of the security that was being offered.  That has changed to an extent, but it is unquestionable that there were significant numbers of farmers who got themselves into trouble on the basis of bad lending by the banks.  I was involved in trying to sort out some of those cases. The trauma for the families involved is absolutely colossal.  Only a small minority of people actually found themselves out on the road, but the amount of pain people had to suffer over an extended period before a settlement was finally reached was quite extraordinary. People in banking are dealing with these things on a routine basis day in, day out.  They do not fully appreciate what the human consequences are for people in that situation.  It is something that needs to be looked at and regulated to the extent that it can be.  Where there is a shared culpability &mdash; I will put it no more strongly than that &mdash; the pain should also at least be shared and not be all on the one side.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> I welcome the provisions in the Bill in respect of moneylenders.  This matter has been discussed at some length by other speakers and I do not intend to go into it.  It is to be welcomed that we control what is taking place with moneylending and hire purchase.  The latter is an area where there have been huge abuses in the past where somebody borrowed something in the order of £50,000 on an understanding that the annual interest payment would in the order of 16 per cent.  It was not until they had paid their first instalment that they discovered how much interest they were paying and that within a short period of approximately three years they would not only pay back the capital but more than the capital in interest.  Consequently, the machine was seized.  This relates to the small print.</P>
    <P>People who are trying to provide a service and do their business well often do not have the time or the professional backup from advisers, because they cannot afford it, to look at these matters in great detail.  There is an onus on institutions to tell people in these circumstances at the outset what they are letting themselves in for.  I have no sympathy for people who make such an agreement with their eyes wide open.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that lending institutions are sometimes anti-enterprise.  In many ways they are extremely conservative &mdash; I was about to suggest they are as conservative as some Departments, but I will not say that because it would be offensive to them as they are more liberal and open-minded that some of the lending institutions.  Some are pro-small enterprise and we welcome that.  Sometimes the ethos in banking circles is not as pro-enterprise as it is presented to be.</P>
    <P>The way the Bill is being dealt with is unsatisfactory.  It would have been more satisfactory to have reconsidered it and brought it back to us.  This would have made our lives a lot easier and it would have removed any suspicion we have about aspects of the Bill.  We could then have had a more realistic debate on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Fianna Fáil Senators mentioned the role of the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, in initiating this Bill.  I want to be associated with the remarks of commendation to her.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator Daly mentioned the amendments made since then.  Senator Dardis said that 310 amendments have been put through the other House since I took over office and that I have a further 145 amendments here.  I accept that looks like an unprecedented situation, but this Bill is a product of the committee system which was introduced in the Oireachtas.  I do not think anyone from any political party will dispute the assessment that it is an immensely better Bill because it went through that process.  My predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, was open to taking amendments on board during that process and I have continued that practice.  The new system of scrutiny of legislation has produced a better Bill.</P>
      <P>I have initiated some changes in the Bill.  Many amendments are of a technical nature designed to produce better clarity and transparency in terms of the type of transactions to which Senators referred.  I am not trying to conceal the fact that I have introduced some fundamental changes, but they are few in number and they were clearly signalled in the other House.  Although Senator Dardis did not allege this, I assure him I have no intention of putting through even one amendment because of the extraordinary circumstances in which we find ourselves today.  The Senator will not find such an amendment if he goes through the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the Senator mentioned the obfuscatory language in section 13. It appears an extraordinary piece of opaqueness but it does no more than draw a distinction and specify offences under the various parts of the Bill which are, on the one hand, summary and liable to penalties of up to £15,000 and, on the other, indictable.  There is a great <Col N="471" /> deal of that type of restructuring and reorganising in the Bill in terms of ultimately making it a more intelligible and useful document.</P>
    <P>I agree I have introduced changes but I think they are for the better, for example, bringing local authority loans under the purview of the Bill, bank charges as they now apply in the Bill &mdash; which many Senators mentioned &mdash; and advertising on which Senator Daly concentrated part of his contribution.  There is an amendment before the House which would require financial institutions to advertise in terms of APR only so that consumers are aware and can compare like with like.  Even if many people cannot readily give a definition of APR off the top of their heads, they know that if every financial institution is required to advertise in terms of APR, they can readily compare one with the other.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to conceal the fact that I have introduced changes. However, I have also taken on board amendments from Deputies, including Senator Dardis' colleagues, and I have reflected other proposals in the amendments before the House.  The measure to include local authority loans in the remit of the Bill was welcomed by the Opposition in the other House.  The previous Minister of State agreed she sought to make this move but could not get Government agreement at the time. I was able to persuade Government to do it and all sides welcome it.</P>
    <P>The position on bank charges is relatively radical.  It is an immensely better deal for the consumer that the monitoring of bank transaction charges is now the responsibility of the Director of Consumer Affairs rather than the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has many responsibilities with which it is preoccupied and it is correct to have a watchdog and champion of the consumer responsible for the monitoring of bank transaction charges.  One of the most radical proposals in the Bill is that the financial institutions will be required to provide <Col N="472" /> commercial justification for these charges.</P>
    <P>The director will be required to assess whether a commercial case has been made and one can readily foresee a situation where a new product is introduced to the market which would be of benefit to the consumer.  If that is the case, so be it but many people believe bank charges have increased in recent years and that new charges were introduced for which it is difficult to see justification. It is a way of making the consumer pay and contribute to the substantial profits of the financial institutions at a time when perhaps they have been less prudent in garnering profits outside this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In respect of Senator Farrelly's queries, I assure him that the question of the remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs extending to all bank customers includes not just consumers but also small and medium enterprises and agriculture. The controls will be all embracing and applied in a more rigorous manner than heretofore.  Business, consumers and farmers have welcomed this; it is a significant step forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde, Senator Farrelly and others have raised the question of the educative and informative role of the director.  The director has specific functions in that regard.  Work on the preparation of a booklet, referred to by Senator Dardis, and leaflets, referred to by Senator Farrelly and Senator Ormonde, will be carried out.  The director will engage on such a programme of public education and the process of opening regional offices will start in Cork this year.  All that is in hand.  I accept there is little point in conferring new rights and entitlements on consumers if they do not know about them. They will know and will be told about them as a result of what is happening here.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised the question of illegal moneylending.  I point him to sections 108 to 112 in Part IX of the Bill which gives the Garda extensive powers of questioning, arrest, entry into premises, seizure of documents, with or without <Col N="473" /> a warrant, as circumstances demand, to tackle the scourge of illegal moneylending.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulty with the ambivalence that exists with the official moneylending industry.  Some contributors to this debate retain a residual doubt about whether we should be engaged in this practice at all.  On the one hand, we are regulating, supervising, legitimising and licensing the practice but some people would say we should give more powers to the Garda and that we should not officially approve of it; after all, it is a necessary evil.  Unless one regards all moneylending businesses as a necessary evil, and there is a strong philosophical argument for so doing, if we are imposing these new supervisory functions on the official moneylending industry then we accept it is a legitimate business.</P>
    <P>There are large sections of consumers who would not get access to credit at all were it not for the official and properly authorised moneylending industry.  The rest of us can get access to credit from our local bank or building society on the basis of our wages, salaries or assets, but we would be denying a whole section of the community access to credit were it not for the existence of this section of the credit market.  In this Bill, we are trying to regulate the industry and ensure it operates on a fair basis, that the consumer knows what he or she is entering into, what their entitlements are, what their rate of interest is and what their repayments are, how many payments they have to make and how they are made.  The Bill is going a long way towards addressing that situation.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who contributed. I acknowledge we are dealing with this Bill in extraordinary circumstances which I emphasise is not my wish.  I would like to take this Bill at a leisurely pace but in fairness, of all the Bills about which these arguments can be advanced &mdash; and I know Senators have to look at it in the context of the parameters of this House &mdash; this Bill has been fine tuned by the Oireachtas to a level of no other Bill I can recall in recent times.  It has been scrutinised line by line in the process of that Oireachtas <Col N="474" /> evaluation.  However, that is not by way of excuse offered to the Members of this House for the speed at which we must proceed today.  I regret this is happening. I would prefer if it was not the case but everybody agrees that there are extraordinary imperatives as to why this Bill should become law before the summer recess and before moneylending licences have to be renewed.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who contributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a definition of the term &ldquo;APR&rdquo;.  I indicated in my speech on Second Stage that APR is a term which is increasingly in public usage.  In brief, one could say that APR is the true rate of interest.  It means the total cost of credit to the consumer over the lifetime of the loan, expressed as an annual percentage of the money borrowed. I have endeavoured to come forward with a definition of APR which would be readily intelligible to consumers. The definition here &mdash; that APR means &ldquo;the annual percentage of charge being the total cost of credit to the consumer expressed as an annual percentage of the amount of credit granted and calculated in accordance with section 11&rdquo;&mdash; is, I think, the best that we are likely to come up with.  It is a definition specified in the EU consumer directive of 1990 and refers to a mathematical calculation on page 99 of the Bill.  If any Member of this House can validate the mathematics of it I will bow to them.</P>

I accept what the Minister is trying to achieve and I have no difficulty with the amendment he is proposing, but I am curious why that has been dropped from the Bill and why the Minister is doing it this way.  I accept that we should have some clarity, which is consistent across the board, as to what is the true rate that is being paid and this is the way to do it.  Sometimes people are not even sure what APR is when they come to repay their loans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the subject of a great deal of discussion in the Dáil.  If you look at the relevant section of the debate in the Lower House, a number of different attempts were made to give a better verbal definition of APR. However, at the end of the day we had to ensure that the mathematical calculation, <Col N="476" /> as set out in the formula on page 99, was given accurate verbal expression in the amendment.</P>
      <P>There are issues that would apply to one section of the credit industry that might not readily apply elsewhere.  For example, in money lending ought the cost of collection charges be properly included in the APR?  At the end of that process of evaluation it was concluded that one could not depart from giving expression in words to the mathematical formula expressed on page 99.  This is the closest we will ever come to being able to give that expression while at the same time maintaining its consistency with the EU Consumer Credit Directive of 1990.</P>

      <P>I accept the concept but I am allergic to having mathematical formulae in the middle of this Bill.  I know it must be used for calculation purposes, but the public need to understand APR.

      <P>We cannot have two definitions in one Bill.  It must be consistent with the Consumer Credit Directive of 1990 and it is probably the best we will get.  Later we will discuss an important amendment which will give effect to the objective of uniform advertising. Senator Ormonde's point about whether a person understands it precisely is almost irrelevant because in all cases they will be comparing like with like.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="477" />&ldquo;&lsquo;authorised copy&rsquo; in relation to a moneylender's licence, a mortgage intermediaries authorisation or a credit intermediaries authorisation, means a copy of the licence or authorisation for display purposes issued by the Director in such form as he may decide;&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 98 and 120 of the current text of the Bill require moneylenders and mortgage intermediaries respectively to display, in a prominent position in any premises where they engage in the business of being a moneylender or a mortgage intermediary, a copy of their licence or authorisation. A similar requirement is being inserted in a later amendment relating to credit intermediaries.  In order to avoid a photocopy being displayed and the potential this has for abuse, I propose in this amendment that the Director of Consumer Affairs shall issue a copy of the licence or authorisation specifically for display purposes.  I will be tabling amendments to this effect later in sections 98 and 120 and the new section dealing with credit intermediaries. These amendments shall refer to the authorised copy of the licence or authorisation.</P>

However, in relation to the moneylending provisions of the Bill in Part IX only members of the Garda Síochána shall be authorised officers. As we know, illegal moneylending often brings with it wanton violence and gross exploitation, as has been referred to at some length in the House this morning.

The present definition of &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; in the Bill is confined to housing loan transactions, but the term &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; is now also used in Part IX relating to moneylending.  In order to reflect this position the new definition specifies that a borrower is a consumer acting as a borrower.  Also, arising from the insertion on Report Stage in the Dáil of the provisions relating to credit-sale, the term &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; was used for the first time.

For example, if a person has made one third of the payments, the article secured under the hire purchase agreement cannot be repossessed by the credit institution <Col N="482" /> without a court order.  The implication of the Bill as it stands was that the goods may pass to the hirer, but this is incorrect.  In the case of hire purchase the goods pass to the hirer once the hirer has complied with the terms of the agreement.  It depends on the terms of the agreement because the distinction between hire purchase and consumer hire is that consumer hire is effectively leasing.  In the case of hire purchase, depending on the terms of the agreement itself, one can get ownership at any stage along the process; but if they seek to repossess the goods and at least one third of the repayments have been made, they must get a court order.</P>

      <P>I am still confused about ownership.  I understood that it has changed.  If one has paid one-third of the money, they cannot retrieve the goods.  What happens if one has paid less than one-third?  I would like the Minister to come in on that again.  I am unclear and the public are unclear about the effect of that amendment.  There is also the conflict of deferred payments. When does ownership pass to the consumer? Is the agreement workable?  It has to be legal from the beginning.  We cannot allow personal arrangements between the financial institution and the buyer in relation to the instalments. There is a clumsiness there, if I may say so.  I would appreciate if the Minister would explain this again.</P>

      <P>This amendment is providing against clumsiness.  This is a technical amendment which cannot be taken in isolation from various other sections in the Bill dealing with hire purchase. One of the requirements of the legislation is that there must be absolute clarity concerning the terms of the agreement itself; the person who is benefiting from the hire purchase must have the terms of that agreement made available to him or her.  As it stands the Bill states that the ownership may pass if the terms of the agreement are complied with.  This amendment corrects that statement.  If the terms of the agreement <Col N="483" /> are complied with then the question of ownership is clear.  That is the only change being made.</P>

      <P>I propose the deletion of the definition of &ldquo;successive credit agreements&rdquo; and also section 49 which deals with successive credit agreements. These were included in the Bill when credit agreements included hire purchase agreements.  This is not now the <Col N="484" /> case as successive hire purchase agreements are provided for separately in section 75.  Credit agreements, such as cash loans, cannot be the subject of the provision in section 49 which provides that successive agreements shall be regarded as having revoked the earlier agreement and consisting of the combined terms of both agreements.</P>

      <P>This amendment is not entirely removed from an earlier question Senator Dardis asked.  The total cost of credit does not include any sums payable as a penalty, as compensation or damages for breach of the agreement. The purpose of this amendment is clarity.  The underlying approach to the calculation of the total cost of credit is that the consumer will at all times abide by the terms of the agreement.  Thus, to build into the total cost of credit any cost in relation to a breach which one assumes will not occur would be erroneous and is, therefore, now specifically excluded from the definition of the total cost of credit.</P>

      <P>That is not right.  As I understand it, this relates to circumstances where, for example, a lawn mower is bought under an agreement, the terms of which include a maintenance contract on the lawn mower.  It would not be right to include that in the cost of terms nor would it be right to <Col N="485" /> include the cost of any damages for which the buyer might pay as a result of breaking the blade.  These are not the same as the cost of repayments.  These penalties are separate and distinct from the selling and buying of the article itself.</P>

      <P>Section 4 deals with the functions of the director.  It states: &ldquo;The Director shall have the following functions for the purposes of this Act in addition to other powers conferred on him by this Act&rdquo; and then lists the functions. What provision has been made for funding the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs so that it can implement this legislation?  The means of the office are fully stretched at present.  The Bill contains many diverse provisions and its implementation will put a great strain on the office.  Why <Col N="488" /> does the Bill not provide for funding the office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that significant additional functions are being conferred on the director and his office will require additional resources given the onerous nature of some of these duties. I accept Senator Kelleher's point.  I gave a commitment in the other House that the staff in the office will be doubled in the next two years from 30 to 60 people, notwithstanding that a more rigorous public expenditure regime is anticipated for the next year and a half or so and I intend to honour that commitment.  This is the essential ingredient to enable the director to discharge these additional functions, with an opening of a network of regional offices.  Senator Kelleher will be pleased to hear I intend to proceed with opening an office in Cork at the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not have been possible to include in the Bill a provision whereby funding the office would be guaranteed?  We all hope that the Bill, if passed, will be implemented and that the public will appreciate its positive aspects.  The staff in the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs are stretched as it is and it is hard to see how even doubling the staff will be sufficient. This forward thinking legislation will put such a burden on the office's staff that I do not think, even with the Minister's commitment, that the legislation can be implemented in full to ensure the public is safeguarded by its measures.  Is it not possible to insert a provision in the Bill to ensure that funding would be guaranteed as opposed to the Minister of State having to beg from the Minister for Finance?</P>

      <P>I do not know if the provision of additional or specific resources is specified in legislation relating to any organisation, the functions of which are analogous to those of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  If Senator Kelleher can give an example, I will stand corrected.  I do not know, for <Col N="489" /> example, if resources are specified for the Competition Authority or the Health and Safety Authority.  I do not think it is the norm for such a provision to be enshrined in legislation and I am not sure if it would be desirable.</P>
      <P>The director is in the best position to identify the type of staffing and expertise he needs and he should be given flexibility to do this.  From my direct discussions with him, I do not think he is as concerned about the total number of people employed as he is about their skills and expertise.  Parts of this Bill outline functions, the discharge of which will impose onerous responsibilities on him.  The transfer of responsibility for monitoring bank transaction charges will impose on him and his office an unprecedented onus and will require people with the necessary expertise to match the firepower of the banks in this area.  All I can do is give a commitment that these resources will be provided.  I have no indication that the commitment that we won earlier from the Minister for Finance will be interfered with in any way.</P>

      <P>From the discussions of the Minister of State with the director, what volume of extra work does he envisage as a result of this legislation? When the Bill is passed and the original early decisions are made, can we expect the financial institutions to go along with the new rules so that the office will not be faced with a large amount of work?  Would it not be the norm that the financial institutions should implement the rules and regulations? Dealing with original queries should not result in an increase in the number of queries on a continuous basis.  Will the Minister agree this should be the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but I am not sure the big bad world will always operate in that fashion.  Section 4 imposes specific additional responsibilities on the director, many of which will require him to demonstrate a proactive role.  It is not a question of the financial institutions <Col N="490" /> not complying with the legislation but that their compliance will require an informed response from &mdash; and investigations by &mdash; the director.  It will require him to assess, for example in the area of bank charges, whether a commercial case has been made to permit increases in charges or new charges. His role in licensing the moneylending industry and his power of investigation under the legislation impose new duties on him which are not inert or which will be implemented merely by his acquiescence; a proactive role is being imposed on him.</P>
      <P>The first area with which he will be concerned is the invocation of the sections dealing with the moneylending industry.  This does not mean that all sections will have to be invoked at the same time but it may prove an intolerable burden on the director until he is up and running and we will have to look at this situation.  I take the points made by Senator Kelleher and Senator Farrelly and I assure them it is my intention that, if we are conferring new powers and rights on consumers, the director will have the necessary resources to ensure they can vindicate those rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>To ensure the Bill's provisions are eventually enforced, will the Minister agree that, if the Finance Act had not provided for a reduction in corporation tax or the abolition of bank levies, they would have been an ideal way of funding the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I am sure that £40 million in bank levies and corporation tax would have adequately funded the increase in staffing levels necessary to ensure the legislation is enforced. This is not a political point.  Would it not have been possible to impose a levy on institutions and those who apply for licences to be used to fund the office to help ensure the legislation is implemented in full?  The director could not implement a quarter of this legislation, even if his staff is doubled or trebled, given the present level of resources available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> Why can there not be a provision for funding, such as a levy on the banks, which would guarantee resources to the Director of Consumer Affairs to ensure that this legislation will be implemented? Will the Minister explain that? If there are to be cuts in public spending, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs will be an easy target.  It is a matter for the Minister of the day to argue on his behalf.  While we appreciate the Minister's ability to argue his case, he might not necessarily secure enough funding to implement this legislation.  It is not worth passing the Bill, if its provisions cannot be implemented.</P>
    <P>Is there a possibility of guaranteeing funding?  For example, people who apply for licences for moneylending could contribute a certain amount based on how much they lend.  That should be ironed out so that the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has guaranteed funding.  If we pass this legislation, the Director of Consumer Affairs will not be able to implement its provisions with the present resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The director assures me that the staffing provisions which, I repeat, are destined to double his staff complement from 30 to 60 over the next two years are adequate to discharge the additional functions he will have under the legislation.  I accept what Senator Kelleher said that his office may be considered an easy target when cuts are contemplated in public expenditure, which the spokesperson in the other House argued trenchantly for.  I cannot foresee the outcome of the Estimates process but I sincerely hope we will be able to protect this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw Senator Kelleher's attention to the fact that I am doing precisely what he asked.  He asked for a levy on the banks and there will be a levy, if that is what he wants to call a rose by any other name, on all financial institutions, including banks, building societies and finance houses.  If they decide to seek increases in existing charges or introduce <Col N="492" /> new ones, they must submit a fee of up to £25,000 with that application. As regards the regulation of moneylending, a fee of £1,000 is sought with each application.  Credit intermediaries must pay a fee of either £500 or £250, depending on the nature of the partnership which again will yield a not insignificant revenue.</P>
    <P>As Senator Kelleher said, it is appropriate and proper that some element of contribution should be expected from the industry.  I do not know precisely what it will be annually.  We will need to look at that to some extent on the basis of experience but it will not be an insignificant contribution to the revenue cost of discharging the new responsibilities under this Bill.  I agree with Senator Kelleher that it is appropriate that they should make a modest contribution and that is required under the Bill.</P>

Senator Quinn, on almost all legislation with similar provisions, has sought to have such reports produced speedily and he never understands why this cannot be done.  I hope the Minister will bring this aspect of the legislation to the attention of his colleagues when they respond to Senator Quinn's amendments seeking the speedy publication of such reports.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage we spoke about the need to provide information which people can readily understand in respect of the legislation and how it applies. While, as far as I can see from the Bill, it is not a duty of the director to provide that information &mdash; I may be wrong &mdash; perhaps it should be included.</P>

      <P>It is a general duty on the director and it is included in the consumer Act introduced in 1978.  Indeed, he has plans prepared to do precisely <Col N="493" /> what Senator Dardis suggested.  On the provision of the report within three months, I agree that is desirable.  At present it is more than one year behind by which time some of its value is eroded.  There is a specific statutory imposition here that it must be provided to the Minister within three months. The Minister, in turn, must lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas two months later.

The position of the director is being made fully independent outside of this legislation. It is up to the director to implement it &mdash; the director &ldquo;may&rdquo; do this and the director &ldquo;may&rdquo; do that if the director sees fit or if the director has enough funding.  Why is it not provided in the legislation that the director &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The fact that the director &ldquo;may&rdquo; if he sees fit or if there is enough funding brings us back to the same problem. That is my concern about this Bill. There are no proper guidelines or provisions whereby the director must or shall carry out the task.  I do not wish to detain the Minister on the nitty gritty aspects of the legislation but this matter is important.  It refers to the basic problem of this Bill which is whether funding will be made available or may be made available.</P>

      <P>I refer the Senator to section 4.  There are specific and onerous imperatives on the director under that section.  It is all governed by the use of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is important and correct that the director is independent in the <Col N="496" /> discharge of his functions.  It is quite proper that we should protect that independence and give the director discretion to act as he sees fit in respect of a number of matters that are not governed by section 4.  That is what we are doing.</P>
      <P>I realise that one cannot draw general conclusions from the discharge of his functions by the present occupant of the office.  However, his performance has been praised on all sides of the House. To narrow his discretion could be counter-productive. The inclusion of the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this section is probably the appropriate flexible instrument to give to the director.  He may, depending on the exigencies of any given circumstance, decide to use the power reposed in him under that section.  In other circumstances he may decide that it is wiser, for whatever reason, not to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis is more alert than he indicated on the Order of Business.  It is proper that I comment on this.</P>
      <P>I am proposing the deletion of section 9 dealing with credit intermediaries by means of a new Part XII to the Bill.  This amendment is concerned with new regulatory provisions for credit intermediaries. It also provides that the director shall have the power to suspend or revoke a credit intermediary's authorisation, a power not included in the present section 9.  I will now deal with the new provisions <i>ad seriatim</i> which are similar to those introduced by way of Report Stage amendment in respect of moneylenders' licences and mortgage intermediaries.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) provides that, subject to an exclusion in subsection (2), a person shall not engage in the business of being a credit intermediary unless he is so authorised by the director and he holds a letter of recognition from each undertaking for which he is a credit intermediary.  Under subsection (2) a person who is authorised under section 101 to collect repayments on behalf of a moneylender is exempt from having to have a credit intermediary's authorisation. Subsection (3) states that a holder of a credit intermediary's authorisation must only engage in the business of being a credit intermediary in the name specified in the authorisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The form and content of an application for an authorisation is set out in subsection (4).  The applicant must state <Col N="498" /> his true name, his business name and address and the name of any undertaking for which he intends to act.  The application fees of £500, in the case of a company or partnership, or £250, in the case of a sole trader, are set out in subsection (5).  These fees will be used to fund the director's office and assist him in carrying out his functions under this and other legislation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) is a standard legislative provision and provides that the application fees referred to in subsection (5) may be varied by regulations.  The life of an authorisation is set out in subsection (7) at 12 months.  Subsection (8) specifies the content of the authorisation. Similar to the contents of the application form, the authorisation shall state the true and business names of the intermediary, his business address and the name of each undertaking for which he acts as an intermediary.</P>
    <P>The grounds on which the director may refuse to grant an authorisation are set out in subsection (9) and include failure to have a letter of recognition from each undertaking; conviction for a criminal offence during the previous five years; being the holder of a bookmaker's licence or a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor, a gaming licence, a pawnbroker's licence or a money-lender's licence; failure to provide a current Revenue tax clearance certificate; not being in the opinion of the director a fit and proper person to carry out the business of being a credit intermediary and failure to comply with regulations under subsection (10).  Subsection (10) provides for the making of regulations requiring an intermediary to effect a policy of professional indemnity insurance.</P>
    <P>In subsection (11) conviction for a criminal offence during the time of holding an authorisation, becoming the holder of bookmaker's, liquor, gaming, pawnbroker's or moneylending licences and contravention of regulations made under subsection (10) shall now be grounds on which the director may suspend or revoke an authorisation.  Subsection (12) corresponds in large <Col N="499" /> measure to subsection (8) of deleted section 9.  It extends the provisions of that subsection to director's suspension or revocation of an authorisation. Consequently, where the director proposes to refuse to grant an authorisation or proposes to suspend, revoke or vary the terms or conditions of a current authorisation, he must notify the applicant or the holder of the authorisation, as appropriate, of his proposal.  Such applicant or holder is entitled to make, within 14 days of receipt of the notification, representations to the director in respect of his proposal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (13) provides that, if having considered any representations made under subsection (10), the Director decides not to grant the authorisations or decides to suspend or revoke an existing authorisation, he shall notify the holder or the applicant of the decision and the grounds on which he has based his decision.  The holder or applicant may, within seven days of receiving the notification, appeal the decision to the Circuit Court within whose circuit the business to which the authorisation relates is to be carried on. The provision of subsection (14) replaces subsection (12) of deleted section 9.  Any notification made under this section from the Director must be delivered personally or sent by pre paid registered post to the business address of the credit intermediary or applicant.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that where the notification refers to a refusal to grant a second or subsequent authorisation, a suspension or revocation of an authorisation, such refusal, suspension or variation shall take place upon the expiration of the seven days allowed for the appeal.  Subsection (16) provides that pending the determination or withdrawal of an appeal against the Director's refusal to grant a second or subsequent authorisation or his decision to suspend or revoke an existing authorisation, the refusal, suspension or revocation shall take effect and any authorisation shall continue in force until the appeal is finalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> Section 17 provides that the Circuit Court may confirm the Director's decision to refuse to grant, suspend or revoke an authorisation or to allow the appeal.  Where the appeal is allowed, the Director shall grant the authorisation or shall suspend or revoke the authorisation as the case may be.</P>

      <P>I do not have any objections to the amendments primarily <Col N="503" /> because I do not understand them.  I understand that the Minister conceded earlier this morning that these provisions are especially opaque.  I sometimes suspect that these provisions are inserted to generate work for lawyers over an extended period of time because one would need to be an eminent senior counsel to deal with them.  It is difficult to understand what is at stake here for the ordinary person.  It underlines, once again, the need for explanation and clarification for consumers.</P>

      <P>The matter of offences should be very clear to people.  If people read the Bill they will not be aware whether an institution or a licence holder has committed an offence or what the nature of the offence is.  It is completely confusing.  I am aware there <Col N="504" /> are technical reasons the proposed legislation should be presented in this way. However, is it not possible to lay out in simpler language, the offences that could be committed by an institution? At present one would need to be an eminent senior counsel to understand the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senators are reposing too much importance on section 13. Senator Dardis correctly takes the view that it is a section for lawyers.  It provides a handy ready reckoner of the offences that may be committed under the Bill.  It does no more than specify the various sections, contravention of which will result in an offence.  For example, a money lender applying for a licence must comply with certain conditions. If he does not do so and misrepresents the position an offence is committed.</P>
      <P>Conditions apply to be authorised as a credit intermediary.  An offence may be committed if the position is misrepresented. The aim of this section is to codify and make a distinction between summary offences and indictable or serious offences.  Section 13 cannot really be considered in isolation from the rest of the Bill.  It draws it together and is a handy ready-reckoner to contravention of specific sections which is an offence.  It is not designed for the consumer.  It is designed, as a section, to codify all sections.</P>

      <P>The general criticism about the need for clarity in legislation still stands.  I think the Minister actually accepts that.  However, I am not aware of another way to deal with this other than the way it is dealt with in the section.  In other words, we must refer to the nature of the offences listed in the various sections of this Bill and there is no need to consult other legislation.  The criticism is a valid one.  Having made it, however, I have to accept that the offences must be listed somewhere with information on how to deal with them. The latter is dealt with in the subsequent section.</P>

      <P>The confusion in this section relates to placing the onus on the director to point out offences.  If offences under this legislation were clearly laid out, it would be easier for a consumer to identify when an offence was being committed.  They could then report to the director who could take the appropriate action.  However, under this section it is the consumer's direct responsibility to identify an infringement. The legislation is so confusing there is little chance of the consumer ever doing so.</P>
      <P>Would it not be possible to explain this in clearer language?  It is up to the director, or a person with an eminent legal qualification, to spot where an offence has taken place.  If the language of the legislation were clearer, a consumer reading it could identify when an offence was taking place and report it to the Director of Consumer Affairs. Otherwise the Director of Consumer Affairs is the watchdog.  Without any shadow of a doubt, the best watchdog of all is the public.  I do not think the public can interpret this legislation or point out where an offence takes place or what is an offence.</P>

I have had to read the Bill too frequently in recent times and it is not something to be kept in the attic for bedtime reading. It does not make easy reading.  The Senator is correct about the public's need for information.  However, they will get that information from the leaflets being produced by the Director of Consumer Affairs which are written in intelligible English.  With the exception of that rare breed the eminent senior counsel, people with access to this legislation would not be much the wiser for reading it.  The information will be contained in the leaflets.  That is the correct place for it.</P>

Subsection (2) provides that the Hire Purchase Acts, 1946 to 1980, shall continue to apply to any hire purchase agreement or <Col N="509" /> credit sale agreement made before, and in force, when this Act commences, because various parts of the Act may be brought into force on different dates.

      <P>This amendment is consequent on the previous one, which replaced the word &ldquo;credit&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;financial accommodation&rdquo;.  I am now making it a specific requirement for advertisers to state the nature of the financial accommodation on offer; for example, cash loan, hire-purchase or consumer-hire.

    </Speaker>
    <P>25.&mdash;(1)  An advertisement in which a person offers to arrange the letting of goods under a consumer-hire agreement or indicates the availability of such a letting <Col N="514" /> shall include a statement to the effect that the agreement is for letting, hiring or leasing only and the goods remain the property of the owner,</P>

    <P>(2)  Where any figures relating to the amount payable by a hirer under a consumer-hire agreement are indicated in any advertisement to which subsection (1) applies, those figures shall be clearly displayed and shall be fully inclusive of all amounts payable, including taxes.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where any figures relating to the amount payable by a hirer under a consumer-hire agreement are indicated in any advertisement to which subsection (1) applies, and those figures indicate the amount payable for part of the agreement only, that fact shall also be clearly indicated in the advertisement.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons for this amendment.  Section 25 is no longer necessary in this part of the Bill because of the changes to the definition of housing loans on Report Stage in the Dáil.  Section 25 provides that a warning notice to the effect that the consumer's home is at risk if payments on a mortgage, or any other loan secured on it, are not kept up must be included in any advertisement for the availability of credit other than a housing loan.  As a result of Report Stage amendments, any loan secured by the consumer on his principal place of residence is a housing loan and, therefore, subject to Part X.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In place of the deleted section 25, I propose to insert a section dealing with the advertising of consumer-hire agreements. The provisions of this section are currently contained in section 93, whose deletion I am also proposing.  The new <Col N="515" /> section, which sits more correctly within the advertising provisions of the Bill, states that an advertisement for the letting of goods under a consumer-hire agreement shall include a statement to the effect that the agreement is for letting, hiring or leasing of the goods and that the goods remain the property of the owner.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the question of title or ownership to the goods is not understood by the consumer or brought to their attention by the owner.  Subsection 2 provides that any figures relating to the amount payable by the hirer be clearly displayed and be fully inclusive of all amounts payable, including taxes. Under subsection 3, the fact that any figures indicated are payable for part of the agreement only must be clearly indicated in the advertisement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the spirit of the amendment as it is desirable to have these sort of specifications.  One of the things that strikes me &mdash; and I wonder if the Minister has given consideration to it &mdash; is the question of matters being clearly displayed.  On both occasions, in subsection 2, the amendment states: &ldquo;... those figures shall be clearly displayed....&rdquo; and, again, in subsection 3, it states &ldquo;...clearly indicated in the advertisement&rdquo;.  Will the type of advertisements we see on televisions &mdash; I am thinking, particularly, of ITV where one would need a spyglass to read the small print at the bottom of the screen &mdash; conform to what is said in the Bill, i.e. &ldquo;clearly displayed&rdquo;?  Is that &ldquo;clearly displayed&rdquo;? In my view, it is not.  Is there any specification as to what a clear display is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;No&rdquo; is the answer. That would not constitute being &ldquo;clearly displayed&rdquo;.  I refer the Senator to amendment No. 24, which states that the director may, in the interest of better informing consumers, by such means as he sees fit, and subject to this Act, issue a direction as to the location and <Col N="516" /> size of any statement or notice required under this Act.</P>

      <P>Section 38 provides that credit agreements other than an overdraft facility must contain the notice set out in Part I of the Third Schedule.  The notice shows consumers at a glance the full intent of the financial commitment they are undertaking. Amendment No. 68 excludes credit-sale agreements from having this form of notice as it cannot apply to an agreement, obviously for the purchase of goods.  The requirement of the notice refers to instances where cash is advanced as cash loans and not to an arrangement whereby the total cost of credit is paid in instalments.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;(1)  A consumer or a person acting on the consumer's behalf may apply to the Circuit Court in whose Circuit the consumer resides or in which the agreement was made, for a declaration that the total cost of credit provided for in any agreement is excessive.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The wording of section 50 is the product of amendments adopting and arising from the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil.  As a consequence, the present text contains a number of unintended anomalies and this amendment is designed to remove them.  Under the present text, the only agreement in which the rate of interest could be challenged in the courts would be a moneylending agreement, but the first and only arbiter of rates of interest for moneylending shall be the Director of Consumer Affairs, in accordance with the powers given to him under Part IX of the Bill.  In these circumstances, it would also be anomalous that a consumer or a person acting on their behalf could apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to have the rate of interest judged to be excessive.  Any rate fixed by the Director would be determined only after the most detailed and painstaking <Col N="528" /> scrutiny and this consideration should be accorded due weight in designating the court in which the interest rate could be challenged.  Thus, the amendment provides that the reference to the director making application to the court is being deleted as are the references to court or court of competent jurisdiction.  Also, the court action must take place in the Circuit Court area in which the consumer resides or where the agreement was concluded.  The words &ldquo;collection of&rdquo; repayments are being substituted by the more appropriate term &ldquo;collecting&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 79(a):</P>
      <P>In page 35, between lines 24 and 25 to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  In any case where the application under subsection (3) is made by a consumer or a person acting on the consumer's behalf the court shall not make an order without first affording the Director the opportunity to be heard on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has already gone a long way in cleaning up this section as regards the provisions about the Circuit Court and so on.  This is a slightly different aspect, but it is within the context of the powers given to the Director of Consumer Affairs which have been considerably strengthened under the legislation. Section 50 (3) states that &ldquo;The Director, a consumer or a person acting on the consumer's behalf may apply to the court of competent jurisdiction for a declaration that the total cost of credit provided for any credit agreement is excessive.&rdquo; It would then seem appropriate that if a consumer or a person takes an action, the court should consult with the Director of Consumer Affairs or he should be given the opportunity to be heard on the matter because he would have expertise in this area and his view would be important.  It would be remiss if the court did not take that view fully into account.  I am not saying I would like to see this wording in the Bill, but I strongly recommend the spirit of the amendment.</P>
      <P>I am indebted to the Consumer Credit Association of Ireland for bringing this matter to our attention. It has discussed other issues with the Minister and it appears from the amendments brought forward that several of its concerns have been addressed.  However, this one has not been addressed and that is why I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I am persuaded by Senator Dardis' amendment.  It is only logical that if a rate of interest has been fixed by the Director of Consumer Affairs, the court should hear the Director before it makes an order in the case. However, in terms of the amendments already passed, it seems that the Circuit Court is the relevant court in this case. If I am to ensure consistency with amendments Nos. 74, 75 and 80, I propose that the wording of Senator Dardis' amendment be amended by the substitution of &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo; for the term &ldquo;court&rdquo; so that it would be clear that it is the Circuit Court which is being referred to.

      <P>The amendment to section 52, which deals with making demands and threats in relation to unenforceable agreements, is similar to the existing subsection (3) which the amendment proposes to replace.  The provision in paragraph (b) dealing with the &ldquo;failure to comply with a requirement of the Act as to form and content of an agreement was not deliberate and has not prejudiced the consumer&rdquo; is adequately covered by the enforceability provisions of sections 40, 62 and 88.  Those sections already provide for such a defence in relation to credit agreement, hire purchase and consumer hire agreements.</P>
      <P>I had this examined before I came to the Seanad because it was indicated to me in the other House.  The combinations of sections 40, 62 and 88 adequately provide for an inadvertent situation, to which Senator Dardis referred.  For example, part of section 40 states:</P>
      <P>Provided that if a court is satisfied in any action that a failure to comply with any of the aforesaid requirements, other than section 32, was not deliberate and has not prejudiced the consumer, and that it would be just and equitable to dispense with the requirement, the court may, subject to any conditions that it sees fit to impose, decide that the agreement shall be enforceable.</P>

The most important matter was to prevent consumers being embarrassed by receiving something at their workplace or apartment block which was clearly a calling in of a loan and I thought the best balance possible had been reached. I will examine the point raised by Senator Dardis and consider whether further changes are necessary for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Section 97 concerns moneylender's licence and the various procedures which have to be undergone both to apply and be granted such a licence.  One of the grounds on which the Director of Consumer Affairs may refuse a moneylender's licence is that a court has found the applicant to be charging an excessive rate of interest during the previous two years.  The reference &ldquo;to court&rdquo; is now consistent with an earlier amendment to section 50 being changed to &ldquo;the Circuit Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A further ground for refusal to grant a licence includes the applicant being the holder of bookmakers, drink or gaming licences and in the event of this Bill being enacted, a pawnbroking licence.  The references to bookmakers, intoxicating liquor and gaming licences are being expanded to include reference to the specific legislation under which they are granted.</P>
      <P>In line with these changes an insertion is now being made in the Bill whereby the grounds on which the director may suspend or revoke an existing licence are made more explicit.  These are conviction for an offence by the holder of a licence or any business with which he is connected for breaches of section 102, which concerns illegal moneylending; becoming the holder of a bookmaker's, intoxicating liquor, gaming or pawnbroker's licence and failure to comply with any terms and conditions of a licence.</P>

      <P>I can think of another situation. I understand the distinction the Minister is making; he has to have a separate premises which is clearly identifiable as a moneylending premises.  It <Col N="544" /> would not matter if he lived down the hall from it provided there is a separate premises.  In many rural towns an elderly widow living upstairs on the main street may decide to let out the ground floor to the local dentist or doctor who sets up a surgery.  From the way this legislation is drafted it would appear that if our moneylending friend did that it would be illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take advice on it but my own opinion is that it would not mean that.  If the downstairs or first floor was designated as the premises that is the definition of business premises as intended here.  It does not mean the entire complex or that somebody cannot use some other location in the entire complex as a residence.  It means that there is an explicit, identifiable, separate business premises within a block of apartments, houses or buildings. As I read it, it is not intended that if somebody is sleeping in a separate section of the building that would disqualify the issuing of a licence to a person under this section.  I will take advice on it however.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the purpose of it?  The moneylender who holds a licence and who has a premises will have to specify that he is trading on the first floor or in the left hand side of the premises, while somebody living on the right hand side in a bedsit will be in breach of the legislation.  What is the basic purpose of having to ensure that he maintains a business premises for that purpose which is not used as a residence by any person?  I could possibly understand &ldquo;by the moneylender himself&rdquo; but not &ldquo;by any person&rdquo;.  A two storey house in the main street of any rural town would have to become a separate property or a separate business. He would have to put his address as bottom floor or top floor, floor A or floor B.  What is the reason for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that you must have a separate identifiable place for conducting the business of moneylending. <Col N="545" /> A few minutes ago Senator Dardis asked whether you could put postage paid on an envelope and I have established, incidentally, that you may do so.  Having regard to the extremes we have gone to to protect confidentiality and privacy, it would be crazy if all the files of the moneylending business concerned were under the bed and whoever happened to be in the bed on the night in question could go through them at will if they had not anything better to occupy them.

      <P>The Minister has our support in terms of making sure that it is an identifiable business and that it is absolutely separate.  It goes without saying that we support that concept, but the Minister can see that there is some potential for confusion and that is putting it at its mildest. Perhaps it is something he could look at.  If Mrs. McCarthy, who is living upstairs and owns the entire premises, by virtue of her circumstances decides to let the ground floor on the main street of a rural town, there is some potential for confusion as I see it.</P>

While there might be a totally separate entry or access point from the street, there could be technical difficulties which could lead to severe difficulties if a person who has a premises and tries to lease the bottom floor or a portion of the building, finds that they will be in breach of this legislation. The Minister should check that point.  We are totally in agreement with trying to protect the confidentiality of the client, but that difficulty could arise.</P>

      <P>Section 113 of the Bill prohibits the collection of repayments under moneylending agreements at certain times.  This prohibition was motivated <Col N="549" /> by the need to safeguard family privacy and avoid any unseemly incidents particularly at unsocial hours which could cause distress to family members, especially young children. The purpose of this amendment is to allow for the collection of repayments outside the hours specified by the Bill subject to the strict conditions which I enjoin the legal moneylending industry to observe to the letter.</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me that there is a discernible need for a concession in the hours of collection to cater for family circumstances.  The present amendment provides for collection being made between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. on any weekday provided that the consumer so consents in writing, in a document separate from the moneylending agreement and in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule now being inserted.  A copy of the consent must be handed personally to the borrower upon giving consent or sent to him within ten days.  Such consent may be withdrawn at any time by the borrower.</P>

      <P>Section 147 places an obligation on credit intermediaries to disclose in writing to the consumer the nature of the financial accommodation, the repayment details, including APR, the name of any undertaking for which the intermediary acts and the amount of commission received on arranging the finance.  This amendment now places a further obligation on credit intermediaries to disclose who has the property and the goods during the agreement. Depending on the nature of the agreement, property may pass at different stages or it may not pass at all.  Under a credit sale agreement the property passes to the buyer immediately upon the making of the agreement, whereas a feature of consumer hire agreements is that property remains at all times with the owner and never passes to the hirer. With hire purchase agreements, the property will pass to the hirer once the terms of the agreement are complied with.  Until such time as the agreement runs its full course, the owner will have a lien on the goods.  It is important for a consumer to know who has ownership of the goods.  This has obvious implications for a consumer who wants to sell the goods during the currency of the agreement.</P>

    <P>(6)  Where a notification under subsection (2) is in respect of a proposal to impose a charge for a new service which was not previously offered to its customers or is being offered as choice to and in a materially different way to existing services, the Director may, within 3 weeks of receipt of the notification, direct the credit institution&mdash;</P>

      <P>I indicated on Second Stage that I had had meetings with representatives of the Irish Bankers Federation, the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association and the Irish Finance Houses Association about the implications for them of section 148 of the Bill, which concerns customer charges by credit institutions.  I also informed the House on that occasion that I had had consultations with the Director of Consumer Affairs in whom responsibility is now being vested for the regulation of bank charges, a duty until now performed by the Central Bank.  In considering the case for change I was anxious at all times that the Director's functions would not be dispensed too widely, particularly to areas which are not of major concern or significance to any category of bank customer.  My principle aim is to ensure that all future increases in bank charges or the introduction of new charges must be fully justified by the applicant institution and must not bear too heavily or unfairly on any one class of customer, be they consumers, small or medium sized enterprises or the farming community. Equally, there must be a measure of fairness attaching to the new scrutiny regime in order to avoid undue burdens on financial institutions where the volume <Col N="570" /> of business is small relative to that of the major banks or building societies. Reflecting on this approach I now put forward this amendment as I promised on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>Some moneylenders collect repayments door to door and people who do not have the required amounts when the moneylender calls take out new loans, some of which are used to pay the amounts currently owed.  Will the fact that a form is to be included in a repayment book mean this will no longer happen or will moneylenders have separate books for the new loans?  I know people who can never clear their debts; their loans are continually renewed and never repaid.</P>

      <P>These three amendments combine with the effect that a pawn transaction in excess of £10 will be regarded as being a special contract and, therefore, subject to section 15 of the 1964 Act, which provides for a modification to the redemption period.  In practice the redemption period for special contracts is four months.  To require a pawnbroker to hold precious articles for a longer period would result in insurance implications for the broker. For non special pawn contracts, the redemption period is either six months and seven days or one year and seven days depending on the nature of the pledge.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 140 to the Seventh Schedule states: &ldquo;I UNDERSTAND THAT I MAY CANCEL THIS CONSENT AT ANY TIME BY NOTIFYING THE LENDER EITHER BY USING THE CANCELLATION FORM BELOW OR BY WRITING TO THE LENDER OR HIS AGENT&rdquo;.  Is there any leeway if the moneylender or his agent collect at a house in Kerry after leaving Cork and post arrives in his office that morning <Col N="579" /> from the person from whom the money is to be collected cancelling consent to collection repayments between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.?  If the form arrives in the moneylender's office on 1 September at 8.00 a.m. and the agent drives to Kerry that morning to collect, is the cancellation valid from the point of arrival?  Is there a possibility for argument and debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always room for debate and argument.  If one were to consult solicitors on that point, one would get two different answers.  The phrase is very explicit.  Amendment No. 140 states: I UNDERSTAND THAT I MAY CANCEL THIS CONSENT AT ANY TIME BY NOTIFYING THE LENDER EITHER BY USING THE CANCELLATION FORM BELOW OR BY WRITING TO THE LENDER OR HIS AGENT&rdquo;.  If the moneylender travels outside Cork, whatever his reason for doing so, I hope he will have a moneylending licence which would apply in Kerry.  Since the person giving the consent to repayments or collection at extraordinary times, 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., has the option of doing so in writing or communicating to the lender, it seems that he or she can verbally advise the lender that they are cancelling that authorisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would happen in circumstances where the person calling on the door is not the lender, but somebody acting on his behalf?  Amendment No. 107 to section 113 states that: &ldquo;A borrower may withdraw any consent given by him under subsection (2) by notifying the moneylender, his employee or agent and, accordingly, any such consent shall be terminated upon receipt of such notification.&rdquo;. That would appear to expressly include any person acting on behalf of the moneylender, an employee, a debt collection agent or whatever and that any such consent shall be terminated upon receipt of such <Col N="580" /> notification.  If the person is notified that the deal is off, they must revert to the hours provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a possibility for contention and legal argument?  If the letter was posted in the same jurisdiction to the office of the moneylender by the borrower informing him of the cancellation of the extraordinary collection hours between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. and the same morning the person collecting or the agent arrives on his doorstep and the borrower, who has already informed him in writing, is not present, the moneylender could then issue proceedings or inform the borrower in writing on returning to the office.  Would there be a possibility of legal argument in that case?  The moneylender has been informed that the hours between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. are no longer ones in which the moneylender can call to a house to collect repayments.  The Minister has already said that there is a possibility of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there was a possibility because I doubt if this House has ever enacted legislation which is not open to challenge by somebody who is so minded.  A person would not need to travel outside Cork to confront the circumstances described by Senator Kelleher. The same question would arise if somebody posted a withdrawal to the moneylender on Friday evening and the moneylender arrived on Saturday morning between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., although the letter was already in the post.  Subsection (4) of amendment No. 107 states that: &ldquo;any such consent shall be terminated upon receipt of such notification&rdquo;. It seems the right is there for the person to notify the moneylender, his agent or employee face to face.  I cannot think of a more direct means of notification.  If that was challenged subsequently, I believe it would be deemed to be adequate.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the way he dealt with this legislation &mdash; he has had an onerous day.  However, my original criticism stands in that this has all the hallmarks of something which has been rushed.  It has been the Minister's unhappy responsibility to clean up something that should not have come to the Oireachtas in that form in the first place.  In my experience I have never known a Bill, particularly a Dáil Bill, which required so many Government amendments to come before the Seanad.  There have been Seanad Bills which required far fewer Government amendments.  The Bill when it was introduced required a great deal more work and the Minister has been compelled to do that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been unfair on the staff of the House, given their limited resources, to have to deal with such complexities. There were unfortunate circumstances this week and we must accept them.  The Members who have chaired the sitting also deserve our congratulations for the way they dealt with this legislation.  I congratulate the Minister on having steered the Bill through the House.  Perhaps <Col N="582" /> he would indicate when he hopes it might be dealt with in the Dáil.  Does he hope to have it completed before the summer recess?  One of the reasons we were prepared, on the Order of Business, to deal with the Bill in this way was that we wished to have it enacted as quickly as possible.  If it will not be enacted until the autumn one must question why we have gone through this work today.</P>
    <P>If the Minister ever comes back to the House with legislation requiring similar amendment, I recommend that he select a particularly hot Friday in June to do so.  It is the most effective way of getting the legislation through the House quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis that it is difficult for Opposition Senators to speak on the Bill when there are so many amendments and so little time to respond to them.  It was also unfair to the staff of the House and to the Members who chaired the sitting. They kept order and a sense of reality in what was a confusing situation.  I do not see the reason for rushing this Bill through the House.  Another few days in the Dáil would have ironed out many of the problems.  It would be greatly appreciated if, in future, the Minister deliberated properly on such legislation. Then there would be no need for so many technical amendments to be dealt with in this House, obliging us to hold a lengthy sitting without affording us the opportunity for free debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I studied &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice&rdquo; for my Intermediate Certificate.  In those days the balance of power always weighed in favour of Shylock and the moneylenders.  By passing this legislation we have changed that balance in favour of the consumer, and rightly so.  I welcome most of the provisions in the Bill.  However, I appeal to the Minister to secure adequate funding for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I hope a Deputy will <Col N="583" /> not come into the Dáil in the future claiming there is a letter in that office which will rock the State to its foundations, because a civil servant in that office is unable to do his job due to lack of funding.  I hope the Minister will secure sufficient funding to ensure this legislation is implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister and thank him for bringing this legislation before the House.  Of course, we are not happy &mdash; and this has happened with nearly all legislation that comes before the House &mdash; that we do not have enough time and that there are, perhaps, too many amendments. On this occasion there were more Government amendments than ever before.</P>
      <P>However, this legislation has been under consideration since 1986.  It is time it was passed even if there were so many amendments.  The fact that it has taken so long shows the complexity of this area.  More than one Minister has had to deal with this legislation.  The present Minister for Enterprise and Employment was involved in the early stages of its formulation for a few short weeks in 1986 and he mentioned that when the Bill was introduced in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Bill.  I have no doubts, despite those expressed by my colleagues, about staff being made available for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  There is no point in passing legislation if one does not follow through with the required number of staff to implement it.  If a case is made to Government, I have no doubt that the funding will be made available for the required staff to implement this Bill properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good day for the consumer. I hope, as Senator Dardis said, the enactment of this Bill will not be delayed until October.  The Minister <Col N="584" /> said this morning he intends to have the legislation in place in time for the issue of the new moneylender's licences.  I presume the legislation will be signed by the President as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It has been a long day.  On a day such as this one must admit that, apart from the Minister and ourselves, the officials have had a tough day.  I compliment them on their work in giving frank responses to our questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have been present for the Minister's appearance in the Seanad in his official capacity.  We soldiered together in a different forum and I wish him well in his new high office.  The Minister was an extremely good public representative at local authority level and it is obvious that he will continue to be so as a Minister.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill.  I wish I had the opportunity to have a greater input to it.  However, we all have our areas of responsibility and this was not mine &mdash; when I saw the size of the Bill I was glad.  The Bill offers protection to the consumer in an area where it is badly needed.  It is difficult, particularly when Bills are initiated in the House and when one is in Opposition and does not have the back-up and resources one might have on the Government side, to understand and deal with amendments. That has been my experience with amendments on Report Stage of a Bill in particular.  However, if a Bill is being amended it means that the Minister and his or her staff are at least listening to and accepting some of the observations, criticism and recommendations of Members and lobbyists, who also have valid cases to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not entirely critical of the amendments.  However, it is probably more difficult for the Opposition to come to grips with amendments, especially with the number made to this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.  I am sure he will <Col N="585" /> introduce many more interesting and vital Bills during his term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I again pay tribute to the work of my predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, in initiating the legislation.  I regret the Bill has been concluded on the terms that were forced on us today. It is not the ideal way.  However, there are a number of things that can be said in mitigation.  The Bill was a long time in gestation and it took a long time to come through the Oireachtas.  It is true, perhaps, that it got through in a manner that was less than perfect.  However, as Deputy McGennis says, my predecessor and I have been open to accepting amendments.  As a result, consequent changes were necessary in the structure and technical arrangement of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis mentioned the impact of lobbyists.  This Bill has been subjected to the most inordinate lobbying. Lobbyists have followed the progress of the Bill from the Public Gallery from the first day and are here today even in these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is similar to that in the former Dublin County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is remarkably similar in some ways to the former Dublin County Council.  I do not suggest that the lobbyists will be happy with the outcome of the Bill because they do not mind my saying that they have been acting for sectional interests.  However, some of the amendments and a great many of the arguments put forward by the lobbyists have been given expression, maybe not exactly as they would like but in one fashion or another, in the Bill.  I referred to meetings we have had with The Irish Bankers Federation, the building societies, <Col N="586" /> the finance houses and so on, and we have gone some way towards accepting their arguments.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the important thing is that it is a better Bill, notwithstanding the fact that we would have perhaps preferred if there was more time available to us today for debate.  However, there is no doubt that it shifts the balance in the relationship between borrower and lender.  New rights are conferred on the consumer, the consumer has new protections and authority is reposed in the director to vindicate those rights.  It is a good day for the consumer.  Notwithstanding the exigencies of the circumstances we have today enacted a Bill that will have a major impact on the lives of a very great many citizens.  We occasionally enact Bills that do not have a far reaching impact, but this Bill will have a major impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.</P>
      <P>I am indebted to the persistence of Senators for staying with the debate today and I thank them all.  I wish to be associated with the remarks of Senator Dardis regarding the contribution of the staff of the House.  I thank them for their diligence.  I also thank my officials who have laboured in the vineyard for many hours above and beyond what is imposed today on their colleagues on the staff of the House.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Bill is rostered by agreement between the Whips in the other House for Thursday next.  As a result, I hope that by midnight on Thursday or thereabouts, if not earlier, the Bill will finally be through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This Bill will greatly improve the quality of life of the people.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 79(a) to section 50(3) in the name of Senator Dardis, which was agreed to today, should, in view of Government amendment No. 74, be a reference to subsection (1) of that section.</P>
