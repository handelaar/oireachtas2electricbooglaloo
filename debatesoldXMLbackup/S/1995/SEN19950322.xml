      <P>I regret to tell the House, before the Order of Business, that we have a vote of sympathy on the death of the late Deputy John Fox, a Member of the other House.  Following tradition, I will call the leaders of each group and anybody from County Wicklow who wishes to contribute may then do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past while, we have all become accustomed to votes of sympathy.  However, in almost all cases, we were speaking of somebody who had been taken from us in the fullness of time, somebody who had a led a full life and had retired.  In the case of the late Deputy Johnny Fox, we are talking of somebody who was taken from us suddenly and very tragically in the prime of his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Deputy Johnny Fox was a Member of Dáil Éireann for just over two years.  However, in that time, it is true to say that probably everybody in both Houses had their own special relationship with him and their own memory of him.  Everybody will recall <Col N="1090" /> his humour, common sense and tremendous humanity.  They will also recall his great love of County Wicklow and all its aspects, from its sport and environment to its people in particular.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Johnny Fox was very much a people's person.  It is important to remind ourselves that politics is as much, if not more, about people as it is about policies or principles.  Deputy Johnny Fox's love of the people of Wicklow, whom he was very proud to serve, came through in everything he did.  All of us who knew him knew that he was a person of integrity, somebody who was straight and who never took himself too seriously.  He could never be pompous and his wry ironic sense of humour was always evident.  He was also a person of great political and personal independence.  All of us have been genuinely touched by his sudden death and we will all mourn him personally. The people of County Wicklow will mourn in a very special way the passing of Deputy Johnny Fox.  On behalf of the House, I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife and children and to the people he served so well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I extend our sympathy to Susan and family on the death of the late Deputy Johnny Fox.  I had the pleasure of meeting Johnny on various Seanad election trails.  Even on one's first encounter of him, one felt one became his friend. This friendship extended to the House when he was elected.  He was a great character and an honourable and decent person.  Others from the party in the constituency will speak on other areas, but I express our deep regret that a great character and a very decent person was taken in so short a time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independents, I wish to say how deeply I regret the passing of Deputy Johnny Fox and I express our sympathy to his widow and children.  He was an example of the incredibly hard work put in by so many <Col N="1091" /> Deputies in large constituencies.  When one considers the day Deputy Johnny Fox had spent before his death, one cannot underestimate the work put in by such people.  In addition, he had the work on his farm, which also had to be kept going, and we all know of his involvement in sports in the area.</P>
      <P>I also wish to mention his involvement in the Church of Ireland within the diocese of Glendalough.  Without him, a large number of people will feel that a very strong voice for the whole community in the area is missing.  Whoever replaces him has a very serious job on hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We all mourn the passing of the late Deputy Fox and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats I extend our sympathy to his wife Susan, his family and his constituents.  The people of Wicklow were well served by a public representative of his calibre.  It was a shock to hear on Saturday morning of his sudden death on Friday night at a function where he was doing his elected duty of being with his constituents.  He was a model for public representatives and for society in the way he held to his beliefs and spoke out those beliefs without fear or favour.</P>
      <P>He was a good humoured, courteous and decent man in every respect and his loss will be greatly felt.  His passing underlines the commitment which public service requires and that there can be a high price to pay.  He was a man who crossed the religious, social and sporting divides in his county.  He will be greatly missed and we extend our sympathy to his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour group I join in extending our sympathy to the family of the late Deputy Fox.  As Senator Manning said, we all have personal memories of him.  I first met him when I went to canvass him in the Seanad campaign.  I went up the side of the Sugarloaf Mountain, up the narrow <Col N="1092" /> winding roads and into his farmyard. The picture we have seen on television greeted me &mdash; he came out on his tractor and gave me a warm reception, as I am sure he gave to all here who canvassed him.  My memory is of him sitting on his tractor, the farmer and the friendly politician.  He enjoyed being a politician and enjoyed representing his constituents.  He will be sadly missed by them, particularly, as he went at such a young age.  We extend our sympathy to his wife and family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>With many in Wicklow I find it impossible to come to terms with this tragedy.  It is a real tragedy for his family and many friends and for politics. The late Deputy Fox's sad departure is yet another tragic example of the toll political life exacts from an individual and the sacrifice it exacts from their family.</P>
      <P>I knew him for a long time and he was a unique character in many ways.  He was a hard man on the GAA field and he was also at home with the oval ball as he also played rugby &mdash; bans had no place in his sporting lexicon.  He was a hard man in politics as well.  We had many clashes while he was a member of Fianna Fáil and subsequently, but after a clash he always had a wry humour which could take the sting out of it.  He was a populist in the positive sense, yet he was never cowed by political correctness. If he believed the most unpopular line was one he should espouse he was quite willing to espouse it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although he was good at debate, his particular and unique strength was with the ordinary men and women of Wicklow. He had forged an extraordinary bond with people.  His real concern was the concerns of the individual, the concerns of the powerless citizen who had nobody to speak for them.  He ran up against officialdom and it would take a long time to record some of the more colourful incidents in the county council, <Col N="1093" /> for example, over a long career.  The unique aspect was that he always argued the case for the ordinary person.</P>
    <P>There are many people in Wicklow who are genuinely distraught at this loss.  I have not seen such grief among adults as I witnessed at his funeral in Kilmacanogue.  He leaves behind many heartbroken friends and, of course, a family &mdash; Susan, Mildred, Christopher, Ruth and his sisters Pat and Dorothy. They will never be able to replace him. They are good people and their strength, beliefs and faith will carry them through this.  We have all been enriched in no small way by our contacts with Deputy Fox.  He will be a hard man to follow.  There is a big gulf in politics in Wicklow and it will not be easily filled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with the vote of sympathy on the death of Deputy Fox.</P>
      <P>There are two striking characteristics of Deputy Fox's political career.  One was his deep convictions, which many of us did not hold or share, which he held with enormous dignity in very controversial circumstances and which he stuck to, as Senator Dardis said, through thick and thin.  The other characteristic, which Senator Roche touched on, was that although virtually everybody who came across Deputy Fox in politics disagreed with him at some stage, everybody left either the Chamber or Wicklow County Council a friend.  He never took any personal rancour outside any chamber in which he debated.  That is a particularly lasting and endearing characteristic which I shall remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a true Independent in that he spoke his mind, whether within or without the party &mdash; indeed, this was one of the reasons why he was not in a party at the end of his career.  He managed, even as an Independent, to put an extraordinary and unique coalition of forces together in County Wicklow.  He managed to draw rural and urban support <Col N="1094" /> from both male and female, young and old.  Deputy Fox enjoyed an exceptional and unique respect among every section of Wicklow society which, to its great credit, elected him at the last election.</P>
    <P>The last point we should remember about Deputy Fox, as Senator Roche rightly said, is that he was a populist. The small man or woman who had no one else to approach went to him.  He was the man who stood for the ordinary Wicklow person against the big battalions. That is how I will always remember him and I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy.</P>

      <P>Before we say a prayer, could I say that I too was deeply saddened to hear on Saturday of the death of Deputy Fox.  I heard about it on Saturday.  I have very happy memories of him over the years and I will miss him very much.  To me, he was very much his own man.  He arranged on my behalf and that of my family one of the loveliest holidays we ever had in County Wicklow a few years ago.  I regret his passing.  I was sad but at the same time honoured to attend his funeral on Sunday evening.  I offer my sympathy to Susan and his family on this very sad occasion.</P>

      <P>I have received notice from Senator Sherlock that on the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to establish a purpose-built neonatal unit to serve Cork city and county and to make the appropriate arrangements in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Brien of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment when he proposes to allocate £8 million funding under the INTERREG programme for county and regional roads; and if he will ensure that Cavan/Monaghan is given priority allocation in view of the very poor state of county roads in these counties.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give consideration to the proposal to establish a senior training centre for travellers in Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the results of a recent survey by ASH, which showed that 90 per cent of attempted purchases of cigarettes by children under 16 years were successful, the need for the Minister for Health to review the 1990 regulations governing same.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will request the British Home Office to initiate a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding <Col N="1096" /> the death of a person (details supplied) in London in December 1985 and the subsequent investigation until the body was returned to his family in Galway in early February 1986.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for the extension of the capacity of the sewerage plant in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, considering that the existing plant is unable to cope with the current demand.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Sherlock's and Senator O'Brien's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill is being initiated in this House. We will not oppose Second Stage <Col N="1097" /> because we will have an opportunity to improve the Bill on Committee Stage. Item 17 on the Dáil Order Paper today is a Fianna Fáil Bill on this issue in the name of Deputy O'Donoghue but we hope we will have a chance to improve the Government's Bill in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the need for a general and regular debate on foreign policy on a number of occasions and I note the new committee has been established. I know the Leader of the House agrees that we should have a regular debate on foreign policy rather than dealing with it on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis issue by issue &mdash; debating Tibet one day and East Timor the next.  Perhaps the Chairman of the foreign policy committee might be present for a debate on a report of that committee, an issue I raised last year.  We need to approach foreign policy imaginatively because it now touches on various areas, including neutrality, sovereignty, our relations with NATO and a host of other international organisations.  Rather than allowing foreign policy to develop in an <i>ad hoc</i> way, it should be structured.  We should debate it for one day every two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we do not oppose the Order of Business, in respect of item 1 and the remarks made by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil group, may I say that we have a similar Bill on the Order Paper.  As of now we intend to press the Bill, but we will wait to hear what the Minister has to say and to see what the outcome at the end of the Second Stage debate will be before we test that.</P>
      <P>Another matter I would like to raise with the Leader is the fluctuation on the currency market and the problems it is creating, particularly for those exporting food products and other materials.  I regard it as a matter of priority that we debate the currency issue and the economy in general at the earliest opportunity. This matter has been raised on several occasions over the past few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> I wish to clarify a matter relating to last week's business.  It was stated in the press and on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; that the Progressive Democrats withdrew an amendment to the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Bill, 1995. That was not the case.  The amendment was not withdrawn, it was put to a voice vote.  It was defeated by voice vote and there was no division.  It is important to put the record straight on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House whether he will give time to discuss item 4, the Freedom of Information Bill, which is being circulated in my name.  There is agreement on all sides of the House on this matter and it would be a good idea to initiate discussion in this House.  I would like to ask the Leader if it would be possible to find some time in the very near future to discuss the extraordinary proposition to sell local authority mortgages to lending agencies as a means of funding the long outstanding social welfare equality payments. There is a principle involved, I am sure the Leader will agree, that should be discussed in one or other of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Finally, I agree with Senator Dardis.  It would be timely for us to have a discussion on the whole issue of the fluctuations in our currency and in particular the evident confusion which seems to exist at a very high level in this matter.  It would be a good idea to have a debate in order that we could track the thing out, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader, following this morning's report in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on the report by the British Medicines Control Agency on the conditions in Pelican House, if we could have a discussion in this House as a matter of urgency and if the Minister for Health would make a full statement on the report.  It is outrageous, if what is stated in the paper is true, that such conditions exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> The Minister for Health has had the report of the expert committee on hepatitis C for the past six weeks and we still have not heard any of its recommendations. It is a matter of urgency, particularly for the women who have been contaminated with hepatitis C by the anti-D vaccine.  I ask him to arrange a debate on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask, in addition to Senator O'Toole, that we should have some sort of a structured debate on foreign policy on a regular basis.  This is very important in view of the day of the long knives that happened last week when so many of our ambassadors were shifted, willy-nilly it appeared, all over the place and three new embassies were opened.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should know why these people were shifted, why there are so many changes and why certain countries are picked to have new embassies when many other places are crying out for them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking with Senator O'Toole that we should have a continuum of structured debate here on foreign policy, which is becoming more and more important, whether it be in the field of human development, development aid, our involvement in the military field in terms of peace keeping or in whatever area.  It is an increasingly important area and we should have formal structured debates every two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if it would be possible to have a debate on communications and broadcasting.  We have seen leaked proposals in the paper over the weekend in relation to the whole broadcast media and it would be an ideal opportunity for us to have a discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure all sides of the House would like to join in congratulating Steve <Col N="1100" /> Collins on his great performance and for bringing great honour to this country last Saturday night.  It is great for Cabra. for Dublin and for Ireland.  It is a terrific time to be Irish all over the world.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Dardis in his request for an urgent debate on the currency crisis.  Exporters are extremely worried and there is a definite need for an urgent debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be a little unusual, but I ask the Leader of the House not to have a debate on the currency situation.  I have asked for such a debate in the past because it is better to have a debate when tensions are not high. This is the wrong time to discuss currency and perhaps the less said, the better. I hope we find another time to debate the currency situation and its long term implications.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the important question of foreign affairs.  I am conscious that we do not want to duplicate work being done by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  Nevertheless, there is a need for a forum, as a number of Members pointed out.  Perhaps we could call together ten Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and four Members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs to see if we could establish a link between this House and <Col N="1101" /> the two committees.  Perhaps, as Senator Lanigan suggested, we could arrange for a structured debate to take place in this House once every four, six or eight weeks so that Members of these committees could report on what is happening. However, we do not want to set ourselves up as a poor man's foreign affairs committee while the work will be done elsewhere.  We do not want to duplicate work, but we want to have a forum.  I will ask the rapporteur of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Senator Norris, to call together the ten and four Members, respectively, to see if we can make progress on this matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the business today and I am glad he has an open mind on that issue.  I agree with Senator Quinn on the currency situation.  We are long overdue a major debate on the economy and I will try to arrange one as soon as possible.  However, a debate on the currency crisis would probably not help at present.</P>
      <P>I have read Senator Roche's Freedom of Information Bill, 1995, which seems to be a useful contribution.  I suggest that he could begin this Bill in Private Members' Time, but I will make time available for a discussion on it.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Honan's point, I am afraid <i>The Cork Examiner</i> was sold out in Ballsbridge this morning, so I am not familiar with the report she mentioned. However, I will make inquiries and contact the Senator before the end of the day.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan made the point about foreign affairs and Senator Cassidy about broadcasting.  There is a Green Paper due shortly and I will ask the Minister to come in to address those issues.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am honoured to introduce this first piece of legislation in the Seanad today. It underlines the importance of the Seanad's work.</P>
      <P>This is a short but important Bill which has been quickly introduced to deal with problems which have arisen out of two recent judgments of the Central Criminal Court in connection with an incest case dealt with by that court.  I thank Senator Honan and Deputy O'Donoghue for the Private Members' Bills they have introduced to resolve those problems.  Unfortunately, I believe that their Bills would not achieve that purpose.  The effect of the judgements I have referred to is that information relating to the hearing of a prosecution for an incest offence cannot be disclosed.  The result is that a health board social worker, for example, concerned for the welfare of a child incest victim, could not be told whether the child's offending father had received a sentence for incest.  The social worker could not even be told that there had been a prosecution.  This situation is manifestly damaging to the interests of victims and potential victims of child sexual abuse.  It must be remedied without delay.  The main purpose of the Bill is to provide this remedy.</P>

    <P>For the avoidance of any doubt.  I should say that in commenting on the adverse effects of these judgements &mdash; something which I must do in the course of my statement &mdash; I am not, in the same breath, implying any criticism of the judge who made the decisions.  He dealt fully and carefully with the logic of the relevant statute.  It is evident from his judgments that he was most unhappy with the conclusions he felt obliged to reach.  The problem here is one for the Legislature, not the courts.  The Bill does not deal with all of the issues raised by the judgments &mdash; only with those which require an immediate and obvious response, if we are to ensure <Col N="1103" /> the protection of victims or potential victims of incest.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issues raised by the judgments, and indeed certain important issues in this area which are not affected by these judgments at all, it is, in my view vital, before we proceed to legislate, that we receive the opinions of others, including especially those with expertise in the area of child offending. To facilitate the necessary consultation process, I will shortly publish a comprehensive discussion paper on the issues involved.  I will return again to this consultation paper in the course of my statement.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to describe the provisions of the Bill it would be useful, by way of background, for me to clarify what is involved in the offence of incest and to outline the details of the Central Criminal Court judgments I have referred to.</P>
    <P>Incest is an offence which was created by the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908. Under section 1 of that Act, it is an offence for a male person to have sexual intercourse with a person who is, to his knowledge, his granddaughter, daughter, sister or mother.  Section 2 is the counterpart of section 1 and it provides that the offence is also committed by a female who, with consent and full knowledge of the family relationship involved, has intercourse with her grandfather, father, brother or son.</P>
    <P>Consent is not a defence to a charge of incest.  In that sense it is an absolute offence which is committed once intercourse takes place.  It should also be noted that where two adults within the same family engage in consensual intercourse, both the man and woman are liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>Incest is, of course, one of the charges that is frequently brought where a child has been sexually abused by a very close relative.  One of the reasons for this is that, as I have mentioned, it is an absolute offence, in so far as a male person is concerned and an absence of consent does not have to be proved.  Non-consensual intercourse constitutes rape and <Col N="1104" /> frequently both rape and incest are jointly charged.  Similarly if a girl victim is under age the perpetrator may be prosecuted for the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15 or 17, as the case may be, under section 1 or section 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, in addition to incest.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the Bill arises directly from the judgments of the Central Criminal Court in an incest case.  On 1 February 1995, the court held that section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, continues to have full force and effect.  That section provides that &ldquo;...all proceeding under this Act are to be held in camera&rdquo;.  The important words in this context are &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; because the court went on to rule that they must be taken to mean that all such proceedings must be held, to quote the court.  &ldquo;...in total privacy and secrecy with the admission of no persons, other than the immediate parties, including the Press... with the community at large not being entitled to know even of the happening of the case, let alone any sentence which might be imposed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A further judgment was delivered by the Central Criminal Court on 17 February, 1995, in connection with the same case, in which the court ruled that it was precluded by section 5 of the 1908 Act from disclosing whether the accused had been sentenced.  This was in response to an approach from the Eastern Health Board which had sought the relevant information because it was concerned for the health and safety of the children of the accused man.</P>
    <P>In this particular case the accused man had been charged with two counts of rape and two of incest.  He pleaded guilty to the incest charges and the rape charges were not proceeded with.  The application of section 5 of the 1908 Act only arose in relation to the passing of sentence for the incest offences.  In the light of its interpretation of section 5, the court determined that it had no discretion but to decide that sentencing should take place in the absence of interested parties &mdash; as distinct from <Col N="1105" /> immediate parties &mdash; the press and the general public.</P>
    <P>The significance of the Central Criminal Court rulings lies in the way in which the court interpreted the words &ldquo;<i>in camera&rdquo;</i> in the 1908 Act.  As far as I am aware, this is the first occasion that section 5 has been taken to have such a restrictive meaning.  Up to now the practice in the Circuit Court, where cases in which the sole charge is incest are tried, has been to exclude the public but to permit the press to attend and to report on the proceedings subject to certain restrictions.  Where incest has been joined with other charges triable in the Central Criminal Court under the Rape Acts, the practice has been to apply the provisions of those Acts which allow the general public to be excluded but the case to be reported by the press in accordance with a number of important conditions, for example, protection of the identity of the victim.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that it would not appear to have been open to the State, or any other party, to appeal the recent Central Criminal Court rulings to the Supreme Court.  The only way in which the Supreme Court could be asked to rule on these issues would be by way of separate legal proceedings which would have to be initiated in the High Court and it would inevitably take some time before the matter reached the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from various parties with an interest in the protection of children who have expressed very strong concerns to me about the effects of the recent judgments.  I share those concerns and, in particular, I believe that we should not tolerate a situation, which arose in the case in question, in which information vital to the interests of a child should be denied to a caring agency such as a health board.  Furthermore, I am personally convinced of the need to keep the public aware and vigilant of the fact that child sex abuse is actually occurring and that it is a crime of the most serious kind.  I fully recognise that the holding of incest cases in total secrecy <Col N="1106" /> could have the result of gradually pushing the subject under the carpet. No right-thinking person wants that.</P>
    <P>I also recognise that the judgments have given rise to anxiety among the Members of the Oireachtas.  In that context I specifically acknowledge the Private Members' Bill which has been introduced by Senator Cathy Honan. While I have no disagreement, in principle, with what the Senator has sought to achieve, I am satisfied, on the basis of the advice available to me, that her Bill could, if enacted, create serious &mdash; though obviously unintended &mdash; difficulties in the law relating to sexual offences.  Without going into detail in that regard, I might mention that the word &ldquo;complainant&rdquo; which would be applied to incest cases, through the Rape Acts, under Senator Honan's Bill would not be appropriate to a situation where incest is being charged arising out of consensual intercourse between adults.  In the circumstances I regret that I could not support that Bill.  Similarly, I am also afraid that I cannot accept the Private Members' Bill which has been presented in the other House.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill which is being taken in this House today, there are a number of preliminary comments I would like to make.  As I mentioned earlier, incest can be charged with other offences which are covered by the Rape Acts.  This is something that very frequently happens in cases involving child sex abuse.  The effect of the Bill in those cases will be to apply to them the provisions of the Rape Acts, which deal with the exclusion of the general public from court proceedings.  This will mean that the <i>in camera</i> rule of the 1908 Incest Act will not apply; the public will be excluded from any hearing but the press may attend and report on the proceedings subject to certain restrictions; the anonymity of the victim will be protected; and the verdict and sentence, if any, will be announced in public.  It is clear that, where they operate, these measures will fully address the concerns that have arisen out of the judgments of the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> In relation to those cases where the sole charge is incest, the Bill provides that the sentence and verdict, if any, will be announced in public and, while the <i>in camera</i> provision of the 1908 Act will otherwise continue in force, it will not be permitted to prohibit reporting of the sentence and verdict which does not identify the parties.</P>
    <P>Senators may feel that the Bill should go further by, in effect, restoring the position whereby the media could carry detailed reports, as distinct from reports confined to verdict and sentence, in cases where the sole charge was one of incest.  The Bill, of course, makes it clear that the pre-judgment reporting situation applies where there is a charge of rape as well as incest.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan's Bill endeavours to deal with this point but not.  I am advised, successfully.  My best advice is that there are technical and legal difficulties in the way of applying the Rape Acts provisions, as they stand, to cases of incest.  This has to do with the fact that incest can technically be deemed a consensual act where the parties to the offence are both adults.</P>
    <P>Given that the number of cases where the sole charge is one of incest is quite small, and the sizeable risk that the legislative adjustments necessary to remove the technicalities to which I have referred would delay the enactment of the essential protections for abused children in this Bill, my judgment was that it would be better to provide the core protections now and deal with the technicalities surrounding the issue of detailed media reporting in my discussion document.</P>
    <P>The net result of the course I have adopted is that social workers and other interested parties concerned with the protection of children, who need to have essential information concerning prosecutions, verdicts and so on for child sexual abuse, will be able to get that information, irrespective of whether the charge is one of incest alone or whether the incest charge is joined by a further charge.  That is a crucial <Col N="1108" /> point.  Where, as in the majority of cases, the incest charge is joined by a rape charge, the media reporting regime will be that applying under the Rape Acts.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, be glad to listen to what Senators may wish to say on this point, in particular, on Committee Stage.  I certainly intend to address the issue of reporting in my discussion paper.  I am aware, as most public representatives who deal day in and day out with members of the public will also be aware, that the nature of newspaper reporting on child sexual abuse cases is a subject on which many people have views.  It is right, in a democracy, that we provide room for debate on matters of this kind and it is absolutely vital that we acknowledge the enormous contribution made by the media in bringing the problem of child sexual abuse out from under the carpet and keeping it before our eyes.  Far too many children have been the victims of secrecy and silence</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the discussion paper, I should also mention that in it I also propose to raise the question of what reporting and related arrangements should operate in respect of other sexual offences where consent may or may not be an issue.  In addition to incest these include the following: unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15 or 17; sexual intercourse or buggery with a mentally impaired person; buggery of a person under 17; and gross indecency with a male under 17.</P>
    <P>I also intend to ascertain whether there is support for having a similar regime of reporting in relation to the offence of sexual abuse.  That offence, while it is provided as an offence in the Rape Acts, is not subject to the same reporting restrictions as rape offences in that regard, i.e. it is not an offence to prohibit the disclosure of the victim's name.  Senators may query the need for including various matters in a discussion paper rather than proceeding now to legislate on those matters.  I have decided on the former course, not out of any reluctance on my part to act, but <Col N="1109" /> simply in recognition of the wisdom of taking account of the views of individuals and organisations with recognised expertise on such matters before I act, and also because to do so in this Bill might cause a delay in dealing with this very important issue of the lack of protection of victims.  What I am doing today in this Bill is ensuring that if a similar case arises again in our courts the victim will be protected.  That is paramount in our considerations today. The victims of incest must be protected by our laws.</P>
    <P>I am not referring here to legal expertise alone.  I am particularly concerned to ensure that I have the benefit of the insight of individuals and organisations who have expertise in dealing with the problems of sexual offending generally, and a special understanding of the real needs of its victims.  I would urge that Senators accept the good sense of proceeding with the benefit of insight.  The sometimes obvious answer is not necessarily the right or complete one.  I am not being critical of anybody but sometimes we can jump to conclusions as to how a complex matter such as this should be handled.  I believe that the course of action I am taking today is the right one.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not of course envisage that the process of consultation should be allowed to drag on indefinitely. The preparation of my consultation paper is already well under way and my plan is to publish it within weeks, with a tight timetable for the receipt of responses and a firm commitment and determination on my part to bring such further proposals for law reform as may be required in this area before the Oireachtas with minimum delay.  I will listen very carefully to what Senators will say in the course of debate on this Bill on the need for further changes to the law relating to sexual offending.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 4 are standard provisions concerned with definition and the short title of the Bill and they do not require any special explanation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> The Bill has two substantive provisions which are sections 2 and 3 and in practice they will operate as alternatives. Section 2 is specifically designed to mitigate the effect of the very restrictive interpretation adopted by the Central Criminal Court in respect of section 5 &mdash; the <i>in camera</i> provision &mdash; of the 1908 Punishment of Incest Act.  Subsection (1) provides that in all proceedings relating to incest the verdict or decision and sentence, if any, must be announced in public notwithstanding the <i>in camera</i> provision of the 1908 Act.  This will mean that the general public and press will have a right to be present at that stage and the conviction and sentence will be a matter of public record.  In particular, it will put it beyond any doubt that caring agencies with an interest in establishing whether or not an accused has been convicted of incest and sentenced to a term of imprisonment will be able to do so.  In that sense the subsection overcomes the specific problem that was highlighted in the ruling of 17 February 1995.</P>
    <P>Although the verdict and sentence will be announced in public and could disclose the name of the accused, section 2 will not allow general publication in newspapers or elsewhere of the names of the parties involved and the subsection makes this clear.  It is obvious why that must be there: the name of the accused in an incest case will immediately identify the victim.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 2 deals with a different matter.  One implication of the recent ruling is that the requirement to hold the proceedings <i>in camera</i> means not only that the public or the press cannot have access to the proceedings themselves but that there can be no reporting of any kind of what went on in the proceedings.  Up to now it has always been accepted practice that incest proceedings can be reported, provided that confidential matters are not revealed.  If no reporting of any kind were to be allowed then important legal and social issues might never come to light.  Accordingly, subsection (2) makes it clear that, notwithstanding section 5 <Col N="1111" /> of the 1908 Act, there will be no prohibition on a report of verdict and sentence in incest proceedings being prepared, and there will be no prohibition on such matters being published provided the identity of the parties and sensitive information is not given out.  This will ensure that incest cases can be reported in the media and that they can also be appropriately covered in law reports etc.</P>
    <P>In practice, section 2 of the Bill will only be relevant in incest cases where there is no associated charge of rape or aggravated sexual assault because the effect of section 3 is that section 5 of the 1908 Act will not apply to proceedings where rape is charged along with incest.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is concerned with incest cases where both a rape offence and incest have been charged in the same proceedings and, in practice, it is likely to apply to the vast majority of incest cases which come before the courts, particularly those relating to child sex abuse.  The main reason it has been included in the Bill is to prevent a situation developing where, because of the recent Central Criminal Court rulings, the court would feel it necessary to direct that joint incest and rape charges should be tried separately.  I am sure Senators would agree with me that such a development would be wholly undesirable, especially since a victim could be faced with having to give evidence in different sets of proceedings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) is the substantive provision and applies to proceedings which relate to both incest and rape, rape under section 4 of the 1990 Act or aggravated sexual assault.  The subsection also specifically covers proceedings which &ldquo;at any time, related&rdquo; to both incest and rape.  This wording is intended to include proceedings, such as the recent case in the Central Criminal Court, where the accused was originally charged with both rape and incest but at a later stage he pleaded guilty to incest alone and the rape charges were not pursued.  In such cases the subsection provides that section 5 of the 1908 Act <Col N="1112" /> will not apply so that the proceedings will not be held <i>in camera.</i>  However, section 6 of the 1981 Rape Act will apply so that the general public will be excluded but the bona fide representatives of the press and other persons permitted by the judge can attend, and the verdict or decision and the sentence, if any, will be announced in public.</P>
    <P>Because of the link with the rape offence charge there is no need to make any specific provision for the anonymity of the victim.  Section 7 of the 1981 Rape Act applies once a rape charge is brought and continues to apply, even if the rape charge is subsequently dropped.  The wording of section 7 of that Act is such that it would be an offence to publish or broadcast, without a court order, the name of any party in an incest case where rape has also been charged.  Section 8 of the 1981 Rape Act which provides for the anonymity, up to conviction, of the accused would also apply but it is of no significance as clearly in an incest case the name of the accused or convicted person could not be published without revealing the identity of the victim.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this Bill is not being put forward as a solution to all the problems which have emerged following the rulings of the Central Criminal Court to the effect that section 5 of the 1908 Act requires that incest proceedings must take place in secrecy.  Rather, it is intended to address immediately the concerns that arise from those rulings which can and ought to be addressed now.  The effect is to make certain that the outcome of incest cases can be disclosed to interested parties and can be published in the media subject, of course, to certain restrictions.  The Bill provides for these matters in respect of all incest proceedings.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that there are other issues which also arise in that context and I propose to deal with them in a discussion paper.  I will also be listening to what is said here in the House.  I would, of course, be more than willing to consider any specific proposals <Col N="1113" /> Senators may have in relation to what might go into that discussion paper.</P>
    <P>I believe that the approach I have adopted &mdash; to deal with the immediate problems now and the wider issues which arise after appropriate consultations &mdash; is the correct one and certainly the best way of ensuring that the legislation which is undoubtedly required in relation to the operation of section 5 of the Incest Act is enacted as quickly as possible.  I could delay bringing in this Bill and run the risk of another similar incest case coming before our courts while we have discussions and another victim of incest could be unprotected by the rules which have existed since the Central Criminal Court decision.  I will listen carefully to what Senators say on this Bill.  If improvements or better solutions are proposed I will take them on board.  My position when dealing with legislation will be not to keep a text simply because it is mine if a manifestly better solution is offered.  I believe there is widespread general support for the provisions of the Bill and I hope and expect that support will be shared by Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I realise Senator Honan's Bill may go further than this one but I ask Senators to recognise this is an urgent step which is required to change our legislation. While it may not do all everyone wants, it is better to pass this Bill and work on further provisions to ensure that the rights and safety of victims of child sexual abuse, however and wherever it happens, are protected in our legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad; this is her second visit in a short time.  It is a compliment to this House that she chose to introduce this important legislation here.  It is also a good idea to do so because it gives us a chance to deal with some of the issues the Minister is keen to address, perhaps not in great detail but covering the broader policy areas.  I thank her for her speech, which set out the meaning of the Bill's provisions and some background <Col N="1114" /> as to her thinking on what is to come in the future.</P>
      <P>It is good for democracy that the Legislature and the Executive can act quickly when a matter of this urgency arises.  Since the original judgment by Mr. Justice Carney was delivered on 1 February and the second judgment on 17 February, we have had, barely a month later, in strict chronological order, Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill, the Progressive Democrats' Bill and the Minister's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan's Bill came first, mine was second and Deputy O'Donoghue's was third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  There has been no delay in the response of the Legislature and the Executive to this serious problem.</P>
      <P>The nature of incest has not changed since 1908 but what has happened is that people are more aware, social agencies are more active in helping and people are more educated.  We are increasingly aware of a problem which appears to be fairly widespread.  I use those words carefully because as the Minister will agree we do not know the extent of the problem.  I was informed that only 5 per cent of confirmed incest cases and confirmed child sexual abuse cases go to court.  I do not know whether that figure is correct, nor what percentage of abuse, child sexual abuse in particular, is prosecuted or successfully prosecuted.</P>
      <P>One point the Minister is seeking to address is the need for more information and I support her in that.  Until we have the information we will not know the extent of the problem.  That is a basic matter and in her consultation with the agencies the Minister will have been informed of the total lack of information. There are no national statistics on child sexual abuse and I ask her to address that as a matter of urgency in her consultation paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is similar in relation to rape cases.  Only 30 per cent of such cases reported to the Rape Crisis Centre <Col N="1115" /> are reported to the Garda.  Not everyone who is unfortunate enough to be a victim of rape makes a complaint; and of those cases that are reported only 30 per cent are prosecuted by the Garda. A small proportion of those will be prosecuted once the DPP has made a decision.  Although the Bill is primarily about incest some of its provisions address rape.  The Minister will accept that in relation to cases of incest and rape we do not have a full body of knowledge.  The Minister is anxious to deal with the problem but we cannot do so comprehensively unless we have adequate information.</P>
    <P>In 1908 there was no television, the cinema had barely started and there were some newspapers being sold on street corners.  There were no active media.  When it was decided that incest cases would be heard <i>in camera</i> there was unlikely to be a furore about it. Although humanity's interest in crime has always been intense, censorship acted at that time to deny the public an interest in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister has correctly pointed out the implications of the two recent decisions, the principal one being that of Mr. Justice Carney on 1 February 1995. The National Newspapers of Ireland said it would launch a constitutional challenge but it appears the Minister's advice is the decision was not necessarily a bad one and may have been correct on the law as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As it was mentioned in the 1961 Act the previous provisions gained a measure of constitutionality. The Constitution states the administration of justice will be conducted in <Col N="1116" /> public save in accordance with law.  We as legislators will have to decide, in respect of any class of cases, whether this is to be one of the exceptions to the principle that justice be administered in public.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone will advocate that incest cases should be reported in public and I would disagree with anyone who did.  As the Minister said the first principle of all legislation dealing with such cases is that the victim must be protected; that must be the primary and paramount consideration.  Where the case is proven, victims' lives may have been shattered or ruined.  They may never recover; they may have had their childhood stolen from them.</P>
      <P>The least they can expect from us as legislators is the protection of anonymity. After a case, they should be able to pick up the pieces of their lives and proceed in a dignified and private way. There is no question that the identity of the victim must be protected.  Such protection must be strong, vigorous and beyond the discretion of a judge.  This may have to be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The final sentence of section 2(2) which states &ldquo;and do not include information that the judge or the court has directed should not be made public&rdquo; seems to give the judge a discretion.  It would, of course, be dangerous to fetter totally the discretion of a judge hearing a case because there might be exceptional cases where something would have to be mentioned.  However, as a general principle, the revelation of the identity of a victim should almost be beyond discretion.  Any legislation doing that will have my support and that of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I echo the Leader of our party in the Seanad in saying that we will not, in principle, be opposing this Bill.  We commend what the Minister has done because there is an urgent need, especially <i>vis-á-vis</i> the health and welfare agencies which, acting on behalf of the people, have a legitimate interest in finding out whether a child who has been abused is in danger of being <Col N="1117" /> abused again.  In so far as the Minister's Bill focuses primarily on the ambition to protect the identity of the victim and the need for welfare agencies to protect the victim from further abuse, it is to be supported.  I am happy that section 2 (1) achieves that.  There might be room for some amendments.  I ask whether the word &ldquo;charges&rdquo; should be included with the verdict, decision and sentence but again that is a matter for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done something which is sometimes done to us in local authorities and she will be aware of this, having been a member of a local authority. Members may propose something to the city or county manager who will say that he or she has taken advice on the matter and that it cannot be done. The Minister will know from her own experience that this can be very frustrating because when one asks to see or argue against the advice, the manager replies that he or she has the advice of the law agent and going against it could mean that the authority would be surcharged, abolished or get into difficulties. The Minister is, to an extent, using that device.  She said that in considering the two other Bills which were published &mdash; the Progressive Democrats' Bill and the Fianna Fáil Bill introduced in the Dáil by Deputy O'Donoghue &mdash; her advice was that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;complainant&rdquo; might introduce legal difficulties and technicalities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not disagree with the Minister, not because I am not capable of it but because I do not have the time, resources and expertise which were available to her.  I accept the bona fides of the Minister when she says that she will come back to the Oireachtas with more wide ranging proposals.  Having said that, we have to deal with the document before us and ask whether it is a good Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say that parts of section 2 (2) give me difficulty.  It states &ldquo;nothing in the said section 5 shall be construed <Col N="1118" /> as prohibiting the publication of reports of proceedings...&rdquo;.  Reports of proceedings are not defined.  Could it be open to the interpretation that it is merely a legal report of proceedings? That question will have to be addressed. The subsection continues &ldquo;...that do not identify, or include anything likely to lead members of the public to identify, a person involved in the proceedings and do not include information that the judge or the court has directed should not be made public&rdquo;.  I have already referred to the issue of judicial discretion and I will return to it.</P>
    <P>Reporting of proceedings has to be addressed because, although there are disadvantages, it is better that society be allowed report in a general way on these cases.  We must of course protect the identity of the persons concerned. There are people who say that some of the reporting of sexual offences is lurid while others say that it is merely designed to sell newspapers or increase circulation.  However, another argument is that Ireland, as a country, has learnt from the reporting of these cases.</P>

      <P>I agree it is a question of balance and there is no easy answer. The recent terrible case from the west of Ireland was an incest case.  Perhaps the Minister knows why it was reported notwithstanding the sanction of the 1908 Act.</P>

      <P>Yes.  However horrible that may have been, it may have helped us to grow up as a nation.  It may help us learn something about ourselves that, since 1908, has been swept under the carpet.  The Minister said that in her own speech.  We may have to report these matters for a while in order to become aware of the nature and extent of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> It is important for sociologists and people working for the agencies dealing with child abuse and sexual abuse to know the detail of some of these cases. This is the central criticism of this Bill. As the Minister said, it maintains the <i>in camera</i> status of incest cases, meaning that people from the welfare agencies, the rape crisis centres and the child support agencies will not be able to attend these court hearings.  The Minister will agree that is correct.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister intends to address this in the future but the point is often made by the agencies that the victim in many incest cases can be so alienated from their family that they do not want a member of the family with them and would often prefer to be accompanied by a friend.  That is a very important point.  Even though this is an emergency Bill, it offers an opportunity to the Minister to consider allowing friends of victims of child sexual abuse and incest to go into court with them to assist them through their trauma.  That is not to say that people from the agencies should be prosecutors or persecutors. Victims need support and there is a case for allowing people from support agencies to go into court with them as a friend.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill can be referred to on Committee Stage.  It is an important technical matter.  There will not be much disagreement on it because it remedies an obvious problem.  Subject to the legal advice the Minister has, I believe that the remedy proposed by Deputy O'Donoghue was a very good one.  The proposal was to take the provision in the 1990 Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act which deals with the attendance of other people in court and simply apply it to incest cases.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the 1990 Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, in relation to rape and sexual assault cases, states:</P>
    <P>...shall exclude from the court during the hearing all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, <i>bona</i><Col N="1120" /><i>fide</i> representatives of the Press and other such persons (if any) as the judge, the justice or the court, as the case may be, may in his or its discretion permit to remain.</P>
    <P>Section 11(3) is very important.  It states:</P>
    <P>Subsections (1) and (2) are without prejudice to the right of a parent, relative or friend of the complainant or, where the accused is not of full age, of the accused to remain in court.</P>
    <P>The Minister may correct me, but, as I understand the Bill, if these proceedings are to maintain their <i>in camera</i> status, there is now the possibility that parents, relatives or friends would not be allowed into the courtroom if a judge took a very restrictive view of the 1908 Act.  The Minister is shaking her head so I think she will assist me in this matter. It would be a terrible result if &mdash; to use a horrible phrase &mdash; the friendly parent of a child sexual abuse victim was not allowed in court.  It would also be terrible if the friend or relative of such a victim was not allowed in court.</P>
    <P>I welcome the speed with which the Minister has introduced this Bill.  I fully endorse the part of the Bill which undoes the inability of health care agencies to get vital information from the courts about prosecutions under the incest Act.  However, I wish to insert a caveat in relation to section 2 (2), which requires further consideration, and the Fianna Fáil Party will be most constructive in seeking to amend the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her on producing her first piece of comprehensive legislation as Minister for Justice.  I also congratulate her for the speed with which she has responded to the decision of the court in the matter of DPP <i>v.</i> W.M.  It is important that such issues are responded to as quickly and comprehensively as possible.  The Minister has made it quite clear that to take a full and comprehensive approach would take an inordinate amount of time and <Col N="1121" /> the situation at present, which is totally unacceptable, would pertain during that time.  We welcome the speed of the response and it is important to acknowledge it.</P>
      <P>When delivering his judgment on 1 February in the Central Criminal Court, in the case of DPP <i>v.</i> W.M., Mr. Justice Carney was well aware of the anomaly created in the administration of justice by his judgment that incest cases must be heard <i>in camera.</i>  As the judge said, whatever the law states, hundreds of people, whether directly involved in the case as members of the jury panel or through reports passed by word of mouth, will effectively penetrate the secrecy in every detail.  In other words, there is no such thing as absolute secrecy in such situations.</P>
      <P>However, nothing can appear in the newspapers or the broadcast media. Under the law as it stands, they are forbidden to report on what is one of the most frightening and important aspects of Irish life in the 1990s.  As the law stands, the public must remain totally unaware of the nature of the crime, the torture it inflicts on victims, often for many years, and the extent and type of terror imposed on the family involved in such crimes.  I congratulate the Minister for moving so quickly to address the immediate problem which has arisen as a result of the decision on 1 February and the statements on 17 February in the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>The Minister has acted with a sense of urgency to introduce amending legislation to deal with the ruling that section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, precludes the disclosure of the verdict and sentence in the case of incest, even to a health board official and others involved in the caring professions who are perhaps responsible at the time for the child victim.  It inhibits and restricts the treatment and response of the caring professions to a victim who may be experiencing extreme difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our democracy, it is most important that one of the most dreadful crimes must not be judged in secret.  The <Col N="1122" /> public is entitled to know that such cases exist and the details of any sentences which are imposed.  There must be transparency regarding the application of the law.  The situation at present is unacceptable and reading through Mr. Justice Carney's impeccable judgment, it is clear that this is also his view.  The 1908 statute, which introduced <i>in camera</i> hearings for incest cases, lapsed as a result of the Constitution, which allowed secrecy only in special and limited cases as defined by subsequent legislation.</P>
    <P>It was revised by the 1961 Act, which effectively reintroduced the provisions of the 1908 Act.  It has survived further changes in the law which have given the media a right to attend and report on rape cases, subject to certain safeguards. The legislation passed in 1981 and amended in 1990 did not extend to incest cases, though there is no conceivable reason why all sexual crimes cannot be treated in exactly the same way as under those Acts.</P>
    <P>What in the 1908 Act was suppressed, in order to maintain the fiction of innocence in family relationships, provides a poor guide today when suppression means that many young victims are kept in a state of ignorance about the crime to which they are subjected.  Ignorance means that they remain vulnerable to exploitation and are discouraged from seeking help.  It is intolerable that a law which has this result should remain on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that in every case under the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, the verdict and sentence, if any, must be announced in public.  This means that the fact that an incest prosecution has taken place and the sentence is a matter of public record.  This is as it should be; it is important that such information is available to the public.</P>
    <P>It is important for the credibility of the administration of justice and the agencies of justice, from the Garda to the Judiciary, that the public is informed of what is happening and how the process is used.  Secrecy breeds suspicion.  It <Col N="1123" /> is a main plank of our democratic institutions that the public is informed of the application of justice.  This information oils and enhances the acceptability of the system.  It is important that the Bill also ensures that persons with an interest in the outcome of particular cases will be able to establish whether the accused has been convicted and, if so, the sentence handed down by the courts.  I have already referred to these agencies.</P>
    <P>The greater openness in recent years about the crime of rape, as mentioned by Senator Mulcahy, has had a salutary effect on public understanding of the issue.  It has made it easier for victims to come forward and give evidence. Incest imposes even greater psychological and social barriers to disclosure and this must be acknowledged.  I am pleased the Minister has responded so quickly to Mr. Justice Carney's ruling which highlighted the inadequacy of the present legislation.</P>
    <P>It is important in cases of incest that the victim is fully protected.  In the Bill the approach proposed by the Minister is that where a verdict or sentence is announced in public no information which is likely to lead to the identification of the persons involved in the case may be published.  Specific provisions are also made for the reporting of incest cases provided the identity of the parties is protected and confidential information is not disclosed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that in a further examination of the effects of these rulings consideration will also be given to amending the legislation further to bring it into line with the conditions that exist for the attendance of the press and certain other persons as allowed under the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  The Minister has pointed out that the inclusion of wider reporting facilities in this amendment would have caused undue delay in tackling the immediate problem of lack of disclosure of the verdict and the sentence to the caring agencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> I welcome the provision made in the Bill to cover cases where a person is charged with incest and rape or an aggravated sexual assault, which is almost invariably the case.  There is a potential conflict between the recent Central Criminal Court interpretation of section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908 and the Criminal Law (Rape) Acts, 1981 and 1990, under which the public is excluded from hearings but the press and certain other persons may attend, and the verdict and sentence must be announced in public.</P>
    <P>To remove this conflict the Bill provides that where incest and rape are charged jointly the provisions of the Acts dealing with rape will apply in so far as attendance at the proceedings is concerned.  This will also be the position where a person is originally charged with both rape and incest but the rape charges are not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Child abuse is a fact of Irish society in the 1990s.  It must be recognised and eliminated as far as possible.  Everything possible must be done to help eliminate it.  No resources of the State must be spared in doing this.  The State has a special duty to children and it must respond to its responsibility with all available resources.  Abuse or neglect is not confined to children too young to run away or to inform the authorities. It exists in all communities; it occurs in settled rural communities just as it may occur in high social stress urban areas. Social isolation may be a feature in families in which incest, child abuse or neglect occurs.</P>
    <P>As has been shown in several high profile cases in recent times, ongoing contact with services is, unfortunately, no guarantee the abuse will be identified and stopped.  Professionals can often find it impossible to get to the truth.  This problem must be addressed; there must be an acceptable code of practice or procedure of co-operation for parents.  We do not want such a code to be overtly intrusive but professionals too often find cases where resistance, deceit, hostility and even threats or intimidation can thwart their best <Col N="1125" /> efforts in trying to obtain information where incest and abuse is suspected.</P>
    <P>It is a thankless task for a lone professional to visit isolated and sometimes hostile households, especially if the professional is a young person and is alone, as often is the case.  We should acknowledge the debt we owe to individual social workers.  We need to ensure they have the legal powers, training, supervision and physical back-up to protect the child, to help them preserve their own objectivity and good judgment, and to guarantee their physical safety in doing their work.</P>
    <P>For the authorities to act in a case of incest, child neglect or abuse they must first know about it.  That may sound obvious but it is important.  The victim must be able to tell and be heard and adults must be able to speak for the child.  Victims are often isolated and intimidated into silence, even where they are old enough to speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Adult relations or even professionals may also be intimidated, ignorant of the harm being caused to the child.  They may fear the consequences of reporting for themselves, or the consequences for the child of telling the authorities.  They may fear legal or physical retribution, or may feel in some way contaminated by association with the terrible events they know about.  Sometimes adults wonder whether action will be taken by the authorities which will improve the child's position.  Cases of abuse of children while they are in care for their protection indicate how such doubts are not necessarily unfounded.</P>
    <P>What is to be done to ensure that cases come to light in time?  First, it is essential for all professionals and citizens to believe that abuse and neglect occur, and that abuse and neglect are harmful and, sometimes, potentially lethal.  This may seem obvious but we are still in a stage of understanding what is happening in society in this regard. Second, it is essential that everybody be alert to the possibility that children may be suffering maltreatment in the most unlikely situations and at the hands of <Col N="1126" /> the most unlikely perpetrators.  Third, parents, teachers and, indeed, all of us must listen carefully to what children are trying to tell us in words, appearances, behaviour and body language.</P>
    <P>In response to the problem of finding cases in time there have been frequent calls for the introduction of mandatory reporting.  Mandatory reporting is in operation in a number of jurisdictions abroad and places a legal duty to report concerns or suspicions of child abuse on named categories or professionals, for example, doctors, social workers and teachers.  Those who favour it see mandatory reporting as a way of making sure that no known or suspected cases remain hidden because of professional ambivalence or fear of repercussions.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose it worry that it could lead to a flood of referrals, not all urgent, which would snarl up an already hard pressed system and distract attention from the really serious new cases and from the routine work necessary to support the monitoring of existing cases. I do not know if this is an issue for consideration by the Minister for Justice as it may be in the Minister for Health's ambit.  However, it is important this aspect be looked at in the broadest sense to see how it would operate in practice in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>What needs to happen to reduce the risk of such cases?  Over the past few years we have called for the full implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991 and the recommendations of the report on the Kilkenny incest case.  We have had comprehensive discussions on them in this House and they are being mentioned again.  We should let health boards address the factors which inhibit people from making referrals, including misunderstandings on how cases should be dealt with, and must ensure legal immunity for those who make a referral to the authorities in good faith out of concern for the child.  Key professionals like casualty officers in hospitals, general practitioners, teachers, psychiatrists and psychologists should receive intensive training on their role and responsibilities in these cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> I want to refer to an important statement on children made recently by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Currie.  He said that too much emphasis may be placed on the perpetrator rather than on the child victim at the centre of the case.  In cases of this nature our focus has to be unambiguously child centred.  A crucial and central factor to this and other recent cases have been the breach of trust in child-adult relationships.  In any area where an adult is in a position of responsibility, either explicitly or implicitly, for a minor, it is clear that great power for good or ill is vested in the adult.  The maintenance of relationships of trust between an adult and a minor is of particular importance in all areas of child care.  Indeed, it is central and essential that a grave abuse of trust by an adult in relation to a child should be regarded with the utmost severity by society.  We cannot over-emphasise what the Minster of State has stated with regard to this matter.  Indeed, in traditional, so called unsophisticated societies, violations of a trusting relationship involving children and females were taboo, putting the perpetrator outside the pale of society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is publishing a discussion paper.  The complexities surrounding this area must be fully explored and the views of all the relevant organisations &mdash; the NGOs &mdash; who have an interest in this area must be considered.  This is an important consultative process which ensures that when the legislation is finally introduced, it covers all aspects of the situation. All the interest groups and caring organisations should feel that they have had an input and can feel that they have ownership by virtue of the fact that they were consulted.  It is important when legislating that we have the confidence of the people who are closest to this issue.  Surely there must be nobody closer than the caring associations.  The Minister is correct in ensuring that time is taken to introduce the final legislation in this area while correcting the immediate <Col N="1128" /> problem.  I am confident that the Minister will introduce the legislation as soon as possible because it is urgently required.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister will extend the area with regard to reporting and related arrangements in respect of other sexual offences where consent may or may not be an issue and that she will include the area of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 17 years of age, of sexual intercourse or buggery with a mentally impaired person, buggery of a person under 17 years of age and gross indecency with a male under 17 years of age.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as the Minister has said, is not being put forward as a solution to all the problems that have emerged following the ruling of the Central Criminal Court to the effect that section 5 of the 1908 Act requires that incest proceedings must take place in secrecy.  It is important to address the concerns that arise from these rulings and we welcome the fact that this is happening.  It is important that the outcome of incest cases can be disclosed to interested parties and published in the media, subject of course to the restrictions contained in the Bill.  The Bill provides for these matters in respect of all incest proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that she fully appreciates there are other issues that give rise to concern and they will be dealt with in the discussion paper.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill in this House.  This House is in a unique position, because of our role and the elective process, to consider these matters and deal with these issues in a more apolitical and objective way than the Dáil, as we have already seen from Senator Mulcahy's contribution.  A development like this should be encouraged. If there are restrictions in doing this, the House should take them on board as well.  I again commend the Minister for bringing this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>From one constituency colleague to another, I wish the Minister <Col N="1129" /> well in her new portfolio.  It seems to be a tradition in north Dublin that we provide Ministers for Justice on a regular basis.  I also welcome the Minister's commitment to listen to what Senators have to say.  However, I am afraid to tell the Minister that those are the most positive comments I will be making.</P>
      <P>I do not have any great problem with the contents of the Bill.  It meets the needs that arose out of Mr. Justice Carney's judgment.  My concern lies with what is not in the Bill and I am not prepared to put this on hold any longer.</P>
      <P>I would like to quote from the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908: &ldquo;Any male person who has carnal knowledge of a female person who is to his knowledge, a granddaughter, daughter, sister, mother etc. shall be guilty of a misdemeanour&rdquo;. I do not believe the Minister is happy to allow incest to be continued to be described in this fashion in our law.  It does not reflect the Minister's views on the matter.  At the end of the day, I could not support a Bill which does not even seek to address that issue.</P>
      <P>In her speech, the Minister clearly explained the issues that brought her to the point of producing this legislation. However, this Bill is not enough.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to say that it is not enough and that she will come back with more.  This is the time to do it.  After all the pain, suffering, angst, debate and rhetoric following the apparently unceasing stream of child abuse cases with which we have occupied ourselves over the last two years, it is incomprehensible and reprehensible that the Government should continue to hold the view that incest is merely a misdemeanour. We are dealing with this problem on a day to day basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is minimalist.  It is almost invisible in addressing the issues.  It fails to address those aspects of incest and child abuse which have regularly impacted on and occupied all our minds over the last few years.  The Bill in its present form is unacceptable, not for what is in it but for what should be, which I hope can be added to it during the course of discussion in this House.  It is inadequate <Col N="1130" /> because it does not deal in any additional way with the protection of children or in the punishment of offenders.  It allows incest to remain a misdemeanour and a crime less serious than rape.  It does not deal with sexual assault and fails to protect children from rape.</P>
    <P>This Bill sends out a most negative signal.  I must put it in a context which I know will make the Minister feel as uncomfortable as it makes me.  We are in breach of the UN Charter on the rights of the child &mdash; I have said that many times &mdash; but closer to home, we have failed to implement more than 50 sections of the Child Care Act and the recommendations of the report on the Kilkenny incest case.  We may now be failing to grasp an opportunity to protect young people from rape, incest and child abuse.  Somebody must shout stop, but who will if the Minister does not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify something Senator O'Toole said.  In 1993, under the Criminal Justice Act, the offence of incest was changed dramatically by introducing a maximum penalty of 20 years.  The misdemeanour argument which the Senator made was addressed in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and it is a valid point.  I would like to give an example as to why it should not be a misdemeanour.  Members will have read about a horrific case in the newspapers three weeks ago where an uncaring, irresponsible father forced his son to have sex with his daughter.  This father is not guilty of any offence under this legislation because the crime is a misdemeanour. I will put down an amendment to replace the word &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; with &ldquo;felony&rdquo; so anybody who aids or abets such a crime is himself or herself guilty.  That was the point I was making.  I accept what the Minister said but I hope she will accept my amendment.  I will also put down an amendment which will do something similar to what was done in the 1993 Act, except I will give discretion to the <Col N="1131" /> court to leave it at imprisonment for life without a minimum sentence.  There is a minimum sentence in the 1908 Act, although I am not enamoured by minimum or mandatory sentencing policy.</P>
      <P>I want to take issue with another point in the Minister's speech which, I believe, is inadequate.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Consent is not a defence to a charge of incest.  In that sense it is an absolute offence which is committed once intercourse takes place&rdquo;.  That is another major flaw in this legislation. To indicate that incest can only take place in the event of proven full sexual intercourse is unacceptable.  The Minister must include sexual assault in the category of incest.  I will put down an amendment to include sexual assault as described under sections 4 and 12 of the 1990 or 1981 Act.  That will, therefore, constitute incest in this area.</P>
      <P>I would like to make another point about that comment in the Minister's speech.  I am not speaking as a lawyer &mdash; I have taken no legal advice &mdash; but as a politician.  It states that it is an offence once intercourse takes place.  I have already given one reason why I have difficulty with that and why it should include sexual assault.  Section 1(3) of the 1908 Act states that if any male person attempts to commit any such offence he shall be guilty of it.  It is not right that somebody is guilty only if intercourse takes place.  There is also attempted sexual assault.  This is unclear in the Bill because it does not define incest so I must go along with what is written there and what has been done in the meantime in terms of amending legislation.  This issue must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about sexual intercourse between people who are under age and what we must do about it.  Ten years ago a Member of this House and of the Minister's party lost the whip on the basis that he refused to accept that criminal responsibility should be set at seven years of age.  I was not a Member of the House at that time &mdash; I was outside the gate protesting.  I am still sore <Col N="1132" /> about criminal responsibility being on a par with the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>An eight year old can be found guilty and held responsible for taking a decision to murder somebody under our legislation, but a 13 or 14 year old cannot give consent to sexual intercourse.  I am not raising that issue, but the reverse side of it.  Because he or she does not have the legal entitlement to give consent, he or she cannot refuse it.  Hence we have come up with an extraordinary crime &mdash; unlawful carnal knowledge.  If an under aged girl is forced to have sex, it becomes unlawful carnal knowledge. Words are important and the Minister knows that is rape and should be called rape.  Somebody said to me that unlawful carnal knowledge sounds good or, at worst, it is no more than looking at a dirty book.  We must address these issues.  I will put down another amendment to include sexual assault under incest.</P>
    <P>I got post last week from teachers who were appalled at the judgment in the X case.  I cannot come to terms with that, but I will not go into it now. Senator Neville spoke about the involvement of teachers and other workers in this area.  I plead with the Minister to bring in mandatory reporting as soon as possible.  The only way teachers, who are the same as neighbours, care workers and others in charge of children, can be protected is if they do not have to decide whether they should or should not pass on information. It should be part of what they do.</P>
    <P>The worst thing about the 1908 Act is that it reflects that time when the family was inviolable and the father ran the family.  If he did something wrong with his daughter, it was a misdemeanour.  I take issue with Senator Neville who said child sexual abuse is something we must come to terms with or is something of modern times.  It always happened, but has only now come to light.  Attempts were made to deal with it in 1908.  The Minister now has an opportunity to deal with it and the issues I raised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> I am not an expert in this area; I am simply responding to this legislation as an ordinary punter who has experience in the teaching area, who is an elected public representative and who, like the Minister, must respond to what people are worried about.  I note that Senator Honan has put down a strongly worded amendment.  The arguments she put forward are valid and I look forward to hearing her develop them.  I will listen to the Minister's response to Senator Honan.  I am not ready to vote against Second Stage of the Bill because I am not opposed to its contents and I would be hypocritical or foolish to vote against something I have no fundamental disagreement with.  However, I fundamentally disagree with the Minister's decision not to make the Bill more comprehensive. I therefore hope that we can take the Minister at her word, that we will make the changes on Committee and Report Stages of this Bill.  By Report Stage we should have made significant changes on issues on which I do not think there is any great difference of opinion in terms of Government policy or the Minister's own views.  They are issues which will not cost the taxpayer a bundle of money.  I ask the Minister to let this Bill run a bit, broaden it, listen to what we put forward. We will put forward amendments in good time, change the words, make them fit in a bit better and make sure they relate to other changes in legislation. Let us move forward on that basis.  We have a huge problem in that it is not an amending Act as it sets out to be; in some of the documentation it mentions that this is an Act to amend the punishment of incest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to amend a very specific problem that has arisen which needs to be tackled immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that point.  I am putting the case to the Minister.  I have given her a clear signal on three or four areas and I will put down amendments tonight which I have just finished drafting. I ask her and her advisers to look <Col N="1134" /> at them very closely.  The arguments I put forward are arguments on which both sides, including herself, agree.  The Minister is at the disadvantage that I know her well enough to know her views on many issues.  I ask her to respond to them in the open way which she has done in regard to other issues in the past and to accept them.</P>
      <P>I intend taking a very active part on Committee Stage of the Bill.  In the meantime I put it to the Minister that incest deserves a heavier penalty and that there are other reasons why I would wish it to be seen as a felony rather than a misdemeanour.  I gave one reason in regard to aiders and abettors. Another reason is this &mdash; correct me if I am wrong &mdash; but in regard to a felony the Garda are allowed to arrest somebody on suspicion of the offence.  This is a signally important issue in this case, because if we are talking about it being brought to the attention of the appropriate agencies and the Garda, and if the Garda are of the view that a child is at risk now, they should be able to do something immediately without having to wait to get a warrant or whatever would be required.  I could make a lot of arguments why this should be a felony rather than a misdemeanour.  Another argument would be the label.  A person who does something like this should clearly be a felon in the eyes of the State.</P>
      <P>That is my first input into this Bill.  I hope I have given the Minister food for thought.  I hope she will respond to what I have said in the general area and that she will move away from the minimalist response which I agree and accept was required of her in terms of responding to the judgment.  I do not disagree with the point she made in that regard.  I have indicated some of the areas &mdash; there are some more &mdash; which should be dealt with.  We need to give a clear signal out there to people who are worried, to parents, people in the care area, the educational area and the medical area who are worried about this, and to politicians who want to respond in a responsible way to the needs of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> I ask the Minister to take on board some of the things I have said.  I will listen carefully to her response at the end of Second Stage.  I look forward to Committee Stage and Report Stage.  I will not take up any more of the House's time, but I will plague the Minister on the next two Stages.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the debate which I think will be helpful to the Minister in dealing with the broader issues.  I compliment the Minister on reacting so speedily to the recent cases which brought this about and on bringing the Bill to this House.  I listened with interest to her speech and it gives a good outline of the background of this case and of what we are dealing with.  It is helpful to all of us in that sense.  A deliberate attempt was made to explain the issues in great detail.  In many ways I suppose it also pre-empts our concerns and attempts to limit what we can deal with in this particular Bill.  I do not know if that is a good or a bad thing, but it certainly will not stop the Members of this House from addressing all matters relating to sexual crimes generally.</P>
      <P>As I said, the Bill deals with a very specific issue.  It is limited to that and deals simply with an amendment to what was section 5 of the 1908 Act.  As Senator O'Toole has said, it is only necessary to read that Act to know the level of importance that was given to such offences at that time.  The fact that the provision still exists in any shape or form is a surprise to me in view of the fact that we have seen so much reforming legislation in various areas. Section 5 survived critical amendment through other legislation such as the Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981, the subsequent Act of 1990, the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) (No. 2) legislation in 1935, and other legislation on similar matters, so it goes to show that sometimes legislation is not amended where required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> I suppose it is human nature but we must all make it our duty to watch out when dealing with a particular Bill that we deal with it in a comprehensive fashion and in a way that does not leave loopholes such as this which has managed to exist from 1908.  As has been said, I welcome the Minister's commitment towards introducing a comprehensive discussion paper.  I am very keen that that is not put on the long finger.  I believe the Minister mentioned a number of weeks.  That is crucial because it is not so much that it is in the news this week but some of us are particularly interested in this area of law and it is not something that we would like to see put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>It is our duty as politicians to legislate in areas which are now a matter of particular public concern but which have always been a matter of concern.  I have not actually seen Senator Honan's Bill and for that reason I will not comment on it, but the areas are quite complicated and quite wide ranging; we must look at every issue involved.  It impinges not just on the criminal law and the Minister's brief but also on education, child care legislation etc.  We must take the overall view of what is needed at this time and hopefully address that in legislation within a short time.  It is not, as I said, something that can be dealt with later; it is extremely urgent.  It is on the basis that we will deal with the other issues in a comprehensive fashion very shortly that I will support this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is vital that information be given in the interests of the child.  It is not helpful to anybody to keep that kind of information hidden away.  The carers in our society, whether they are psychologists, doctors, teachers, the health board, whoever, are entitled to vital information such as that.  It is about time that was made quite clear.  The Bill is effective in what it seeks to do in that narrow sense.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters that I hope to deal with in this debate.  They may be disjointed, but they are all matters of consideration and one of them is the issue of mandatory reporting.  It is <Col N="1137" /> something that we must address.  People have a job, whether they are social workers or whatever, they work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., they deal with the same types of problems on an ongoing basis. It is possible that they become cynical or used to it.  It is possible they feel helpless in the whole situation, where the Garda come in and where they do not, but mandatory reporting would solve all of that.  It would be crucial and vitally important for everybody who becomes aware of a possible abuse to report it. That is only a starting point, so we must have that.</P>
    <P>In relation to <i>in camera</i> proceedings, maybe Members of this House will remember that I raised this matter in relation to family law cases quite recently, because it is something that applies there also.  Family law cases are also held <i>in camera</i>, as we know, and are not reported as a result.  This means we are losing out on a vital source of information regarding family law.  This should not happen in a society where we must address this issue and where legislation is being introduced to deal with it.  We are losing out on vital information of which the public, experts and judges need to be aware.</P>
    <P>While I respect the necessity for confidentiality for the parties involved, we would be able to benefit from proper reporting.  Headlines which announce a case do not reflect the facts.  Journalists have a duty to behave responsibly in these matters.  Reporting is of benefit to the public and law reporting is crucial, because judges who implement the law can only base their judgments on information before them.  If they lose out on information about how these cases are dealt with in other jurisdictions, then they lose out on valuable information on which to base their judgments.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the fact that the victim must be spared the trouble and difficulty of being forced to give evidence.  However, if a case goes to trial, that person has already given evidence to carers who have come to their assistance, to the Garda Síochána, solicitors and barristers.  As a result, it <Col N="1138" /> will not be a big hurdle to jump when it goes to trial.  This saves the victim the trouble of giving evidence, but it also saves the accused from having to listen to the victim's detailed report of what happened to them and how they were affected by it.  It would be a lesson to any convicted person to be forced to sit and listen to such evidence.  Our law does not address these procedures and, therefore, we must examine it.</P>
    <P>It is easy, as I have seen in many cases, to give evidence <i>in camera</i> when one knows there will be no adverse response or opposition to what one is saying.  This suits the victim; but it is too easy for the accused, because one must realise that a person has not been prosecuted unless there is evidence.  Cases where there have been convictions prove it is of benefit to hear both sides of the story in evidence.</P>
    <P>Admitting the offence &mdash; a plea of guilty &mdash; ensures that no evidence is taken from either side; in other words, to plead guilty at the last minute saves the accused from having to go through the hassle of giving evidence, being reported and being cross-examined about what has happened.  We should examine this area.  A plea of guilty should not automatically mean that the accused does not have to answer questions from the judge.  It is essential that the judge is given an opportunity to question the accused in order to decide how sorry they are, their intent and ongoing attitude to the crime of which they are accused.  That is important in assessing the guilt of the accused and, therefore, in determining the sentence. We should look at this issue.  It is absurd to offer it as an excuse for a reduction of a sentence.  I cannot understand why that should be allowed at the time of trial when the accused has already gone through everything, unless the accused has admitted the offence at the time of arrest.  If that is the case, it might be allowed in terms of the leniency of the sentence, but it should not be allowed in any other circumstance.</P>
    <P>We should consider victim impact studies in every case of sexual abuse. <Col N="1139" /> Such studies are required in other jurisdictions, but they are not used here in general abuse or family law cases.  Psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, etc. have a vast amount of experience and knowledge and they work with the people involved, but their expertise is not heard when the case goes to trial.  In addition, this would also make the accused realise that this is not a matter which goes away after sentencing or on completion of a sentence; the victim is a victim for life.  It would help our system of justice if we ensured that not only is justice done, but is seen to be done by giving time and attention to the impact of the crime on the victim.</P>
    <P>An issue I mentioned here on many occasions, not only when it was highlighted in the media, was the need to provide a system for the education and training of judges.  It is not specifically related to this legislation, but it is related to other legislation and indirectly to all sexual crimes.  As Senator O'Toole said, legislation which enshrines a sexual crime as a misdemeanour, whether that term is now used or not, gives the impression that it is not too serious.  Recent judgments have shown that that is the opinion of the Judiciary.  We must examine this area.  I have great respect for our judicial system and the work our judges do on a daily basis but, like all of us, the law changes radically on a day-to-day basis.  I must do courses as a solicitor and I would like to see a system which facilitates other professions and the people who make these decisions, the judges, to update their knowledge on laws and their impact and on how victims react to these offences.</P>
    <P>Education has a role to play in the detection of these offences and the abuse of children.  While we talk about the implementation of the Child Care Act, there is no specific training &mdash; correct me if I am wrong because I am happy to hear what the situation is &mdash; for teachers in primary or secondary school education to deal with detection and counselling.  There is no specific <Col N="1140" /> module for teachers in the training colleges and we must examine this.  I know this is not in the Minister's brief, but we must consider this issue if we are serious about the situation.  We are introducing a curriculum which includes sex education. Teachers meet the children on a one to one basis and they are seen as a friend, yet the teachers are given no training in the detection of abuse.  This must be rectified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her speech referred to the various types of offences.  I am in favour of increasing the penalties for many offences.  I know the maximum penalty for incest is 20 years, but it should be life.  We should also increase the penalties for defilement, gross indecency and unlawful carnal knowledge, because until the law reflects the seriousness of those offences nobody else will.  They are viewed as the misdemeanours the law states they are, therefore we must increase those penalties. We must show that we are not a society which will tolerate this and show how we will punish it.  The criminal procedural system ensures that the victim of such crimes are witnesses.  They do not have independent rights of appearance or the right to have cross examination of the accused and so on.  This must be considered, because while these cases may well come under the criminal law in that they are prosecutions by the DPP, the Attorney General or the Garda, it is the victim versus the accused and the victim does not get a proper hearing throughout the entire case.  Victims are the excuse, the reason for the case, but they are not part of the case in so far as they may be entitled to cross examine the accused, to have the accused listen to their side of the case, and so on.  We must therefore consider how we handle such cases in the future and how to amend the administration of the law to deal with the matter properly.</P>
    <P>This is not something which has arisen in 1994 or 1995.  I watched a horrifying programme recently on &ldquo;The Oprah Winfrey Show&rdquo; which dealt with incest in the USA.  It featured a mother and daughter &mdash; where the daughter was <Col N="1141" /> by the mother's father &mdash; and all of the scenarious involved in incest cases.  It was frightening to see what was happening and how the mother of the child who was abused could appear and say that she knew it was going on but that she felt she was not in a position to do anything about it.  We cannot console ourselves by saying that this does not happen here.  What happens in the USA happens throughout the world as human nature has not changed.  Furthermore, incidents such as this have happened throughout time and will continue to happen.</P>
    <P>The one thing we as a society must do is introduce not only legislation but a system which will stamp out this problem, a system which will identify the issue, punish the perpetrators and let them know that it is viewed so seriously by society that we will not condone it. Such a system should also allow people to come to the aid of the abused person and should rehabilitate the offender, if possible.</P>
    <P>Legislation can only go so far, but we should consider the matter once and for all and see what we can do about it.  We have heard so much about abortion and the rights of the child.  The rights of the living child are paramount in a society which often gives lip service to them. We must put children at the centre of the system we are dealing with and give them an opportunity to have their say.</P>
    <P>In terms of court administration, there are ways which would allow the child victim to give evidence and be heard in court, such as through a microphone and where they are screened and not viewed or named in public and so on.  This would preserve confidentiality while allowing them to be heard, to ask and to listen.  We must therefore consider the proper use of modern methods of communication to facilitate this kind of hearing in court.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if the legislation would state that the information should include the charges brought against the accused.  On the issue of bringing a friend to court, section 6 (2) of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, allows <Col N="1142" /> for this.  I am not aware if this has been changed by the 1990 legislation, and perhaps the Minister could advise in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very open in stating that the Bill deals specifically with an urgent situation which has arisen, and I accept this, but we as politicians have a duty to tackle this area of sexual abuse in the best way possible. This will entail an input from more than those involved in the Minister's Department. It is time that we took the issue seriously and addressed it urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am pleased that the Minister has introduced the Bill in the House today, although she is aware of my feelings with regard to the proposed legislation. It is a minimalist approach to the problems we are addressing which is <Col N="1143" /> why I have moved this reasoned amendment.</P>
      <P>The record of the Houses of the Oireachtas in legislating for the protection of children and for sexual offence cases is one of which no Member of either House could be proud.  The history surrounding these issues &mdash; issues of rape, of child abuse and violence against women has been one of inertia, intellectual dishonesty and an unwillingness to face up to child abuse once and for all, to take the steps which are necessary to protect women and children from this most horrible of crimes and to take the steps necessary to administer swift and sure justice to those who commit them.</P>
      <P>We in the Houses of the Oireachtas have much to answer for to the abused children and women of Ireland.  The sentencing decision in the X case has led to expressions of shock and outrage, both outside and inside this House. However, in some ways it should come as no surprise, because successive Governments have failed to grasp the issues which this case raised.  I refer especially to how best to support the victims of sexual assault and abuse and the issue of sentencing.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have failed to give any clear guidelines to judges on sentencing, and the X case, the Kilkenny incest case and the Kerwick case contain many lesson for us.  Recent figures have shown that less than 5 per cent of all confirmed cases of child abuse are ever prosecuted.  This is a stinging indictment of those State authorities involved in the bringing of these prosecutions.  It may well be the case that many of the victims of these offences are unwilling to go to court, and in the wake of the sentencing in the X case this attitude is understandable. What guarantees do victims have that their rights and grievances will be vindicated? What guarantee do they have that their voices will be heard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the recent cases to which I have referred should be a cause of deep reflection on all of the issues involved <Col N="1144" /> and I do not put it too strongly when I say that they should even be a cause for shame at the way we as a society treat victims of these crimes.  However, they should also give rise to a call for action and a call for a strong arm to be extended to victims of sexual crime, an arm which offers them protection and compassion.</P>
    <P>We as legislators are primarily called upon to address these issues.  The hearts and minds revolution has already taken place in society.  After years of society denying that these actions took place, it is now demanding of us that we take action.  However, we have largely ignored this call, which is why I was disappointed when the Bill was published. It is a minimalist approach to the problems which have arisen and a narrow response to the issues which were identified by and flow from Mr. Justice Carney's judgement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an ideal opportunity to plug loopholes in the law regarding the reporting of trials in sexual offence cases and to extend the protection offered in rape cases to prosecutions for under age sexual intercourse.  However, the Minister has not availed of this opportunity and the Bill is another knee jerk reaction to a very high profile case. It is another act of gesture politics.  It enables us to say that the Minister is doing something to tackle the difficulties identified.  In the literal sense that is very true.  However, it is a sad day when we are debating a Bill which is a half baked measure.  With a little more time and thought a much stronger, more purposeful and effective Bill could be put in its place.  As the Minister has acknowledged, there are three Bill before both Houses which attempt to address the judgment of Mr. Justice Carney.  Before I discuss their contents I want to set out the kind of issues which, in my view, this Bill should address.</P>
    <P>The first issue is of course the necessity arising from the judgment of Mr. Justice Carney to abolish the anomaly identified by him arising from section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  The effect of this section is that incest trials <Col N="1145" /> must be heard in total secrecy with the effect that no one, not even health boards caring for child victims, is entitled to know the result of the incest prosecution.  Everyone in this House agrees there is no justification for such an approach.  The provision of the 1908 Act was laid down in a time when issues of child abuse and sexual violence were shrouded in secrecy, shame and denial.</P>
    <P>However, recently there has been a recognition that we need to get these crimes out into the open and expose the fact that they happen in order to foster the development of a climate of public opinion that is supportive of victims of these terrible crimes.  Victims must be made aware that they are not alone, that these types of crimes occur, that they will be helped and that the perpetrators will be dealt with severely.</P>
    <P>This Bill simply amends the existing law so as to ensure that the verdict and the sentence in an incest case will be delivered in public.  The Minister has confined herself to this and I have a major problem with this minimalist approach.  We all learned the lesson in the X case, if we learned nothing else, that there is a need for transparency and consistency in sentencing.  We need transparency because the public has a vital interest in knowing the kind of sentence which will attach to particular kinds of acts.  We need consistency for the sake of protecting victims and punishing offenders in a manner consistent with principles of fairness and justice.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill the verdict of guilty or not guilty will be announced in public and so will the sentence, but the nature of the offence will not be revealed nor will its gravity.  We will still not know if the offender has been found guilty of the brutal rape of a child or whether he has been found guilty of becoming involved in one of these unusual cases, which I understand occasionally happen, of long parted siblings who embark on a consensual basis upon an emotional relationship.  We will not know if the offence was an isolated one or whether it was the result of a <Col N="1146" /> reign of terror lasting for years.  We will not know if the offence was accompanied by aggravating or mitigating circumstances.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if this Bill is passed, judges will be deprived of the means of knowing how other incest cases have been dealt with by their colleagues.  In effect, this Bill militates against consistency in sentencing at a time when there is a massive concern that judges be assisted to become more consistent.  I find it incomprehensible that such legislation would be introduced in the light of what we were all forced to confront last week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I was talking about the judgment in the X case.  My other objection to the Bill is that it retains the <i>in camera</i> rule for the prosecution of incest in all its aspects except in relation to the announcement in public of the verdict and the sentence.  The House will be aware that in cases of rape and sexual assault, under the provisions of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1990, in any proceedings for a rape offence or the offence of aggravated sexual assault, the judge is required to exclude from the court during the hearing all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned with the proceedings or &mdash; this is the significant exception in relation to this Bill &mdash; bona fide representatives of the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This exception in favour of the press in the general rule that the court must be cleared reflects a recognition by the Oireachtas that society has a strong and legitimate interest in being informed through sensitive and restrained reporting of the kind of offences which are perpetrated against women and children <Col N="1147" /> so as to foster a climate of public opinion that is supportive of abused women and children and to encourage them to come forward and report offences.  If the facts behind these offences are not made known, their seriousness and gravity will never be fully appreciated.  Ignorance of sexual offences may well be bliss for our society but it is hell for the victims of these crimes, whose voices are unheard and whose feelings of pain and fear are unacknowledged.  Victims of these unspeakable crimes must be made aware that they are not alone, that others have suffered as they have, that they will be helped and supported and that perpetrators will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Society also has a strong and legitimate interest in knowing how these offences are dealt with in our courts and by other State agencies.  This was fully illustrated in the Kerwick case, the Kilkenny incest case and, most recently, in the X case.  In this Bill there is no provision that bona fide members of the press may be admitted to incest trials for reporting purposes.  I believe this is a very serious omission.  It is worth nothing that Judge Catherine McGuinness has called for the admission of bona fide members of the press to family law cases, which at the moment are also heard entirely <i>in camera</i>, on the basis that the public has a legitimate interest in knowing what is going on in the family courts.  We raised this matter with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform when we discussed the Family Law Bill and he said he would have discussions with the Minister for Justice.  The more society knows about these matters the better we can respond to dealing with the problems which arise from them.</P>
    <P>Another objection I have is that many prosecutions for child abuse are brought under the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, which deals with unlawful carnal knowledge of girls aged under 15.  In my view this offence ought simply to be renamed child abuse since this is what it really is.  These are the sections under <Col N="1148" /> which the man in the X case was prosecuted.</P>
    <P>While the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981 and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, extend to the victim a guarantee that she will be anonymous, no such guarantee is extended to victims of child abuse where the perpetrator is prosecuted under the Act of 1935.  The Minister outlined other examples of this and said she will address this issue.  This is a very serious anomaly.  It goes without saying that victims of sexual abuse must be given every encouragement to come forward and report the crime against them.</P>
    <P>The Minister had an ideal opportunity to remedy this anomaly.  I accept she has said this is a stop gap measure to deal with very specific issues raised in the Mr. Justice Carney decision and that the other issues can be considered in time.  I ask the Minister why she did not plug this particular gap as well and if she could give some indication if she is also waiting until we have this discussion document.</P>
    <P>There are three Bills before the Oireachtas &mdash; Deputy John O'Donoghue's Bill, which was introduced in the other House, the Bill we introduced and this Bill.  I believe this Bill is the weakest.  The other two go much further in addressing the issues to which I have drawn attention.  There are differences between the Fianna Fáil Bill and ours but essentially they are both directed towards the same end, which is to carry out a meaningful reform of the law in this area.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister failed to do what is crying out to be done?  Why has she failed to integrate the treatment of victims of incest and victims of rape?  If she could point to any good reason for her failure in this regard, I would like to hear it.  I know she has said she needs time to consider whether the reporting restrictions attaching to trials of incest need to be brought into line with those applying to rape and other sexual offences.  How long will this take?  It has been seven weeks to the day since Mr. Justice Carney delivered the judgment <Col N="1149" /> this Bill is designed to meet.  The issues which that judgment raised are clear cut and simple.</P>
    <P>The task for the Minister arising out of that judgment was to integrate the reporting conditions for incest trials and anonymity provisions in trials for defilement of young girls with those applicable to other sexual offences.  I believed that was a simple task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>It never is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that it could have been tackled within those seven weeks. Instead this Bill has done the very least that is required and other very important issues have been long fingered. Cases of rape, incest and defilement of girls under 15 are essentially similar; they all involve the sexual abuse of women or children.  I see no reason why they should be treated differently and I have not heard any compelling reasons from the Minister today.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that she is going to bring forward this discussion document but she has not given us a specific period in which that will be done.  My fear is that the inertia which has characterised the response of the Oireachtas to rape and sexual abuse will come into play and that the issue will be shelved and gather dust until the courts force us to confront it yet again.  Accordingly, the Minister should indicate what timescale she has in mind for the purposes of carrying out the review of integrating the reporting rules on rape and incest.  I would like the Minister to indicate also when she intends to bring the fruits of this review before the Oireachtas.  I am asking the Minister to give a serious commitment to this House and to honour it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we, as legislators, want to do the right thing by victims of sexual offences we need to start here today.  We need to assure victims of sexual abuse that their anonymity will be guaranteed as well as providing for the responsible reporting of incest trials and assisting judges to sentence in a consistent way.  That is why I am asking Members of this House <Col N="1150" /> to support my motion.  We need to send out a strong signal to the victims of sexual abuse that their problems are taken seriously in this House.  We need to let them know that we have has enough of half-baked measures, the political gesture and the empty promise.  The Minister could have taken decisive action on these issues but it has taken seven weeks to come up with this measure which achieves as close to nothing as it is possible to do.</P>

If the Bill as presented by the Minister passes Second Stage, the Progressive Democrats will in due course be proposing amendments designed to target the flaws that I have identified.

      <P>The Minister has acted swiftly to remedy the anomalies of the 1908 Incest Act, which were recently highlighted in the High Court, and I welcome her initiative.  The Judiciary quite rightly put the ball firmly back in the court of the Legislature and the Minister has reacted responsibly.  The central issue, however, goes far beyond the 1908 Act.  We are dealing with a body of antiquated legislation, as has been referred to by previous speakers.  I am thinking not only of the 1908 Incest Act but also of the 1904 Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, which is ill-suited to the needs of the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our concept of childrens' rights has changed radically since the Victorian era.  For example, the 1908 Act placed limitations on the ability of children to give evidence as it was framed at a time when children were quite literally seen and not heard.  However, we have moved on since then and today we recognise the vital importance of listening to children.  Indeed, that recognition <Col N="1151" /> is embodied in services such as Childline.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has acted to remove the most glaring anomalies in the 1908 Act, but I would argue that in the longer term we need an entirely new Act.  It is sad that in recent years such issues have arisen in relation to children who have been particularly ill-served by political sticking plasters.  We need to revisit our entire body of child protection legislation and a start has been made with the 1991 Child Care Act.  I welcome the Government's commitment to implementing all sections of the Act.</P>
    <P>However, our legislation still lags behind changes in public opinion.  Just last week the nation was outraged when the man at the centre of the X case had his sentence reduced from 14 to four years.  I do not wish to revisit the debate on sentencing policy at this stage, but to a large extent the sentences passed by our Judiciary reflect the content of our laws and the definitions contained in them.  On issues ranging from incest to unlawful carnal knowledge and cruelty to children, our laws are rooted in an era which viewed children as chattels rather than as individual entities.</P>
    <P>We agree that a wholesale review of these laws cannot be undertaken overnight. Any such review should take on board the views of those directly involved: parents, teachers, lawyers and child care professionals.  The Government should initiate such a review urgently, or perhaps ask the Law Reform Commission to examine the body of legislation relating to children and to make appropriate recommendations.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and, naturally, I welcome the Bill, limited as it is.  This is a complex issue which has not been dealt with in a clear manner.  For example, even following the Minister's speech.  I am still not clear whether the Bill deals with the fact that there will not have to be two trials <Col N="1152" />&mdash; one for incest and one for rape &mdash; if both are involved.</P>
      <P>Section 3(1) says that</P>
      <P>Where the same proceedings relate or, at any time, related to both an offence under the Act of 1908 and an offence referred to in section 10 of the Act of 1990&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Surely it should be &ldquo;either, or&rdquo;.  Other Senators have addressed many of the things that I wanted to say.  The Minister is again talking about a discussion document while we have in front of us the Kilkenny incest investigation, whose recommendations of two years ago have yet to be implemented.  If we have a discussion document now will it not mean that two years further on we will be trying to do the same thing with the results of this discussion document?</P>
      <P>The fact that sensitive cases, particularly if they have anything to do with sex and, worse still, with the family, are held <i>in camera</i> has not been helpful because there has been too much secrecy. Family law cases should be held openly under the same reporting restrictions which apply to other sensitive cases.  With the divorce legislation coming up shortly it is important for people to see the violent, horrific abuse that goes on in some families.  This is the reason so many people want to make a clean break of the marriage they were in and try to establish a new family and relationship with someone else.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy mentioned the fact that this Bill does not seem to allow for a friend of the victim to be present in rape cases.  This is most important because the child may have no friend within the family to come forward. Someone from outside the family may need to be appointed.  That is a great pity.  I will put down an amendment about this because it is not clear to me that a friend would be allowed to come forward.  Secrecy has been behind all these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember the importance of eugenics with regard to incest cases.  Indeed, it was the knowledge of the children who resulted from <Col N="1153" /> consanguineous relationships &mdash; and we can go back to Leviticus to see that &mdash; that led to laws against incest being introduced.  They are older than the 1908 Act.  One aspect of the 1908 Act which should be looked at again is the ages to which the different types of offences apply.  I also support Senators who have said that &ldquo;carnal knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;defilement of young females&rdquo; are not suitable phrases to use in 1995.  It is child rape in these cases.</P>
    <P>The age groups are divided into categories of under 13, under 15 and under 17.  It is important to remember that children under 13 were considered at that time to have been too young to conceive.  However, in the last two weeks we have been made aware of a pregnant child in Cork, not as a result of incest, and, as <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> report pointed out, we have had many cases in this country of children that young being pregnant.  This should be rectified in this Bill and I will bring that to the Minister's attention.  It is also important to remember with regard to cases of incest that children do not have a statutory right to health care.  A child who is being abused and who may be pregnant or who may have venereal disease or both &mdash; I have known of such cases &mdash; is not in a position to have treatment without the consent of the parents.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Kilkenny incest case report and its guidelines, reporting of such cases must be made mandatory. Senator O'Toole discussed this from the point of view of teachers and I can talk about it from the point of view of the medical profession.  The report recommends:</P>
    <P>...that the Medical Council should ensure that all doctors are circulated with ethical guidelines... and that it should be made clear that, if a doctor has reasonable grounds for believing that a child is being abused, not only is it permissible for the doctor to disclose information to a third party, but it is the duty of the <Col N="1154" /> doctor to do so.  Where a client admits to child abuse or discloses child abuse, clinical responsibility to that client cannot take precedence over a doctor's responsibility in relation to child protection and the client should be so advised.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to have this recommendation and to rely on the Medical Council.  However, this is once again an instance of our relying on extra-legal guidelines rather than legislation.  We as legislators should take it upon ourselves to introduce legislation making it mandatory for people in such responsible positions &mdash; be they doctors, teachers or whatever &mdash; to report to the appropriate authority, the community care officer in these cases.  Otherwise, we are seriously shirking our responsibility.</P>
    <P>Finally, we must look at the Judiciary. It is important to stress constantly that consent can never be given in these cases.  The fact that physical violence was not involved does not mean that there was no intimidation or threat of physical violence or even enticement. We must urge the legal profession to realise that it must become involved in seminars to update its thinking to take into account the feelings of the general public.  At present there appears to be, if not in the thinking certainly in the language of the Judiciary when it expresses its views on these cases, a sad difference between the views of general public on the proper way for us to go forward and those of the Judiciary.  I understand the Judiciary's position.  It must weigh up the problems of the accused while we might be too enthusiastic in seeing the plight of the victim.  However, it must be remembered, particularly in the cases under consideration today, that nothing like consent can be given.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we as legislators urgently take action on mandatory reporting of cases and proper sentencing and that we do not end up &mdash; which could easily be the case looking at this Bill &mdash; with another long discussion document which we will be considering again two years hence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for introducing the Bill in the Seanad.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, to the House and congratulate him on his work since his appointment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill which ensure that social workers and others concerned with children's protection can now secure essential information concerning prosecutions and verdicts in child sexual abuse cases.  It is important that they have such information whether the offence is incest or otherwise.  We must recognise that these problems in our society are extensive and appear to be increasing.  As public representatives we are all aware of cases of incest, rape and unlawful carnal knowledge.  I agree that the term &ldquo;unlawful carnal knowledge&rdquo; is a somewhat nonsensical term to have on the Statute Book in 1995.  It is nothing other than child rape and that is what the offence should be called.</P>
      <P>My worry about this area is the veil of secrecy that is shrouded over it in our society.  The sooner we deal directly and specifically with it the better.  The recent decisions in the courts regarding the refusal to issue information to social workers in relation to specific cases were not necessarily a reflection on the judge concerned but on the legislation under which he had to operate.  This Bill is welcome in so far as it rectifies that difficulty.  However, it only touches on the problems that must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not one school in this country that does not have one pupil &mdash; indeed many pupils in some schools &mdash; who is a victim of incest or unlawful carnal knowledge.  As a former teacher, I am fully aware of that and of its extent in some schools.  It must be condemned. However, it begs one question &mdash; if the name of the perpetrator of the crime was published after the verdict and conviction in a case, would that act as a deterrent to other perpetrators?  This is an issue which we as legislators should address.  The argument in incest cases is that publication of the name of the perpetrator <Col N="1156" /> leads to the victim being identified. That is true and everything must be done to ensure that the victim is not identified.  The victim suffers enough trauma and is psychologically scarred for life.  We have a responsibility to ensure that they are scarred no further following the court proceedings.</P>
    <P>However, we must look at the position of the perpetrator in society while protecting the victim.  Each case should be assessed as to whether the name of the perpetrator should be published.  If it is the child's father it would be easy to identify the victim so special care and judicious thinking should be applied in that case.  However, a neighbour, friend or associate using his or her position of trust to abuse the innocence of a young person knows that, even if the case is brought to court, his or her name will never be made public.  There is, in a sense, no protection for victims or potential victims.</P>
    <P>When somebody convicted of murder is released from jail, he or she is known in society as a murderer and people are wary of them.  Equally, if a professional person in a position of trust, such as an accountant, is convicted of embezzlement, at least those people seeking the advice or services of an accountant are protected because they know that that person has been convicted.  However, in the case of rape or unlawful carnal knowledge, nobody knows who the perpetrator is as his or her name is never published.  It is the only crime on the Statute Book where the name is not published, which is an issue we must address.</P>
    <P>We have seen the benefits of the publication of names.  As a result of the publicity which surrounded the recent Fr. Brendan Smyth case, quite a number of other victims came forward as they realised that they were not the only victim. If names were published, a number of victims who are not now prepared to come forward would do so.  The sooner that there is greater openness and transparency in relation to this issue, the better. We should ask ourselves honestly why we are currently protecting the perpetrator. <Col N="1157" /> Why are we withholding the name of the perpetrator from publication? We will argue that we are doing it to protect the victim, which I agree is true in the case of incest.  However, in most other cases that is not true and the name should be published.</P>
    <P>This matter is not addressed in this Bill which I know is a response to a specific court decision.  However, I welcome the Minister's announcement that she will publish a discussion paper on this issue.  Until it is addressed in an open fashion, the problem will continue and, unfortunately, it appears to be very much on the increase.</P>
    <P>A child sex abuser released back into the community after spending a term in jail may move from town A to town B and apply for a job dealing with children. The fact is that those dealing with his application would have no full detail of his history or the inherent dangers to children.  In a sense, we are not protecting potential victims by not publishing the name of the perpetrator.  We have seen from recent cases that it is not an isolated incident in most cases but is repeated.  The power of public persuasion and odium in relation to their behaviour could be a far greater deterrent than any sentence.  I had hoped that this issue could be addressed in this Bill. I have no doubt that it will be addressed in the discussion paper and, I hope, in legislation.</P>
    <P>While stating that the perpetrator's name should be published, at the same time everything possible must be done to protect the victim, whose innocence has been abused, usually by a person in a position of trust.  Although it may be claimed that there was consent, the fact is that consent can never be used as a justification in such cases because the victims are under age children who were taken advantage of by somebody in a position of trust.  That total abuse and undermining of the confidence which people have in their superiors must be condemned, and everything must be done to ensure that these misfortunate young people are supported in every possible way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> While there is a reasonable support mechanism in place in specific areas of the country, in many rural areas there is a hidden Ireland which only comes to the surface in dramatic cases covered by the media, such as the recent case in Athy or the case in Granard ten or 12 years ago.  There is a great sense of hush-hush in rural communities and a reluctance to face issues of this nature. The sooner that we open up the situation, the better.  We have only touched the surface of the problem on a national scale.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome in so far as it is at least changing the law in relation to social workers and others securing the necessary information to protect innocent children and potential victims. However, I would like to see a Bill coming before this House dealing in much greater detail with all the issues in this area.  I will rely on the Minister, Deputy Owen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, to combine their abilities to ensure that all these matters are brought into legislation.  Instead of too many discussion documents and White and Green Papers, we need very specific legislation and to stop avoiding the real issue.</P>
    <P>As I said before, in regard to every other crime the name of the defendant can be published for everyone to see. Why is the name of the defendant in sex abuse cases not published?  The reality is that there is no good reason &mdash; the one answer which is given is that it is to protect the victim.  That is true in some but not all cases.  We have a responsibility to ensure that potential victims are not damaged in the future because of our cowardice and lack of courage in dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>We have no problem dealing with matters relating to money but we have a major problem with anything related to sex; we are not able to deal with the issue in a matter of fact fashion.  Perhaps it is our conditioning over the years, our religious background or just Irish society.  I am not sure what the reason is.  I am confident the Minister in her discussion paper will manage to find out <Col N="1159" /> some of the reasons behind the psyche of the Irish people in relation to this issue.  We need to mature and face realities and not to shirk our responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Minister of State to the House and, in her absence, to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Owen, who is a colleague of mine on the local authority and is recognised as a very capable and competent public representative.  I also wish to congratulate Senator Honan who took the initiative and drafted legislation to deal with the legal loophole which this Bill attempts to address.</P>
      <P>The legislation, as the Minister would admit, addresses a specific problem and is limited to the crisis situation which the judgment provoked.  The problem was caused by one judge's interpretation of section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  The Minister says it was evident from the judgment that the judge was most unhappy with the conclusions he felt obliged to reach and she rightly points out the problem is one for the Legislature, not for the courts. While I accept it is a legislative responsibility, the Minister said in her contribution that as far as she is aware this is the first occasion section 5 has been taken to have such a restrictive meaning. One may wonder whether the judge's interpretation of the section is correct, but the judgment has been given and the Minister has to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Mulcahy, said the nature of incest had not changed, but perhaps without knowing it he has highlighted the kernel of the problem. The question is: should the meaning of incest have changed?  I concur with Senator O'Toole; the old definition of incest is incorrect and is not applicable today.  The definition provides it shall be an offence for a male person to have sexual intercourse with a person who is to his knowledge his grand-daughter, daughter, sister or mother.  Perhaps this crime could be called incest when it involves a sister or a mother but it is totally <Col N="1160" /> inappropriate that the definition be applied to sexual intercourse involving a grand-daughter or daughter.  Repeatedly in the Chamber today the case has been made for seeing this as rape of a minor.  The term of incest is not appropriate in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing this legislation because the accused in the case in question had been charged with two counts of rape and two of incest.  He pleaded guilty to the incest charges and the prosecutor did not proceed with the rape charges.  Had the rape charges been proceeded with, the reporting restrictions under the 1908 Act would not have applied.  This further reinforces my view that incest is not the correct charge to bring in cases involving a minor.  I further ask the Minister to explain why the rape charges were dropped after the accused pleaded guilty to incest.  It was totally unacceptable that this happened and had those charges not been dropped the reporting necessary in this case would have been permissible.</P>
    <P>I did not know what the thrust of Senator O'Toole's contribution was going to be; the thrust of my contribution is that the definition of the crime is the core issue.  This legislation deals with a legal loophole but we must deal with the definition of crimes, specifically those involving a sexual offence.  As the Senator said, it can never be acceptable that sexual offences are deemed to be a misdemeanour.  No-one in these Houses would deem that to be appropriate for a sexual offence, particularly one involving children, but that is the position in relation to unlawful carnal knowledge and other offences mentioned by Members today.  The public would also see this as inappropriate.  We must address those issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this judgment gave rise to anxiety, but it does more than that and its effect must be examined. Our Constitution says it will give protection to children and that we will cherish all the children of the nation equally. The effect of this legislation is that not only do we not cherish all children <Col N="1161" /> equally, but we can allow the guardianship of a child to be awarded to a known child sex abuser.  The fact that the 1908 Act permits this has given rise to public anxiety and outrage.  In cases where a social worker should be informed that a person has been charged or found guilty of such a crime, they cannot be so informed.  Not only does the effect of this judgment leave us legislators open to ridicule, but, more importantly, it exposes children to further abuse.  We must address this.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan said this is minimalist legislation and the Minister admitted as much; it simply addresses a specific crisis.  She went on to say that her discussion document would invite contributions and she would address anomalies based on the input she gets.  The definition of the crime is the core issue and the charges brought will ultimately decide the sentence an accused will receive.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have said it is inconceivable that there could be consent to a sexual act where the victim is a minor. The public undoubtedly would agree and that is the first area the Minister will be asked to address in her discussion document.  Irrespective of whether that is a technicality or otherwise, it is unacceptable that consent can be inferred in cases involving sexual offences against a minor.  This is clearly rape of a child and we must bite the bullet in terms of defining sexual offences and what charges are brought against those who perpetrate them.  This can never be treated as a misdemeanour.</P>
    <P>The Minister said reporting restrictions will be dealt with in her discussion document.  That is only one issue she will have to address.  As Senator Gallagher said, mandatory reporting of cases of suspected abuse will also have to be considered.  The introduction of this legislation has already provoked wide ranging contributions and discussion from all sides of the House.  The Minister will see the floodgates open when she launches her discussion paper, and I look forward to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> The Minister is well aware that the inconsistency of sentences in crimes of a sexual nature is a subject of public disquiet. I have difficulties with the reduction of sentences when a perpetrator pleads guilty to a crime.  It may make it easier on a person being abused and reduce the time and effort put into a case, but I question the rationale behind an automatic expectation of leniency and a reduction of the sentence of someone who pleads guilty, particularly in sex abuse cases.  This may be acceptable in other areas of criminal law but it is a nonsense in sex abuses.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in her discussion paper she is concerned to ensure she has the benefit of the insight of individuals and organisations who have expertise in dealing with the problems of sexual offending generally and a special understanding of the plight and the real needs of the victims.  I support that.  Missing completely from her speech is any mention of establishing programmes or support for offenders. We do very little by simply locking up offenders and saying we have dealt with the case.  It certainly administers punishment, but our system of justice should do more than administer justice.  We are simply opening the gates in two, seven or 14 years' time and allowing a known sex abuser back out on to the streets without any intervention during the period of imprisonment.  The Minister should incorporate a programme for offenders in the discussion paper to which she referred.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Senator Taylor-Quinn and all the other contributions today.  For the first time I realised why we have a system of debate and discussion. It sometimes seems as if we are all repeating what the previous person said, but today all the contributions seemed to hone in on particular areas of concern.  Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned the naming of perpetrators of offences.  She accepts that incest cases should be excluded but suggests that serious consideration should be given to this in other cases.  I support what she said up to a point, but very often in <Col N="1163" /> cases of sexual abuse and rape it is not the abuser or perpetrator who suffers when the abuser is named but their family. I had experience of a case where the wife and family of a convicted rapist experienced intimidation and harassment in their community and had to move away.  I take the point the Senator made.</P>
    <P>If it was not automatically the case that the perpetrator would not be named, it might have some beneficial effect in terms of reducing the instances of sexual abuse.  There may be some benefit if the perpetrator was not guaranteed anonymity.  However, if, when all of the circumstances are taken into account, anonymity would protect his family, it should certainly be granted.  We might consider whether we should automatically grant anonymity to somebody who perpetrates the crime.</P>
    <P>The Senator made another point which is not addressed in this Bill but which was mentioned in crisis debates in this House.  She mentioned people seeking employment involving work with young children, the relevance of whether they have committed crimes such as incest and whether information can be given to specific agencies with an interest.  I do not know whether this legislation covers the position of someone applying for a job with young children, and Senator Taylor-Quinn was wise to raise that point.  The Minister should outline whether this Bill addresses that situation.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister said: this is a minimalist piece of legislation to address a crisis situation.  If there was another case tomorrow we would be attacking her for not introducing emergency legislation.  It is emergency legislation. The Minister admits that it does not deal with the whole area of crimes of a sexual nature, and that is where the big debate is.  Her discussion paper is to be welcomed, but if she is to be held to her word &mdash; and Senators will hold her to her word &mdash; she will find herself in this House on a regular basis introducing legislation to update existing legislation <Col N="1164" /> and addressing the whole area of crimes of a sexual nature which are being committed in this country.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the valuable contributions of Senators Henry, Taylor-Quinn and McGennis.  Many important and real concerns have been expressed here today on the wider subject of child sexual abuse.  These are concerns which I share.  However, this Bill does not attempt to address broad issues.  It has a limited purpose.  It is an urgent response to recent Central Criminal Court rulings and its purpose, in a nutshell, is to firmly close the gap opened by the rulings and to do so as quickly as possible to ensure that persons with a legitimate interest, such as the press, can continue to have access to joint rape and incest proceedings and, in particular, to ensure that information on convictions for incest cannot be denied to bodies with responsibility for child welfare.</P>
      <P>The Minister acted quickly to bring this Bill forward so that children's welfare could not be put at risk as a result of the rulings.  Many Senators have indicated that they do not think this Bill goes far enough.  I certainly agree that wider issues have been raised by the rulings &mdash; for example, whether the Rape Acts should be extended to cover other sexual offences.  These are legitimate questions which the Minister has indicated she will be happy to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister hopes to be in a position to publish a discussion paper on the subject <Col N="1165" /> in the next few weeks.  When the discussion paper is issued she intends to consult widely with interested bodies and, if necessary, bring forward appropriate legislation.  However, the Minister chose a limited approach to this Bill because what is needed at this time is a short and immediate remedy to the problems presented.  A more extensive Bill would simply take time and such a delay could not be justified in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will ensure that the provisions of the Rape Acts will be applied, as they were in practice before these rulings, to joint rape and incest proceedings.  The Bill will also ensure that the verdict in incest cases should be announced in public so that persons with a genuine interest in child welfare can have access to the information they require to safeguard the welfare of the children.  I have no doubt that the Members of this House share my belief that the provisions of the Bill are essential and must be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised a number of specific points where he thought that the Bill could be improved.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Owen, has taken careful note of his comments and, in keeping with the commitment she gave in her statement, she will be happy to consider any amendments the Senator may wish to put forward on Committee Stage.  I thank the Senator for the general support he expressed for the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville also dealt with a number of issues which are particularly relevant to the problem of child sex abuse. In particular, he referred to the question of mandatory sentencing in suspected child abuse cases.  This is obviously a matter where appropriate arrangements will have to be worked out.  Senator O'Toole expressed general concern about the provisions of the 1908 Punishment of Incest Act which are in need of substantial strengthening.  He also said that he would put down amendments to achieve that purpose on Committee Stage.  If he does so, they will be given the necessary consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> Senator Gallagher referred to the general need for effective and appropriate legislation to tackle the scourage of child abuse.  She also raised the issue of whether the use of the <i>in camera</i> rule in family law cases should be reviewed. This is already being done by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan moved a motion which in effect proposes that the Bill should be scrapped.  As the Minister, Deputy Owen, explained, the Bill is not intended to provide a full solution to all the problems that arise.  This approach is being pursued because of the need to overcome the difficulty under existing law whereby the caring agency with the interest of preventing incest cannot be told of the outcome of an incest trial. Senator Honan in my opinion has failed to take account of the very strong commitment by the Minister to publish very shortly a discussion paper which will cover all of the relevant matters.  The Minister is disappointed at the reaction of the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn was concerned that the identity of the culprit in sexual offence cases should not be protected because to do so can shield the culprit and fail to protect potential victims.  This is an issue which can be considered in the Minister's discussion paper.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis raised the question of why rape charges were dropped in the case which gave rise to the Bill. The charges prosecuted in any criminal case are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is fully independent in the exercise of his functions.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to go a little over my time.  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise on behalf of the Minister for Justice that she could have delayed the introduction of the Bill in order to deal with a comprehensive review of a wide range of sexual offences.  In our opinion, this would most certainly have led to the criticism, if another incest case arose where the health agencies could not be informed, <Col N="1167" /> that she had not acted on Mr. Justice Carney's judgment.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In the light of Bord Pleanála's decision to refuse permission for the Luggala Interpretative Centre in County Wicklow, Seanad Éireann calls on the Government:</P>
      <P>(a)  to abandon plans for similarly controversial and undesirable Interpretative Centres e.g.  Mullaghmore;</P>
      <P>(b)  to prevent future similar developments in environmentally sensitive areas;</P>
      <P>(c)  to safeguard areas of unique scientific, historical and scenic significance;</P>
      <P>(d)  to take steps to limit land-fill disposal of refuse; and</P>
      <P>(e)  to reduce water abstraction from rivers and lakes when there is potential for environmental damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party has deliberately tabled this important motion in the Seanad in a bid to force the Government to come off the fence and spell out its policy in relation to the sorry mess of interpretative centre <Col N="1169" /> development in this country over the past number of years.  We believe it is absolutely disgraceful that this Fine Gael/Labour/Democratic Left Government cannot yet make up its mind and is thereby compounding the shameful performance of its predecessor, the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government.</P>
    <P>Few could imagine that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, who has overall responsibility for Government policy on heritage matters and has now been in office for more than two years, has as yet failed to grasp the nettle in relation to the interpretative centres.  It is quite clear that this Government, in common with its predecessor, has not got the guts to come out and make a clearcut decision and hopes instead that An Bord Pleanála or the courts will resolve the matter for it.</P>
    <P>However, this is not leadership, rather political cowardice.  After all, the current programme for Government makes clear that the future of the controversial centres at Luggala, Mullaghmore and the Boyne Valley will be decided by the Government.  However, it continues to prevaricate.  On 15 February, the Minister, Deputy Higgins, informed my colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Quill, that he would be bringing recommendations to Government on this matter in the next few weeks.  That is over a month ago and we are still waiting for a decision.</P>
    <P>There are many salutary lessons arising from this entire controversy, the most important of which is that State agencies, such as the Office of Public Works, cannot ride roughshod over the general community.  This has been a very sorry and disgraceful episode in the history of the Office of Public Works. It is now reaping the whirlwind for its outrageously arrogant and dictatorial behaviour.  We should not overlook the complicity of its political masters, who presided over the Office of Public Works at various stages in recent years and who not only condoned but abetted its carry on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> I make this criticism while being fully aware of the outstanding work being done by the Office of Public Works in other aspects of protecting and enhancing this country's natural and built heritage. Its work on the Grand Canal, for example, is outstanding.  There are also many other Office of Public Works operations throughout the country which are a testament to its work. However, it came up with a stubborn, one-sided and ultimately self-destructive policy stance on the matter of these interpretative centres, which is most regrettable.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Office of Public Works became blinded and obsessed by the prospect of drawing down so called free money from Brussels. This became the primary motivation, rather than a considered approach to the most appropriate, sensitive and acceptable interpretative centres which should be developed at these key sites.  The unacceptability of the Office of Public Works's behaviour is borne out by the fact, for example, that just two days after a group of objectors were granted a right to judicial review in the courts in autumn 1992 against the proposed Burren interpretative centre at Mullaghmore, it began excavation work on the site.</P>
    <P>It was a clear case of the Office of Public Works snubbing not only the concerned environmentalists who opposed the scarring of the Burren landscape, but also the courts.  There have been many landmark developments along the way, which will, in time, be seen as major turning points in the assertion of community rights and the vindication of the need for openness and accountability by all State agencies. The May 1993 Supreme Court judgment that the interpretative centres did require planning permission and the finding that all State bodies would henceforth have to comply with planning law, just like everyone else, was most important.  In an era when openness and accountability have become political clichés, this was a decision which gives these laudable objectives <Col N="1171" /> real teeth and effect.  It means that never again can the Office of Public Works behave in such a cavalier fashion.</P>
    <P>The question remains of how to resolve the expensive mess at the Burren, Luggala and in the Boyne Valley. Luggala is the most straightforward case in that An Bord Pleanála has eventually vindicated proper planning and environmental concerns by refusing permission.  This has had many serious implications.  It means that the works carried out to date are now illegal and there must be a full reinstatement of the site to its former tree-planted state. Approximately £1.6 million has been wasted.</P>
    <P>The madness of the siting of the Wicklow interpretative centre at Luggala, above the village of Roundwood, is plain to anybody who visits the area. To any objective person it is obvious that Roundwood is the correct and logical venue for an interpretative centre. Hopefully, when this whole sorry mess is resolved the village will get an appropriate centre.  The irresponsibility of the choice in this case is underlined by the fact that Roundwood village requires a sewage treatment plant, yet the Office of Public Works proposed to build a separate sewage treatment plant above the village at Luggala which would not at all benefit the village.  This in an area where some of the water supply for the greater Dublin area originates.  What an example of resource mismanagement.</P>
    <P>In the case of Mullaghmore a decision by Clare County Council on the Office of Public Works's planning application for the development is long overdue.  It has been put on ice in a neat piece of behind the scenes political manoeuvring involving the county council, the Office of Public Works and the Minister.  The planning process has been deliberately dragged out by the process of the county council referring questions on the project to the Office of Public Works and the Office of Public Works failing to furnish its responses.  The proper decision <Col N="1172" /> which must be taken in Mullaghmore is similar to that at Luggala &mdash; abandon it.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if Clare County Council eventually decides to grant permission it will be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  The expert view is that the grounds for refusal by An Bord Pleanála are even more compelling at Mullaghmore than at Luggala, particularly because of the unacceptable impact on such a sensitive environment of such a project.  Of course, the question will also arise of the waste of perhaps £1.5 million in the works already carried out there, allied to the cost of removing them.  It means a scandalous waste of well in excess of £3 million given the money already spent and the cost of restoring these sensitive locations to their former states.</P>
    <P>The question arises of whether the EU authorities will look for the return of this money by the Irish Exchequer. Not only will we suffer the waste of this money but we may have to return an equivalent amount to Brussels.  I want the Government to clarify the attitude of the EU Commission on this matter.</P>
    <P>The centre at the Boyne Valley adds to the problems although there are a number of different factors involved here.  That centre is now almost complete and approximately £1.7 million has been spent to date.  Furthermore, the centre has planning permission, upheld on appeal by An Bord Pleanála.  The Boyne Valley Trust is continuing to campaign to have the project reversed and located at a more suitable venue, or, at the very least, that the centre being built be significantly modified with the removal of the bridge and minibus elements.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has previously indicated his opposition to the present location and has expressed his support for the Boyne Valley Trust.  It will be interesting to see what the Government decides to do in the case of this interpretative centre.</P>
    <P>There are many lessons to learn from this sorry saga and I hope we will never again see the pursuit of such a divisive, damaging and wasteful policy by any <Col N="1173" /> State agency.  The requirement that all State agencies must comply with planning law is most welcome and long overdue. At a time when there are so many demands for openness and accountability this is an essential precondition to ensure this.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that local communities have been so seriously divided by this pre-emptive policy of the Office of Public Works which had the support of Fianna Fáil in Government.  Let us all hope that the lessons will be learned and the financial cost and the appalling waste of public money on such a misguided undemocratic policy can be contained as much as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  When we discuss matters such as these we are faced with a fundamental conflict between what are perceived as local needs, national needs and, in some instances, international considerations, as the quality of the environment in the areas is of international stature.  We are asked to balance pressing local needs and the need for jobs in a locality with the preservation of the environment and the jobs that can flow from that preservation.</P>
      <P>A local authority or community may decide on the need for an interpretative centre, but to proceed with the work before the planning process is completed or the courts have made their judgment is quite another matter.  Was it the case with Mullaghmore or Luggala that somebody thought if they lobbed in over £1 million in each case it would put the gun to the head of the planning authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of these centres the potential environmental consequences are so serious that no risks can be taken.  In those circumstances I suggest that the precautionary principle should operate, in other words, we begin by assuming the potential for damage and until the case is proven otherwise the development does not proceed.</P>
      <P>I am not against interpretative centres <i>per se.</i>  There are good examples of how they can be done properly &mdash; Glenveagh National Park, the Céide Fields and the centre at Portmagee on Valentia Island for the Skelligs are all excellent.  The do not intrude on the landscape and do not create an environmental problem. There are areas, however, where there is potential for damage.  The precautionary principle should apply to interpretative centres, but it must apply to the two latter aspects of the motion referring to landfill and water abstraction from our lakes and rivers.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Environmental Services makes interesting reading.  Paragraph 3.6 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme emphasis will continue to be placed on supporting activities, including tourism and natural resource based <Col N="1175" /> development, which depend on the presence of high environmental quality and on the need to underpin regional and local rural as well as urban development.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that included would be &ldquo;... investment in infrastructure aimed at environmental protection in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and linked to regional development&rdquo;.  We have heard a lot about sustainable development and we recently agreed a proposal to establish a Joint Committee on Sustainable Development.</P>
    <P>The programme goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The European Union's fifth programme of policy and action on the environment towards sustainability, adopted in June 1992, has given a new impetus to environmental protection and natural resource management to meet the additional burdens imposed by increased economic activity on completion of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of fine words of that nature in this document, but what are we doing to support these fine words in practice?  What are we doing to protect the environment?  We are using public moneys, and possibly Structural Funds, with total disregard for the environment. There are two concrete cases occurring in my own area which have national significance and where the needs of the local community contradict those of the national need.  One is the proposal to have a landfill dump in Kill in County Kildare.  Outside of the greater Dublin area, we are increasingly being asked to bear the environmental cost which the Dublin county councils and corporation are not prepared to take.  We are being asked to provide Dublin with clean, fresh water in substantial quantities, take away its waste and put it in a hole in the ground in Kill, a village that has won awards for its tidiness. There is a stream from the proposed site leading into the River Liffey and a water pipe under the site carrying <Col N="1176" /> fresh water into Dublin.  This site is in the middle of the bloodstock industry and beside an international centre of repute to which people come from all over the world to buy Irish thoroughbreds.</P>
    <P>People should not be subjected to that type of environmental vandalism or be compelled to go to the High Court to seek redress, although I wish them well in that effort.  They have got little support in their fight outside their own community or concerned citizens around the country.  Even the interests of the wider society dictate that this development should not proceed.</P>
    <P>Water is a resource of immense environmental value.  We are taking 53 million gallons a day out of the River Liffey for Dublin and planning permission has been given to increase this amount to 70 million gallons.  There is also a proposal to go up to 100 million gallons and I heard one that suggested we go to 120 million gallons.  The ESB in Poulaphouca published a report which shows the potential for environmental damage.  The angling clubs and farmers along the Liffey are aware of the potential for damage.  We are talking about disturbing a complete ecosystem because nobody will pay.  If one looks through this report carefully, one will find out about the amount of water that is lost through the system, and nobody bothers about this.  Reference is also made to the pipes which carry the water.  Will we ever use the Structural Funds to improve the system so that we do not have to take so much water out of the Liffey?  In my view, the answer to that question is no.  As long as it is convenient and easy to do it in this way, the damaging of this environmental resource will not really matter.  Somebody somewhere will have to put up their hands and say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and question why it is regarded as appropriate to spend £18 million on fisheries under the operational programme for tourism while at the same time destroying the resources into which we are meant to be putting this amount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> I conclude by quoting from a Greenpeace document which underlines what I am talking about.  Planet Earth is 4,600 million years old and it compares that with a person of 46 years of age.  It goes on to say that</P>
    <P>Dinosaurs and the great reptiles did not appear until one year ago when the planet was 45.  Mammals arrived eight months ago.  In the middle of last week, human like apes evolved into ape like humans and at the weekend, the last Ice Age enveloped the Earth.  Modern humans have been around for four hours in that 46 years of age.  During the last hour, we discovered agriculture.  The Industrial Revolution began a minute ago and during those 60 seconds of biological time, humans have made a rubbish tip of paradise.</P>
    <P>That is what we are doing and that is why this motion is so important.  Unless somebody somewhere puts up their hands and says &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;, we will not be waiting for Judgment Day or Armageddon, we will impose it upon ourselves. We will not have a planet left at the rate we are going.</P>

      <P>Ar a gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom a rá gur iarr an tAire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta, an Teachta M. Higgins, orm leathscéal a ghabháil thar a cheann leis an Seanad toisc nach bhfuil ar a chumas bheith anseo tráthnóna chun páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht ar an rún tábhachtach seo.  Tá fhios ag Seanadóirí, ní foláir, go bhfuil sé san Airgintín leis an Uachtarán atá ar chuairt Stáit ar an tír sin.</P>
      <P>Before I begin, I would like to say that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has asked me to convey to the House his apology for his inability to be here tonight to speak on the motion.  I am sure the Members know that the Minister is accompanying the President on her State visit to Argentina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> As regards the motion itself, I would like to thank Senator Dardis and Senator Honan for having raised these important matters and I commend them for once again drawing the attention of this House and the Government to the need to protect our natural environment. Some of the matters referred to in the motion are outside the remit of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and while I will be adverting to them in my speech, Senators will understand if I focus primarily on the issues referred to in the first three paragraphs of the motion.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the proposals to develop visitor centres at a number of our national parks and other locations have led to an unprecedented level of controversy at local, national and indeed, international level.  Very few, if any, other environmental issues in recent years have led to such controversy. The cohesiveness of local communities has been damaged and there is widespread disenchantment with central government among both the supporters and opponents of the various developments. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of this whole debate is the fact that the impression has been created both at home and abroad that this State and its agencies are not serious about nature conservation and environmental protection.  I am confident that this debate this evening will contribute to a better appreciation among the public of the concern of Members of the Oireachtas for the preservation of our natural heritage.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senators are familiar with the background to the proposals for visitor centres in the Wicklow National Park, the Burren National Park and the Boyne valley.  In the case of the Burren and Wicklow National Parks, the proposals to develop visitor centres at Mullaghmore and Luggala each evolved as part of a strategy to improve the facilities on offer to visitors and in particular to provide a way for visitors to be aware of what each national park had to offer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> The proposals in relation to the Boyne Valley Visitor Centre emerged in a somewhat different way.  They arose from the work of a committee established under the aegis of the Royal Irish Academy to examine how best the wealth of monuments in the Boyne Valley archaeological area should be managed. The Boyne Valley is, of course, an area of great archaeological importance and contains many of our most famous national monuments, including the passage tombs at Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth.  It was designated a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1993 and good visitor management is one of the issues to be addressed in the regular reviews of the designation carried out by world experts acting for UNESCO.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works, as the State agency charged with the protection of our heritage, was the body which undertook these projects.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has frequently expressed his admiration for the work of the Office of Public Works in the conservation of our natural and built heritage.  I fully endorse these sentiments. The Office of Public Works has carried out very sensitive work throughout the country, particularly at our national monuments, to preserve them and to make them more accessible to the public.  I could instance monuments well known to every Senator, such as the Rock of Cashel, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough and Newgrange, which I have already mentioned.  I am very familiar with the fine job done at Ennis Friary in my own constituency and I am sure that each Senator could cite examples in their own areas.</P>
    <P>The proposals in relation to the Wicklow National Park Visitor Centre and the Burren National Park Visitor Centre must be seen in the context of the Office of Public Works' overall remit to manage our heritage on our behalf. Plans for these centres began to take shape in the late 1980s and work began on the different sites in the early 1990s. Senator Dardis said works were commenced at Mullaghmore in advance of <Col N="1180" /> planning permission in order to preempt the planning authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Continued, not commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Senator said commenced.  Between 1963, when the Planning Act was passed, and 1993, when the Supreme Court made its decision, the understanding was that State authorities were not bound to seek planning permission.  In fact, there was a High Court decision to that effect as well.  Various legal challenges were mounted, particularly in relation to the Burren and Wicklow proposals, and on 12 February 1993 the High Court decided that the Commissioners of Public Works did not have powers to build and manage developments and that planning permission, in addition to planning consultation, was necessary for State developments.  A previous High Court decision had held that consultation only was required.  In response to these decisions, the then Government introduced legislation which was enacted as the State Authorities (Development and Management) Act, 1993, which ensured that the Commissioners of Public Works had the necessary powers to carry out development projects.  In addition, the Government appealed to the Supreme Court that aspect of the High Court decision which related to the requirement for planning permission.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court ruled in May 1993 that the State was not exempt from the requirements to seek full planning permission and, in the light of this, the then Government decided in June 1993 that a process of public consultation should be conducted by the Office of Public Works, following which the Minister of State in charge of that Office would decide the course of action to be taken.  At the conclusion of this consultation process, the then Minister of State's decision was to apply for planning permission for slightly altered proposals in the three cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> The present position in regard to the various applications for planning permission is as follows.  In the Boyne Valley planning permission was granted by Meath County Council and upheld by An Bord Pleanála; at Luggala planning permission was granted by Wicklow County Council but rejected by An Bord Pleanála; and at Mullaghmore a decision has not yet been made by Clare County Council on the planning application. They recently sought clarification on some points from the Office of Public Works but a reply has been deferred as the general issue is awaiting Government decision.</P>
    <P>In their motion before the Seanad tonight, Senators Dardis and Honan call on the Government to abandon its plans in relation to centres such as Mullaghmore. I am sure that Senators will be aware that the policy agreement between the three parties forming the present Government states: &ldquo;The future of the proposed Interpretative Centres at Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley will be a matter for decision by the incoming Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it was a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, as Minister responsible for heritage matters, to bring recommendations in relation to each of the three centres to Government.  I understand the Minister has now completed his examination of the matter and that he expects the Government will make its decision in the next few weeks.  Senators will appreciate it would be inappropriate for me to divulge the precise details regarding the course of action being proposed by the Minister.  Suffice it to say that each case will be taken on its merits and careful consideration will be given to all of the validly held viewpoints in regard to these centres.  I have no doubt but that the Government will also take cognisance of the views expressed in the Seanad tonight.</P>
    <P>Senators Dardis and Honan call for the prevention of future developments in environmentally sensitive areas and, in regard to this.  I would point out that valuable lessons have been learned by <Col N="1182" /> everyone involved in these controversies. Our planning process has been strengthened by the Supreme Court's decision that developments by State bodies now require planning permission. This introduces the concept of transparency into such developments and I for one welcome this.  It is right that proposals emanating from Government and State bodies should be open to scrutiny and that local authorities should be allowed to analyse proposals which affect their areas.  By the same token, the importance of local consultation has been recognised.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is particularly insistent that, as part of the preparatory work on future developments in the heritage area, meaningful local consultations take place with as wide a range of individuals and groups in the areas affected by proposals as is possible.  This commitment to transparency and consultation is indicative, I believe, of the commitment to open government which underpins the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>I welcome the Senators' call for a safeguarding of areas of unique scientific, historical and scenic significance. We are fortunate in this country to have a relatively unspoilt natural heritage and we have a responsibility to protect this heritage and to pass it on to the next generation.  The State has in recent years taken considerable steps to conserve areas of particular scenic and scientific interest by establishing national parks and nature reserves.  We have designated refuges for our animal life and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is in the process of preparing new legislation to strengthen the protection for such sites and, indeed, for wildlife in general.  The Minister intends also to enact measures in the near future to give effect in this country to the European Union's Habitats Directive which will lead to the creation of a network of protected sites throughout the member states which will be known as &ldquo;Special Areas of Conservation&rdquo;. It is expected that there will be about 300 such areas in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> Legislation is also being prepared for the establishment, protection and management of national parks, historic parks and other areas of outstanding scenic and heritage importance.  The protection of the environment and economic development are both essential goals.  The key challenge now is to achieve both through sustainable development.  The concept of sustainable development is accepted at a global level, as well as being an objective of EU policy, and is reaffirmed in the Government's programme.  Nature conservation is fundamental to sustainable development Development will not be sustainable unless biological diversity is conserved.</P>
    <P>The conservation of our national heritage is not solely a matter for Government, nor any one sector of Government, but involves non-governmental organisations, local authorities, the universities and voluntary sector.  Nature conservation is necessary not only because of the intrinsic and other values of biological diversity, but because our natural heritage enriches the quality of all our lives, whether we are conscious of this or not.  Nature conservation is for the benefit of us all and there is an onus on us to share the responsibilities involved.  The conservation of biological diversity is the common concern of humankind.  Nature conservation is not an exclusive national affair but must also be addressed by international action, including educational actions to increase peoples' awareness of natural heritage.</P>
    <P>I should point out to Senators that 1995 is European Nature Conservation Year and this country is taking an active role in promoting the aims associated with the year.  The theme across Europe for this campaign is &ldquo;Nature Outside Protected Areas&rdquo;.  While the identification and protection of key areas and sites was an essential first step in conserving that natural heritage, it will not be enough.  Nature conservation must move out into the broader countryside. The conservation of biological diversity <Col N="1184" /> in the general environment can be achieved through two complementary approaches, namely, through generic measures such as for example the rural environmental protection scheme, or REPS for short, and from the bottom upwards through specific action plans for species and habitats.  Put simply, this means that it can no longer be sufficient just to look upon conservation as a matter which exists only within the confines of parks and other protected areas, nor is it something to be left solely in the hands of &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and Governments. Instead, we have to remind ourselves that nature is something that surrounds us all, whether we are in the countryside or in cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I would like to move on now to the final paragraphs of the motion, which are more properly within the remit of the Minister for the Environment.  The motion refers also to the need to limit quantities of waste going to landfill. This is fully consistent with the objective of the Government's recycling strategy to direct 20 per cent of waste volumes from landfill, through increased recycling, by the year 1999.  Waste management is one of the most difficult environmental challenges of our time. Past solutions for the management of Irish wastes concentrated almost exclusively on the consignment of waste to landfill sites.  In Ireland almost 93 per cent of all municipal waste is treated in this way.  Recycling has, however, been increasing and some 7 per cent of all household and commercial waste is now recycled.</P>
    <P>Much more stringent control is now being applied to landfill of wastes compared to previously.  Since 1990, all significant new landfill development has been subject to environmental impact assessment.  Landfill guidelines are being developed by the Environmental Protection Agency and it is intended that the new Waste Bill, shortly to be published, will provide for leasing of all landfills by the agency.  An important new directive on landfill has recently been approved by the EU.  Under this, new landfills will have to be provided with adequate control of leachate and methane gas emissions and be subject to <Col N="1185" /> regular monitoring of environmental impacts on the water, air and environment. In addition site services, reception areas for recyclables, a control house and weighbridge will have to be provided.  The standards laid down in the new directive will apply to new landfills immediately following its adoption. Existing landfills will have to be upgraded to meet the new standards required within 10 years or otherwise they will close down.</P>
    <P>Many of our existing landfill sites are quite small.  Given the increased costs which will be applied as a result of the new requirements, a considerable degree of rationalisation of the overall network will be required.  The Government's recycling strategy sets specific, challenging targets which will provide for the diversion of a significant volume of waste away from landfill.  In overall terms, a target of 20 per cent of combined household and commercial waste is set to be recycled by 1999 as compared to the present diversion rate of some 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive waste management framework for Ireland is being developed by the Minister for the Environment. This will incorporate policy, legislative, infrastructure and other management measures.  Support for the application of the framework will come through the waste management sub-programme of the Operations Programme for Environmental Services.  That programme provides that co-financing of some £30 million will be made available to support waste planning and the provision of infrastructure related to recovery and recycling of waste.  The Minister for the Environment also hopes to publish in the near future a comprehensive Waste Bill which will incorporate appropriate provisions to regulate the generation, movement, management and, where necessary, disposal of waste.</P>
    <P>With regard to the last item in the motion, I am advised that water abstraction in many European and international areas exceeds the natural recharge of groundwater and surface water resources: such problems with maintaining quantity are particularly <Col N="1186" /> severe in coastal and island areas of the southern parts of the European Union. Long term over-exploitation results in reduction of water supply for the catchment areas of aquatic ecosystems such as streams and wetlands.  Internationally there are many examples of severe depletion of river catchment and lake systems leading to shortages and ecological damage and, indeed, to conflicts between nations.</P>
    <P>We were abundantly supplied with water resources with the climate and level of rainfall that we have in Ireland. Some 31,000 litres of surface water per capita per day are available.  This is four times that of the most densely populated European countries.  In general there is little evidence of environmental damage arising due to abstractions from our rivers or lakes.</P>
    <P>Given the ongoing need to provide new and improved public water supply schemes, both to ensure compliance with the strict EU drinking water standards and to meet ongoing demand, there is unquestionably a challenge facing us to ensure that the water resources of our lakes and rivers are maintained.  It has been estimated that total fresh water abstractions amount to 3 million cubic metres per day, of which about one third is for public supplies, one quarter each for industry and thermal power generation, and the remainder for agriculture and rural domestic supplies.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are the main fresh water abstractors in Ireland and there are controls on their activities in this regard.  When a sanitary authority wants to abstract water for the purpose of providing, increasing or extending a supply of water, a statutory control procedure is provided for under the Water Supplies Act, 1942 whereby affected persons must be notified.  Where objections are made and not withdrawn, an application for a provisional order has to be made to the Minister for the Environment. The Minister, before making a provisional order in accordance with the application, is obliged to cause to be held a local inquiry into the application. All relevant concerns, including environmental aspects, can be raised at this inquiry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> In addition the powers available to local authorities under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990, are extensive and include a requirement on each local authority, under section 9 of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, to establish and keep a register of certain abstractions from waters in its functional area. The Water Pollution Act, 1990, in addition, has provided local authorities with the power to require the submission to them of specified particulars of abstractions from any person who is abstracting water from any waters in its functional area.</P>
    <P>Water is an economic resource, with many competing demands and uses. There are many uses to be satisfied, such as a source for drinking water, for fishing, for navigation, for sustaining livestock, as an ecosystem, etc., and there are corresponding rights which have to be borne in mind.  Conflicts between uses can arise.  Water management is a complex issue, because water is both an economic and environmental resource.  Existing public policies adequately ensure the rational management of water abstraction in Ireland. We will however be giving close attention to the new requirements in this area, such as those which may emerge at EU level.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again thank Senators Dardis and Honan for raising these issues for discussion this evening.  I can assure them that I will bring their views to the attention of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on his return from South America.  I know that he would like to see the interpretative centre controversy settled as speedily as possible but he appreciates too the need for calm deliberation in coming to decisions on such issues and for the creation of a suitable environment for consensus to be built.  As have I stated publicly, the Minister has completed his review of the various cases and he expects that there will be a Government decision before long.</P>
    <P>I have a personal interest in this matter and I was disappointed by Senator Honan's reference to Clare County Council's planning department which I <Col N="1188" /> know to be very fair and honest.  If compared with any of the other county councils it has the fewest number of section 4s in the entire west coast.  Planning in County Clare is rigidly controlled and when this whole matter arose originally I was one of the people who advocated that a full planning application should be made to Clare County Council for this proposal. Senator Honan is a fellow Clare person and I am sure she understands my concern that the impression could be given in this debate that Clare County Council does not look after its planning responsibilities correctly.</P>
    <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions and I will listen in anticipation to the other contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and find little objection to aspects of tonight's motion.  It is Fianna Fáil's wish and mine that we abide by decisions of An Bord Pleanála. When a discharge licence was issued for effluent for the Mullaghmore centre, the application was appealed to An Bord Pleanála, which upheld Clare County Council's decision.  However, I cannot accept parts (a) and (b) of the motion, to abandon some centres such as Mullaghmore and to &ldquo;prevent future similar developments in environmentally sensitive areas&rdquo;.  If one was to follow the line put forward by the Progressive Democrats in this regard, one could defeat the purpose which the motion is intended to advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national parks and wildlife service of the Office of Public Works is the State authority charged with the protection and conservation of nature in Ireland.  It has the further role of providing educational information on nature, wildlife, flora and fauna.  As most Members know, the national parks concept is recognised by the United Nations and is known as category II of protected areas.  It fulfils the crucial role of protecting important collections and ecosystems internationally.  National parks provide a conservation mechanism for these important sites and they allow public access for recreational enjoyment, inspiration, educational facilities and research.  Many national parks <Col N="1189" /> throughout the world have succeeded in doing this in a balanced way.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record the achievements of the Commissioners of Public Works in the development of some of the national parks, which I do not need to mention.  We constantly hear about Mullaghmore and Luggala, but we rarely hear of the important work being done by the Commissioners of Public Works in the Killarney National Park, where the work done in the interpretative centre in Muckross House has been the central focal point of conservation in the most scenic part of Ireland.  It has also been the focal point of a major economic off-spin from such developments, while at the same time managing, balancing, taking care of and conserving some of our most valuable areas of habitat.  We should also put on the record the work done in other parks, such as the Connemara National Park.</P>
    <P>The interpretative centres in the parks being developed have been in or adjacent to the parks.  A central function of any park, whether a national or an international one, is the interpretative centre.  A survey was done of approximately 60 parks in Europe and 50 had interpretative centres located in or closely adjacent to the parks.</P>
    <P>The importance of the designation of national parks is vital for the long term conservation and protection of some of our important habitats.  The provision of the interpretative centres alongside that is equally important for the enjoyment of people who wish to visit these areas and who would not be familiar with their details, as a process of education and to create an awareness of the importance of their preservation and conservation.  Anyone who has seen the large numbers of young people who have visited Killarney National Park, Glenveagh in Donegal or Connemara National Park will be impressed with the level of interest, awareness, concern and care which these young people take afterwards, not only in protecting and conserving these important habitats, but in their educational process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> People want to visit important scenic areas, such as the Burren region, the Wicklow mountains or areas involved in peatland conservation, such as the Clara bog in Offaly, where work is presently being undertaken by the various peatland organisations and by the Commissioners of Public Works.  We must get away from the type of conservation elitism which is shared by a small number of people in this country who seem to think these areas are their preserves and who want to deny access to anyone else other than their friends.</P>
    <P>I deplore the way in which the proposal for Mullaghmore was misrepresented by professional people who knew better and who tried to tell people that the centre for the national park in the Burren was being built on Mullaghmore mountain.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It was being constructed in a disused quarry from which gravel had been excavated for years and the second part of that site was a green field site where cattle had grazed and farming had been continued for generations. There was no question of interfering with the important system of Mullaghmore mountain, although some professionals in the business took photographs on the side of Mullaghmore mountain and misrepresented the location.  When I took issue with some people in this House who criticised the building of the centre at Mullaghmore, they freely admitted that they had never visited the site or seen where the project was located.</P>
    <P>National parks have been developed throughout the world and interpretative and visitor centres have been built alongside them.  This is true of the United States, Australia &mdash; where Tower Hill is one of the most important volcanic sites and its interpretative centre is on it &mdash; Cradle Mountain in Tasmania, which has approximately 150,000 visitors each year, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Scotland. National parks and interpretative and visitor centres throughout Europe have been built alongside the important sites.  We need more time to discuss these issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> Play has been made of the fact that there is no public support for the centre at Mullaghmore.  However, it was in response to the media's suggestions that there was public opposition to Mullaghmore that a Mullaghmore support group was formed in Corofin.  I can give Members an indication of the volume of support in that area of County Clare for the Mullaghmore project.  Such support included all the local GAA clubs, branches of the IFA at county, executive and national level, Kilnaboy Community Development Association, Carron Community Council, where people are now flooded out of their homes &mdash; the price they pay for living in a scenic area &mdash; Corofin Development Association and Tidy Towns committee, Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre, the ICA groups and the Clare Archaeological and Historical Society.  All these groups and bodies not only publicly supported the Commissioners of Public Works but visited the offices of the Minister and campaigned in the House to ensure that the project proceeded.</P>
    <P>We do not object to concerns over the Burren area.  It is an important national treasure which must be conserved and protected.  The best way to do this is to have an area managed, developed, conserved and interpreted by the State, with centres and facilities available for people to visit and appreciate the region.  In addition, the project can run in parallel with centres in Kilfenora and other parts of the county.  There is no conflict, nor should there be, between the work being undertaken on the centre at Kilfenora or the work that can be undertaken on the northern environs of the Burren at Ballyvaughan and the work that can be undertaken at Mullaghmore. Hopefully, the Government will make a speedy decision to complete the project and thereby make a valuable contribution towards the conservation and protection of one our most scenic areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Senator Honan and Senator Dardis for moving this motion and compliment the Senators on its extent.  It will provide much food for thought and room for plenty of discussion.</P>
      <P>The need for interpretative centres is recognised by all.  The location and possible impact of these centres in an area of natural beauty must be weighed carefully.  While it may appear logical to place an interpretative centre in a central location, the effect this would have should not be measured in terms of a short term gain but, more importantly, in terms of the long term impact the centre will have on the social, economic and environmental life of the area.  The motion must be addressed from the perspective of both the environment and the economic wellbeing of an area.  In contemporary folklore regarding our survival, it is apparent that human beings must learn to live in harmony with the earth, and our own lives and the life of the planet can be considerably improved if we learn to treat nature and the planet with respect.</P>
      <P>No State body can make its own rules, as this is the function of the legislators. I welcome this debate as a means of keeping this important subject to the forefront of public interest.  The present planning system must be scrutinised for any inadequacies which exist, and any loopholes found should be blocked by legislation.  Due cognisance must be given to the importance of environmental impact studies, with funding and use of independent, properly qualified experts, who would enhance the results, thus making their findings more acceptable to a wider spectrum of public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works must be praised for the initiative it has taken in the area of interpretative centres and national parks.  Places such as Coole Park in County Galway are part and parcel of our tourist economy.  The location of Mullaghmore in the Burren is unique.  It is an area of north County Clare and south County Galway which is rich in heritage, with alpine and mediterranean plants growing side by side.  It is also an area rich in flora and fauna, <Col N="1193" /> with butterflies, moths, and pinemartins in abundance.  Alongside this are the historic caves, adjacent to the historic mountain &mdash; as we now know it to be &mdash; of Mullaghmore.</P>
    <P>The location is considered by many to be unsuitable for the interpretative centre in question.  Nobody is against the idea of such a centre for the Burren area, but it is this location which has been questioned.  Some argue that the existing centre at Kilfenora could be further developed, while others propose smaller units in local towns such as Gort, Kinvara and Corofin.</P>
    <P>The Burren is a unique area and the danger of pollution from the siting of large septic tanks in marshy land to cater for the influx of huge volumes of people is a matter of concern, as is the idea of big groups of people trampling on rare flowers.  Small groups, allowing the solitude of the region to prevail, are perhaps more acceptable.  On the other side of the argument, the location of the interpretative centre at Mullaghmore in a disused quarry, at a distance of a mile from the mountain itself, together with the type of materials used in its construction, may mean that it will not cause significant visual impact.</P>
    <P>The view of the majority of public representatives and of Clare County Council who have backed the project must be respected.  There is strong local support in the region for this project, as Senators from County Clare, and the Minister have indicated.  In addition, Clare Archaeological and Historical Society hold the view that the plans put forward by the Office of Public Works for the Burren National Park, including the visitor facilities, will meet all the requirements of international standards and will play a key role in conserving the heritage of this fascinating region.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works manages 31 centres in Ireland which cater for 1.25 million visitors annually.  The visitor centre at Glendalough has received major awards for design and conservation. The Office of Public Works has a proud record, therefore, and in the case of Mullaghmore it will doubtless adhere to its customary standards.  In addition, the employment which the <Col N="1194" /> centre at Mullaghmore will generate is badly needed in the area and it must also be acknowledged that in our damp climate covered facilities for our visitors is desirable.  It is also desirable that there be a focal point for any area.  Furthermore, the Ailwee caves are hugely successful as a tourist attraction and they blend in well with the local terrain.</P>
    <P>There are arguments for and against on this issue, but it was regrettable that the Mullaghmore project was rushed without adequate consultation.  The views of people must be listened to and respected and at the end of the day a consensus could be arrived at.  We have all learned much from the haste with which the centre at Mullaghmore proceeded. For all future such developments, the planning process must be completed and consultation must be the norm at all levels.</P>
    <P>Public health legislation in 1978 places responsibility on the statutory authorities for the removal of refuse from premises.  Since then, various additional legislation has been enacted covering water and waste disposal, site, litter, water pollution and so on.  An EU Directive issued in 1975 calls on member states to establish a system of waste disposal, the objective of which must be the protection of human health and the environment against harmful effects caused by collection, transport, treatment, storage and tipping of waste.</P>
    <P>The issue of conservation of water supplies, while it may not appear topical after the recent deluge, is something which must be addressed in the long term, even with a temperate climate such as ours.  With our present policy of economic growth, more industry leads to greater demands on available sources of water.  There is then a tendency to over use these sources without thought for the future or the development of alternative supplies.  We should be planning for the future now, and not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as events unfold.  We should have a coherent policy for the benefit of our descendants which will encompass economic development while coexisting with nature.</P>
    <P>We have no major problems with water supplies in Ireland at present. <Col N="1195" /> Indeed, if everything else was as plentiful as water in the country, many of our problems could be easily remedied. However, water pollution is regrettably well known and is the norm in many areas, especially rural areas.  How often have we seen notices displayed requesting us to boil water before using for human consumption?  Relative to the water in our rivers and lakes, addressed by the motion before the House, the ownership of water becomes a factor, and if interference takes place upstream it can lead to major problems downstream; therefore, control and ownership are very important.  Under water pollution legislation local government authorities are obliged to keep registers of abstraction of water in their functional areas.  Individual houses are exempt from licensing and their use of water, or the abstraction for individual houses, causes little or no impact on water tables.</P>
    <P>The activities of industries and their use of water may be monitored as an extraction of huge volumes of water. Often needs could run down supplies, leading to pollution problems downstream, with a major effect on fish life ensuing if there is not enough water coming through.  Lower levels of water, especially in summer time, can raise many problems, especially for the fishing industry.  It can have a major effect on anglers above all others.  The reality of conservation cannot be viewed in its environmental aspect alone.  It must be seen from the economic, social and cultural perspectives as well.  The message of conservation does not mean letting nature take over but means the wise use of money and manpower working in unison with nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I cannot speak with any particular authority on this subject.  I welcome the motion because it touches on a topic of great and growing importance and one which will not go away.  I very much welcome in principle the establishment of national parks and interpretative centres, which have developed rapidly in recent years.  They greatly improve <Col N="1196" /> the ability to tell tourists and foreigners about what type of country we are.  We can also learn a great deal from them.  I certainly have learned a great deal about Ireland from visiting various national parks and interpretative centres and I have been very grateful for the expertise and commitment which has gone into developing them.</P>
      <P>I do not know anything in particular about Mullaghmore.  I am one of those Senators who have not visited this site but, unlike those mentioned by Senator Daly, I am not going to pronounce on what ought to be done there.  For me it is a site unseen in every sense of the term, but I am a very strong supporter of respect for local opinion where it is clear it has not been manipulated.  One of the most valuable developments of the environmental movement has been the growth of strong local opinion across the country on a whole range of issues arising from these proposals.</P>
      <P>I recall listening to &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; on radio a few years ago.  The whole programme was devoted to Luggala. It took the form of a think-in in the vicinity of Luggala.  Two things struck me very forcibly.  The Office of Public Works officials came across as extremely dedicated and crusading in their commitment to the development of interpretative centres.  However, at times they also came across as having the mentality of colonial governors, as if they knew it all and the backward natives did not.  Their attitude was could the natives not stop being obstreperous, realise what was good for them and accept the superior wisdom of central Government authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not competent to judge where wisdom lay but I was very taken aback to sense the mindset and attitude coming through.  I hope officials who may have grown up in that mindset will have learned from the experience of the last few years that this simply has no future in dealing with strong local feeling and that the commitment they undoubtedly have will be in a sense placed more modestly at the service of local aspiration rather than seeking to impose what is deemed to be superior wisdom on the natives.  I hope this is one area <Col N="1197" /> about which we have learned a great deal in the last few years.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the Minister's speech, one is very struck by the rhetoric of &ldquo;the planet earth&rdquo;, &ldquo;the good ship Earth&rdquo;, &ldquo;communicating with nature&rdquo; and all these wonderful things of which I and all of us are strongly in favour. I suspect the rhetoric is running a little ahead of the reality but in the right direction.  I welcome the rhetoric, even if it is a little more elevated than what we see out of doors when we move out of the building.  It is eloquent, indicative of the right direction in which to move and should be supported.</P>
    <P>The reference to the necessity to address these issues by international action, including educational actions to increase people's awareness of natural heritage, is obviously welcome but one does not have to wait for international action.  National action can improve people's awareness through the education system.  We should ask ourselves how we can incorporate more systematically in the education system awareness of the environmental dimension of virtually everything we do.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the Green Paper on education to the importance of environmental education.  I hope that when the White Paper is published this strand of the Green Paper &mdash; I have been critical of a number of the aspects of the Green Paper but I unreservedly welcome this aspect &mdash; will be developed systematically and that we will rear a growing generation which will be much more conscious from the beginning of the importance of environment proofing virtually any developments in economic and other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  We are sorry that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, could not be here.  I hope he is enjoying himself in Argentina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though I live near Mullaghmore, I do not know it as well as I should.  I will leave Senator O'Sullivan to comment on this matter if she has time.  She has walked the length and breadth of the Burren and can talk about it with authority.  I will deal with <Col N="1198" /> the other aspects of the motion.  I thank Senators Dardis and Honan for bringing this motion before us.</P>
    <P>Humanity together inhabits one world.  We have received it from previous generations.  We do not own the environment but hold it in trust for future generations.  For generations this truth was known and respected by communities in Ireland and throughout the world.  It is part of the religion of people in some parts of the world to respect the environment.  This is particularly true of the native Indians of America and the natives of Australia.</P>
    <P>Over the course of the years, particularly with the advent of the industrial revolution, we became arrogant in our belief that the world was there for us to exploit, ravage and to get as much from as we could without any consideration for the damage we were doing to our natural environment.  In enriching ourselves we were robbing our grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Throughout the world there has been a recognition that as we take from this world we also need to give back.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Dardis when he talks about the care we should take when we take vast quantities of water from rivers, even rivers as strong flowing as the Liffey.  In providing water for non-essential purposes such as car washes, there is the danger that we could rob a whole ecosystem of its ecological balance.</P>
    <P>Our relationship to the environment and the world we inhabit must be based on the total interdependence of everyone in that world.  When we create rubbish we must realise that somebody somewhere has to put up with it.  If we do not recycle it, we put it into our bins and expect it to be taken away and dumped somewhere else.  The NIMBY syndrome &mdash; not in my back yard &mdash; is alive and well in Ireland.  Nobody wants a dump in their own back yard.  Everybody is prepared to throw away cigarette papers and milk cartons but we have yet to find people who say they would love to have a dump in their parish. I do not see any advertisements in the papers for any community seeking a dump in its area.  This problem is faced <Col N="1199" /> not just in Kill but by every local authority in Ireland.  Nobody wants to take responsibility for the rubbish they create themselves.</P>
    <P>It is very pleasing to receive the <i>Environmental Bulletin</i> and see the grants which are available to various companies in the private sector for recycling.  For example, Kerbside Dublin, Rehab, and even Statoil garages, offer a collection service for recyclable items.  Various companies throughout the length and breadth of Ireland are prepared to make the effort to involve themselves in recycling so that it becomes profitable as well as providing good environmental management rather than just a pious aspiration.  In a previous debate in this House I spoke of the need to consider turning biological waste into bio-gas before it reaches our lakes and rivers, thus turning a potentially lethal weapon into something of use on farmland.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the National Heritage Council Bill, which was initiated in the Seanad by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  That Bill will be of enormous importance when it is fully implemented because vast areas will be designated as heritage areas to be preserved for future generations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, our natural environment is a unique resource held in trust by this generation on behalf of the nation.  In order to manage our environment sensibly and responsibly on behalf of the community it is essential that we expand considerably our monitoring of the environment.  The rapid growth of urban and rural settlements, the <Col N="1200" /> increase of industrialisation and the application of industrial methods in agriculture combine to threaten the existing balance of the environment. This basic natural resource is essential and non-renewable.  We should keep in mind the fact that once we destroy this earth it will be impossible to reconstruct; there is no other earth for us to inhabit.</P>

      <P>Mar is gnách.  This motion gives us an opportunity to develop some necessary points, such as where we are going in relation to interpretative centres and the preservation of our environment.  However, I cannot agree with the motion and in particular the first two parts.  There are, possibly, elements within the whole motion that we can accept, but I do not think we can accept the first part because of the major debate has taken place on the development of the Burren and the Mullaghmore interpretative centre.  It seems strange that most of the controversy against the interpretative centre for Mullaghmore and the Burren is urban based.  Generally speaking, urban people are against it, while local people and rural people are in favour.</P>
      <P>There has been controversy all over the world regarding interpretative centres.  In certain places where they are close to an area of natural beauty these centres have worked.  In other areas it has been found that where they are away from the area of natural beauty or the particular item or monument that is being interpreted, they have not worked.  Since international thinking on interpretative centres has not yet been focused, we cannot say that one is right in a certain place while another is wrong in another place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interpretative centres in Mayo and in Glenbeigh in County Donegal <Col N="1201" /> are a credit to everybody concerned. One can have an interpretative centre in an area of such natural beauty as Glenbeigh Park, into which one can drive; and rather than taking away from the environment, it enhances the area.  I have not heard anyone saying either that that centre has taken away from the natural beauty of the area or that the natural beauty has been downgraded due to the numbers of visitors that continue to go there.</P>
    <P>It seems that if you are a musician, actor or film star of international stature you know everything about environmental protection.  But those in the entertainment business who are against interpretative centres, in the Boyne Valley or elsewhere, are the very people who will beat the doors down to hold huge concerts in County Meath, bringing thousands upon thousands of people to an area in which they do not want an interpretative centre built.  In my opinion, there is an imbalance in their thought process.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny is in a national park but nobody who is giving out about the interpretative centres around the country has given any thought to the environmental damage to Kilkenny city because of the influx of visitors.  We love to see them visiting the Castle, the Cathedral, Rothe House and various other places of international interest. The interpretative centre for Kilkenny is in the city centre and it attracts a huge number of tourists.  We are trying our best to develop road and parking systems to allow the continued development of these facilities for tourists and local people, while not downgrading their quality of life.  Unless local people benefit as well, there is no point in having interpretative centres for tourists.</P>
    <P>I know the Burren area extremely well, having visited it on holidays since I was a child.  There is a need for an interpretative centre there.  Having looked at it, I do not see anything particularly wrong with the suggested site for the interpretative centre.  I have examined it as somebody who loves the area, what grows there and its natural beauty.  Unless there is an interpretative centre in that area, there cannot be <Col N="1202" /> management of visitors to it.  There is no point in establishing an interpretative centre on the present site or any place else unless there is management of the visitors who are now tramping all over that magnificent scene with its historic flora and fauna which cannot be found in many other places in the world.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we must safeguard areas of unique scientific, historical and scenic significance as is stated in the motion.  Looking at the work carried out by the Office of Public Works on many sites and in many different environments, I cannot point to one and claim it is a badly completed job.  The standard of workmanship and thought that has been put into such works in the past has been tremendous.</P>
    <P>The motion seeks &ldquo;to take steps to limit landfill disposal of refuse&rdquo;.  There is a huge problem with refuse disposal in this country.  There must be greater emphasis on recycling.  Landfill disposal will not be an easy option in the future. Kilkenny was the first area that was obliged to abide by the new EU rules on landfill sites.  The cost of installing a dump at present is enormous.  A base must be installed.  Pipes must be installed to remove gas and one must be certain that water and leachate can be removed.  The water around the area must be preserved and so forth.  It is an enormous problem that must be addressed.  The cost of addressing it is also enormous.  Site management of landfills is of extreme importance. Unless site management is good, there will be problems in any landfill area. However, if the site is managed properly according to the rules and regulations that must be followed, one need not be afraid.  The landfill site in Kilkenny is within 150 yards of the Nore river and there has been no problem with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with every part of the motion and in particular with its call &ldquo;to take steps to limit landfill disposal of refuse&rdquo;.  I welcome the Minister. I am sure he will bring my comments to the attention of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>I have read a great deal of material on this issue.  The Geological Survey of Ireland tells us that landfill will only be permitted subject to site investigation, adequate operational safeguards and sufficient containment to satisfy the proposed EU Directive.  Landfill sites underlaid by permeable strata will eventually cause ground water pollution unless there is an upward hydraulic grid or unless multiple composite liners are used with sophisticated leachate monitoring and collection systems.</P>
      <P>I could continue to discuss the survey report, but I wish to put on record the absolutely appalling situation at a landfill site being operated in north Cork.  It is not subject to regulations of any description, even EU regulations.  I am very angry about this.  It was established in 1990.  At that time we were told that an environmental impact survey was not necessary because the amount being disposed of would be less than the 25,000 tonnes per annum which is required in the EU Directive.  We were also told that the site would take only domestic refuse collected by the local authority and refuse from one or two contractors who would be closely monitored.  By 1992, 24,000 tonnes of refuse per annum were being deposited in the site without any control whatsoever.  None of the measures in the EU Directive was put in place because less than 25,000 tonnes per annum were being deposited there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consulted the Geological Survey of Ireland again.  It tells us that in that locality there is a very important regional aquifer.  Other documentation from authorities on this issue prove beyond doubt that even landfill sites provided with liners leach into the aquifers. Within three years the same local authority, the northern division of Cork County Council, was taking refuse not <Col N="1204" /> from one or two contractors who are being monitored but from five contractors, one of whom is from outside the county.  Two others are from areas far removed from north Cork.  What happened?</P>
    <P>My concluding point will demonstrate why I am opposed to the landfill system. A subcontractor of one of the contractors arrived at the site in Ballyguyroe and he &mdash; and not the council people who were supposed to be monitoring the site &mdash; found two plastic disposable ten millimetre pipettes, a photocopy of the title page of an agricultural research journal of November 1994, disposable syringes with plastic needles and a sample containing coagulated blood.  That came from the Agricultural Institute at Moorepark in Fermoy.  The blood was sent to the forensic laboratory of the Department of Justice which determined that it was bovine blood.  That refuse was found in a landfill site in Ballyguyroe over a major regional aquifer. This continues without let or hindrance and I could not let this occasion pass without putting the appalling situation there on the record.</P>
    <P>It is fine to talk about EU directives. Are they in place?  Are they being put in place?  Is the document <i>Selection and Management of Landfill Sites</i> of the Geological Survey on ground water aspects of the issue being implemented? I would say not.  If it was being implemented we would not have the appalling situation in Ballyguyroe.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Members of the House would agree with many aspects of this motion.  However, to lump together five different areas which have little in common is playing politics with important and sensitive issues.  In my discussion of the five areas I will start with the last two mentioned in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody would agree with sections (d) and (e), particularly section (d) which states &ldquo;to take steps to limit landfill disposal of refuse&rdquo;.  However, it is highly irresponsible for any party to propose that we should take steps to limit landfill disposal of refuse in such <Col N="1205" /> as bland fashion as is proposed in this motion without suggesting some alternatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should read the operational programme which was published by the Government of which he was a part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to have a row with Senator Dardis but the only answer to landfill disposal of refuse is the technological developments which are now to be found in other parts of the world and which, inevitably, will have to come to this country.  The problem with such developments is that they are extremely expensive.  I suggest to Senator Dardis and his party that it would be a very responsible step if they were to undertake some examination of the alternatives.</P>
      <P>For example, 30 power stations have been developed in major cities throughout the United States, using the waste-to-energy technology which was developed in Germany.  This has taken care of the refuse problem in those cities. A very interesting joint venture takes place between the private and public sectors and local government to develop those waste-to-energy power stations which dispose of all of the waste and refuse in the cities concerned.  We should examine seriously the possibility of locating such a facility in Dublin.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about tackling this problem, instead of simply taking steps to limit the landfill disposal of refuse, we must also provide alternatives.  The Seanad should look at the cost and other implications and talk to some of the companies concerned, such as Ogdon which is the main operator of those power stations in the United States.  Of course, it involves very significant capital and running costs, but that is the price which has to be paid if we want to deal with refuse in the most modern and environmentally friendly way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section (e), which states &ldquo;to reduce water abstraction from rivers and lakes where there is potential for environmental damage&rdquo;, is without question a very desirable proposal which is not as <Col N="1206" /> difficult to deal with as many people might think.  There has never been any such problem in the west of Ireland and I take it that there will not be such a problem in the east either.</P>
    <P>However, with regard to the first three sections, I have very strong feelings about the objections which have been raised to the Office of Public Works's proposals for interpretative centres.  I am often critical of the Office of Public Works but its work in regard to interpretative centres has been second to none.  I have to smile at the objections to developments at places such as Mullaghmore and Luggala as I live a mile from Coole Park and if the objections which I have heard for the last number of years stood up, Coole Park would be a disaster area today. The Office of Public Works put an interpretative centre in Coole Park, which was the home of Lady Gregory, and Senator Daly was instrumental in its development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an exactly similar forest situation to that of Luggala.  Thousands of people now walk through Coole Park as a result of the interpretative centre and we want more people to go there.  It defies logic to say that an interpretative centre in Coole Park is <Col N="1207" /> acceptable whereas one in the centre of a forest in Wicklow is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>I note in the Minister's speech that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will make a recommendation to Government about Mullaghmore.  If I know the Minister, I am sure that he will recommend that work on the centre should be discontinued.  When the next Fianna Fáil Government is in power, whenever that may be, the centre in Mullaghmore will be built.</P>
      <P>I live a couple of miles from the Burren, where I spend most of my free time, and to me it is the most precious landscape in the world.  I spent many hours in Mullaghmore before the interpretative centre was discussed, during the time it was built and since then, and I am utterly convinced that the interpretative centre will not have the negative effect on the Burren which so many people feel that it will.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Government goes ahead with Mullaghmore and that people such as the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, in particular, ensure it is built because, like Coole Park, when it is finished many of today's concerns will no longer exist.  However, even if it does not go ahead in the short term, it will go ahead in the long term because it is the proper course of action for the Burren.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I welcome the new development in the planning systems as, heretofore, bodies such as the Office of Public Works did not have to apply for planning permission. In my own county, the question of road development into a site caused a great deal of controversy because the Office of Public Works expected the county council to build the road and the county council expected the Office of Public Works to do it.  Thankfully, money was made available from the INTERREG fund as otherwise there would have been a major problem.  The local authority should have a say in such cases.  If a private individual applied for development, the issue of the road would arise and they might have to pay a hefty charge in order to cater for the extra <Col N="1208" /> traffic which the development would generate.  I welcome that recent change in the planning regulations.</P>
      <P>A visitors' centre opened near where I live last autumn which has been a huge success.  That centre would probably not exist but for the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, who visited our village one day when going to Mayo and gave the go-ahead for two visitors' centres, one in Keenagh, County Longford and the other in Mayo.  There was no local controversy but people were concerned that there should be an access road to the centre.  There was complete co-operation with local people through the local development committee and the Office of Public Works.  One hopes when the Minister comes back from Argentina he will open the centre in the not too distant future.  We look forward to having this as a major tourist attraction in the midlands.  As Senators are aware my area does not have many such attractions and a development like this enhances our tourism potential.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get involved in a discussion about Clare because so much has been and remains to be said and written about it, but that area has always received a great boost from tourism. Perhaps visitors there are taken for granted and may not be fully appreciated. Natural areas are there to be enjoyed and perhaps some do not want to share them with the public.  The Office of Public Works has done fantastic work in creating interpretative centres and has always maintained the character of areas.  Connemara Park and Glenveagh Park in Donegal are examples of the perfection it has achieved over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great care to Senator Belton's contribution and I support what he said.  The work which has taken place in Ardagh and other areas in County Longford has been magnificent.  Our area is the undiscovered part of Ireland.  Mystery tours are currently being held there and are extremely popular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest need in our area is for information centres.  At the &ldquo;Seven Wonders of Fore&rdquo;, visited by up to <Col N="1209" /> 2,000 people a week, people are clamouring for information about this unique area.  I would have no hesitation in supporting this great gift of communication, provided it was done in consultation with local people, because it will provide many jobs.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the greatest opportunity the country has had for the last 25 years is at hand.  Tourism is one of the three great industries supported by all Governments since the time of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, in 1987.  The current Government also believes there is great potential for growth in tourism.  I speak about this industry with enormous experience.</P>
    <P>The latest market research shows the number one tourist attraction for Americans is castles.  My area contains an abundance of castles.  There is Knockdrin Castle and the famed Tullynally Castle where the famous author, Mr. Thomas Pakenham, resides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a castle in Delvin.  We have more than our fair share of tourist attractions; we only lack the expertise or the people to market them.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach comes from the beautiful area of Roscommon. The midlands also includes Cavan &mdash; which features Dún na Rí &mdash; and my county, Westmeath.  There must be a development drive by everyone concerned.</P>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, to the House.  He is a man of experience and is a great rural representative, as all of us from the country like to think of ourselves.  There is no doubt that information centres are vital to market, promote and give the public the information required.  I could speak on this for much longer but I gladly give way to my colleagues who wish to contribute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will concentrate entirely on Mullaghmore because the points made on the other side should be answered.  Senator Lanigan suggested the objections to the Mullaghmore site were urban based and that is wrong. The environmental impact study on Mullaghmore showed there were locally organised groups on both sides of the argument.  Messages from both sides were signed by people living in the area. To say this was imposed from outside is untrue, although it has been said time and again.  There were large numbers of people on both sides of the argument from County Clare and County Galway.</P>
      <P>The objections to Mullaghmore are to the site, not to the concept of interpretative centres.  People welcome the concept but not on the particular site.  It is different from Coole Park, mentioned by Senator Fahey, which is a developed area, not a wilderness area like Mullaghmore. There are not great numbers walking all over Mullaghmore, as was suggested by Senator Lanigan; it is beautiful because of its stillness and isolation. That is why people are objecting. There is no objection to an interpretative centre where jobs can be provided in a place like Kilfenora, Corofin or Ballyvaughan.  Those areas have structures and there are no difficulties with the sensitive ground water or turlough system.</P>

      <P>Senator Daly is the only one of us present who has had the privilege of serving in Cabinet and he would tell us there are 15 people with differing points of view.  Nothing which goes to Cabinet is pre-ordained.  Nonetheless what has happened here has been useful because it will feed into the Cabinet discussion.</P>
      <P>I agree with 99 per cent of Senator Dardis's motion.  The one portion with which I have difficulty &mdash; I do not disagree with it &mdash; is the part on Mullaghmore. My views on Mullaghmore are very close to those of Senators O'Sullivan and Sherlock, your own, Sir, and those of some people on the far side who have not spoken this evening.  My views may be quite different in some ways to those of my friend, the Minister of State here.  The simple fact of the matter is that we are being asked to take a major decision on Mullaghmore tonight.  The Programme for Government lays down, as one of its priorities, that this will be examined in a short space of time.  The Government will make its recommendation in light of all that has been said and done and any decision will take into account the Bord Pleanála decisions, the court cases and so on and it will be in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extraordinary issue.  Mullaghmore hit us all between the eyes as an issue which came from nowhere, took off and suddenly developed a momentum which has raised passions and feelings in a way that none of us could have envisaged.  It has almost become a civil war in some families in different parts of the country, both rural and urban.  I <Col N="1212" /> do not think there is any right or correct position on it.  Senator Daly made a valid point.  The Minister's own feelings and well expressed views on Mullaghmore have extraordinary validity, as have the views of Senator O'Sullivan. The job of Government is, in the public interest, to try to reconcile the two points of view without tearing the Irish people apart.  We all love the country and do not want to do any damage of which our children can accuse us of afterwards.  On the other hand, we want the best economic livelihood and so on. The views are very strongly held.</P>
    <P>I will be urging my colleagues in Government not to vote but to abstain on this motion tonight, which is an unusual thing for a Government party to do.  I will urge them to abstain because the arguments have been made here tonight and it is up to the Government to listen to what has been said.  A vote from here telling the Government that it can do this or should not do that is not going to change its view.  The arguments have been very well expressed here this evening.</P>
    <P>I would prefer this debate to take place two or three weeks down the line when we have a Government decision on which we can argue and vote and where the vote would make some difference. It is unusual but I will urge my colleagues in the Government parties &mdash; but they are free to do as they wish &mdash; to suspend judgment on this issue and ensure that the arguments made here tonight will be laid before the people making the Government decision.  That decision will be made in light of all the information, the renegotiated Programme for Government, the new partnership in Government and so on.</P>
    <P>We have all learnt a great deal from this debate.  None of us would go about doing what was done in the same way ever again, and thank God for that.  We have all learnt a great deal but now is the time, rather than hectoring and adopting an entrenched position, to at least listen to what everybody was saying. Let us hope that the Government will make the right decision in all our interests.</P>

      <P>The Leader's last remarks have drawn me into an area into which I had not intended to intrude, but he has prompted me to do so.  It concerns democracy and what democracy is all about.  In my view, it is quite appropriate for a House of the Oireachtas to demand of the Government that it do certain things, not the other way around.  That is a fairly central issue in that whole argument.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to what has been a very good debate.  There were some Adjournment issues during the debate but, apart from that, it has been a good debate.  I agree with practically everything the Minister said in his address and I thank him for the comprehensive nature of his reply to the debate.  I agree so much with what he said that I would be very surprised if the Government parties could not support the motion before the House this evening.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear that there will be a Cabinet decision on this matter in the near future.  I take note of what was said about the policy agreement when the Government was formed.  I had some difficulties however when the Minister spoke of Minister Higgins deliberating on it calmly as it is not something that I readily associate with the Minister.  I am sure he will give it deliberation &mdash; whether it be calm or not I am not so sure, but that is by the way.</P>
      <P>I do not have criticisms about the Office of Public Works's work and I would not like it to be suggested that I do.  However, like all organisations, they can make mistakes.  Senator O'Sullivan's point is central to this argument. The issue is not what they or these centres do, but where they do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparing Coole Park with Mullaghmore, which stands over porous limestone, is a total fallacy.  We are in favour of national parks.  Nobody has suggested during the course of this debate that anybody is not in favour of national parks, but we have to draw lines in terms of where some of these centres are built.  One thing Mullaghmore has achieved is that is has made us concentrate our minds on the nature of the argument before us.  We have had much <Col N="1214" /> rhetoric and the aspiration is fine &mdash; as I said, I agree with what the Minister said &mdash; but it comes back to how we do it.</P>
    <P>The matter of elitism has to be nailed. There is an idea that there is some privileged elite trying to prevent every development in the country.  We would not have a Christian Church were it not for an elite of 12 plus one.  An elite can actually do something and tell us what we need to be told.  There is a conflict between what local communities need and want in terms of jobs, development and tourism potential and what is demanded of us from a national perspective and even more so from an international perspective.</P>
    <P>We have to get it into our heads that tourists are attracted to this country by the quality of the environment.  For somebody to say that they cannot see the connection between the different elements of the motion surprises me because it is about the quality of the environment in this country, whether it be the built environment, the natural environment, the aquatic environment or whatever.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point in respect of building interpretative centres all over the country.  I have been to Fore and I recognise its quality.  However, Fore has an additional quality which is characteristic of places such as Coole.  It has an immense resource which we do not appreciate in our own community &mdash; the sound of silence.  It is an inestimable quality for somebody who lives in the Ruhr valley, an American city or a built community to be able to go and stand in the country, hear the birds and listen to the water.  That is the greatest resource we have.</P>

We are just passing through; we are the custodians. There is a solemn responsibility on us to maintain the resource in the condition we found it and pass it on to the next generation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity of making my case on the need for a neonatal centre in Cork and I thank the Minister for being here.  There are approximately 6,000 deliveries per year in Cork and there is no purpose built neonatal centre for the country's second biggest city and county, in contrast to smaller towns such as Tralee or Letterkenny which have neonatal centres.</P>
      <P>Deliveries in Cork are spread between four hospitals &mdash; Erinville, St. Finbarr's, the Bons Secours and the Victoria. The staff of these hospitals do an outstanding job under difficult circumstances. They are not, however, neonatal experts and cannot be expected to provide the same level of specialised support available in purpose built neonatal centres.  There is currently just one registrar available at nights and weekends to cover maternity duties at Erinville, St. Finbarr's and Cork University hospitals.</P>
      <P>In many cases childbirth is a relatively simple affair; in some, however, complications can lead to various forms of handicap and in other cases new born babies may die due to lack of expert care.  A few minutes can make all the difference between a healthy baby and a baby with mental or physical handicap. By the same token complications during labour can endanger the life of the mother, requiring specialist intensive care facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am calling for the establishment of a purpose built centre for neonatal excellence which would offer women choice, control and, above all, safety during the process of childbirth.  Such a centre would offer pre, peri and post natal care and would provide an outpatient as well as in-patient service, as well as having full intensive care facilities. It would also cater for women who are either threatened by miscarriage or who have experienced a miscarriage, and would provide the medical and <Col N="1217" /> psychological support for such women's needs.</P>
    <P>Unless we move to establish such a facility we will continue to witness needless tragedies before, during and after childbirth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Senator Sherlock for raising this matter and for giving me an opportunity to outline the position regarding maternity and neonatal services in Cork city and county. At present maternity services in the Cork area are provided in the places the Senator mentioned &mdash; Cork University, Erinville, St. Finbarr's and the South Infirmary-Victoria hospitals.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock will be aware that my Department has received a number of submissions in relation to the organisation and delivery of the neonatal and maternity services from the various agencies in the Cork area.  In April 1993 the Southern Health Board adopted a proposal to have maternity and neonatology services currently sited at the Erinville and St. Finbarr's hospitals amalgamated at the Cork University Hospital site.  The board is of the view that consolidation of its services on this single site would make the best use of resources available and result in a greatly enhanced service to patients.</P>
      <P>This proposal is being examined in the light of medical opinion on how best to provide the optimal level of care to mothers and babies, and also in the context of the recommendations on manpower planning and organisational structures contained it the recent Comhairle na nOspidéal report, <i>Review of Consultant Manpower in the Southern Health Board Area.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator will appreciate that the health board's proposal would require major capital investment over a number of years and would have to be considered in the context of the resources available to my Department.  However, the Southern Health Board has indicated that this matter is now a top priority for it.  Officials from my Department met management and medical representatives from the Southern Health <Col N="1218" /> Board recently to discuss proposals they had made in relation to their maternity services and facilities.</P>
    <P>Additional information has been sought from the board on a number of aspects of their proposal.  I look forward to receiving this material as a matter of urgency and I hope to be in a position to progress this matter further as soon as clarification is received on the issues raised.  I assure Senator Sherlock that any future developments in this regard will take full account of the need to ensure the optimum level of service for women and their babies in the Cork area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin. Many figures have been bandied about in the last few weeks with regard to funding for roads in the Cavan-Monaghan area and, in particular, with regard to the INTERREG programme. However, everybody agrees that Monaghan and Cavan have the worst county and regional roads in the country.  This is a particularly serious problem for an area that has such intensive farming in pigs, milk, mushrooms and poultry. County Monaghan also has a strong industrial base in furniture and food processing.</P>
      <P>These counties also suffer the big disadvantage of having no rail link to transport the heavy goods necessary for such intensive production.  As a consequence, the roads have to bear the brunt of the heavy traffic that is so much a feature of modern life.</P>
      <P>Rainfall this year has been the heaviest in living memory &mdash; double the normal amount for the period.  This has, in many cases, washed away the road surface. I have already mentioned that traffic is very heavy with the intensity of the industries in County Monaghan, scattered over all areas of the county.  A figure which illustrates this point is that 6 per cent of the country's agricultural exports come from County Monaghan which has only 2 per cent of the country's land area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> No roads escape being used by heavy vehicles as every farmer is now visited by a bulk tanker, a meal truck or an articulated truck delivering fertilizer.  In view of this, people were pleased at the indications that funds might be made available for the roads infrastructure under the INTERREG 2 programme and also under the Community Initiative intended to support the peace process. However, these moneys will serve no purpose if the State siphons off the allocations by reducing the national allocations to the roads in this county.</P>
    <P>Counties Monaghan and Cavan need the full national allocation and additional funds from the sources mentioned. Additionality is the key.  The Minister should clarify that INTERREG and peace process funds for county and regional roads will be additional to the normal national funding that could be expected under the national roads programme.</P>
    <P>With the reduction of rates and the removal of rates from agricultural land and houses the amount of money the county council can provide for roads from its own resources is limited.  For example, with limited local resources Monaghan County Council provides nearly £1 million towards its roads programme. The allocation for Monaghan and Cavan County Councils was severely reduced in the recent allocation of moneys for roads.  Unless major extra funding is provided from INTERREG II and the peace process money, there is a danger that the total roads structure of both counties will fall apart.  Both counties have an exceptional length of mileage of county roads and an exceptionally high density of heavy vehicles travel on them.  Roads that were built for horses and carts are now trying to carry 40 foot articulated trucks with allowable gross weights of up to 40 tonnes.  Obviously, the old roads will not serve the modern economy, of which we are very proud, in our county.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, last August we saw the end of violence in Northern Ireland, which resulted in the welcome opening of many closed Border roads.  Great hardship was experienced by many <Col N="1220" /> people when they were closed.  The result of the opening of these roads has been an increase in cross-Border traffic of almost 20 per cent.  Traffic routes are changing since these 40 or more bridges have been opened and many roads that were quiet in the past are now very busy.  This is a great benefit to towns along the Border areas.  Clones, for example, will benefit greatly from this increased business.  However, these roads must be maintained to a reasonable standard.  I call on the Minister to unequivocally state that major extra funding will be made available to allow us to embark on an ambitious upgrading programme of our roads network.  It is also imperative that these moneys should be announced immediately to enable the works programme to be carried out by next spring or summer to avail of the good weather at that time.</P>
    <P>As European borders, particularly that unnatural Border between ourselves and Northern Ireland, begin to disappear, it will be important for the southern Border counties that our infrastructure matches that of the North.  We have a short time to make up the shortfall. I ask the Minister to clearly state that major progress will be made in this direction in 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important issue.  As Senators will be aware, the EU INTERREG II programme represents a significant new source of funding which will be available during this new year for our non-national roads.  The traditional problems encountered by Border areas in promoting economic development due to distances from the main centres of economic activity are being addressed by this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1992-93 INTERREG I programme, insofar as it related to roads, made a valuable contribution towards addressing the disadvantages experienced by Border areas.  In fact, the financial provisions for road improvements in the qualifying counties amounted to £2.1 million in 1992 and £2.4 million in 1993.  The INTERREG II programme will benefit not only roads along the <Col N="1221" /> land Border with Northern Ireland but also certain maritime areas, and substantially increased funding will be available as compared with INTERREG I.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Border region, £6 million will be made available for non-national roads in 1995 alone.  The EU Commission gave its approval recently to the draft framework programme under this heading which had been submitted to it and local authorities will be invited by my Department to nominate projects for consideration under this element of the programme in the near future.  I sought to facilitate the councils concerned, including Cavan and Monaghan, in drawing up their proposals for funding under INTERREG II by including indicative allocations under this heading in the grants already notified to them.  Payment of these grants is conditional on each council putting forward significant and sufficient qualifying projects so as to be in a position to expend its allocation in the current year.</P>
    <P>In the case of the maritime element of INTERREG, £2 million will be available in 1995 under this heading for non-national roads.  The project selection criteria will, it is understood, focus on projects making a contribution to strengthening linkages between Irish and Welsh ports.  Insofar as the roads area is concerned, projects that improve access to these ports from certain counties will be eligible for assistance during the lifetime of the programme and the local authorities will be consulted in due course in this regard.</P>
    <P>INTERREG II funding represents an important source of funding for non-national roads in the 1995-96 period and will facilitate further significant improvements in the network in the Border region, including, of course, Counties Cavan and Monaghan, and in qualifying counties under the maritime element of the programme.  Every effort must be made to utilise these resources in the most beneficial way for the communities and regions concerned and my Department will rigorously examine proposals from local authorities for funding in this area with a view to ensuring this end.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> I would now like to place the funding in 1995 under the INTERREG II programme in the broader context of the overall 1995 grant allocations for non-national roads.  The fact that these allocations totalled almost £103 million is indicative of the Government's major commitment to non-national roads. While the provision is marginally less than last year's figure of £107 million, the resources provided in that year were significantly boosted by a once off allocation from the receipts of the tax amnesty, a point that was clearly and explicitly made by the then Minister for Finance.  When this exceptional allocation of £15 million is excluded, the 1995 grants are up on the underlying 1994 provision by 12 per cent and by an even higher amount on the allocation for any previous year.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that an element of the discretionary grant provision for county councils, amounting to £5 million in 1995, was reserved for the purpose of making supplementary allocations for road improvements to a number of councils in counties where the conditions of roads is particularly poor. These counties include Cavan and Monaghan. I determined the amount of the grant allocation to the councils concerned, having regard to the situation in each county.  This practice is consistent with the approach adopted by my predecessors and represents an element of positive discrimination in favour of counties such as Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will agree, therefore, that these counties have been treated in a very reasonable and satisfactory manner insofar as the 1995 allocations for non-national roads are concerned. Lest there be any doubt, however, about this matter, let me explain that while the grants for Cavan and Monaghan represent almost £2,400 for every mile of non-national road in these counties, the corresponding figure for all remaining county councils only comes to £1,600.  This demonstrates beyond doubt that these counties have fared very well and any suggestion to the contrary simply ignores the facts. The particular problems, therefore, affecting the non-national road systems <Col N="1223" /> in Cavan and Monaghan have been fully taken into account by me in the grants I have allocated and they reflect this.  I am confident that the House will fully support my actions in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for allowing this subject to be discussed.  The area to which I refer is Clarina village in County Limerick. Limerick County Council has been supportive and has agreed to have some of the improvements required in this village completed.  However, financial constraints have prevented it from providing footpaths throughout the village and from clearing and hardening road margins. I ask the Minister for the Environment to produce the necessary funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population of Clarina and its environs has increased dramatically in the past ten years.  It now has a population <Col N="1224" /> of approximately 2,000, including 249 primary and 210 secondary school going children who use the N69 which passes through the village.  The area is quite dangerous and there is much concern about the safety of the citizens of the village.</P>
    <P>The N69 is the estuarial road serving the area which also services a large number of industries, including Aughinish Alumina Limited, Wyeth (Ireland) Limited, Foynes harbour and the harbour industries.  New footpaths are required throughout the village for safety and the clearing and hardening of road margins is necessary to facilitate this.  Improved public lighting and sign-posting and an extension of the speed limit is required.</P>
    <P>The village is six miles from Limerick city and is no longer a small stretch of road inside the area of the restricted speed limit, but encompasses areas outside it.  The large population, which is increasingly serviced by activities in the village, requires more safety arrangements, with the necessary investment from the Department of the Environment.</P>
