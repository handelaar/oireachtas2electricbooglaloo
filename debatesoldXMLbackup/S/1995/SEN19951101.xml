      <P>I have notice from Senator Fahey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if she is aware that Garda strengths in Galway city are down by 22 since January 1994 with at least a further five retirements by January next; and if she will outline the number of Garda appointments she now proposes for Galway city and the timescale for those appointments.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if she is aware of the delay in her Department in granting a visa to a person (details supplied) who has <Col N="2" /> been granted a work permit and is expected to commence employment shortly.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make a statement regarding the delay in the transfer of corporation housing stock and land-bank to the three new Dublin local authorities.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Fahey's and Cosgrave's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator McGennis may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take items 1, 2 and 17, motion 22, today.  It is <Col N="3" /> proposed to take Committee and Remaining Stages of item 1 and item 2 until 6 p.m., depending on the availability of time at the conclusion of item 1.  I suggest a time limit of 20 minutes per speaker on item 2.  Item 17, motion 22, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that if time is not available to deal with item 2 it will remain on the agenda for consideration later?  If time remains at the conclusion of item 1 perhaps an arrangement might be made to reorder the business of the House to afford the debate on item 2 its proper standing.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions we have requested a debate on crime and drug related activities during this session and the Leader has agreed.  I believe this House needs an opportunity to discuss the Government's policy on crime in light of statements made by the Garda Commissioner in his request for further prison spaces to be made available in the fight against rising crime and in relation to a recent settlement made by the State to the victim of a prisoner on early release.  I urge the Leader to provide time in the coming weeks for a full debate in this House to give the Opposition an opportunity to put forward its views and ideas on dealing with crime.</P>
      <P>I also raised the issue of a debate on Northern Ireland.  Some very constructive debates have taken place in this House during the past year.  Before the visit of President Clinton at the end of this month, Members should be given a chance to air their views and opinions on the way forward in relation to the situation in Northern Ireland.  I urge the Leader to provide time for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to again raise the issue of the intergovernmental conference which takes place next year. The changes likely to emerge from those discussions will have a far greater impact on our lives than anything which might be decided in the referendum that takes place later this month.  I ask the <Col N="4" /> Leader to consider inviting involvement from those Irish MEPs responsible for dealing with this issue at European level.  The Leader is now entitled to invite people other than Members of the House to participate in our debates following the changes made to Standing Orders.  I ask him to consider providing time for such a debate.</P>
      <P>I understand the difficulties in encouraging people's interest in Europe but there seems to be an extraordinary neglect in providing information.  People must recognise the changes which will take place in their lives following the next year's discussions with regard to neutrality, citizenship, legal rights, etc. The MEPs and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs should be invited to this House to indicate Government policy.  It is an extraordinary problem.  An understanding exists in Europe with regard to the position of every member state except Ireland about many of these issues. Much European documentation containing space for the Irish view on citizenship, etc., remains blank.  We need to discuss this issue so that there will not be a panic next spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's call for a debate on law and order, particularly in light of the incidents which took place in the Bally-fermot area last night.  Listening to the Garda Superintendent this morning, it was evident that he felt he was not getting the proper back up.  That is something we need to address within the scope of that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I raised with the Leader the question of what I saw &mdash; and what my party and others see &mdash; as undue interference in the affairs of Trinity College Dublin.  In the business which has been circulated since last Thursday and in today's Order of Business, the Leader said we would take statements on education; he said that in response more to a call from Senator O'Toole than to anything I said.  Is the Leader prepared to debate a substantive motion on this issue?  Senator Honan and I put down a <Col N="5" /> motion on it, item 17, motion 23.  When will this matter be dealt with?  Under the rota for Private Members' time, it will be after Christmas before a Progressive Democrats motion is heard.  We seem to be heard on an irregular basis. There have been more selective leakings in today's newspaper of the Minister's plans, or non-plans, for the university and we need to know what is the situation.  This is the place to establish the facts, not in the columns of <i>The Irish Independent.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point I want to make.  A briefing document is purported to have been circulated to Senators.  I certainly did not get a briefing document.  I do not know who got a briefing document.  Where is this briefing document?  What does it say?  When are we going to have this substantive motion debated?  Will we have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry sending his personal representative down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time to debate a serious situation which arises from the Taoiseach's statement last weekend.  The Taoiseach said there would be no additional funding, whether it is INTERREG, Cohesion or other EU funding; he said all the funding would be within the Government's expenditure programme but there would be no additionality. That sounds a note of warning to the Border counties and the west which <Col N="6" /> were expecting funds.  Without consulting anybody, I have had to write to the Regional Development Commissioner, Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, advising her that, although I have made many attempts to raise this matter and have it satisfactorily discussed in this House, the Leader has failed to provide time to discuss it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an urgent matter and it is even more urgent after the Taoiseach's statement over the weekend when he said there would be no additionality, that our monetary constraints were so tight that the Government was going to stick to the 2 per cent increase and that the only thing which mattered was the Maastricht&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In agreeing with the question from the leader of my group, I am hopeful the Leader will make time available for a law and order debate. When the Minister for Justice comes here, I ask the Leader to widen the discussion to include the prison spaces, penal policy and the bail laws.  The Leader will be aware that the Garda Commissioner said the shortage of jail accommodation is a big contributor to the rising crime rate.  We should also have an assurance from the Leader, and perhaps from the Minister, that none of the thugs involved in the riots last night was on bail or on temporary release.</P>
      <P>If the Minister's hands are being tied by the more liberal elements in Labour and Democratic Left, she can come to this House and be assured that we will support law and order policies because the people are sick and tired of the failure of this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>For a change I want to compliment a Minister.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Currie, is entitled to compliments regarding his statements during the last 48 hours.  He has decided to implement 42 sections of the Child Care Act, and he has given a commitment that all other sections will be <Col N="8" /> implemented between now and Christmas.  We have raised this matter on a number of occasions over the last 12 months and we should respond to such a welcome development in a positive way.</P>
      <P>In view of the serious allegations and Garda investigations into the alleged malpractice of a Cork doctor, will the Minister for Health make a statement, in this House or elsewhere, to allay the fears of those concerned?  Given the widespread concern, the Minister should assure the public that no such practices can or will be tolerated and that the strictest procedures are in place to prevent this happening in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms. Kelly Ms. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey the congratulations of the House to the research team headed by Dr. Peadar Kirk and Professor John Scott for the breakthrough in identifying causes of spina bifida.  Spina bifida affects more Irish people than any other race and the team has identified that its cause is genetic.  I also ask the Leader to communicate with the Minister for Health to take on board some of the recommendations of the research group. These include fortifying flour, bread and milk with folic acid, as well as using our health boards to encourage all women of child bearing age to take folic acid regularly to prevent the incidence of spina bifida.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the recent statement by the Garda Commissioner in so far as it underlines the need for the Government to proceed with the Castlerea prison project without further delay.  I support the call to the Leader for a debate on justice matters.  A day long debate is necessary since so many Members will wish to contribute on so many related issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Finneran in his generous tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Currie.  This House made substantial amendments to the Child Care Bill.  I fought hard with former Senator Brendan Ryan to <Col N="9" /> include the special provision for the interests of children, the <i>ad vitem</i> clause.</P>
      <P>I was pleased that Senator Kelly mentioned the research carried out by Professor John Scott and his colleagues, but she omitted to mention that that was in Trinity College Dublin.  It is precisely these kinds of research projects that are threatened by the Government's attitude towards education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very definitive question, a very interesting dissertation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason I would be interested to have the debate on education the Leader promised as well as looking at the matters raised by Senator Dardis.  While we welcome the caring interest in the fate of Trinity College and the other universities, it would have been a good idea to have discussed this in detail with representatives of the universities so that we could have a joint position on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to verify that the Labour Party, either in Government with Fine Gael or in coalition with Fianna Fáil, has never equivocated when dealing with crime.  Senator Mulcahy's disgraceful remark was cheap and unfounded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on law and order because matters have become more serious even in the past week.  We got rid of the &ldquo;Lugs&rdquo; Brannigans of Dublin and the big Pat Flynns of Sligo and replaced them with psychologists and psychiatrists.  That has failed and it is time we brought back the &ldquo;Lugs&rdquo; Brannigans and the Pat Flynns. I ask the Minister for Justice to come to the House to discuss this topic because law and order has got out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Senator McGowan on European funding.  I tried to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Can the Minister for the Environment give us an indication of the present situation in relation to the Cohesion Fund for water and sewerage schemes, many of which have been held up because of the failure to get clearance from the Government or Brussels?  It is not clear where the <Col N="11" /> bottleneck is and a number of schemes dealing with important environmental issues have been delayed because of the situation relating to the Cohesion Fund. It is critical because we are approaching the end of the year and if these schemes are to begin early next year, we must get some indication as regards the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister Transport, Energy and Communications if he has any plans on transportation over the Christmas period? We all know about the disaster last year &mdash; I believe I speak for all sides &mdash; when people had to wait two or three hours for a taxi.  Will the Minister arrange for buses to continue to run until 1 a.m?  If that cannot be done, would he allow private buses to operate?That is very important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the comments of my Border colleague, Senator McGowan.  The alleged statement by the Taoiseach at a meeting in Donegal last week in relation to additionality is already causing grave concern in the Border counties.  His parliamentary colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, promised there would be an element of additionality once the Delors package was put in place, which would mean a great deal for the enhancement of prosperity in the Border counties.  We have been waiting for this money and now we understand there will be no additionality and that these funds will be used as a substitute for Exchequer funding.  We would be grateful for some clarification of what was said.</P>
      <P>In the context of the law and order debate, many calls have been made in this House for debates on Northern Ireland, which are usually taken by the Tánaiste.  However, as most Members are aware, the Minister for Justice is also present at the discussions on Anglo-Irish relations and travels to London and Stormont.</P>

      <P>My question relates to reports in the media in the last few days about alleged foot dragging on the part of the British Government over the transfer of 30 republican prisoners to this jurisdiction.  In the context of the signing into law today of the ratification by this Government of the European Convention on the Transfer of Prisoners I would be very grateful if the Leader could establish, through the Minister, who, if necessary, should come into the House for a debate on law and order or Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As a comparatively new Member of the Seanad and in view of the fact that this is a legislative body with powers under the Constitution, I ask the Leader if, on the Order of Business, it is his intention to organise this House in such a way that questions could be raised on legislation or proposed legislation and not on whether people can get taxis home at certain times of the year?</P>

      <P>I also ask the Leader to make time for a full day's debate on the issue of law and order.  There is no monopoly of concern about this on any side of the House and there is concern throughout the land that we are beginning to lose confidence in the institutions of law and order, which would be dangerous.</P>
      <P>Last week I raised the issue of the freedom of information Bill.  What is the position on that Bill?  During its Second Stage in this House, the Bill which I proposed was effectively put on ice pending the Minister bringing forward her Bill. We understood she would come here in October and it is now November.  I understand there are difficulties at interdepartmental level.  The draft Government Bill I saw is extremely restricted and not one which any person who is interested in public service reform on any side of the House would endorse.</P>
      <P>I again ask for a debate on the Western European Union, not necessarily on foreign affairs in its widest sense. However, we need a debate on the expansion of European Union.  We are going to face a referendum as a result of the intergovernmental conference.  I believe the people are so unprepared politically for the issues which they will face in that referendum that there is a very real chance it would be lost.  It would be a good idea to have that debate at this stage.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that a document has been circulated about the governance of universities.  If such a document has been prepared, could it be circulated to all sides?  I have never seen it and I would have a professional interest in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has promised to introduce legislation restricting the concept of ministerial responsibility.  The Taoiseach recently suggested introducing a new concept in administrative law called personal responsibility which was promised in the programmes for <Col N="14" /> Government of both this and the previous Government.  When will we see that?  Could the Leader ascertain if that Bill could be introduced in this House?</P>

      <P>As Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Northern Ireland I ask the Leader to bring to the Taoiseach's attention that this House would like a response to statements which imply that the British Government is deliberately dragging its feet on the Northern peace process in order to ensure maximum impact closer to the British general election.This statement came from a senior source in the SDLP and is a matter of great concern which I would like to see addressed in this House.  From the same source comes the implication that the Irish Government's position is no longer of particular relevance or concern.  This is very serious, irrespective of the party to which one belongs.  I would like the Taoiseach or the Government spokesman to address this issue.  This is in support of my continuing request to the Leader for a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I want to add one point on the burning topic of law and order.  I was a member of the Government which recognised, albeit belatedly, the need for prison space.  We made provision in the Estimates for the prison in County Roscommon.The current Government, for reasons best known to itself, decided to cancel that decision.</P>

A debate would be timely in view of the number of working days lost in Ireland <Col N="15" /> and the effects alcoholism has on our younger population.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consult with the Taoiseach to ascertain what steps he will take to prevent she who cannot be mentioned from entering the political domain before each referendum on the side of the liberal agenda and whether she will continue to do this?</P>

This will have grave implications for the rural post office.  The Leader has been asked for a number of debates but I ask him to keep this in mind.  I said recently that we are not kept fully informed of happenings in the EU.  If the EU can introduce regulations over our heads which have serious implications for us, we should have a debate on the EU.</P>

      <P>There are calls for debates on various subjects today but I must get my priorities right and ask for a debate on agriculture.  I asked the Leader about this last week and he said it could be arranged in Private Members' time.  I do not agree because it is too important a matter to be dealt with in that way.  Government time should be provided for such a debate, especially in view of the unrest in the farming community over such matters as sheep farming and the delay in processing applications for grants to tackle farm pollution.  I also read bad news in the paper today where the EU is going to refuse Ireland's reclassification submission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very important that we have a debate on agriculture.  There are now only 54 days to Christmas and, given all the calls for debates, I hope the Leader will find time for a debate on this important subject.  I also agree with <Col N="16" /> the call for a debate on law and order, especially as Limerick has its crime problems.  Tractors in Munster are being stolen.  Many houses are being burgled for example, the house of neighbours of mine, two elderly brothers, who are also near neighbours of the Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice, was broken into.</P>

      <P>I support the calls for a debate on law and order.  We should discuss certain issues including bail and the need for additional prison places.  If the Minister is to attend the House, will the Leader add to the list of issues for discussion the condition of some of the Garda stations throughout the country? I had occasion to attend my local Garda station at Blanchardstown last Sunday night.  The conditions gardaí must work under are deplorable.  Shortly after her appointment, the Minister announced that we were to get a new Garda station. I am sure she will continue to fight for this within the Cabinet and I support her.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Sherlock's remarks on the question of transport, a very important matter.  During the previous session we were subjected to a very heavy lobby, inside the House and outside the gates, from those involved in the Centre for Independent Living. They made a hard plea to us to recognise the problems they are experiencing in terms of transport.  While I was at the gates, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, met those involved and told them he would address the matter.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to make public transport, or at least some parts of it, accessible to those who are disabled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised the Control of Horses Bill last week the Leader indicated that he did not know when it would be introduced to the House.  I was a member of a cross-party deputation who met the Minister.  Owing to threats and physical violence, local authority officials are no longer rounding up these unfortunate animals.  There is, therefore, a need, as <Col N="17" /> a matter of urgency, for this legislation to be introduced.</P>

If these Ministers can have these facilities installed in their offices, would the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to give each Senator at least the use of a PC?</P>

We have asked that armaments production be stopped and that countries be prevented from supplying arms to areas of conflict.

It would be timely to have a debate on the matter in this House.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition asked about the debate on the Ombudsman. The debate will be ongoing because it appears we will not have much time for it today.  The Senator also asked for debates on crime and Northern Ireland. I guarantee there will be debates on each of these topics between now and the end of session and, I hope, sooner rather than later.  I have also taken on board the views that the crime debate should be wide ranging.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned a debate on the Intergovernmental Conference.  I raised that issue with the Minister last week and he is agreeable in principle. We will find a date to hold such a debate.  That debate might also accommodate Senator Roche's views on defence policy.  It is one possibility to cover those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the education debate and the future of Trinity College and the National University.  The position in that regard is as I explained to the House last week.  The Minister circulated her proposals to the heads of universities some time ago and discussions have been taking place with them.  These discussions, I am reliably informed from many sources, are positive and a number of difficulties are being ironed out at this stage.  It is proposed to publish within the next few weeks a definite statement of the Government's intent &mdash; the Government's actual proposals and not what we read on the back page of <i>The Irish Times</i> or elsewhere.  As soon as these proposals are published I will make time <Col N="20" /> available for a full debate on them.  It is better that we proceed on the basis of what is actually being proposed than on what people think is about to be proposed.It would not be very helpful to have a debate on the negotiations, before certain difficulties have been ironed out between the heads of the universities and the Minister.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the open ended debate on education which was requested on many occasions by the other side of the House take place tomorrow along the lines suggested.  I hope too much time will not be taken up on the Order of Business tomorrow because people will want to contribute to this debate.  This debate will not exclude a discussion of third level education so if Members have concerns on that they can make them known to the Minister tomorrow and get her response.  I do not want to lose a great deal of time at the beginning of the debate tomorrow in votes and procedural discussions.  Education is something in which most Members have an interest.  I would like to see the format we are adopting tomorrow used on many other subjects as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris talked about consultation.The Minister should consult with the university Senators on any reform of third level education; they are elected by the graduates of the universities and would have a great deal to say.  I will pass on that very worth-while suggestion to the Minister.  Senator Dardis raised the question of a briefing document.There was a briefing document on the Minister's thinking sent out to all Government Senators.  I was never briefed by Fianna Fáil when I was in Opposition.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty having that document made available to all sides of the House.  It is simply a statement of where things are at present.  It is all in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Senator McGowan raised the question of additionality.  I will seek clarification on <Col N="21" /> that and, if possible, make time available.It is reprehensible to insinuate, as Senator Mulcahy did, that any person or party in this House is soft on crime.</P>
      <P>I will pass on Senator Finneran's comments to the Minister of State, Deputy Currie.  The allegations against the Cork doctor are the subject of Garda inquiries.No charges have been made and it is not possible or right to make any further reference until charges have been made, if they are to be made. Senator Kelly had some very positive things to say about the Trinity College research team with which I agree.  Other Senators referred to crime and EU funding.  I will try to get information on Cohesion Funds for Senator Daly. Other points were not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche asked a question about the Freedom of Information Bill: I gave that information last week.  This Bill will not be published before Christmas.  I will take the other issues into account.  Senator Lydon's cryptic and Delphic utterance I did not understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The whole postal service and the issue of deregulation is worth looking at.  Senator Kiely is very persistent; I will try to find time for a debate on agriculture between now and Christmas. Senator McGennis spoke about the Centre for Independent Living and we should have a follow up on that.  I will discuss it with the Senator later.  My good friend, Senator Bohan, made a relevant point.  I do not want to be discourteous to the Senator but I will try to get information on the question of transport.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I indicated that the board would be bound by the EU requirement that applications for product authorisations should be processed within 120 days. This, of course, should have been 210 days.  I regret that this inadvertent transposition of figures in the briefing notes supplied to me resulted in me giving incorrect information to the Seanad.  As soon as I became aware of the mistake I asked to have the record amended to show the correct period of time.  To clarify the situation EU Directive 65/65 requires that member states should take steps to ensure that the procedure for granting an authorisation is completed within 210 days of a valid application and, of course, this operates on a stop the clock basis.</P>

      <P>Senator Lee asked me if it is possible to table amendments which will save money.  The Minister can think about this and if, during the course of the debate, I think of anything which will save money we will see if that will be allowed.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the amendment is out of order because the indemnification of members of the board and the advisory committees is important.  This situation with regard to members of the board has been brought to my attention by people who have already served on various boards.  I pointed out the invidious position they could be in and the possibility that this is being considered in other jurisdictions as well, given the hasty action of the committee on the safety of medicines in Great Britain. The Minister said that if such a claim is made against the board he will look at its financial situation at that time. However, that is not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I am not only concerned about individual patients suing the board but also about companies who may sue it.  I understand from previous court cases that companies have constitutional rights as well.  A pharmaceutical company which believes it has been wronged by the board will also be in a position to sue it.  It is possible that a company which has a major interest in a drug that is widely prescribed on the Irish market could take a case against the board and this could tie up the ratification of a licence for a generic and delay its production.</P>
      <P>There could be problems as regards the board's immunity from prosecution. I realise it is not possible to confer absolute immunity on the board and that only limited immunity can be conferred on it.  Those on the board will be considered to have acted in good faith and the only way they can be considered to have been negligent is if it is wilful negligence or they have acted intentionally in a wrongful manner.  However, I doubt if that will happen.</P>

      <Col N="25" /> Indemnity was provided in the Clinical Trials Bill.  I am worried that the Minister is getting the same advice as was given in 1987 during the debate on the Clinical Trials Bill.  An amendment had to be introduced for immunity in the 1990 Bill.  I would not like to see that happening in this Bill.  This is a serious problem.  I have not been able to provide a solution, apart from asking for indemnity for the board and for those on it and advising it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement that applications for product authorisations should be processed within 210 days instead of 120 days.</P>
      <P>As regards this amendment which was tabled by Senator Henry and myself, we referred to this matter on Second Stage.  This is an area of major concern which could cause problems at a later stage.  Could professional people refuse to make themselves available to the board on a secondment or contract basis to carry out research on behalf of the Irish Medicines Board because indemnity is not provided?  Anyone may follow the board or its members if a drug causes problems.  Under the existing system such matters were referred back to the Minister and the Department of Health, but the new system seems to have great independence.</P>
      <P>What will happen if someone proves that a certain drug has done them damage and compensation has to be paid? Will the members, staff and professionals, like scientists who may carry out certain investigations, involved with the board feel they are in danger of involvement of litigation?  The Minister will have to explain that matter further. These drugs might not only damage a person's health.  This Bill also covers veterinary medicine and livestock could be damaged.  That person could then make a claim against the board or its staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry and I did not put this amendment down just to hold up proceedings.We are taken aback that the provision could be interpreted in this way.  I cannot argue against it because I <Col N="26" /> do not know all the facts.  Sometimes I wonder if it is being used so that none of us can challenge it.  The concern is there and it has been expressed by many people, including Senator Henry and myself.  If what was said on Second Stage in this House and in the Dáil is any evidence to go by, it still remains.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister elaborate on this matter further and see if definite information can be given so that the people concerned will not be involved in litigation as a result of this Bill being passed in its present form?  We would prefer to have proper safeguards in the Bill to ensure that the likelihood of litigation against the staff of the board will not be possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Finneran and Henry.  This matter was raised during the Second Stage debate. It is hardly acceptable that the Minister should give this kind of responsibility to the new board.  Under this legislation, it will become the new licensing authority and that is a huge weight of responsibility to place on any board.</P>
      <P>It appears that the board has been given little protection under this section. Senator Finneran asked a number of questions.  Usually many people hope to be appointed to State and semi-State boards.  However, under the ambiguous content of this section, one will find, as Senator Finneran said &mdash; Senator Henry also said it on Second Stage &mdash; that able, capable and competent people will not seek appointment to this board and may even refuse an appointment if offered it. Being a member of a licensing authority for any drug is an onerous position.  Giving responsibility for veterinary products may be one matter, but to give responsibility for licensing human medication and blood products, which caused great concern recently, to a board without appearing to give it any kind of protection would be its downfall.I cannot see why anybody would seek or accept an appointment to this board unless they were guaranteed some kind of protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> On Second Stage, I asked who would be liable to be prosecuted if a product is found to have been faulty or caused problems.  Would it be the board or the Minister?  I know the Minister is no longer the licensing authority but if the board is responsible, the fears raised by Senators Finneran and Henry about this section may be real.  If the board is the body that will be sued if a product is at fault, I would not want to be part of it unless I knew I would be indemnified, not for taking wrong decisions, but for taking decisions made in good faith and with the knowledge available to the board at the time.  The Minister will have to reassure us that members of the board will be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am no expert in medicine or law but I support the concerns expressed by the previous speakers and hope they can be resolved in as satisfactory a way as possible.</P>
      <P>Members of the board are in the potential firing line if these issues arise. Section 9 (8) states: &ldquo;The Board shall not refuse to grant a licence in respect of a medicinal product on any ground relating to the safety, quality, or efficacy of a medicinal product unless it has requested the advice of the appropriate committee in relation thereto and considered such advice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To my layman's mind, this seems to implicate the members of a committee in whatever decision is made.  Looking at the phraseology of the section, I am requesting clarification of how far members of committees might be implicated in any legal actions that might arise.  I am speaking from a position of ignorance so this is simply a request for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to immunity in the Clinical Trials Act. The firm legal advice given to me is that this immunity extends to the new board in respect of all its functions on foot of section 34 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to the question of providing a statutory <Col N="28" /> indemnification for persons carrying out assessments or other functions for the board.  I have also taken legal advice as to whether this would be an appropriate matter for the Bill.  I should stress that there have not been any practical difficulties in this area over the years.  In any case up to now in the courts it has always been the National Drugs Advisory Board, as a corporate identity, that was cited.  However, I accept that there has been some recent concern about the hypothetical possibility that legal action could be taken against the specific individual.I am advised that this is most unlikely as all actions taken by individuals would be done in the name, and on behalf of, the board as a corporate entity.  But, we must, nonetheless, accept it as a possibility, however slight.</P>
    <P>I am advised that an administrative, rather than a statutory, solution to this possible problem would be more appropriate and I am aware that the National Drugs Advisory Board has been looking at the possible administrative options.  It may emerge, for instance, that an insurance based solution is the best option or the board may agree that it will indemnify advisers in respect of furnishing advice to the board.  If it was necessary for the Minister to make funds available to the board arising out of such indemnities, this can be done under section 15 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am certain the new Irish Medicines Board will continue to examine the issue so that the option which emerges as the most suitable can be implemented if it is found that the question of indemnity is proving a genuine obstacle to the board carrying out its functions, although I again stress that it has not been an obstacle up to now.</P>
    <P>Given that such an administrative solution is feasible, the legal advice available to me is that the inclusion of a general statutory indemnity provision in the Bill is not appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that section 15, which allows for grants to be made to the board, is there.  However, I am not sure if it was ever intended to <Col N="29" /> be used for compensation cases.  Maybe that section is a safety valve.  I mentioned property because this Bill covers veterinary medicine as well.  The Minister did not respond to that point and he might do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure section 15 can be used and maybe an administrative solution to this problem is the better one.  There is the possibility of a bond being given to the board, but one does not know how much to ask for.  The Minister mentioned an insurance based solution, but what insurance company will take on something without knowing the risk involved?  I am not an expert on insurance but normally one has to give some notion of the expected risk on which the insurance company will assess the cost.  The one trouble with having a bond system to indemnify advisers is that it may encourage litigation and suing is much more open now than it was some years ago.  When the Minister says problems have not arisen, it is not strictly true.  There was successful litigation in the case of Scotia Pharmaceuticals, against the board.  Alarm has not been raised in this jurisdiction about the possibility of members of boards being threatened with litigation but there has been anxiety about it in other jurisdictions and we may be sure that what happens in one place will happen in another.  There was a Supreme Court case a few years ago in which the Supreme Court allowed an individual to sue the Department of Post and Telegraphs without having to have the Attorney General's permission.</P>
      <P>Any board nowadays is far more open to litigation.  Can boards such as An Bord Pleanála who make decisions involving a great deal of money be indemnified or can the Minister be sued?  This is an area where we have the problem that individuals or a group can sue if they feel they have been damaged. Later this evening, during Private Members' Business, we will have a debate on this issue and how to resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> As well as that, we have the problem where a company under the Constitution is also in a position to sue.  It is all very well to say this has not happened in the past, but our experience of the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, shows that it had to be amended after three years, because of concerns about immunity.  Members who have served so ably on the National Drugs Advisory Board are concerned about the possibility of litigation on the new board, within the committees of the board and so forth.  An insurance based administrative solution seems vague.  I do not know how one gets an insurance firm to quote on the risk of being sued since none of us is in a position to know what that risk is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Finneran raised a question as to the outcome if property is damaged by a particular medicine and he instanced the case of animals on a veterinary medicine.  If a difficulty arises, the person who suffers the damage has to examine where liability may lie.  It may lie in a number of different agents at different stages in the process between manufacture, the arrival of the product on the farm and it being administered to the animals.  If an individual believes a decision to licence a product has resulted in him suffering serious loss it is open to him to sue.  It is then up to courts to judge whether that person has a basis for seeking compensation.  It may not be only the proposed Irish medicines board that could be joined in such litigation.</P>
      <P>On the various points raised by Senator Henry, it is a commercial decision for an insurance company whether it will insure against a risk or as to what premium it may seek.  This system could be a solution and it would be for the board, if it so decided, to seek to have an insurance based indemnity for advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board has been looking at this problem with a view to coming up with the best possible solution and that examination will continue during the lifetime of the proposed <Col N="31" /> Irish medicines board.  As the Senator conceded, this is not a problem for which there is a ready-made or easy answer.  I assure the Senator that I am concerned about it and, when the new board is being set up, I will make it aware of the concerns expressed in the House during the debate on the Bill and ask it to give special attention to continuing the work being done on this by the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned section 15 as a section which would authorise a Minister to make a payment &ldquo;after consultation with the Board in relation to its proposed work programme and expenditure for that year&rdquo;.  I presume that, strictly speaking, the board will not propose to incur expenditure that would arise from payment for litigation, unless it sets aside a specific amount in anticipation.  I do not want to be difficult, but the word &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; qualifies both &ldquo;work programme&rdquo; and &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo; and I wonder if it is a slightly inelegant way of expressing a contingency which we hope does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that the way the section is phrased refers to the coming year, but when a difficulty like this arises, it does not arise overnight and it is something that would obviously be taken into consideration in the context of ongoing discussions between the Department of Health and the Department of Finance at a particular time.  I take the point but I do not foresee any practical difficulty there.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on a number of areas in section 4.  We must remember why the Bill is before the House and why these matters are being <Col N="32" /> debated &mdash; the inability of the previous board to protect the interest of the individual.Paragraph (1) covers this aspect. It states:</P>
      <P>to establish and administer a service for the inspection of any service for the collection, screening, processing and quality control facilities and procedures in respect of human blood, blood components, blood products and plasma derivatives for the purpose of ensuring the safety and quality of blood, blood components...</P>
      <P>This is the reason behind the Bill.  It would not be before the House if the scandal with regard to hepatitis C and anti-D had not occurred recently.  The legislation came about as a result of the inability of a State agency to carry out its function in a proper way.  The public will be interested to know whether the new board will have better controls and will be in a position to ensure what happened in the past will not recur.  I hope the Minister will cover this point in his reply.</P>
      <P>Clinical trials worry some people. They feel much goes on about which they do not know.  This may be right or wrong but that perception exists.  I understand the Bill refers to the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 and 1990, and safeguards are included in that regard.  However, worry exists about this area.  There are major chemical and legal drugs industries in this country. There is a major problem with regard to illegal drugs but that relates to a different Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chemical industry involves the development of a range of medicines.  I made the point on Second Stage that there is a need for a great level of cooperation between the pharmaceutical companies, the new board and the Department of Health; none can work in isolation.  However, we must remember the pharmaceutical companies exist to make money.  This is their bottom line but the business of the Department of Health and the Government is to ensure that safe medicines are provided to the citizens of the State.  The Bill provides <Col N="33" /> for this responsibility.  All necessary protections with regard to clinical trials should be included.  In his reply, I hope the Minister will state that definite guidelines and protections exist for individuals in this regard.  A death occurred some years ago in a health board area as a result of a clinical trial.</P>
    <P>With regard to the connection between the Irish medicines board and the European structure in terms of the investigation of medicines, will the Minister outline the exact position?  Will the board accept decisions or conclusions already reached by the European structure regarding the investigation of medicines and those considered safe?  Will it be able automatically to take those medicines as sacrosanct, which means it would be unnecessary for it to carry out its own individual investigation, or will the responsibility rest with the board to carry out further investigations and prove to itself that these medicines are safe for the Irish public?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The section covering the functions of the board is most important.  Senator Finneran raised the points I wished to cover regarding the control of clinical trials.  Paragraphs (f) and (i) will be particularly important if the number of drugs, currently only available on prescription, which may be sold over the counter is to increase.  Will the board have to ensure the information given to patients will be readily understood by those who may be buying drugs on an over the counter basis, rather than, as in the past, through their GPs?</P>
      <P>Pharmacists carry out splendid work in educating the public about various drugs sold in pharmacies.  However, many drugs are sold in supermarkets where people receive no advice from pharmacists, as they pointed out in the past.  The board must make clear information available to the public in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> Regarding paragraph (g), on Second Stage I mentioned the difficulty with the reporting of adverse reactions.  However, given the Minister's reply, I obviously did not make myself clear.  In general, pharmaceutical companies are good about reporting adverse reactions but my profession has not been quite as vigilant as it should be in this regard.  I hope the new board will try to set in place the simplest possible system of reporting of reactions and adverse reactions.</P>
    <P>Kings College in London set up a telephone line where reactions were reported on a confidential basis.  There was a greatly increased incidence of reporting of adverse reactions and perhaps this matter could be brought to the Minister's attention.  At present one must fill in cards and submit them. There has been an enormous increase in the amount of administrative work and form filling which doctors must carry out and if the reactions do not appear serious they may be pushed to one side. However, in the overall context of assessing problems with drugs, it is most important to encourage as many people as possible to report.  I hope this matter will be taken into account.  When the Minister replied to the Second Stage debate, he concentrated on the pharmaceutical companies which, in general, are relatively quick to report adverse reactions.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (1) deals with establishing and administering a service for the inspection of any service for the collection, screening, processing and quality control facilities and procedures in respect of human blood, blood components, blood products and plasma derivatives for the purpose of ensuring the safety and quality of blood, blood components, blood products and plasma derivatives and to advise the Minister in relation to such general or particular matters arising out of the administration of such a service as the Minister may refer to the board.  Will this include assessing premises?  There has been some criticism in the recent past about, for example, the storage, not of blood <Col N="35" /> products, but some of the equipment which was to be used for the collection of blood in the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>Will the new board have to advise on premises?  It has been suggested that the premises should be upgraded, particularly the national centre which was not purpose built.  It is an improvement on the two Georgian houses in Leeson Street but it is not a purpose built centre.Does it have to advise on the premises where collection takes place?  Radio broadcasts each morning inform people where the Blood Transfusion Service will operate in their county.  This usually takes place at school halls, community halls, swimming pools, etc.  Is that covered under this part of the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with this Bill because of one of the central recommendations contained in the report of Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien's expert group into the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  On Second Stage, I informed the Minister that simply transferring the licensing function to the new board would not overcome the problems experienced by the previous board.  It is clearly stated in the report of Dr. Hederman O'Brien's group that the former board suffered greatly from an overload of work.  The report also refers to the increased functions undertaken by the board over a period of years.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (3) of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>The Board shall have all such powers as are necessary or expedient for the performance of its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very vague statement in relation to a service which is so critical. I stated on Second Stage that, unless there is a radical overhaul of the way the new board carries out its work, I fear we will be faced with a crisis similar to the one to which Senator Henry referred.  This will be the subject of Fianna Fáil's Private Members' time this evening.  I investigated if another <Col N="36" /> reference was made to this in the Bill and section 20 further confirmed my fears.  As I understand it, assessment by the board of performance of certain of its functions does not refer in any way to the efficiency of the board in relation to its functions.  I believe it refers to the economic and efficient disposal of properties.</P>
    <P>The expert group stated that the functions of the chairman and the board should be clearly defined.  The Bill does not copperfasten the way in which the board will achieve that efficient means of carrying out its business.  Section 4 (3), which I quoted earlier, does not reassure me that the new board will be empowered &mdash; by way of resources, staff or whatever is necessary &mdash; to overcome the problems created by the National Drugs Advisory Board.  These problems occurred as a result of the huge workload and increased functions which were given to the board.  While the Bill is worthwhile, I am concerned that it does not address the points raised by the expert group on to the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be quite parasitic on the points raised by those Members more knowledgeable on this subject. The question of dissemination of information, in relation to section 4 (1), was raised during Senator Henry's contribution.Apparently medical products are more widely available for general sale than through prescription.  I worked in an institute in America some years ago where one of the subjects under research &mdash; which was a long way from my own concerns &mdash; was the labelling of products for sale on the open market. The Americans' concern, which I hope will not be as serious an issue here but must exist to some extent, arose from the extraordinary level of illiteracy among a certain category of mothers who could not understand the medical implications of the products they were buying for their children.  Is the Minister satisfied that the labelling conventions regarding products of this type, which are now widely available, will ensure as <Col N="37" /> far as is humanly possible against misunderstandings on the part of purchasers?</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis raised two questions to which I would like to add small riders.  Section 4 (3) states:</P>
      <P>The Board shall have all such powers as are necessary or expedient for the performance of its functions.</P>
      <P>What is the difference between the terms &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; and &ldquo;expedient&rdquo;? Why is the term &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; included if the terms &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; already covers matters?  I would like an answer on that issue.  Does the term &ldquo;all such powers&rdquo; extend to powers to appoint adequate numbers of staff?  Can the board invoke this to justify the appointment of staff? How will that battle be fought?  What are the ground rules for it in terms of allocation of resources in that direction? I also refer to Senator McGennis's point on section 20, which raises echoes of issues not one million miles from County Cork at present.  What is the analytical distinction between &ldquo;economically&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiently&rdquo; in the minds of those responsible for drafting the Bill?  What criteria may be applied in that context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and accept a number of the anxieties which have been expressed by Members.  I believe the kernel, in relation to the functions of the board, lies in section 4 (1) (l).  We do not have a great record in relation to the collection or screening of blood products.  Problems occurred in relation to infection with hepatitis C from the anti-D product and a debate took place in this House regarding haemophiliacs and factor 8.  Mistakes were made which cost a number of lives in the case of haemophiliacs.The important word in section 4 (1) (l) is &ldquo;inspection&rdquo;.  Can the Minister inform the House as to what type of inspectorate will be set up and its allocation of staff?  The kernel of the board's functions lies with its carrying out inspections to ensure that proper screening and collection of blood products takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="38" />
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to adequate staffing, I stated on Second Stage that consultants are considering the functioning of the National Drugs Advisory Board.  They will offer recommendations with regard to how the structures of the new board can be set up to provide a streamlined operation which takes safety and public health as its absolute responsibilities.  A new chief executive, who will become the chief executive officer of the new board, has been appointed to the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
      <P>With regard to the words &ldquo;economically&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiently&rdquo; to which Senator Lee referred, I would not dare to intrude into the area of legal interpretation of those terms.  However, in general terms, economics relates to the use of resources, financial or identifiable ones.  Efficiency relates more to systems and how things may operate.  I am not able to develop that distinction as well as I would like.  It is an interesting question.</P>
      <P>The issue of adequate numbers of staff will be dealt with, obviously, in the context of the recommendations of the consultants.  In general terms, the Senator mentioned the section in relation to the Minister entering discussions with the board as to its financial needs for the coming year.  The bottom line is that the Government decision is that the board would be self-financing.That is an aspiration and an objective.  At the end of the day, there must be a marrying of the needs of the board in staffing and carrying out its duties.  Obviously, the funding in the initial stages at any rate will come from the Exchequer and the various decisions, regarding fees and so on, will be reflected later in regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be taken on board in this discussion on whether a section is broad or comprehensive enough that quite a few regulations, which will emanate from this legislation, will be as binding as legislation.  It is proper and appropriate when we are down to specifics, as in fees and so on, and I will be dealing with that in more detail when we get to later <Col N="39" /> amendments, that we use the regulations rather than legislation.  The regulations must be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas and can be rejected by them.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee raise a point about labelling and literacy.  I will look at this in the context of the regulations as it is worth exploring to see whether the situation can be improved.  Literacy is something of which I am aware from my professional background as a teacher.  I thank the Senator for raising that issue.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator McGennis's point, I stress that the new board will have a bias towards management rather than the professionals, as was the case in the past.  The professional advice will be available among the staff of the board.  There are advisory committees and a provision for special subcommittees to deal with specific areas later. There is more emphasis on management at board level but I stress that the structures which will be put in place will certainly have public safety and health as a priority.</P>
    <P>The Bill arises from a Government decision taken long before the anti-D problem came to light so it is not a response to that problem.  However, I concede that the anti-D problem reinforced the need to take action.  The Bill is only part of the solution.  A radical overhaul of the system, structure and procedures is taking place.  A management consultancy has just been completed, its recommendations will be implemented and the necessary resources will be made available.  I cannot quantify them now but the professional work is going on in order that they be identified.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran asked about the European agency.  Under the EU licensing regulations, a drug may be assessed and licensed at a central level.  The European Medicines Evaluation Agency will be responsible for this and the assessment work will be done for it on a contract basis by national agencies, such as the Irish Medicines Board.  This is something which we dealt with at <Col N="40" /> some length on Second Stage.  The charges which could arise from contract work on behalf of the European agency could be important income for the new board in the context of being self-financing.If a drug gets a European licence, it will automatically be licensed for Ireland.  The Irish Medicines Board will then be involved in monitoring the various conditions attached to the licence.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of information for patients on products sold in supermarkets.  The Medical Preparations (Labelling and Product Information) Regulations, 1993, set out in great detail the information to be included in information leaflets for parents.These reflect requirements laid down by the EU.  I refer, again, to Senator Lee's point regarding literacy. That is one which I want to examine to see whether there is some method by which we can bring about improvements there.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran specifically raised the clinical trials role of the new board. The clinical trials Acts provide for the participation of volunteers, the requirement of informed consent and approval of trials by ethics committees.  This strikes a balance to facilitate clinical research whilst ensuring protection for individuals.  The death to which the Senator referred pre-dated the legislation but the protection of human life and health at all levels must be paramount and I share his concern here.  I assure him that the protection provided by the clinical trials Acts will form a part of the new board's work.  I am fully committed to pursuing the highest standards.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the matter of the inspection of premises.  That will be included.  She also made an interesting point about a confidential line on adverse reactions.  The necessity a confidential line requires further examination.There may be a method whereby we can improve the reporting of adverse reactions.  The Senator specifically made the point that where adverse reactions are not startling, it may be they are not <Col N="41" /> reported.  Because of its importance I propose to specifically refer that point to the new board when it is set up.  The Senator said there had been a great increase in the reporting of adverse reactions because of the confidential line involved.  Senator Henry made the distinction between the good record of the pharmaceutical companies and her concerns that adverse reactions were not always reported at practitioner level.  I undertake to refer that matter to the new board when it is set up.</P>

    <P>To return to the Bill, if the board has to supervise the premises of the Blood Transfusion Service Board as well as the collection of blood it is a very onerous <Col N="42" /> task.  They will be well aware of how serious that will be for them.  If it would be of help, I will look up the information I have regarding the confidential line and will bring it to the Minister's attention.  The fact that a phone provided immediate communication to deal with the problem was good and increased the reporting of reactions. While one deals with serious reactions, the summation of less serious reactions might show a pattern which it is essential the board should be aware of.  What the Minister has said will be very useful.</P>

I presume this is as a result of some EU directives, and perhaps the Minister could elaborate on that.  The over use of antibiotics in livestock is an area of concern to the public.  It has been debated by local authorities and health boards as well as on the floor of the House.  People fear their health can be put at risk because of the over use <Col N="43" /> of antibiotics in the treatment of animal disease, particularly milk problems in dairy cattle.  The use of angel dust is also a matter of concern.

      <P>As regards the issue raised by Senator Finneran, the Animal Remedies Act, 1993, is the relevant legislation dealing with prohibited substances.Heretofore the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, through the resources available to him or her, made recommendations to the National Drugs Advisory Board in relation to particular pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of animals.  The National Drugs Advisory Board has been the licensing authority for veterinary pharmaceuticals but that situation is about to change.  The section enables the Minister, at any time in the future, to confer additional functions on the board should the need arise.  For example, developments associated with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products may involve additional responsibilities for the board.  It is in that context that this section was conceived.  However, I assure Senators that the primary function of the board is to ensure product safety and public health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall appoint a member of the board to be chairperson of the board.</P>
      <P>I question whether the Minister should appoint the board and I will speak about that in the next section.  I do not see why the Minister should appoint a member of the board to be the chairperson.Why not leave it to the board to elect its own chairperson?  If the Minister has the authority to appoint the board, does he not believe the board has the ability to elect its own chairperson? Not only does he appoint the entire board but also the chairperson, thus denying the right of board members to elect their own chairperson.  That is taking the matter too far.</P>

      <P>This is a standard provision enabling the Minister to appoint the chairperson of the board.  It will be noted that section 6 (5) states:</P>
      <P>The chairperson of the board shall be paid such remuneration (if any) and such allowances for expenses as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may from time to time determine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for the standard practice which the Minister spoke about in relation to the selection of the chairperson of the board and given current thinking and, to some extent, Government statements, is the Minister not open to making political appointments? <Col N="45" /> Section 6 states that the Minister shall appoint the chairman of the board, while this section states that he shall appoint all the members to the board. This is a closed shop which will involve political patronage.  The Minister will appoint nominees who, if we go by past experiences, have a political allegiance to his party or to a Government party. That is something which certain members of the Government have spoken out against recently.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister reconcile recent statements by the Government on appointments to boards with the provision in section 7 which states: &ldquo;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the establishment day, appoint persons to be members of the board.&rdquo;?  If we do not want political involvement, then the Minister should not appoint members to the board, otherwise he is leaving himself open to the charge that he is appointing people of a political persuasion.That may not be so in all cases but that charge could be made.  Surely in a case like the Irish Medicines Board the Minister should keep out of it and leave it to the professions and the interests involved.</P>
      <P>The board will be independent and should comprise the medical and veterinary professions and interests, including the pharmaceutical industry and chemists, who are involved in the industrial, commercial and professional side of human and veterinary medicine.  The Minister is leaving himself open to the charge that his appointments are political.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume these provisions are not unprecedented in terms of appointments to boards.  In an ideal world I would agree with Senator Finneran, but I suspect we will be waiting some time before we achieve that.  I have specific observation in relation to section 7 (6) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Board may at any time be removed from membership of the Board by the Minister if, in the Minister's opinion, the member has <Col N="46" /> become incapable through ill-health of performing his or her functions, or has committed stated misbehaviour, or his or her removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Board of its functions.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister's opinion on ill-health would need to be backed by professional advice and that stated misbehaviour would extend beyond the Minister's perception of what that constitutes because there could be elasticity of perception on these matters. The final provision which states, &ldquo;His or her removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Board of its functions&rdquo;, seems to introduce a potentially arbitrary element not subject to the controls the phraseology of the two previous justifications requires.</P>
    <P>I would like it to state that it appears to the board to be necessary rather than it appears to the Minister.  If the board is to be independent &mdash; section 3 (3) states that it is to be independent &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo;&mdash; and if any member can be removed at any time by the Minister, including presumably the chairperson, simply for this particular reason, then the Minister is retaining excessive authority in that area.  I would prefer the question of the possible removal of a member of the board left to the board itself which after all would see the performance of a colleague in board circumstances.  I find that provision difficult to justify even accepting the limits imposed on us by the inherited conventions of our political culture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee made a good point because the Minister could remove the entire board if it did not do what he wanted by saying members were ill or behaving badly.

      <P>We should not judge the board before it is appointed but when we see its personnel.  This will be a smaller board than the National Drugs Advisory Board which will consist of nine people.  I am not convinced &mdash; I stated this in relation to other legislation in the last Administration &mdash; that if we decide to make nominations from particular constituent bodies we get the best people.  The Minister of the day should have the method available to him or her to appoint the best people available.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of this board to many aspects of our health services and to the health and safety of the public, I find it difficult to conceive that a Minister from any party would appoint people to the board who would not be capable of carrying out their functions. As time goes by I become less convinced that the nominations option would yield the best people.  The bias in this board is in the area of management and streamlining activities in terms of processing and granting licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will always be exposure to charges of political patronage &mdash; that goes with the territory.  Irrespective of what Government is in power that type of allegation can be made.  We should wait until the board is appointed to see if it carries out the duties and functions laid out in the Bill.  The provision which enables the Minister to remove a board member because they do not perform their functions is an arbitrary power in terms of how Senator Lee presented it. However, in such a board it is difficult to conceive that a Minister would use that power in a frivolous way.  It can happen with boards, committees and even political parties that certain individuals <Col N="48" /> need to be disciplined and to be removed.</P>
    <P>The person with primary responsibility in the State for the health services should also have the powers to exercise judgement in dealing with situations which can arise where important State boards may have a member or members who are not contributing and preventing the proper functions being carried out. I am not sure that a member's peers deciding that he or she should be removed from the board is a good idea because, by its nature, that would be divisive and could cause tensions which would prevent the board from getting on with the job.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage that the powers would ever be used in a frivolous way but it is necessary to have that protection for the stated reasons of misbehaviour, health or generally not contributing and becoming a negative element of a very important board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">

      <P>Lapses into clarity are forgiven.  The Minister has total power of appointment so if the same Minister chooses to remove somebody on very general grounds then, in a sense, he or she is passing a vote of no confidence in their original decision.  If there is a change of Government and the new Minister wants to put somebody else on the board, the permission which this clause allows seems too general.  While I obviously take the point about ill health and misbehaviour, on balance and allowing for the valid points of judgement made by the Minister, it would have been preferable to have the board rather than the Minister as the arbiter of the quality of performance of its colleagues in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>I do not want to continue with this because, to some extent, the Minister is correct when he says that it depends on which side of the House one is on as a Bill goes through. However, the Minister does seem to have more power under this section than he should have.  He said that Ministers do not remove board members but I disagree as members have recently been removed and replaced by a particular Minister which has been a matter of grave public concern.  Some of those removals and replacements were carried out in a fairly arbitrary fashion, depending on which side of the boundary one was on.</P>
      <P>Section 7 states that the Minister can remove a member who has become incapable through illness or whose removal &ldquo;appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the board of its functions&rdquo;.  I do not know what he means by that.  Illness would obviously require a medical opinion.  However, the Minister could say that he was removing a member or a board because they were a sick, political lot.  He does not have to give any reason apart from the belief that they are not carrying out their work in the interest of the performance of the board's functions.</P>

      <P>In page 8, after line 44, to add the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(12) The Board shall ensure that all applications are processed as speedily as possible and shall put <Col N="50" /> in place an independent appeals procedure where applicants can raise matters relating to delays and any refusals of applications.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 essentially seek to put in place an appeals procedure against decisions of the board.  I draw attention to the fact that, under the provisions of the Bill, the board cannot refuse any licence unless it has first sought and considered the advice of an appropriate advisory committee, so that the board cannot act unilaterally in refusing to grant a licence.  In any event, there is at present a case before the High Court seeking a judicial review regarding a decision to refuse to grant a product authorisation. Among the issues raised in the case before the court was the lack of an appeals mechanism under existing regulations. The judgement of the court is still awaited but is likely to be given during the present term.</P>
      <P>Obviously, there is considerable merit in the proposal to seek to provide an appeals procedure.  However, I do not believe it is either appropriate or necessary to provide for such a procedure in the Bill.  On the contrary, it would be more appropriate for the question of an appeals procedure to be dealt with in the context of the Medicinal Preparations (Licensing, Advertising and Sales) Regulations, 1984, which set out in detail the requirements and procedures for licensing medicines.  The regulations will require amending to enable the board to assume the role of licensing authority and the question of providing an appeals procedure will be examined in the context of the amending regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, regard will be given to the outcome of the case at present before the High Court and any particular issues which the court may identify as requiring attention.  I agree that the board should take all possible steps to ensure that applications are processed as speedily as possible but I do not believe that it is necessary to make specific provision in the Bill relating to this. <Col N="51" /> The board will be required by section 20 to carry out an annual examination to ensure it is operating efficiently and economically.  At the same time, it will also be required to seek to comply with the requirements of EC Directive 65/65 which stipulates that applications should be processed within 210 days.</P>
    <P>The requirements, of course, operate on a &ldquo;stop the clock&rdquo; basis.  In this context, it is important to note that quite often in the past there were delays where incomplete applications were submitted or where companies took a considerable length of time to deal with the issues raised by the board or its assessors.  While I agree that the board should seek to deal with applications as speedily as possible it cannot sacrifice questions of safety or public health considerations which, as I am sure Senators will agree, must at all times be the primary consideration.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not accept the need for the amendment as proposed, but agree to look at the question of an appeals procedure when amending the regulations.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 4, section 13 is an enabling section whereby the Minister may make regulations for the payment of fees in respect of matters arising out of licensing medicines.  It is not appropriate that the section would set out the specific details proposed in the amendment. That is more appropriate to the regulations which will set out the fees and the circumstances in which they will be payable.  As Senators are aware, the Minister will be required to lay the regulations before the Houses for approval.  At the same time I recognise that the specific proposal in the amendment merits serious and constructive consideration and shall be examined in the drawing up of the regulations.</P>

      <P>It is important that we have a proper appeals system.  The current case would not be before the High Court if there was an appeals system. This matter was discussed in the Dáil and the Minister gave certain commitments regarding regulations.  I said to the Minister on Second Stage that, unless I saw those regulations, I would put down certain amendments.  There is a great worry about both refusals and delays.  It is not sufficient to refer the matter back to an advisory committee or deal with it through regulations.</P>
      <P>The law should make exact provision for these situations.  It should provide a procedure to deal with delays and another to deal with refusals.  They are both serious matters and should be dealt with in this legislation.  It is the responsibility of Government to bring forward legislation to deal with those situations. It has been brought to my attention that delay can be a serious matter.</P>
      <P>I do not question the bona fides of this Minister but Ministers come and go. We cannot decide the exact contents of the regulations but are dependent on the bona fides of a Minister.  I question whether it is appropriate for this Bill to go through this House without provision for proper procedures in a number of areas.  These include an independent procedure whereby delays and refusals of applications can be raised as well as a definite appeals procedure as regards appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other relevant matter is fees.  I appreciate the Minister's view that it is an enabling section; he said it would be inappropriate to include detail in an enabling section.  How will this board be financed other than by fees?  Section 15 provides that the Minister may give a grant but, apart from that, this board's activities will be financed by fees.  The Minister said there may be an opportunity <Col N="53" /> to deal with this in the event of litigation.  Senator Henry and I attempted to move an amendment which was ruled out of order and the Minister said the matter could be dealt with under section 15.</P>
    <P>The board's only income will be from fees.  It will, therefore, raise its own income.  If the board becomes strapped for cash, the easy option will be to raise the fees.  Some pharmaceutical companies can absorb those fees but small companies cannot.  Will they fall by the wayside?I proposed these amendments with a view to protecting those companies.They are practical amendments which should be part of the Bill.  We have a responsibility to pass legislation which addresses all issues and regulations are not suitable on this occasion, particularly in light of what is happening in the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Finneran raised pertinent points which deserve a reasoned refutation, if they can be refuted.  We did not address adequately the issue of the powers of the board in terms of staff appointments, the size of staff and so on.  This would be partly dependent on its income which must come in large measure from fees.  The board has a powerful incentive in certain respects to charge whatever the traffic will bear in terms of fees and that could lead to the undesirable situation sketched by Senator Finneran.  The relationship between fees and board activity should be teased out further.</P>
      <P>The principle of appeal against any State or public board decision should be part of legislation anyway.  Does the Ombudsman have any role to play in situations like this?  Can one appeal to the Ombudsman on issues relating to delays and refusals of applications?  Are there existing powers which allow appeals to be made?  If not, there is a strong reason for looking carefully at these amendments.</P>

      <P>Senator Finneran and Senator Lee made good points regarding delays and fees.  I mentioned <Col N="54" /> another difficulty on Second Stage.  One may have a drug which is useful only to a small number of patients.  Where there is a standard fee, there is little reason a major pharmaceutical firm should bother to get a licence for the drug in a country with such a small population.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the amount of information sent in by companies often is not adequate to enable the board to proceed with the authorisation of a product.However, there seems to be an internal as well as external delay factor affecting the current board.  This is not just hard on the pharmaceutical company; it is also extraordinarily hard on patients if it involves a particularly useful drug.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important area.  In response to Senator Finneran, regulations are law and emanate from the enabling sections of legislation.  Any regulations brought in under this legislation and not annulled by the Oireachtas are law.  There has only been one refusal in the history of the National Drugs Advisory Board and that is the case currently before the High Court.  The path towards which companies are more usually inclined is to withdraw an application where it seems it could be refused because no company wants a refusal.</P>

It is also inappropriate to have the detail of an appeals procedure contained in the legislation, but the commitment given by me here will be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to two aspects of the fees, the first, which I addressed on Second Stage, was in respect of a product that would not have a great demand in terms of its usage.  There is <Col N="55" /> a system at present in place where the licensing fee with the NDAB is one-twentieth of the general fee; I have no doubt this will continue in the context of the new board.  I would, therefore, ask Senators to take on board that, in the first instance, the regulations will be brought before the Oireachtas, and the Seanad and the Dáil will have the right to reject those regulations if they are seen to be inappropriate or do not cover the given situation.</P>

    <Title>Death of Deputy Brian Lenihan:    Expression of Sympathy.</Title>

      <P>It is with deep regret that I learned of the passing of Deputy Brian Lenihan today.  A native of Athlone, I have known Brian all my life.  He was a committed politician. During his political career, Brian served with distinction in the office of Tánaiste, as a member of several Governments, as Parliamentary Secretary, Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and as a Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  His ability and versatility are evident by his expertise in the number of portfolios he held.</P>
      <P>Brian started his career in the Oireachtas when he was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1957 on the Industrial and Commercial Panel.  In October 1961 he was elected to the Dáil for Roscommon, which he since served in the Dáil with the exception of his return to the Seanad in the period 1973-77.  Brian was a popular politician, noted for his sense of humour, affability and admirable personality.  He has friends in all parties, on both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all admired his courage in dealing with ill health over the past few years and deeply regret that he lost that battle <Col N="56" /> today.  To his wife Ann and family, his sister, Mary, and brother, Paddy, with whom I served for a long number of years on Roscommon County Council, we extend our deepest sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a day of genuine and universal sadness in these Houses and in our country.  No one was better loved, or better deserved to be loved, than our friend and colleague, Brian Lenihan.  He had friends and admirers in all parties at all times.</P>
      <P>The first phrase that comes to mind when one thinks of Brian Lenihan is loveable.  He was warm, gregarious and fun loving.  He had an infinite capacity for living and for life.  Friendship came naturally to him.  It was friendship that transcended party boundaries, nationality and age.</P>
      <P>However, behind the warmth and the fun there was a fine mind and a very fine brain.  He was very well and widely read and was a sharp observer, especially of the foibles of his fellow men and fellow politicians.  He also had a deep sense of history and a great and genuine love of his country.</P>
      <P>He was an extraordinarily able politician.When he applied himself, his grasp of detail was huge, his intellect sharp and he could bring to the most mundane of debates rare insights and very sharp observations.  He was a person who thought a great deal and reflected on the big issues and on history.These reflections would be given to us, whether in debates or while enjoying one of the chats he had with virtually everybody in the House.  He was an original thinker and he could bring that originality to bear on the big issues of our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as a companion and friend that many people here will best remember him.  To sit with him, listen to him and chat with him was an education.  New Members who came into this House very quickly came under his influence and would very quickly be beguiled and entranced by him as a companion. Although he was never pompous and never took himself too seriously, he had <Col N="57" /> the capacity to say very serious things on a very wide range of issues.</P>
    <P>To travel with Brian Lenihan was, in the first instance, to enjoy the experience, but also to see the breadth of his learning.  He was a true European.  He had a great sense of Europe and a great sense of the adventure and the excitement of bringing the country into Europe and deepening our relationship with Europe.  However, as he showed in his later years as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, his grasp was not just European; he had a global grasp of the big events.</P>
    <P>To all of us, Brian Lenihan always seemed young, yet it is extraordinary to think today that he was one of the last links in these Houses with that great earlier generation.  When he was first elected to the Seanad, Éamon de Valera was Taoiseach.  He served under Seán Lemass and with people like Frank Aiken, Seán McEntee and others.  For somebody interested in history, it was always an education to listen to Brian's stories, the observations, the anecdotes and the insights he had of that generation, a generation which certainly influenced him, and many of whose values he retained and exemplified to the day of his death.</P>
    <P>Brian was, of course, a Fianna Fáil man first, middle and last.  To my colleagues and my friends in Fianna Fáil, you have lost a great servant, a great patriot, one of your finest ever.  Your loss is truly great.  These Houses have also lost a great parliamentarian.  In my early days in the other House, it was always a joy to watch his parliamentary jousts with John Kelly, two of the great parliamentarians, two men of sharp intellect, of great humour and erudition, both of whom enjoyed the jousts and the with across the floor.  It is something I have not experienced in these Houses since.  Brian was a great parliamentarian who loved Parliament.  He respected the Houses of Parliament.  It was bred in him; it was in every pore of his body.</P>
    <P>Most of all, Brian Lenihan was a family man.  He had a fine family, whom he loved dearly, as they loved him.  He was <Col N="58" /> a genuinely good man, a decent man.  To his family, especially, we send our deepest sympathy today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I never thought I would be standing in the Seanad today or any other day paying tribute to my late friend, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  We always thought of Brian as being indestructible, a giant of a man in every way who would always be part of the Irish political scene.  He is a man who served his country and the Fianna Fáil Party unselfishly for a lifetime.  He served in every capacity in both the Dáil and the Seanad and in almost every Ministry.  It is important to record what the late Brian Lenihan achieved in politics.  He was first elected to the Seanad in 1957 and to the Dáil in 1961.  He was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs up to today.  He was previously Tánaiste, three times Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Forestry and Fisheries, Minister for Education, Minister for Justice, Minister for Defence and Minister for Transport and Power. What a record.</P>
      <P>Many pieces of Brian's legislation, which he initiated and steered through both Houses, will bear testament to his life long commitment to serving the people.  For example, in legislation which has a bearing on the many debates that take place today on the rights of women, he steered the Succession Act, 1965, through the Oireachtas.  It gave women the first guarantee of the rights to share in their husband's estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a gentle giant in every sense of the word, a unique politician without an enemy on either side of the House as the Leader has so kindly said.  In every part of Ireland and at every crossroads one visited the first politician's name to be mentioned was Brian Lenihan and the only thing one heard was love for that politician.  That is unique for many of us in politics today.  As a result of his commitment to peace, both on this island and internationally, he was <Col N="59" /> known on the international political stage.</P>
    <P>I knew Brian Lenihan as a friend for ten years.  He was the first person I and many others in this Chamber would approach when in trouble.  One would know that advice would be given as a friend and that one could always count on that fact.  Brian Lenihan, the great politician, scholar, sporting figure, man of courage and friend to all of us, will be greatly missed.  The Leader has rightly mentioned that he was a great Fianna Fáil member.  However, he was more than that.  He just loved the Oireachtas and all it stood for.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, I offer my sincere sympathy to his wife, Ann, his sons and daughters, our colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, his brother, Paddy, and all other members of his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sad day.  A man who cast a friendly shadow on both Houses for a long time and who was a friend to everybody has died.  The real virtue of Brian Lenihan is that he never became the cute hoor politician to which many others were attracted.  He was always open, direct and honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will always recall how he handled difficult areas in foreign affairs.  Having been an activist in many areas before being elected to this House, I saw the areas in which he was very supportive. On Central American issues he took a progressive stance on behalf of the State.  In dealing with groups, such as the PLO and other representatives of the Palestinian cause, he took a progressive and courageous attitude in the European context.  I always felt that he was under-estimated by the general public.  Being universally liked he was also, in a sense, dismissed and under-estimated.I was delighted to hear the Leader of the House say that he was an intellectual, a man of great intellectual ability.  That was evident to anybody who raised with him the latest publication on matters historical, political or in literature.  He had a wide interest in <Col N="60" /> sport.  The fact that he was a great reader and kept up to date with new ideas is a side of him that is not well known.  He always retained that freshness.</P>
    <P>We all owe a certain debt to him for his responsible approach to public life. He stood for public life and gave of himself as a public representative.  He defended the importance of public representation at every opportunity.  That is a legacy we would do well to follow.  I appreciate how he was able to say proudly: I am a politician, I am a public representative and I respect my colleagues of whatever party in both Houses.  It is fair and right of the Leader to say that his death is a loss to his party.  In offering condolences to his wife, sister and his brother, whom I do not know, it is also important to say to his friends on both sides of both Houses that this is a sad day.</P>
    <P>He would have appreciated the irony with which we heard the news of his death this afternoon.  We were meeting the Iranian delegation and he had quite strong views on that country.  As the Iranian delegate was telling us that there were no gay bars in Teheran he also said that he had just heard that our former Foreign Minister had passed away.  The coincidence of both remarks was quite ironic and wry.</P>
    <P>On a personal note, I feel a degree of sadness.  He was approachable and upheld that great tradition of members of the Bar of being always available to young hedgers such as myself when we entered the House.  Speaking on behalf of the Independent Members we offer our condolences to his family and his party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I join other Members in conveying our sympathy to the family of the late Brian Lenihan and to his party, Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has rightly been said that Brian Lenihan was one of the most loved politicians in this country.  He will be sadly missed not just by those who knew him but also by people throughout Ireland. If one were to ask people to list the politician <Col N="61" /> ticians they respected and loved, Brian Lenihan would certainly be in the top ten of most lists, and deservedly so.  As Senator Wright said, his service was extraordinary in terms of the offices he held.  He was Tánaiste, a Minister in seven or eight Departments and a Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas. He was a Member of this House from 1957 to 1961 and was the Fianna Fáil Leader in the House from 1973 to 1977. He will be remembered in many areas of Irish society.</P>
    <P>It is also right to pay tribute to his role as a debater and as somebody who took an interest in the current issue of the day.  He had wide knowledge on a great number of issues.  In the last few months we saw him contributing to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation when he was quite ill.  He still attended the forum on a regular basis and played his part in a thoughtful and knowledgeable way.  He played his part in the important issues of the day in this country from the time of de Valera right up to the present.  His role in foreign affairs was strong and touched on many parts of the world.  He represented this country in a very important way.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party, I convey our sympathy to the family of the late Brian Lenihan, to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and to all who knew and loved him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be hard to imagine Irish politics without Brian Lenihan at its centre.  I share the great sadness of the Members of this House and of the Dáil in recording his passing.</P>
      <P>As has been outlined by Senator Wright, he gave a lifetime of distinguished public service.  If any of us could leave this place with even a fraction of the service he gave we would have acquitted ourselves with distinction.He was a distinguished parliamentarian in every sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that he could show such energy and enthusiasm in that face of such huge physical and health difficulties.It was a measure of the man &mdash; I certainly never heard him complain &mdash;<Col N="62" /> that he could have such enthusiasm in the throes of a life threatening disease and that he carried himself so well.  He did not have a vindictive bone in his body.  I can say that with certitude because he took some very heavy political blows, particularly when he contested the Presidency.  He carried on professionally, was always pleasant and good company and I never heard a vindictive word from him.  That was another measure of the person with whom we were dealing.</P>
    <P>There is no question that he was an authority on foreign affairs.  His counsel had to be listened to and should be listened to by every member of every party.  He was a totally professional politician in the best sense of being professional.That refers back to my point about his not being vindictive &mdash; he took the heavy blows and carried on.  He was a pleasant and good companion.  He was also a true parliamentarian in the best sense of that word.  He had an endearing, roguish quality; that is probably what made so many people love him.  Many people in both Houses and throughout the country loved Brian Lenihan for his cheerfulness and how he conducted himself.  He was a model of what a good public representative should be.  He was also a model of how to face illness and disease with courage and equanimity.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I want to be associated with this vote of sympathy. On my behalf and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats I extend to his wife, Ann, to his sister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, to all the members of his family and to his Fianna Fáil colleagues our deepest sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The man we are honouring would express himself now by saying &ldquo;Enough of that, now.  Next business&rdquo;, because he, of all men, would not have expected or wished to have special tribute be paid to him.  I have already had the opportunity at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to pay tribute to Brian, a former Chairman. Much of his life was devoted to the service <Col N="63" /> of Ireland abroad and to the service of other nations in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Nothing anyone could say would be an adequate expression of what we all feel.  Tributes are being paid across the nation by people in their homes, people who knew and loved him and by people who never knew him but to whom Brian Lenihan meant something very special. He was a unique character in Irish life and politics.  As I said in the other House his was a life spent in the service of Ireland.</P>
      <P>He loved this House.  It was a measure of his self-effacing modesty that, having been in the service of his nation in Government for many years and having been unexpectedly defeated Brian came back to this House where he started in 1957 with the same enthusiasm, commitment and respect he showed in the other House and in Government.  I recall how much this House meant to him.  It was he who steered me into this House when I first became a candidate in 1965 and could not have been successful without his goodwill and support.</P>
      <P>He and I together went out to Paris in 1973 to negotiate the formation of what is now the European Progressive Democrats.  We were in discussions there when the message came that the Seanad would meet.  He came back from those discussions to this House for a vote which he knew would not be successful to support Senator Kit Ahern for the position of Cathaoirleach.  He knew it was a lost cause, but he came back and returned immediately afterwards to continue discussions in Paris.  Such was the measure of a man for whom service to this nation at every stage of his life was mingled only with the love he had for his wife, Ann, and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His family made many sacrifices because of his love and commitment to this nation but they always supported his commitment without question.  That he could have provided much better financially for the family than he did because of public service, makes him an <Col N="64" /> example to all of us and to those who would be cynical about public life.  Brian had before him a very distinguished career at the Bar which would have rendered him a much better financial return than did service in public life, but that was not his option.  He illustrated to all of us in public life that in the role of public service, other issues, particularly the financial rewards, do not cast a shadow across the path.  May his service be an answer to some and a challenge to the rest of us who can take an example from it.  It is an answer to those cynics who would say that men and women in public life are more concerned about the benefits they get than the benefits they can confer on others. That was not Brian Lenihan's approach to public service.</P>
    <P>He had a great love for the people, from Donegal to Wexford, from Antrim to Kerry and was known by everyone but he did not have a narrow view on life, or of Ireland's role in the community of nations.  He was equally at home in the European movement in which he and I were fellow members in the 1970s and in the Council of Europe and the European Community at all levels.I was privileged to succeed him in many ministries and always to have his support, advice and friendship, above all else.</P>
    <P>Brian Lenihan devoted 40 years of his life to public service.  It might have been longer, because even when it was clear &mdash; maybe the rest of us were guilty in a sense for not making him aware of the fact &mdash; that he could not stay in public service to the extent that he wished to in 1989, he had to be almost forced away from the Government of his nation to look after his health.  We may have persuaded him too late but in the life that he devoted to us there was no trace or malice or animosity and he respected each and every individual from the youngest to the oldest, from the loftiest to the lowliest.  Brian Lenihan has given some example.  The best I can do now is to say &ldquo;Enough of that.  Next business&rdquo;. He wants us to carry on the work in <Col N="65" /> every single aspect of our lives in the service of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in paying tribute to our late colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  He was the second longest serving member of the Oireachtas, with service spanning almost four decades.  He was a great servant to the country and rendered distinguished service in many roles, in various ministries, as a Deputy and as a Senator.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has lost a great servant.  Ireland has lost a great servant. Brian was a friend to us all.  He loved the cut and thrust of politics, he loved the various elections, the by-elections and he gave tremendous service and dedication to everything he attended to. To his wife, Ann, and family, to our colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke and to his brother, Paddy Lenihan, I extend my sympathy and the sympathy of both Houses today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In joining with the other members in expressing our deepest sympathy to the family, Deputy Mary O'Rourke and to Paddy Lenihan, we should reflect on why Brian Lenihan was so loved.  He grew in stature despite his many problems associated with his political life.  He was elected, was defeated, and fought again and his stature increased.  He knew what defeat was and fought against what would have seemed the end to many another politician.</P>
      <P>When he got sick, he did not lie down under it.  He had major surgery and it was a miracle he survived it at his age. He taught us how to live through difficulties.This is the greatest element of his character which we should remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he grew in stature, so also the stature of Ireland grew.  As a small country Ireland would not be as well known and as respected on the international stage were it not for the broadness of the vision Brian Lenihan brought to it.  I had the privilege to travel abroad with him <Col N="66" /> on occasions.  There is no doubt that among European politicians he was a giant.  When we look at the leaders in European politics at present we would have to suggest that if Brian Lenihan had been given the opportunity, the Europe we know would be a better one and his broadness of vision would have helped to resolve many of the problems besetting us.</P>
    <P>Brian was not just a politician.  He was a great family man.  He was probably the best raconteur in the country and the best person to remember anecdotes.  His sporting life should not be forgotten.  He was a giant on the sports field and as an administrator with the Football Association of Ireland.  He served as president of that association with great aplomb. He was truly and deservedly liked.</P>
    <P>He had vicissitudes and problems in business and politics but he overcame them.  As Senator O'Kennedy said, if he had what might be called the good sense to stay out of politics he would have been much better off financially and able to devote more of his strength to his family.  He was a giant and we will miss him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan spoke on behalf of the Labour Party and I concur with what she said.  I knew Brian Lenihan when I served under Mr. Brendan Corish.  I was introduced to Brian by the late Mr. Seán Casey during a by-election many years ago.  He was in every respect a smashing fellow and most approachable.  To me at the time he was very important and I was impressed by the fact that not only did he talk to me but took a great deal of time to do so.  He was the most receptive man one could meet.  He was extremely clever and thoughtful and was an expert in many fields.  As Senator Dardis said, he was completely devoid of any sort of malice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the early days of television I used to watch him bat for Fianna Fáil and he was the best batsman I ever saw. He may have been one of the main reasons overall majorities for Fianna Fáil were the order of the day because <Col N="67" /> he could almost convince people of the justice and rightness of his case.</P>
    <P>He will be sadly missed.  I am glad he came into politics.  We can seldom use words like &ldquo;love&rdquo; in relation to politicians.However, the word can be used with justification about two politicians, the late and much loved Seán Fallon and Brian Lenihan.</P>
    <P>Memory of Brian's courage will remain with me for many years.  When he came back from America and resumed his duties he never once complained, even when we knew by looking at him that it was not a good day for him.  Never once did he bewail his fate. I salute him as do all the members of the Labour Party and we extend our condolences to Brian's family, to Deputy O'Rourke and her family and our colleagues in Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I concur with the tributes paid to the late Deputy Brian Lenihan by previous speakers.  I also join in the expression of sympathy to his wife and family, to our colleague in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, Deputy O'Rourke and to my former colleague on Roscommon County Council, Brian's brother, Paddy.</P>
      <P>Brian started his political career as a member of Roscommon County Council.In 1957 he was elected to Seanad Éireann and in the following general election he was returned to Dáil Éireann as Deputy for Roscommon.  He served as a Deputy for that constituency until 1973.  In the general election of that year he lost his seat because of his willingness to put his own seat at risk in order to ensure the election of a colleague.It was because of his unselfishness that he failed to be returned to Dáil Éireann.  In the subsequent Seanad election he was again elected to this House and served as its Leader for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brian Lenihan will be remembered as one of the most popular and outstanding Irish politicians of the second half of the twentieth century.  During a long and distinguished political career he <Col N="68" /> held several ministerial offices.  He also served with distinction as Tánaiste for a number of years.  In later years his battle against indifferent health was a measure of his courage and determination.  It was always a pleasure to meet him.  As a colleague he was always courteous and pleasant.  As a Minister he was always approachable and anxious to be helpful. He will be greatly missed across the whole spectrum of Irish life.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>I am honoured to have the opportunity to pay tribute to the late Brian Lenihan.  When I became a Member of Dáil Éireann in 1982 he gave me a wonderfully warm reception.  Like the Leader I enjoyed the wonderful banter between Brian Lenihan and the late Deputy John Kelly.  I often thought John was a little personal at times towards Brian but Brian always accepted this with a great sense of humour.</P>
      <P>I have a wonderful memory of him which at least two or three Members will share.  After the 1989 general election the Dáil assembled to elect a Taoiseach.The Dáil was packed and there was great excitement.  Brian had his operation during the election.  When he appeared on the steps of the Chamber there was a spontaneous reaction from Members.  They all rose and applauded him.  He received the warmest reception I have ever seen given to a Member of the Dáil.  Politicians loved Brian and he loved politics.  I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife, family, sister and Fianna Fáil colleagues who have lost a loyal friend.</P>

      <P>I am devastated.  Brian was as close to me for the last 30 years as anybody could be, even my brother. We all knew how ill he was but we thought he would recover.  I do not think anybody suffered as much as he during the last six years.  I always felt that somebody over and above his doctors was looking after him.  It came as a terrible shock to hear this evening of his death.  I spoke to his wife Ann <Col N="69" /> recently and she told me there had been some improvement in his health.  I said I was not surprised because he had gone through so much and that with luck he might pull through.  Unfortunately, he did not.</P>
      <P>If there is a heaven Brian has gone to it.  I have known him for a long time and I never heard him say a bad word against anyone, including those in Opposition.  Brian always had a good word to say about everyone and he believed there was a reason people acted in the way they did.</P>
      <P>He has left a great legacy behind him in his family.  He has four fine sons of whom everyone is proud.  They have all done well in life and his daughter, Anita, was the joy of his life.  It is a sad day for Ireland and for those in politics.</P>

He had bad moments in politics, but that did not change his great sense of humour and dedication to his party, his country and to democracy.</P>

      <P>It was with great sadness that we received the news of the death of Brian Lenihan.  All those who knew him will be saddened to hear it, particularly the people of County Roscommon who will feel they have lost a loved son.</P>
      <P>It is strange that, following the death of the former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Seán Fallon, we are again paying tribute to an Athlone man who served the country so well.  Brian Lenihan was loved throughout County Roscommon and well known by every household.  Brian played a major role in improving the economic life of the county and providing infrastructural developments to help to raise the county's standards and bring them up to a level which was more advanced than those on the east coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> As Senator Mullooly said, it was not the fault of the electorate that Brian lost his seat in 1973.  Brian contributed to his downfall by putting the party first and trying to win a second seat for the county.  Although he fell between two stools, he did not regret his actions.</P>
    <P>His last engagement should have been at a function in County Roscommon some weeks ago.  However, he became ill in Athlone and could not attend.  Those who were being honoured with him that night were Dr. Hugh Gibbons, the man who won a seat in 1973, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  Tributes were paid to these people and the party's general secretary accepted the presentation on Brian's behalf and gave it to his family the following day.  It is a pity he did not arrive in Roscommon town that night. However, the 400 people who attended that function will always remember that they were there on the night that Brian was to attend.</P>
    <P>His contribution to this country and to the international scene was enormous.Members are sincere in their love for Brian Lenihan.  The Fianna Fáil organisation in Roscommon and nationally and his colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas had a soft spot for him and it was with a heavy heart that they received this news this afternoon.</P>
    <P>His death is a major blow to Irish politics.  Brian first tested the waters in 1954 in Longford-Westmeath and was elected in 1957.  He played a major part in politics and introduced legislation during his time in different ministries. He introduced the Succession Act, 1965, which for the first time gave dignity to widows.  He also introduced amendments to the Censorship Acts which were repressive and brought them into line with the thinking of the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
    <P>We express our deepest sympathy to his wife, Ann, his family, his brother, Paddy, who served on Roscommon County Council, and to his sister, Mary, who still serves Fianna Fáil, Westmeath and the country.</P>

      <P>The first time I met Brian Lenihan was in 1973 at the election count in Roscommon when my father took his seat.  He was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I was ten years of age and I did not know what was going on. I remember people carrying my father on their shoulders and saying it was amazing that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been defeated.  He shook my hand and I was dumbfounded because I was a young fellow from Leitrim who had not been to many places. He told me to always remember that night because it would be one of the best nights I would ever have.</P>
      <P>I was elected in 1987.  Brian Lenihan was a gentleman who always spoke to people whether he was a Minister or a backbencher.  He was the epitome of a politician.  Brian Lenihan's name could have appeared opposite the word &ldquo;politician&rdquo; in a dictionary.  He was everything people thought a politician should be, although some people disagreed with him.  However, he believed in what he stood for.</P>
      <P>He will be a huge loss to the Fianna Fáil Party and to this country.  I express my deepest sympathy to his wife, Ann, and to the rest of his family.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in expressing our sympathy to his wife, Ann, his family, his sister, Mary, and his brother, Paddy.  Brian Lenihan was a national figure.  I will miss his wisdom on the troubles in the North.  He had a positive contribution to make on this issue regardless of the difficulties which existed.  He had wisdom, knowledge and foresight second to none in this State. He belonged to the grass roots of public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invited him to County Donegal in June to present trophies in recognition of people who had served 50 years in Fianna Fáil.  He readily accepted the invitation, came to County Donegal and did us proud on that occasion.  We expected nothing less but we were honoured to have him.  I appreciate the contribution made by the Leader of the <Col N="72" /> House and we all join in extending our sadness and sympathy to his family.</P>

      <P>I also wish to be associated with the tributes paid to Brian Lenihan.  He was an extremely kind and courteous man to everybody, a quality that one does not expect to find anymore.</P>
      <P>To me, he represented Irish politics. When he lost his seat in 1973, I was at an economics lecture in UCC.  Before the class started that evening, the lecturer told us that it looked like Brian Lenihan would lose his seat.  Not many of us were that interested in politics or politicians at the time but everybody knew who he was and had great affection for him.</P>
      <P>I remember being struck by his ability not to bear a grudge, no matter what troubles he met, and he met many, especially as far as his health and public life were concerned.  When taking part in politics in these Houses, he was able to put the past behind him and move on, which is an extraordinary measure to find in any man or woman.</P>
      <P>Few people would have the strength of character of Brian Lenihan, be able to face the difficulties he had, especially with his health and after the last presidential election, be brave and courageous and to move on.  He is an example to us and to anybody who does not have a high regard for politicians. We are grateful and lucky to have served with him in these Houses.  It is difficult to imagine that we will not see him walking around either of these Houses again.</P>
      <P>I extend my sympathies to his wife and thank her and her family for allowing us to have had him for so long. I also extend my sympathies to the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly to his sister, Deputy O'Rourke.  He is a huge loss; the party had his loyalty for many years and it will be difficult to imagine life without him.</P>

      <P>I share the regret felt by all Members and the people on the death of Deputy Brian Lenihan.  He was <Col N="73" /> a wonderful family man.  He practised as a barrister in the midlands and was extremely good at it.  If a solicitor had a difficult case and wanted somebody who would at least put up a good fight, they could not do better than Brian Lenihan.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil was in difficulties, it was Brian Lenihan who came on television and he was always able to put up a splendid performance.  The harder the difficulty, the better he responded.  He did it with style, flair and great imagination at all times.  He was a wonderful Irishman.  Any of us who knew him were the better for it.  He always had a great knowledge of current and international affairs and it was an experience for anybody to listen to him.  He was a devoted servant of Fianna Fáil and I can understand how it feels on losing somebody of his calibre and ability.  People like him do not come around very often and we were fortunate to have met someone of his ability.</P>
      <P>Some Members referred to the 1973 General Election.  I was at the Portlaoise count but I took time off to watch the Roscommon count.  At the time Brian Lenihan's seat was in danger and Fianna Fáil looked as if it was going out of office.  The then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, was on television when the bad news came from County Roscommon. There were tears in his eyes that night because his friend was losing his seat. He felt the loss of Brian Lenihan's seat as much as Fianna Fáil losing power because they were close friends.</P>
      <P>While Brian Lenihan came from the midlands, he regarded himself as being more of a west of Ireland man.  He had a great knowledge of, and did much for, the west.  His most important legislation may have been the Succession Act, 1965.  At that time, women had few legal rights as far as their homes and land were concerned.  His Succession Act meant a lot to these women and he will always be remembered for that.</P>
      <P>He had extraordinary kindness and great wisdom and we have all suffered a great loss on his passing.</P>

      <P>I join in the tributes paid to the late Brian Lenihan.  He was one of the last great characters in these Houses.  He was a brilliant scholar, politician and lawyer but a plain and simple man.  Typical of that was the way in which he greeted Senator Reynolds when he was 10 years of age.  He was the same up to the day he died.  He had a special place for everybody and spoke to all.</P>
      <P>Brian Lenihan was at his best when he was involved in by-elections or on the platform.  No matter how tough the going, he never descended to personality clashes or trivialities, which is why he was loved by all.  He played the political game at a high level and never let personalities blind his vision to the policies and goals he was pursuing.</P>
      <P>He was a fine Minister for Education. Many schools were extended and expanded during his tenure as Minister. His mother was a native of my parish and came from a great republican family.It was on the kitchen floor of his mother's house that County Sligo's noble six were brought down dead from the Benbulben mountains many years ago.  He never lost his touch with the west or County Sligo.  A room in Sligo Regional Technical College is known as the Lenihan Room as a tribute to him as Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Brian Lenihan is gone but he has left many good friends.  Where Lazarus is poor no longer, Brian is renewing old acquaintances and is regaining contact with many old friends from the past.  I extend my sincere sympathies to his wife, Ann, his family, his sister, Deputy O'Rourke, and his brother, Paddy.  Go dtuga Dia suimhneas do anam Bhriain.</P>

I got to know Brian Lenihan in 1981 when I was first elected to the Dáil and I always admired his affable and genial manner. His great knowledge of his subject always captured one's imagination.  He was a man who occupied centre stage on the national political scene and the <Col N="75" /> international scene for many years.  He certainly made a great impact.

      <P>I wish to join with my colleagues in their expression of profound sympathy to Mrs. Ann Lenihan and her family, Deputy Mary O'Rourke and her brother, Mr. Paddy Lenihan, on the untimely death of Brian Lenihan.  I knew Brian Lenihan long before I was elected to the Oireachtas.  On the day I was elected to the Dáil in 1973 he lost his seat in that House and was subsequently elected to this House.</P>
      <P>Brian made outstanding contributions to political debate, not only here but in the international fora of the United Nations and the European Union.  On many occasions during my first visits to the European Community many of his former colleagues there were keen to follow his progress in Irish political life.  He had made many friends for Ireland in the Community in the early days of Ireland's membership.  In his capacity as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry he was involved in the delicate negotiations for the conclusion of the Common Fisheries Policy and was highly regarded throughout the Community for the political leadership he gave at that difficult time.  I can recall discussing afterwards the contribution he made with some Irish officials both here and in the Community and they were loud in their praise of the skill, dedication and expertise of the late Brian Lenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Defence, I had occasion to meet with people who had been working with him in a difficult time for the Army with the establishment of RACO and PDFORRA.  Brian Lenihan handled those negotiations in a delicate way and succeeded in putting in place a framework for Permanent Defence Forces representative organisations, both for the soldiers and the officers of the Army.  In every sphere of <Col N="76" /> activity in which he was involved during his political career, he brought a breadth of knowledge and expertise and a dimension which had a long-term impact on the framing of whatever issue or policy was involved.  He will be a major loss to the political life of this country at home and abroad.  I am sure his work will be an inspiration to all of us to continue the same high level of commitment to political life that he gave the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy to his widow, Ann, to all his relatives, especially those in north Clare, where he still had many relations and where he had a deep and lasting friendship with many people.  He will be sadly missed, not only in this House but in many counties and especially in County Clare, for which he had a special affection and a special knowledge of its people's work.  I want to be associated with the sentiments expressed by my colleagues.</P>

      <P>It is the greatest tribute to Brian Lenihan that virtually every Member of this House feels a compulsion to say something in tribute to him this evening for no other reason than real personal sadness.  There is a sense of unity which is rare in this House and I am sure this is true of the Dáil as well. This is a great tribute to the man we are all mourning today.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that there are any more anecdotes that need to be told because, as Senator O'Kennedy quite rightly said, if Brian Lenihan were listening to this, he would say: &ldquo;Enough, enough; let us get on with the next business.This is unnecessary.&rdquo;  I suppose it was his sense of cheerfulness, mischief, laughter and comedy which many of us will remember.  One always felt better for meeting Brian Lenihan.  Even if it was for a short few minutes, he left one with a spring in one's step and feeling more cheerful.  He had made one laugh. There was simply no malice in this man; he just could not feel any personal animosity against anybody, which is rare in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> Many years ago in this House a somewhat petulant university Senator had an extraordinary political row with Brian Lenihan when he was a Minister.  It took the best part of half an hour and was unresolved at the end.  They met in the bar afterwards &mdash; dare I say it &mdash; by accident.  Brian Lenihan invited the Senator to have a drink and he refused, because he was still furious.  The Minister, as he was then, simply could not understand this because he was a great parliamentarian and he believed that the fight should be fought in here but, once we got outside those doors, it was over.  That is an amazingly great quality.</P>
    <P>We are today mourning &mdash; and I say this without exaggeration &mdash; the greatest parliamentarian of this generation. He was not a great parliamentarian just in terms of longevity; he was a great parliamentarian in himself, with a great respect for both these Houses, and we need more people like him.  I would like to join with the sympathy to his wife, Ann, and to his children and to say I do not believe we will see another man like him in our time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with deep regret and a certain emotion that I rise to pay my respects to Brian Lenihan, a former Member of this House, who died today. Brian was a great man.  I first met Brian Lenihan at a by-election in Dingle in 1966 and there was not a time that I met him, over the years, when he would not ask me about people he had met in Dingle at that time.  I would often say to Brian that the person he was talking about was a Fine Gael supporter.  He would tell me not to mind that.  There were no divisions for Brian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last five or six years Brian must have suffered quietly because of the major operations which he had and the difficulties he experienced in that time.  I never once heard him complaining.He was still the same lighthearted Brian.  He had a light step when he walked into a room.  Senator Enright is right.  I remember times when we in Fianna Fáil were down because of bad results after an election and things were <Col N="78" /> going wrong.  Brian was the man who boosted us up.  Everybody in the House will remember Brian's lead-up speech at an Árd-Fheis before the arrival of the leader of the party of the Taoiseach.  He brought the house to its feet.  These are some of the things we will all remember Brian for.</P>
    <P>His contribution to legislation, to its initiation and passage through both Houses is written in the history books. Because of my interest in fishing, I remember being in contact with Brian when he was Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  We had difficulties in Dingle because fishing was not good and fishermen could not pay for their boats.  I am sure Senator McGowan would have had the same problems in Donegal.  Brian was the man who levelled it out and gave them a new chance.</P>
    <P>His contribution to the country in Government and in Opposition over 40 years cannot be forgotten.  He was a great republican and Nationalist.  He played a part over the years in trying to bring peace to the country and recently played a major role in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  Those achievements are all a monument to Brian Lenihan.</P>
    <P>Bhí cáirde ag Brian i ngach cúinne den tír seo agus ar fud an domhain.  Tá Brian i bhFlaitheas Dé inniu le cáirde ó gach taobh den Teach seo.  Fear mór bríomhar b'é Brian.  Bhí croí mór aige agus bhí grá mór aige don tír seo agus do mhuintir na tíre.</P>
    <P>It is with regret that I extend my sympathy to his wife Ann, his sons and daughter, his sister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, his brother, Paddy, and other members of his family.  Ní bheidh a leithéid ann arís.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>There is an O'Henry short story about the invitations received to the funeral of an old lady who had lost contact with her friends for many years. When they arrived at the funeral she was there to meet them and she said &ldquo;Sure I would not miss this for anything&rdquo;.My sadness this evening is that <Col N="79" /> Brian is not here to hear the tributes. Senator O'Kennedy has told us that Brian would tell us to get on with things. I have learned a lot more about Brian Lenihan tonight than I knew before.</P>
      <P>What sticks out in my mind was his sense of humour &mdash; I never met him without a smile on his face and he always brought a smile to whoever was in his company.  There is a definition of a gentleman as somebody who will never deliberately hurt anybody and that may be attributed to Brian Lenihan.</P>
      <P>I remember being on the steps of Kildare House last year when Senator Lanigan asked me if I would like to meet Yasser Arafat.  Brian Lenihan opened the door of the car when Yasser Arafat arrived and the sign of recognition, friendship and delight on his face when he saw Brian Lenihan and their embrace made it clear that Brian had an ability to cross boundaries and divides. He was a statesman in that respect.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the other tributes paid to his qualities I would say we are lucky to have had Brian Lenihan.  I thank his family for the amount of time they allowed him to share with the nation.  He must have given up a huge amount of personal time to share his time with his colleagues here and around the country.  We are grateful to his family for allowing us to share in that time.  Our thoughts go to his wife Ann, his sister, Mary, his brother, Paddy, and his children.  They will miss him, remember him with honour and pride and, I am sure, will look back on the good times.</P>

Brian was known and respected throughout Ireland, including Northern Ireland.  The people in Northern Ireland who would differ from his political beliefs respected him, knew he was a man they could trust and a man of honour.They knew there were few people <Col N="80" /> in this country with whom they could have such good Socratic debate.</P>
      <P>There will always be geese and swans in life.  Brian was a swan and he made an enormous contribution to the political scene.  He was a fair man who had a great thirst for peace.  He liked to see everybody excel in what they did.  He gave me invaluable advice.  I wish to be associated with the expressions of good wishes and sympathy to his family.  We will miss Brian.</P>

      <P>I join the other Members in expressing sympathy to the Lenihan family on Brian's death.  When he lost his Dáil seat in 1973 I remember meeting him in Tipperary.  Many people had seen him on television and an old man came up to him and told him he had been around a long time but was delighted Brian lost his seat.  Brian was amused and asked him what he meant. He replied that he would not have met him in the flesh otherwise.  Brian laughed it off and said it gave him a great opportunity to meet people around the country.  He was a great man.  He gave a lifetime to serving the public and made many sacrifices which reflected on his health.  We should all reflect on the toll that public life can exact on public representatives and their families.</P>
      <P>He was a man for making peace, whether debating an issue on television or in the Oireachtas.  He was a great family man.  He always had a smile on his face, even when times were bad for him.  He always had hope and I am sure he is happy today.</P>

      <P>Brian Lenihan was a man of great charm and good humour.  It is a mark of the affection in which he was held that we all feel that he felt for us as we felt for him.  In the last five years I was struck by the incredible courage with which he faced suffering and illness.If one asked him how he was he always replied there was no problem.  It has been widely said that he was incredibly proud of his family, but they were also proud of him.  I had the privilege of <Col N="81" /> meeting his daughter Anita in Oxford a few months ago and when I mentioned him to her it was lovely to see the glow in her face as she spoke about him. When I came back to Dublin and told him I had met Anita there was a reciprocal glow from him.</P>
      <P>We owe a great debt of gratitude to his family for allowing him to be with us over the last few months.  I particularly express sympathy to his sister Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  It must have been very difficult for her to go on with her political life in the Oireachtas and work in a public role knowing how seriously ill Brian was.</P>

      <P>It was with sadness that I learned of the death of my constituency colleague, Deputy Lenihan. He had been ill in the last few weeks but being who he was I expected he would get better.  I knew him since I joined the party in 1981 but he was a household name long before that.  I also knew about him through my father, who was a party member and canvassed in the former Dublin West County constituency with Deputy Lenihan, Deputy Lawlor and Mr. Terry Boylan in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>Senators mentioned the 1989 election. The vote he secured then was an indication of the high esteem in which he was held by his constituents &mdash; he topped the poll although he was not able to canvass.After that election, when he returned to health, we were on a walkabout in a housing estate and I saw something I never saw before and probably will never see again; large numbers of children following Brian around the estate, calling his name and asking for his autograph.  He was a popular man with young and old.  His positive attitude to life and work was epitomised by his phrase &ldquo;no problem&rdquo;.  He carried that through in the constituency &mdash; no matter what the difficulty was, it could be resolved and overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I offer my sympathy to his wife, Ann, his sister, Deputy O'Rourke, his brother Paddy, his sons Niall, Brian, Conor and <Col N="82" /> Paul and his daughter Anita.  This must be a difficult time for them.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes today.  My friendship with Brian goes back a long way to when I was around this House as a young girl, never thinking I would one day be a Member.  When I was elected a Senator, one of the first phone calls I received was from Brian Lenihan &mdash; he was so pleased another Ormonde was coming into the House.  When I met him afterwards he was always ready to give me advice and tell me what to do.  More importantly, given the fast lane nature of politics today, he was always a listener.He found time to have a one-to-one conversation and empathise with one's difficulties.  He had such insight and understanding into how people went about their business that he knew immediately what was worrying them and how he might help overcome the problem.</P>
      <P>Brian was a family man and he extended that orientation into his political life.  He was a great parliamentarian. He came from the old Fianna Fáil school and understood that commitment to the party was absolute.  That was shown when he lost his seat &mdash; most people would have been inclined to give up but not Brian.  He was geared to success and commitment; he epitomised these qualities and showed the rest of us how important it was to stick with what we enjoyed.  He loved politics and was at home there, as was reflected in how he did his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My last contact with him was at the forum where I sat beside him.  During that period he had a little more time to do his reading.  He used to bring me a list of books and tell me I must read them because they would be useful to me, whether I became an academic or went into politics.  I told him I did not have time to read but he said I must. He always thought of the goodness of people and how important it was that they develop in their careers.  I will miss Brian, especially the way he spoke to me and listened.  I will particularly miss <Col N="83" /> him from the forum because he was so keen about the peace process.  Until the end he was anxious it would be a success.</P>
    <P>I offer sympathy to his wife Ann, his children Brian and Conor, whom I know, the other children and his sister Deputy O'Rourke, who has had a difficult time in the last few weeks, working in politics while being aware of what was happening in the family.</P>

      <P>I join with colleagues in extending sympathy to Mrs. Ann Lenihan and her family and to Brian's sister, Deputy O'Rourke.  We all feel we have lost a friend.  He was from a different political party but was friendly to everyone.  One great characteristic of his was that no matter what debate took place in the House, the row ended when we went outside.  Even in the course of the most heated political debates, we could always see the sense of humour, the fun and roguery glimmering in Brian's eye.  He had a brilliant capacity for dealing with people.  No matter where they came from or what position they held, he made them feel important.  He had a great nature and sense of their value.  He enjoyed tracing their connections and recalling various events.</P>
      <P>He was a fine national politician and his contribution, not only to Fianna Fáil but to Ireland, has been outstanding.  He was a brilliant man who chose to serve the public rather than pursue what would have been a distinguished legal career.  He under-played his brilliance but he acquitted himself extraordinarily well in his various portfolios.  His knowledge and understanding of world affairs were expansive.  His positive attitude to life was particularly clear since he underwent surgery.  I will always remember when he returned after his operation that he received a standing ovation from all sides when he entered the Chamber.  There was genuine goodwill from everyone present because they all liked him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> He will be deeply missed by his wife Ann and his family because people like Brian Lenihan do not often enter public life.  It is hard to imagine anyone being fit to stand in his shoes or replace a man of his talent, ability, capacity, good humour, good sense and positive attitude to life.</P>

It was always nice to meet him and one would go away happy afterwards.  Many tributes have been paid to him today and all of them are deserved.</P>
      <P>As Senator Fitzgerald said, there was only one Brian Lenihan.  He served this House ably and was respected by all.  He was a wonderful parliamentarian.  During his illness he showed great courage. His few defeats were mentioned; Senator Enright recalled watching Mr. Jack Lynch talking to Brian on television during the 1973 election.  He accepted defeat gracefully on that occasion, as he did when he unfortunately lost the presidential election.</P>
      <P>He had many wonderful achievements and served in several Departments.Some of his achievements which may not be equalled were that he was the only Member to serve under six party leaders; and he was the only Member to serve with his father, and later with his sister, a great achievement by his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brian was a very nice man and his love of children was mentioned earlier. Children also loved him.  When he first came to the House, I brought my son, aged eight or nine.  He met Brian Lenihan because Brian would meet everyone.  When he was going home my son was delighted that he had met such a great man.  His passing is a great loss to the Houses of the Oireachtas and I offer my sincere sympathy to his wife, Ann, whom I know, his sons, his <Col N="85" /> daughter, his sisters, Mary and Kate, and his brother Paddy.</P>

      <P>I came to know Brian Lenihan by a circuitous route because I met him in the archives before I met him in person.  However, when I met him in person, it took no time at all to realise that the impression conveyed by the archives was valid.  He was one of the best brains of modern Irish political life.</P>
      <P>He had one of the most capacious minds, even if he felt at times obliged &mdash; this is a reflection on our political culture &mdash; to conceal it in case he appeared to be talking down to people.  However, he could not conceal that he was one of the most decent human beings in public life.  He also gave lie to an image that many political scientists, though happily not in this House, cherish of the legendary localism of Irish politics somehow reflecting a backward and primitive political culture.  He showed how one can combine strong local loyalties with a national and universal perspective on current affairs.</P>
      <P>I recall him at the funeral of Professor Dudley Edwards in University Church several years ago when he was still Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He looked like death warmed up on that occasion. When one thinks of the suffering he endured and the enormous physical, psychological and, in the best sense of the term, spiritual courage with which he endured it, we can say that if ever we wanted an example of grace under pressure, it is Brian Lenihan in the face of that pain.</P>
      <P>One word has not yet been used in the many splendid tributes which have been paid but when one thinks of it, it describes his response to disappointments, whether political or health.  That word is &ldquo;dignity&rdquo;.  He was an extraordinarily dignified man behind his folksy lively personality.  He had true dignity and he is literally irreplaceable.  Senator Fitzgerald made a comment and I will repeat it because we can truly say it of him: ní bheidh a leithead arís ann.  Ar dhéis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the many tributes to the late Brian Lenihan.  As Members are aware, he first stood for election in 1954 in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath. His father became a TD and represented Longford-Westmeath and his sister, Mary, is a distinguished Member of the Oireachtas representing the Westmeath constituency.</P>
      <P>Brian Lenihan was a father figure for most Members of the House.  We looked up to him.  If we sought his advice we took it 90 per cent of the time because it was the right thing to do.  I had a long close personal association with him, as far back as the early 1960s. A great friend of his, the late Joe Kennedy, played a very important part in his young political career, as Brian often told me, when he first stood in 1954 with Erskine Childers, Tom Carter and the late M. J. Kennedy in the Longford-Westmeath constituency.</P>
      <P>At that time he was viewed by the Fianna Fáil hierarchy as the brightest young new political brain available to the party.  How right those great men and founder members of the party were. We have the benefit of hindsight on his 41 years of public service and we know the great contribution Brian made to the State.  As many previous speakers said, people had great respect for him, especially in Europe and America.  He had many friends in the Senate and House of Representatives.  Everyone who met him had to be impressed by his commitment and wide knowledge of political affairs worldwide.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the time he lost his seat in 1973 and we watched the television programme that night. However, he regained the seat through the dignified manner in which he accepted his defeat, which came about as a result of the swing against the Government at that time.  If I had had a vote in the constituency in which he next stood, I would have done everything in my power to ensure he regained his seat, as he did handsomely at the next election.  He held that seat until his death today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> Senator Lee mentioned the reception he received when he came back to Leinster House, having regained his seat in 1989 and after his successful visit to the Mayo Clinic.  That day will remain a highlight of my memories as a Member of the Oireachtas and my association with Brian Lenihan.  It was the greatest occasion in my 14 years membership of the Oireachtas to see the way he was honoured by Members on all sides.  It stands as a testimony to Brian Lenihan and the man we knew.</P>
    <P>I offer my sympathy to his wife, Ann, sons Brian and Conor, the other members of his family, Paddy, Deputy Mary O'Rourke and her husband, Enda, and all the Lenihan family.  It is very sad that we must pass a vote of sympathy on the passing of another great Athlone man following the death of Senator Seán Fallon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak tonight with a feeling of genuine sadness.  I wish to be associated with the message of sympathy to Brian Lenihan's family and I express my regret at the sad news of his passing.  I wish to refer to a number of aspects of the late Brian Lenihan about which I came to know.  Senator Cassidy referred to him as an Athlone man but his roots were in my county of Clare. His father was born in a village called Gortown, between Ennistymon and Kilfenora, and his grandfather taught in the local school there.  A family connection exists and he remembered this when I came to the House.  It may not be known to many but it was known to us and his friendship, support and advice were extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to another aspect of Brian Lenihan, that is, the remarkable courage of a man with a very serious illness.He accepted it and fought it over a period of eight to ten years.  The courage he showed in the face of what he endured was truly remarkable.  His immense contribution to political life is recognised.  It was with genuine sadness that I learned of his death tonight and I wish to be associated with the message <Col N="88" /> of sympathy to his wife, Ann, and his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with genuine sadness that I contribute tonight because we are commemorating a unique individual.  It was already stated that this man had grace and dignity.  He was an extraordinary man who had no capacity to be vindictive or show malice; he had no capacity to show anything other than respect for political friends and foes.  In every sense, Brian Lenihan was a real liberal.  He had the capacity to listen to everybody, absorb their ideas, accept what was right and never show recrimination.He was ever optimistic.</P>
      <P>As is the wont in Irish life, our lives criss-crossed over a long number of years.  I remember having the task as a young civil servant of bringing a file to the Minister; the Minister in question was Brian Lenihan.  I remember his good spirits and how he put a young and awkward civil servant at his ease.</P>
      <P>I was with Brian Lenihan on that fateful day during the presidential campaign when news arrived at our organisation in County Wicklow, where he was canvassing, about the Duffy tape.  Some of our responses were not great, to say the least.  In my case, the response was one of disappointment because a great man, who had shown generosity and kindness to a student, was being repaid in a destructive manner.  Brian Lenihan did not utter a word of malice on that occasion.  He was the greater of all those present on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a great friend to people who entered politics on all sides of the House.  He showed great generosity and spirit.  One of the things I will always remember about Brian &mdash; to which Senator Ormonde referred &mdash; was his extraordinary capacity to read and absorb information.  Senator Lee paid a very kind tribute to him in this regard. People in public life in Ireland must disguise their intellect and that is a great pity.  Brian Lenihan was none of the things in the image of Irish politics which is sometimes fostered.  He had a great interest in every locality.  He had a <Col N="89" /> great interest in the individual, ordinary and extraordinary.  He had a higher view of the nature of politics.  We will never see his like again.</P>
    <P>My personal sympathy goes to his wife Ann, the children, his sister, Mary, brother Paddy, the whole family and to Irish politics.  We have truly lost a great man.  When people are cynical about politics we can hold up the image of Brian Lenihan.  He made a tremendous contribution to public life and politics. We are all diminished by what has occurred today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my deep sympathy to Brian's wife, Ann, their children and his family.  I knew Brian for a good number of years and could tell many stories, but I will tell only one.</P>
      <P>Following a Fianna Fáil convention at Castlebar during a European election campaign some years ago, I was travelled back to Dublin by car with Brian and a mutual friend, Owen Patton. Between stops on the journey I became aware of the amount Brian knew about foreign affairs.  I was astounded by his knowledge &mdash; and I mean that sincerely. I only had to mention a country and Brian knew everything about its politics, who was in charge, how they were elected, its geography, history and sociology.I have never met anyone with such a comprehensive knowledge of foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>I learned much about foreign affairs on that journey.  I also learned about other things; I learned about politics in Ireland and a little about life.  We left Castlebar at 5.30 p.m. on Sunday and stopped for dinner with former Senator Martin Joe O'Toole and some of his friends.  We made a number of other stops and arrived in Dublin at 5.30 p.m. on Monday.  Owen Patton and I were exhausted but Brian attended a meeting and dinner with an Austrian forestry delegation.  I do not know where he got the energy.  He was a tremendous character.  That is the Brian I remember well.  He was always gregarious and good humoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> He had many good qualities but I will mention only two.  The first was his courage.  It is easy to say, when people pass away, that they bore their illness with great courage but Brian really did. I never heard him complain.  The second was his kindness.  I know, from acts of kindness he showed me and many others, that he was a tremendously kind person.  He was warm-hearted, genuine and sincere.  If I could pay him any compliment it would be that he was one of the most decent men who ever stood in shoe leather.  His great friend, Senator Bohan, said that if there is a heaven he was sure Brian is in it.  There is a heaven.  There has to be for men like Brian Lenihan.  He rests there in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I had the opportunity to pay tribute to Brian Lenihan at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>There are a number of qualities which we all remember and cherish about Brian Lenihan.  It is so difficult to think or speak about him in the past tense.  It almost beggars comprehension that somebody so mentally alive and alert has passed so suddenly and sadly from us.  He had extraordinary perseverance. He was, in a way, the &ldquo;comeback kid&rdquo; of Irish politics.  I remember him being defeated in an election having topped the poll in the previous election.  Yet he was able to come back.  He returned to the heart of politics after the presidential election &mdash; with all its bruising difficulties &mdash; without, as Senator Roche stated, any apparent rancour or bitterness.I am glad he died in harness, which is the way he would have wanted it.  I was very fond of him and I believe he would agree that the country obtained an excellent choice in the present President.He himself would have made a very good President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, having lost the presidential election he returned in a role I am sure he was pleased to fill, that of first Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  In that role he displayed all the qualities of diplomacy and decency &mdash; several Members have used that term to <Col N="91" /> describe him because he was the ultimate decent man.  No partisanship existed on that committee.  Our discussions crossed party lines and we reached decisions and adopted by way of consensus.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Roche also referred to his intellectual capacity and made the point that very often in Irish life we tend to disguise intellectual qualities.  It is almost as if we are embarrassed about our intellectual attainments.  Brian Lenihan possessed an extraordinarily acute intelligence and perceptive analysis of international affairs.</P>
    <P>He also wrote beautifully.  It was with the greatest pleasure that I read various articles he contributed to various newspapers in recent years.  They always displayed a real depth of understanding and perception of international affairs. At the same time he was always approachable.  Nobody was too junior to receive the affectionate guidance of Brian Lenihan.</P>
    <P>I believe he would have enjoyed today's meeting with the Iranians.  I will not call them our Iranian friends because they certainly are no friends of mine.  What could be described as a frank exchange of views took place. Brian would have been pleased by that. Although he would have been presidential in his role as Chairman, he would have said &mdash; as he did when I took a swipe at the then French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé &mdash;&ldquo;Good man David&rdquo;, out of the corner of his mouth as we left the Chamber.</P>
    <P>He had a wonderful, roguish sense of fun but was also very much a family man.  He had a very fine family of which he was correctly but modestly proud.  In particular, I believe he was extraordinarily lucky to have his wife, Ann, to whom we all send our sympathy, as his helpmate throughout his life.  She stood by him in very difficult and trying times during a protracted illness.  I remember meeting him shortly before he travelled to America for a liver transplant operation.He was walking with his wife on Bull Island and I have never seen a man <Col N="92" /> look so haggard or exhausted.  One would have buried him that day.  He went to America, had the operation and fought an election from his hospital bed. That was a marvellous thing to do but then he was a remarkable man.  We are diminished by his death.</P>
    <P>I try to avoid clichés but there are times when clichés are appropriate.  The one that comes to my mind is ní fheicimid a leithéid arís because there is no doubt that we will not see the like of Brian Lenihan again.</P>
    <P>It is a sad day for this country but he had a fulfilled life and made a remarkable and generous contribution to public life.  In an age when we are cynical about politics and politicians, he was a man who dedicated his life to politics and I do not think he made any great fortune from it.  If he had gone into public relations or the media, he would have made a fortune.  He carried his qualities of decency into public life for the enrichment of all of us.  He will be greatly missed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I offer my sincere sympathies to Brian Lenihan's wife, Ann, and her family.  When I came into the House after the 1993 Seanad Éireann election, I became a member of the foreign affairs committee.  I always found Brian to be a kind, decent person who was always prepared to give advice.</P>
      <P>I think about his interest in football. At the time, my son played football in Germany and every time I met Brian, he always inquired about him.  It said much about the man that out of a sense of kindness he always inquired about him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His wife, Ann, has a number of relations living outside Letterkenny, the Devines and the Connaughtans, and Brian was always well received in that area.  The results of the presidential election in the Donegal area strongly bore that out.  At weekend clinics I get representations from people.  If they felt I was not making any progress, they would say they could always go to Brian Lenihan with the matter.  His power <Col N="93" /> seemed to extend even as far as Donegal.</P>
    <P>Brian has gone to join many decent people who have left both Houses of the Oireachtas, people like the late Senator Gordon Wilson and Seán Fallon.  To his wife and family, I offer my sincere sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with sadness I pay tribute to a great statesman and a dear friend.  I knew Brian Lenihan since 1965 when he visited me in Kerry and did me the honour of opening a hotel for me in Ballybunion.  I had known of him prior to that in my years in America.</P>
      <P>He had the stature of somebody like Éamon de Valera.  One wonders what political life would be like at present there had he settled down in Tralee, County Kerry, where he lived for a time.  Would I or other people like me get to see the inside of any House of the Oireachtas?</P>
      <P>Brian was an extraordinary man without a bad thought in his mind about any individual.  He was a politician and parliamentarian first and foremost.  He had respect for all political parties and for politics.  When parliamentarians attacked one another he would call a halt and say we were only dragging ourselves down and that we should not lose respect for ourselves.</P>
      <P>Even within Fianna Fáil, he was a man for peace, who would try to bridge gaps.  When he lost his Dáil seat, and later the presidential election, he took it on the chin, bounced back and got on with the day's work and running the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Late in my life, I learned about the image he created in Europe and the United States.  When I became chairman of the emigration group in Fianna Fáil, I worked in Washington.  Brian Lenihan had so many contacts on Capitol Hill that every door was open to him.  He helped me enormously by introducing me to many American politicians.  He could pick up a telephone and deal with <Col N="94" /> these people.  On that note I must mention the work he did behind the scenes, not alone for the illegal emigrants in the United States, but on all the other issues, like the peace process.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on about the man.  I could talk about his political experience, the way he operated, the way he thought and the way he felt about the people.  He put his country above everything. He was a parliamentarian through and through.</P>
    <P>Brian's final rally during the presidential election was in Kerry.  The response he got in every town and village in north Kerry, particularly when he arrived in his own town of Tralee, the thousands of people who came out to meet and touch him, and the respect they had for him, woke another emotion in me.</P>
    <P>He also had many achievements on the sporting field.  He was an extraordinary man.  This country will be saddened by the loss of Brian.  I extend my sympathy to his family, particularly his wife and children, and his sister, Mary, who serves in the other House.</P>

Brian Lenihan was a man of enormous ability and generosity.  He had a great sense of service both to the country, his party and, especially, the people.  He was above all a most friendly man who had time for everybody.  I extend my sympathy to his wife and family and to his brother and sister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> As a Leitrim man, I remember the late Brian Lenihan as having represented the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim prior to his relocation to Dublin West.  I want to echo all that has been said here.  Any words of mine cannot enhance or embellish what has been said with meaning, deep conviction and emotion by those who worked with Brian over the years.  Suffice to say that I express my sincere sympathy to his <Col N="96" /> wife, Ann, and family and, of course, to our Deputy Leader, Mary O'Rourke. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
