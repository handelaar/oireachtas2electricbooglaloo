      <P>I have notice from Senator Honan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In light of the publication of the Women's Aid document <i>Zero Tolerance &mdash; A National Strategy on Eliminating Violence against Women</i>, the need for the Minister for Health to outline the supports he intends to put in place to eliminate domestic violence and protect its victims, and in particular his plans for the Laois/Offaly area, where at present there is no refuge for such victims.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Honan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take item 1 today.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  For the information of Senators it is proposed to sit at 10.30 a.m. rather than 2.30 p.m. next Wednesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Leader of the House indicated we would discuss the OECD report next week.  Some Senators have not yet received a copy of the report and I ask the Leader to ensure copies are circulated.</P>
      <P>I am sure all Members will join me in expressing serious concern and grave disappointment at the decision by France to resume testing nuclear weapons. I ask the Leader to ensure the concern of the House is conveyed through the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to the appropriate quarters.</P>
      <P>Finally, does the Leader envisage there will be an opportunity before the summer recess to discuss Sunday trading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the last call made by the previous speaker.  I asked yesterday for a debate on the report on Sunday trading which has been submitted to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ensure there is a further debate on foreign policy on a Thursday this month, as had been agreed.  I congratulate the Tánaiste on his visit to the PLO because it is important we keep open that relationship which has existed through various Governments.  However, the Middle East has not been debated in this House for some time and it would be interesting to receive a report from the Tánaiste on his visit so we could be brought up to date on related issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting Senator Mullooly, I suggest to the Leader that we should have a debate on either foreign or European affairs.  The French decision is regrettable and has enormous implications, not just for peace and stability but for the Maastricht Treaty, the future development of European foreign policy and possibly the framing of defence policy.  It is a retrograde step on the part of the French.  I am pleased the Taoiseach has already voiced his dissatisfaction but I hope the Government continues to make clear to <Col N="1967" /> the French that we disapprove wholeheartedly of their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mullooly's statement on France.  I hope its EU colleagues, including ourselves, will exert pressure on them to reverse that decision.  It is a most extraordinary and retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House to pay tribute to the memory of the late rock musician, Mr. Rory Gallagher, who died yesterday.  He was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, 47 years ago and was one of the finest musical ambassadors this country ever produced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in condemning France.  The strongest possible protest should be sent through the French Ambassador to Ireland and the EU should discuss the issue as a matter of urgency.  These tests could be of enormous consequence.  If the French feel they are needed, we should join with the New Zealand Prime Minister in suggesting that any tests which take place should be conducted in France.  That will quickly soften their cough.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a debate on foreign affairs, a matter of great concern which will arise in the EU is the joint aeronautical regulations, which could come into force shortly.  These would eliminate all small private aerodromes throughout Europe.  This will ensure that people cannot be tested for pilot licences without being trained by fulltime trained pilots at the small aerodromes at a minimum cost of £35,000 each.  Additional support staff are also needed and this will increase the costs of running a small aerodrome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, to consider this matter because it will eliminate the smaller aerodromes, such as those in Sligo and Kilkenny.  Over 3,000 people have been trained in small aerodromes throughout the country, but this regulation will ensure that they will not be trained there in the future.  We should ask the Minister to come into the House to discuss this matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I mentioned the report of the Insurance Ombudsman.  I ask the Leader if time could be made available to discuss this issue.  The Pensions Board had to investigate approximately 24 pension schemes.  Perhaps it would be possible to have a debate on this matter, given the difficulties which occurred in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to have a debate on item 18, motion 4, which has been on the Order Paper for some time.  The Leader indicated earlier that we would have a debate in Government time and I would like to know when this could take place.  People in the Border areas are concerned about matching funding, because there are rumours that the various funds may not be matched by Government funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader should arrange a debate as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Mullooly, who asked for a debate on Sunday trading. The small shopkeeper must work on Saturdays and Sundays to 12 a.m. to stay in business.  This is the final chapter of his survival.  I hope there will be unanimity in our campaign against Sunday trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with others in asking the Leader to convey to the Tánaiste the point made by Senator Mullooly <Col N="1969" /> about French nuclear testing.  This has the support of the House.</P>
      <P>I am tempted to ask the Leader to ask the Superintendent to remove the cameras from the House because they do not seem to serve any useful purpose as regards the coverage given to this House by RTÉ.  One of the best debates in a long time on an extremely important topic, the murder of people, took place here yesterday.  However, I was amazed last night when it was ignored, apart from the three or four seconds coverage given to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton.  That is disgraceful. RTÉ gave the Dáil and a committee of the Dáil lengthy coverage. This is the second Chamber of the Parliament of Ireland, but it is not being treated as such.  I propose to the Leader of the House to invite RTÉ before the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss the total lack of coverage and respect accorded to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with Senator Magner.  I watched the entire programme and the proceedings of the Dáil were interesting.  However, only two Members of this House were mentioned briefly by name and three or four seconds were given to the Minister of State.  It then showed the proceedings of the subcommittees of these two Houses, which were treated with far greater respect.  It is an outrage and a disgrace and I say that as someone who has consistently defended RTÉ in this House. Its behaviour is grossly irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that a number of Senators, including Senator Magner and Senator Dardis, mentioned the French tests.  I join with them in asking the Leader to find some method of communicating our concern, perhaps to the French Ambassador.  I would go further and say that this shows what we are dealing with in the new Administration in France.  It is a cynical and morally corrupt regime which has openly stated that its personal and individual interests as a country reign supreme over the health, welfare <Col N="1970" /> and foreign policy interests of other countries.  We should not be surprised. During the debate on East Timor yesterday I quoted the Prime Minister, Mr. Alain Juppé&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Senator that we are not discussing that matter now.  He has indicated his support for a discussion on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to place on the record of this House that its secret service abducted and murdered a well known state psychologist who was a personal friend of mine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be out of order, but it is more out of order for the French Government to behave in this way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for clarification on a statement made by the Taoiseach &mdash; I want to know if it represents Government policy &mdash; on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; last night when he referred to the legitimate republican tradition of Sinn Féin.  I do not regard Sinn Féin as having a legitimate republican tradition.  I am increasingly concerned at the use of such language and the casual easy acceptance of the Irish Republican Army as if the so-called IRA was the legitimate army of the Irish Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>On yesterday's Order of Business the Leader mentioned approximately 12 pieces of legislation which will be dealt with during this session. However, there is no legislation on health.  Over the past number of months we have asked the Leader for a debate on many issues, including treatment for the mentally ill.  The Minister for Health has failed to publish the White Paper on Mental Health and the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, have not yet been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader when legislation will be introduced for the statutory reporting of child abuse cases, which has also been debated in this House, and other health matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be possible to ask the technicians to investigate the low volume from the speakers. Some Members speak loudly, such as Senator Norris, but others, such as Senator Finneran, speak low and it is difficult to hear them.  There is all party agreement that the volume from the speakers is poor, therefore, additional speakers should be placed in the House so that we can clearly hear what is being said.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Magner and Senator Norris that our share of air-time in this House is ridiculous.  We are supposed to have one-third air-time.  I agree that we should invite RTÉ before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>We should have a debate on Sunday trading, which I mentioned yesterday and to which I am opposed.  I ask the Leader if it would be possible to have statements on the <i>Irish Press</i> situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with colleagues in asking the Leader for a debate on Sunday <Col N="1972" /> trading.  This issue goes further than the situation in Dunnes Stores.  I want to know when the Government will introduce legislation to deal with this serious issue.  The management and owners of Dunnes Stores are riding roughshod&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the matter now, Senator.  You have indicated your support for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is timely that we should discuss this issue.  It has been going on for some time and it illustrates the inability of Government and the unions to come to the table to discuss some arrangements.  The matter should be discussed in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the condemnation of the French for their latest announcement on nuclear testing.  As regards coverage of the House, and arising from what was stated here last week, I ask the Leader if any communication was received from the Cork Examiner Group or whether it had decided not to give further coverage to the Seanad.  If the answer is in the negative, a response should be given by the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce a refugee Bill. A similar commitment was given by the previous Government in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government.</i> We have obligations under the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Refugees and the New York Protocol to introduce legislation to cover refugees. Will the Leader consider asking the relevant Minister to introduce a refugee Bill in this House, where we could have a broad ranging discussion on refugees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader give the House an update on the status of the broadcasting control committee?  I raised this issue in the House last January. At the time, the Leader admitted that, because of the change of Government, <Col N="1973" /> the committee had been lost in the slipstream and that he would investigate. I did not press the matter subsequently, but four months have now elapsed.  This is a committee of the House.  It acts in a regulatory monitoring role and it would, for example, reflect much of the commentary in the House this morning.  A representative of RTÉ sits on the board.  The Leader and I have shared many happy hours together on the committee down the years.  Will he urge the Taoiseach to establish the committee as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to get copies of the OECD report circulated today.  I thank Senator Mullooly and others for raising the question of France's testing of nuclear weapons.  If it is agreeable with the Whips, we could perhaps arrange to set aside 30 minutes today for statements on this matter.  Statements from the Seanad carry more weight than me conveying the views as expressed on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>The question of Sunday trading was raised by a number of Senators.  I will endeavour in the next fortnight to have a discussion on this issue.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Dardis raised the issue of foreign policy. Members will note that item 15 on the Order Paper is a motion dealing with a report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on European Union Security and Defence.  It was placed on the Order Paper by the chairman of the committee, Deputy Dukes. He is anxious that the House debate the report.  I am also anxious that reports of committees would, as a matter of course, find their way to the House where they can be debated.  This would allow us to keep abreast of developments. I will, therefore, try to find time and a format for this.  The chairman of the committee may well be the person to present the report to the House rather than the relevant Minister. It may be a matter we can discuss in the near future at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1974" /> I will convey the point raised by Senator Lanigan to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications but I cannot guarantee the same speedy results this time as happened last week. Senator Cosgrave raised valid and important points about the insurance ombudsman and the report on pensions. I will communicate with the Senator and attempt to arrange a debate on this matter. There will be a debate before the end of the session on the point raised persistently and correctly by Senator McGowan.</P>
    <P>On the question of RTÉ, I join with Members in expressing extreme annoyance at the exclusion of the excellent debate we had yesterday.  I have been informed by RTÉ that due to a technical hitch, the Seanad was not recorded until 5 o'clock or 5.30 p.m. yesterday. All of us are very unhappy with the level of coverage we are getting in a general way from RTÉ.  It is a matter which should be on the agenda of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the matter of the broadcasting committee.  It has been established and members have been appointed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  A meeting has not been convened.  I do not know why, but I will find out as it is long past time that there was a meeting of that committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Currie, will attend the House before the end of the session to discuss the child care aspects of health.  The White Paper will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy and I discussed with the Minister the question of the <i>Irish Press</i> yesterday.  If it is considered useful and we can find a proper format, we can have a discussion on this matter and on the newspaper industry generally within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>I ask Senator Sherlock to leave the matter of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> a short while longer and I will revert to him on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> I am not aware of a forthcoming refugee Bill.  It certainly will not be introduced in this session.  I will ascertain the position and advise Senator Mulcahy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 16 to 19, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Board shall in particular&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> (a)  provide within the Board's resources and subject to the other provisions of this Act, legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of this Act,</P>
    <P>(b)  ensure that citizens are adequately informed and educated as to their legal rights as represented by the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is another section on which we had quite a long debate on Committee Stage.  I thought the Minister was amenable &mdash; he may have indicated that he was &mdash; to looking at the section again. The Bill, as it was initiated and as passed on Committee Stage, was far too narrow.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 6 attempt to broaden the scope of the Civil Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>The system which was in place before the Minister decided to put it on a statutory basis was similar to the system proposed by the Minister.  Members who proposed amendments to this section feel strongly that now is an opportunity to broaden the scope of the Civil Legal Aid Board.  The Minister made the point that within the limited resources available he saw the provision of civil legal aid to family law cases, which form the bulk of the cases dealt with at present, as being where the resources should go.  That is a short-sighted approach.  Unless we also look at empowering citizens to know what their rights are and carry out some research into the kind of cases taking place, we are doing nothing other than providing a kind of fire brigade service to people in difficulties.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I said I viewed the civil legal aid service in a much broader way and my amendments would expand the service to provide the kind of service the Coolock Law Centres and FLAC have suggested to the Members of the House.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the Minister in his amendment has gone at least some way toward meeting the spirit of the considerable debate we had here during <Col N="1979" /> the earlier Stages of the passage of the Bill.  It is slightly weaker than that which is proposed.  I will continue to support Senator McGennis' amendment.  I must acknowledge that the Minister has clearly made some movement in this area.  I very much welcome that.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on the record of the House that among other material I received is a briefing from SIPTU on behalf of the committee of solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board.  As part of their submission they make the point that the statutory functions of the board should include the following additional functions: an educational role and the dissemination of information about basic legal rights and obligations. That is where both amendments we are considering here really hit home.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I argued on Committee Stage that it has occasionally occurred in the past that when Governments, in a cheese-paring frame of mind, wished to cut back on expenditure, they did not always cut back directly on the services. There was a rather nasty parsimonious attitude displayed by cutting back on the dissemination of information to the public about the availability of those services.  They could on the one hand say they were providing the service, but on the other, by starving the general public of knowledge of their right to access these services, they effectively imposed a rather mean kind of economy.</P>
      <P>I will continue to support Senator McGennis, but I also acknowledge the Minister has made some degree of movement in this area and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has gone some way toward dealing with the fact that so many people who require free legal aid have no knowledge that it is available to them.  I note this was brought up in the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women regarding the fact that information on family law matters is so inadequately available for those <Col N="1980" /> who may need it.  I am glad some attempt is being made now to ensure that the facilities and services of the board are being better publicised.  The amount of money will, of course, depend on the resources of the board.  I do not think a tremendous amount of the resources will go toward disseminating this information.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister said that the citizen's advice bureaux could be put in a position to give out such information. Perhaps they could also have any information that is being distributed by FLAC.  Another possibility would be that such information could be disseminated through any of the one stop shops which the forum on employment is dealing with at the moment.</P>
      <P>The extent to which the services of the board will be taken up depends on whether those who need them know they are available.  Some of those most in need do not realise these services are available.  I know of some in great hardship who paid money privately before discovering they were in a position to get help from the State.  I am absolutely sure the Minister, with his desire for equity before the law for all those within the State, will not want to see that situation arise again.  I welcome the fact that he has brought forward this amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support Senator McGennis' amendment.  I accept the Minister has gone some way toward what we asked of him on Committee Stage, but I reiterate a point I made at that time.  Equal access to justice for all requires that all members of society are aware of their rights and obligations. The Pringle report attached considerable importance to the requirement that the board should have an education function and that they should publicise the services available under the legal aid schemes.  At the launch of <i>Zero Tolerance: A National Strategy on Eliminating Violence Against Women</i> on Tuesday. 13 June, one of the recommendations was that funding would be made available <Col N="1981" /> for public legal education.  They said that lack of finance was only one barrier people face in gaining access to justice and that the lack of awareness of their rights and the services, which can assist them in enforcing their rights, are just as real a barrier.</P>
      <P>We discussed on the last occasion that education can, in fact, reduce the cost of legal aid as it often assists clients to use the available services more effectively at an earlier stage.</P>

      <P>This issue was discussed at length on Second and Committee Stages.  In an ideal world with unlimited finance available one could have an ideal system.  The Minister has struck a good balance in allowing the Civil Legal Aid Board itself to disseminate information and involve itself in educational functions.  The Minister's amendment is the most appropriate approach to the issue which many of us support and on which we voiced our support on Second and Committee Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator McGennis' proposal and the views expressed.  I recognise the Government amendment goes some way to meeting our earlier arguments but I am a little puzzled as to what appears to be a sense of reluctance in the phraseology.  The term &ldquo;disseminate information&rdquo; is a much weaker sense of commitment than using the term &ldquo;education&rdquo; or accepting the validity of an educational function. I am puzzled as to why the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; cannot be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a one-off opportunity to take on board the responsibility of Government to enhance public awareness of basic legal rights, irrespective of the funding situation at any given time.  The phraseology of Senator McGennis' amendment &mdash;&ldquo;within the Board's resources and subject to the other provisions <Col N="1982" /> of this Act&rdquo;&mdash; seems to be responsible.  One should have incorporated in this Bill as a basic statement of principle the responsibility of the State to ensure citizens are as aware of their legal rights as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment is, in a way, couched in terminology which is a little grudging in that respect.  It seems concerned with limiting rather than opening up.  For this reason and the reasons mentioned by others I am still unhappy with the phraseology, although I recognise it comes some way to meeting our demands.  Had it come earlier one might have regarded it as a major concession.  I support Senator McGennis' amendment, although I welcome the spirit of the Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator McGennis' amendment and the sentiments expressed by Senator Lee.  The Government amendment is no more than a minimalist step.  The underlying principle is the degree to which the State takes the view that there is a simple peasantry which might be assisted as opposed to the view that there are people who are entitled as a matter of right to information and the State has a duty to provide that information.</P>
      <P>I realise there is a cost aspect, which I am sure the Minister would emphasise. The savings as a result of disseminating the information might adequately pay for the provision of the service.  It is important that people know their rights and the State has a duty to assist them in that task.</P>
      <P>We debated freedom of information last week and there was widespread agreement in the House as to the need for freedom of information and the need for accessibility of information for citizens.  During the debate on Senator Roche's Bill the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, gave a commitment that legislation would be introduced. That matter should not be lost sight of in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> I accept there is some movement on the part of the Minister, but it is not adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">

      <P>The proposal in the Government amendment is a major step in terms of Government providing information on Government services, something which happens too infrequently. Its proposal is significant.  It is an appropriate amendment.  People are generally fairly well aware of their rights, and the new offices opened by the Minister to give each county a local legal aid service have highlighted the existence of the service for people who otherwise would not have known of it. It has been my experience that people often know about legal aid and ask for it when they go to a solicitor.</P>
      <P>It is questionable whether the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; should be included in the amendment.  Education is for the educators. The Legal Aid Board should not get involved in education with regard to legal rights.  It would be more helpful to be positive about it and look at the role of education generally in the schools. Civics classes should provide education for life and teach individuals about their rights and responsibilities.  That matter should be examined in the general context of education and not in relation to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage a number of Senators expressed a desire to see section 5 expanded so as to impose on the board an obligation to involve itself in a number of activities associated with the provision of legal aid and advice.  I have examined the Senators' comments in the intervening period.  Amendment No. 5 would have the effect of putting an onus on the board to advertise or publicise its services. It would help to ensure that those members of the public who might benefit from obtaining the services of the board will be made aware as fully as possible about the nature and range of the board's services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1984" /> While it is fair to assume that the hoard will provide, as it does at present, a deal of information to the public about its activities, I agree that statutory expression should be given to the role the board must play in this area.  I hope Senators will support my amendment.</P>
    <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, I could not accept any amendment which would result in education and research functions being deemed to be principal functions of the Legal Aid Board.  While I accept the Legal Aid Board has a role to play in the area of education and information and that in the normal course of its operation it may be required to undertake research as appropriate, the principal function of the board must be, as the Bill already provides, the provision of legal aid and advice in civil matters to persons of insufficient means.  To accord any other matter an equal or limited priority would result in limited resources being diverted from what must be the principal function, namely, that of providing legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 would have the effect of deeming the board's educative role to be more important than the provision of legal aid and advice.  It does not indicate that the provision of legal aid and advice is to be the principal function of the board.  Rather it suggests the opposite, because it qualifies the provision of legal aid and advice by reference to the board's resources while not similarly qualifying the board's responsibilities in respect of information and education.  In such an unqualified state, paragraph (b) of the amendment would, I am satisfied, place an intolerable burden on the resources of the board.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 is less far-reaching than amendment No. 4 but has the effect of assigning particular importance to education as a role in which the board might be asked to engage by way of additional functions as the Minister may designate by order.  I have some sympathy with the amendment. However, the difficulty is that it singles out education above other possibly <Col N="1985" /> more important additional functions. Having regard to the primary function of the board, that does not appear to be the right signal to give within the statutory framework for the board in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the Pringle committee, whose report led to the establishment of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  It envisaged a role for the board by way of the supply of legal information to the public. However, at the time of reporting in 1977, the committee envisaged that law centres would be concerned principally with the provision of legal advice rather than legal aid which is representation in court.  The practical experience of the operation of the scheme in the intervening 18 years has shown the opposite to be the case.  Law centres spend by far the greater proportion of their time providing legal aid to members of the public for the purpose of proceedings before the courts.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on Committee Stage, the National Social Service Board &mdash; the NSSB &mdash; which was set up in 1984, is a resource agency whose aim is to inform and empower individual citizens and communities by ensuring that they are aware of all their civil and social rights and entitlements and of the services which exist to support them.  At the time the Pringle committee reported, the NSSB did not exist.  In many respects the information and education role which the committee envisaged would be undertaken by the Legal Aid Board's law centres is today being provided through the citizen information centres registered with the NSSB.  At present, there are a total of 82 citizen information centres nationwide registered with the NSSB, which receives an annual grant from the Department of Health in excess of £1.2 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the denial of information being used as an excuse for budget cut backs and so on. However, that accusation cannot be levied at the moneys provided for the Legal Aid Board.  I have provided hugely increased budgets during the <Col N="1986" /> years I have had responsibility for the board so there can be no accusation of cut backs.  The position is quite the reverse; the moneys and resources have been substantially increased and they are being used to the full.  Even the increased provisions are being used to the full and there is no shortage of customers at the legal aid centres.</P>
    <P>Whatever about information or education, many thousands of people know about the service and are availing of it. I am pleased about this and I hope to extend and further expand the resources of the Legal Aid Board to the maximum possible extent in the future.  I will consider carefully how best the increased resources can be used as they become available from time to time in selecting priority areas for extension and expansion of the service, as I have done in the past.  For these reasons I regret that I am opposing amendments Nos. 4 and 6 and supporting my amendment No. 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister has taken on board many of the points made on Committee Stage. However, his amendment does not go far enough to achieve the objectives outlined on Committee Stage.  The Minister accepts there should be a statutory expression in the Bill of the Legal Aid Board's responsibility with regard to education.  However, his amendment does not give effect to that obligation.  It states that the board &ldquo;shall, to such extent and in such manner as it considers appropriate,...&rdquo; In my opinion that does not place a particular obligation on the board to deliver the type of service we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the primary function of the board is to provide civil legal aid and to represent people who need representation.  This is why my amendment is framed as it is; it recognises that this is the board's primary function. However, it also insists that the board must ensure that citizens are adequately informed.  Senator Henry said she did not believe much of the resources would be channelled in that particular direction. For this reason, I ask her to support <Col N="1987" /> my amendment.  If the Minister's amendment is accepted, very little of the board's resources, if any, will be channelled in the direction that I wish them to be channelled.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher said she believed people are aware of their legal entitlements. However, from personal experience in my constituency I believe that is <Col N="1988" /> not the position.  To reinforce this point, in 1991 FLAC carried out a survey on awareness of legal aid services.  The result showed that 58 per cent of those surveyed knew nothing about the availability of legal aid and how to apply for it.  For the reasons I have outlined, I intend to press my amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, Senator Lee and Senator Quinn, in particular, were of the view that the board should be required to make its annual reports available within a shorter time frame than provided for in the Bill. The Bill as it is framed at present requires the board to make its annual report within a year of the end of the year to which the report relates.  In <Col N="1990" /> replying to the House on Committee Stage I undertook to consult with the board on the matter.  As a result of those consultations I am proposing an amendment which would have the effect of requiring the board to produce its annual report within nine months.  That having been said, I am confident that the board may be able to produce most of its annual reports within a shorter period, even though the compilation of reports involves a good deal of work in relation to information of a statistical nature the details of which do not come to hand for some time.  I am not in a position to tie the board to a deadline of six months because the imposition of such a limit might restrict the board unduly in making a detailed and informed report.</P>

      <P>I am reluctantly going to accept the Minister's move in the right direction.  I have some difficulty with the standards being set in general both by Government and by this House by not placing much more demanding dates on all State organisations, agencies and bodies to provide information to their shareholders &mdash; I am referring to the citizens of this State &mdash; similar to the information that is insisted upon by shareholders of companies in the stock market.  Such companies insist on having information much earlier that 30 September, but I accept that the Minister has moved in the right direction.</P>
      <P>With each Bill that comes before this House, I will continue to urge the Minister concerned to consider moving those dates closer to the dates that would be accepted in the stock market.  As a nation we should be setting a higher standard.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator Quinn says about the lack of urgency with so many reports.  I have already pointed out the case of the Department of Health's committee on maternal and child health whose last annual meeting was in April 1994, but here we are in June 1995 and not even a draft report has appeared yet.  Senator Quinn has a <Col N="1991" /> strong point when he says there is far too long a delay in obtaining accounts and reports.</P>

      <P>Like the two previous speakers, I reluctantly accept this as a move in the right direction.  I moved an amendment on Committee Stage for a three month period.  Nine months is giving a lot of time for something that could be done more quickly if the pressure was really on.  However, this at least recognises that a year is simply too long. If there is difficulty collecting these statistics &mdash; and there obviously has been some difficulty, historically, because it is two years since the last report &mdash; then this surely is a way to begin putting pressure on those bodies which are supposed to supply them.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for the board itself to be abreast of what is happening and to be basing policy on recent developments unless it has this information to hand much earlier than appears to be the case at present.  This is a step in the right direction even it does not go quite as far as one would wish.  Therefore, I will support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister has gone some way towards meeting the demands made on Committee Stage that a date should be set.  It is important to put a deadline, but nine months after the end of the year is a long time to wait.  The Free Legal Aid Board recently made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and they were able to gather information &mdash; for instance, on waiting lists at law centres &mdash; quite quickly for presentation to the committee.  I cannot understand how it would take them nine months to produce the report.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 42 and 43, to delete &ldquo;, in the opinion of the Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I discussed this amendment on Committee Stage and raised it with the Minister. I indicated that I would come back to it and I asked the Minister to look into it further.  As a gesture to the way in which House should operate, the Minister might well consider accepting this amendment.  The proposal is to eliminate the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Board&rdquo; in section 24.  At the moment, that section says that &ldquo;a person shall not be granted legal aid or advice unless, in the opinion of the Board (a) a reasonably prudent person&rdquo; would continue in this way.</P>
      <P>My objection is to the insertion of &ldquo;in the opinion of the Board&rdquo; as a qualifier to what &ldquo;a reasonably prudent person&rdquo; would do.  I note that in the original drafting of the Bill this section did not contain the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Board&rdquo;.  I also note that in many other sections of the Bill &mdash; section 26, section 28(2) and (6), and section 29(6) and (7) &mdash; the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Board&rdquo; are included.</P>
      <P>In order to anticipate the argument as to why I have not suggested taking them out of those sections as well, it is precisely to make my point that they make sense in those areas where the opinion of the board is called for in order to make a decision.  It is not called for and it is an obstruction in section 24.  In other words, in any of the other sections it is how the board makes its decision but the question of &ldquo;a reasonably prudent person&rdquo; is an issue with which many people will have come to terms in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of dealing with, being involved in, participating in and being a witness in cases of negligence in particular taken against teachers, I know that if there is an accident the question will be asked whether enough supervision, discipline or care was taken by the board.  It always boils <Col N="1993" /> down to a judge deciding what a reasonably prudent person would do.</P>
    <P>The problem with this section is that were I to challenge a decision taken by the board, as the Bill is now written, the determination of a court &mdash; in a judicial review, an appeal or however it got to court &mdash; would be whether the decision was the opinion of the board.  If it was the opinion of the board that is the end of the matter, but I want the appeal to be on the basis of what a reasonably prudent person would do, and that is two steps back.  It makes a significant difference in terms of how the matter is dealt with.</P>
    <P>In the whole concept of negligence, reasonableness can be on the basis of omission or commission; in other words, omitting to do something or commission in terms of doing the wrong thing. Courts have had to turn themselves tortuously around pieces of evidence in order to determine that.  In one case concerning a school yard accident, an extremely frustrated defending barrister who was trying to argue the point that the teacher was acting reasonably and that he or she could do no more, said: &ldquo;I suppose, in the first place, a reasonably prudent person would not have had 39 kids.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That case illustrates that it is a court's decision to interpret what a reasonably prudent person would do.  It is not a matter for the opinion of the board, a phrase which definitely creates a barrier and sets things back.  There is a very good reason the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the board&rdquo; have been used in other parts of the Bill.  Section 28(2) says that &ldquo;Subject to section 29... the Board shall grant a legal aid certificate under this section to a person if, in the opinion of the Board... the applicant satisfies the criteria in respect of financial eligibility. ... the applicant has as a matter of law reasonable grounds... the applicant is reasonably likely to be successful in the proceedings ...&rdquo;.  These are the decisions in which the board's opinion is called for in order to come to a conclusion. They are definite, practical and good reasons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1994" /> The initial drafting was correct.  The Minister's addition of the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Board&rdquo; on Committee Stage appeared to be a tidying up &mdash; I accept that nothing more than bringing consistency into the legislation was intended &mdash; but it does not have that effect at all.  It is completely different. Section 28 states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding <i>subsection (2)</i>, the Board shall not grant a legal aid certificate if it is of the opinion that &mdash; (a) the applicant may obtain the cost of the proceedings... from.... any other source, (b) the applicant has on a previous occasion obtained legal aid or advice... (c) the cost to the applicant of engaging a solicitor... (d) such information as is reasonably required by the Board....&rdquo;.  I am sorry to rush through the section's provisions but I do not want to waste time.  The opinion of the board is called for in each of these matters &mdash; it is the method by which the decision will be taken.  I can go through the legislation in the same way.</P>
    <P>My main point is that the determination of what a reasonably prudent person would do, if it is to be challenged, is determined by the courts.  It is unacceptable and worrying that the opinion of the board would come between the definition or interpretation of what a reasonably prudent person would do.  I have looked at information on what a reasonably prudent person would do and how that could be tied in with the opinion of the board.  Taken out of context it appears quite funny. Herberts said that a reasonably prudent person is:</P>
    <P>A model of all proper qualities with only those human shortcomings and weakness which the community will tolerate on the occasion.  This excellent but odious character stands like a monument in our courts of justice vainly appealing to his fellow citizens to order their lives after his own example.</P>
    <P>It is a quite significant legal concept.  It is difficult enough for a judge in court to interpret what this odious character, <Col N="1995" /> the reasonably prudent person, would do because he has been the bane of our lives.  I am glad to be sexist on this occasion because women have not been tainted with this one for the moment</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that this is a significant issue.  The Minister made the case on Committee Stage that this was a drafting matter and that it did not change the meaning of the section. If he still holds that opinion, despite what I have said, would he concede that if it makes no difference there is nothing lost in the fairness of the legislation? The Minister argued on Committee Stage that somebody must determine this and why not the board rather than the court.  I sense the Minister still thinks that way now.</P>

      <P>Mind-reading goes with the job.  The board should not be totally self-regulatory.  Somebody must judge the judges in this case.  The board takes the decision not on the basis of an opinion but on the basis of what a reasonably prudent person would do, and if somebody is going to oppose that it should be done in a legal way.  I could continue to discuss this in a number of other areas.</P>
      <P>We are creating an unnecessary barrier here, which, in the Minister's view, was only a drafting amendment when he put it forward in the first instance.  It therefore does not take from the meaning of the section.  However, I have discussed it with a number of people who have legal and court experience and they see it as an additional obstacle in this area.  I ask the Minister to be gracious and generous about this and to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would have the effect of removing from the Bill words which were agreed on Committee Stage on the basis of a Government amendment.  As I explained at the time, the amendment was simply a drafting amendment which made clear that it is for the Legal Aid Board to operate the general criteria set out in section 24 for the granting of legal aid and advice.</P>
      <P>The board, in forming its decisions, must not only take paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 24 into account but also other provisions in the Bill, such as those in section 26, which sets out the criteria for the granting of legal advice, and in section 28, which sets out the criteria for the granting of legal aid. Section 24 makes special mention of the fact that the section operates without prejudice to the other provisions of the Bill.  Were the board to appear to act outside the scope of its powers under the Bill it would be open to a person to seek a judicial review of any such decision.  The words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Board&rdquo; in section 24 are there for purposes of clarity only.  Somebody must operate the criteria for granting legal aid and advice under the Bill, and that body clearly is and can only be the Legal Aid Board.  It would be unrealistic to think that deletion of those words would somehow change fundamentally the role of the board in coming to decisions about the granting of legal aid and advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the section is that a person shall not be granted legal aid or advice unless a reasonably prudent person and so forth.  A person puts in an application for legal aid and advice.  The criteria are set down in the Bill.  Somebody must make a decision as to whether the criteria have been met. Who will make the decision as to whether the person will be granted legal aid?  Clearly, it can only be the Legal Aid Board.  On what basis does it give its decision?  It gives its decision on the basis that in its opinion these criteria are fulfilled or are not fulfilled.  The only alternative is to have the approximately <Col N="1998" /> 2,500 people who are approved for legal representation go before the courts so that a judge can decide whether these criteria are met.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board makes the decisions.  Nobody can suggest that anybody other than the Legal Aid Board make the decision.  On what basis would it make the decision as to whether the criteria have been met?  There is only one basis &mdash; their opinion that these provisions have or have not been met. That is what I meant when I said that this was a drafting amendment only.  On what other basis will it come to a decision on any application except on whether it is its opinion that these criteria have been met?  I am at a loss to understand the thrust of the amendment.</P>
    <P>Those words were only inserted for the purpose of clarity.  It may reassure Senator O'Toole and Senator Norris to know that, whether the amendment is there or not, any person who feels that the Legal Aid Board in deciding an application acted unreasonably or beyond the scope of the section can go to the High Court and apply for judicial review.  They can do that if they believe the board strayed, acted unreasonably or that its opinion was so wrong as not to comply with the criteria in the Bill.  It is perfectly proper that the words should be in the section.  They are a reflection of fact.  The Legal Aid Board, in considering each application, gives its opinion on whether it complies with the criteria.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not believe the Minister has dealt with the arguments I put forward.  I regret to say I believe he is being somewhat disingenuous in his response to my case.  It is of course true that there could be still be a judicial review of the manner in which the board made their decision.  The problem is that the presence of these words means that the court review will be on the basis of the opinion of the board which is now equally as important as the other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Bill is there and the English language is the English language and it is not correct for the Minister to say that it is the same as everything else.  The Minister said it does not change fundamentally the board's method of decision making.  I agree and I am quite clear that it does not change fundamentally the way a decision is taken by the board.  I am also quite clear that it is the board which takes the decision.  If these words are deleted the section will read: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Act a person shall not be granted legal aid or advice unless ...&rdquo; and go straight on to the issues.  Any judicial review would be on the basis of whether in the opinion of the court a reasonably prudent person would take the action and not whether it was the opinion of the board that such is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that where a decision has to be made by the board, the board makes that decision.  The Minister himself said at an earlier stage that the principle of subsidiarity would apply and that in most cases the decisions would be taken at the lowest possible level, in the law centre.  We all know that is the case and that it would only go to the board where there is a conflict or doubt, but it is still a decision <Col N="2000" /> of the board.  The Minister has not given us any argument as to why the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Board&rdquo; must remain in the section.  He said it does not change fundamentally the method of decision making, and I agree with that.  He said there could still be a review of the board's decision; I never said there could not be such a review. The point I am making is that a review will now take account of the opinion of the board as opposed to what a reasonably prudent person would have done.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that the board may refuse to grant a legal aid certificate if it is of the opinion that certain criteria have not been met and it must take many things into consideration. That is an administrative function which one would expect the board to have.  For that reason I did not propose an amendment to delete references to the opinion of the board in this and other similar sections in the legislation.  The words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Board&rdquo; are certainly unnecessary in section 24.  The Minister, in his reply, said that it does not change fundamentally the method of decision making and that a board decision could still be reviewed.  I am not sure who would pay for such a judicial review or how anybody could take that up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another complicated question but I will let the Minister deal with it.  I notice he did not deal with it in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;a reasonably prudent person&rdquo; denote an objective test which is certainly in contrast to the subjective nature of the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the board.&rdquo;  There is an inherent contradiction in the use of the two phrases in the same section of the Act.  This will be bad legislation if we allow it to go through.  By leaving the phrase there, we weaken the legislation and leave a barrier to its operation.  We allow the opinion of the board to intrude on the <Col N="2001" /> interpretation of what a reasonably prudent person would do.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's opinion is that it does not change the operation of the legislation, why does he have his mind set so strongly and firmly against it?  It is important to some of us and, in the words of the Minister, does not change fundamentally the method of decision making.  If it is only a problem to those of us who spoke and in the view of the Minister does not change the rights of the people, we can all be winners by simply allowing the amendment to go <Col N="2002" /> through.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and not to oppose it.</P>

      <P>The criteria for obtaining legal advice in civil matters are set out in section 26.  Subsection (2) precludes the board from providing individuals with advice on criminal law matters except where the advice sought concerns the procedures by which legal aid may be obtained under the Criminal Justice Legal Aid Act, 1962.  Subsection (3) provides for an exception in the case of any complainant in a prosecution for the offence of rape under common law, or under section 2 of the Criminal Law Rape Act, 1981, or of aggravated sexual assault under section 3, or of rape under section 4, of the Criminal Law Rape (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The effect of the proposed amendment would be to extend legal advice to the complainant in a prosecution for the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge under section 1 or section 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, or of incest under section 1 or section 2 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908. The amendment is cast along the lines suggested by Senator Honan on Committee Stage.  I thank her for bringing this matter to my attention.</P>

I am pleased to say that it was and the amendment can now be introduced.  It is important that we send out a signal to victims of incest and victims of defilement cases which involve young girls under 15 years of age that we are prepared to extend free legal advice to them, as is the case for complainants under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935 and section 1 and section 2 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  I am pleased that the Minister has brought this amendment through and shown that his thinking is in line with ours on this matter.  This amendment had support from all sides of the House.

Following the recent double debacle in the Office of the Attorney General, it is worth making such a statement.

It is very important that this amendment has been included.  I hope it will not be long before the complainant in all rape trials, who is a witness in these cases, has independent legal representation.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage the House accepted the amendment by Senator Norris which had the effect of automatically extending legal aid under the Bill to cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and tribunals hearing social welfare appeals.  Amendment No. 14 would have the effect of reversing that decision.  The decision to proceed with this amendment has not been taken lightly by me or the Government.  It is a <Col N="2007" /> decision based on careful consideration of the facts, including the fact that no responsible Government could accept a situation where a good deal of the Legal Aid Board's resources, 95 per cent of which are at present directed to and needed for family law cases, should at once be directed to legal representation before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and social welfare appeals tribunals.</P>
      <P>It must also be remembered that the formality and expense of legal representation before tribunals is being questioned widely by members of the public, interest groups and, not least, political parties themselves.  The purpose of tribunals is to provide alternative forms of dispute resolution which are cheaper, quicker, more accessible and less formal than the courts.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Employment Appeals Tribunal is concerned, it was never the intention that it should be flooded with legal representation, making it more formal and its hearings longer and more expensive.  It is the widely held view of representatives of both employers and employees that legal representation before the Employment Appeals Tribunal has increased to an extent that was never envisaged on the setting up of that tribunal.  Legal representation at social welfare appeals tribunals may not have increased to the same extent as appears to be the case with the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>A major problem, however, is how legal representation could be contained if legal aid were available as a matter of course.  I am in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Social Welfare to see what can and should be done with the problem before extra State funding for legal aid might be channelled for tribunal cases.  In our neighbouring jurisdiction legal aid is not generally available before tribunals and the matter is one which has received some attention in a recent consultation paper on which the views of people have been sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2008" /> On Committee Stage I indicated that the Legal Aid Board provided legal representation in 2,411 cases in 1993.  In the same year the Employment Appeals Tribunal heard 5,710 cases.  In 910 of these cases the employee was legally represented.  Had legal aid been available, it is estimated that the vast majority of those 910 cases would have been legally aided and, consequently, the board's caseload would have increased by 38 per cent.  The board would not have been able to deal with that number of cases without a major disruption of its capacity to deal with family law cases.</P>
    <P>In the same year social welfare appeals tribunals decided on 14,115 appeals.  The overwhelming majority of individuals involved in those cases would have qualified for legal aid had it been available.  Any need to provide legal representation in even a small proportion of that large number of cases would wipe out the capacity of the board to deal with family law cases. What we would have is a picture of chaos in which the board would be unable to deal with any case at all within a reasonable time, be it a family law case or a tribunal case.  The combined effect of labour and social welfare cases on the board would increase by upwards of six times its existing workload.  To cope with the work, funding for extra staff and premises would have to increase to up to £20 million or more compared with the present, albeit much increased funding of £6.2 million.  It is no surprise, therefore, that successive Ministers with responsibility for legal aid and successive Governments have been unable to agree to the extension of legal aid to tribunal cases.</P>
    <P>The priority at present is to ensure we have a nationwide legal aid service which is reasonably accessible to clients and that waiting lists can be kept to an absolute minimum.  The board must, as a priority, be in a position to deal effectively with family law cases.  Having said that, I should point out that legal advice on labour and social welfare law matters is available under the scheme at present <Col N="2009" /> and legal aid is available where court proceedings become involved.  The Bill, on the basis of my amendment, would allow legal aid to be extended to tribunals by Ministerial order at a time when it can be said that the financial and structural arrangements are in place and when it can also be said that there is public acceptance for that type of expenditure, given the other demands on legal aid and on the Exchequer generally.</P>
    <P>My commitment to the development of legal aid is a matter of record.  In 1994 the number of law centres increased from 16 to 22.  In 1995 the number increased to 25 and the 1995 Estimates allow for further expansion.  Since 1993 staff numbers have increased from 99 to 204.  The number of solicitor staff has increased from 39 to 75.  The number of support staff, that is those in administrative grades, increased from 60 to 129. Exchequer funding in 1992 was £2.7 million.  This year it is £6.2 million.  By any standards these are extraordinary increases and they facilitated a major development of the services of the Legal Aid Board.  These developments are aimed at ensuring that individuals who are entitled to legal aid are provided with it within a reasonable time and that they do not have to travel long distances to obtain it.</P>
    <P>A measure of the success of the extra funding of the board is indicated to a large extent by the reduction in waiting lists in law centres.  In early 1993 the waiting period in half of the board's centres was between one and seven months.  In these centres the waiting period is now one month or less.  In the remaining half of the centres in 1993, the waiting period ranged between eight and 14 months.  Now in all but one of the remaining half of the centres, the waiting period ranges between three and seven months.</P>
    <P>Those developments have helped to address the problems of persons who in the main seek recourse to the courts for maintenance orders for themselves and their children, for barring orders to protect them from violence in the home, for <Col N="2010" /> child custody orders and decrees of judicial separation.  After years of stagnation in which the Legal Aid Board was starved of additional funding, the board is now in a position to develop and reach out to all those in need of legal representation for family law cases.</P>
    <P>The progress now being made has not been made without significant additional funding from the Exchequer, but those resources are not unlimited. They simply cannot be increased sixfold in the immediate future to deal with tribunals. No Government could accept that demand and this Government is simply not in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee and Senator O'Toole would appear to appreciate the nature of our problem.  Their amendment would have the effect of removing social welfare tribunals from the scope of the statutory scheme, at least for the time being.  That amendment would undoubtedly lessen the quite dramatic impact of Senator Norris' Committee Stage amendment.  I must, however, emphasise that the immediate inclusion now of even the Employment Appeals Tribunal would result in large increases in waiting lists and would divert the board's limited resources away from its primary focus.</P>
    <P>The fact that over the years, the legal content of cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunal appears to have increased is of concern.  In so far as legal aid may be involved, I am prepared to review the position, in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  If a structured approach can be developed, it may be possible to extend legal aid to certain of such cases, depending on how the current development programme of the Legal Aid Board works out and also on the Exchequer position.</P>
    <P>That is as far as I can go on the matter at present.  I ask the House to support my amendment and to accept the reality of the situation as I have outlined it.  I am not, regrettably, in a position to accept amendment No. 15.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should explain for the benefit of the House how Senator O'Toole and I came to propose amendment No. 15.  I initially supported Senator Norris' Committee Stage amendment, which the Minister is now opposing.  Therefore, in a sense I am now changing my position on the social welfare tribunal proposal.  I am doing so because the Minister explained in the interim that the social welfare tribunal legislation as it presently stands and the provisions under it do not involve a significant amount of legal proceedings as such.  The original amendment would open the door and bring the law into a situation where it is currently not that significant, and that was not part of our original intention.  I was persuaded by that argument, subsequently presented by the Minister.  It is also an indication of the commitment of Senator O'Toole and I to fiscal rectitude, or at least a degree of fiscal responsibility.  It is not part of our purpose to be opening the coffers of the State in any irresponsible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, am prepared to withdraw the type of proposal I initially spoke for on Committee Stage of this Bill. However, I do make the fundamental distinction between the social welfare tribunal proposal and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  In the light of what the Minister said, the Employment Appeals Tribunal has become a major centre for legal disputation.  That may be regrettable.  I share the view that we are in many respects far to litigious and it would be desirable not to have that tribunal virtually turned into an alternative <Col N="2012" /> court.  I listened with interest to the Minister's observation that this is not the case in a neighbouring jurisdiction. I see no reason why it has to be the case in our jurisdiction.  I, for one, would support any Government proposals to try to ensure that the Employment Appeals Tribunal was not a legal forum, but it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that recourse to legal support in the Employment Appeals Tribunal is rising rapidly.  That may be regrettable, but it means that those who are not able to afford it are discriminated against even more than if there was only occasional recourse to these tribunals.  The purpose behind the original amendment was to ensure as far as possible equity and fairness and not have one side being able to draw on legal advice while another side was not able to afford it.  That sort of equity is fundamentally compatible with basic fairness.  If the situation is becoming worse, it enhances the urgency of trying to redress that matter.</P>
    <P>One can debate or discuss at length the number of cases that are likely to be involved &mdash; these could be matters of observation and opinion to some extent &mdash; but unless the Minister can convince me that the current manner in which the Employment Appeals Tribunal operates is equally fair to all those bringing a case before that tribunal, especially when dismissal from a job is so central to the existence of a number of those involved &mdash; and even more so if they cannot afford the cost of legal aid in the appeal while the other side can &mdash; I would have no alternative but to press ahead with this amendment.  This is the basic reason for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to re-emphasise the points that were made by Senator Lee.  Both Senator Lee and I gave much thought to this amendment before we put it down and we put it to the Minister in the nature of a compromise that could be dealt with.  It was made clear to us by the Minister, and I accept this completely, that the number of cases involved in the social welfare tribunals during the course of a year are enormous. <Col N="2013" /> Were it to be the case that legal advice could be given there, I accept that the tribunal might have huge queues and costs.  While saying that, I do not for one moment accept that the vast majority of applicants would require legal aid.  I also recognise that lawyers are involved in only a few social welfare appeals cases.  They are normally conducted without lawyers being involved and I fully approve of that.</P>
      <P>However, it may happen that lawyers might be necessary in the more complicated cases, which is why we initially supported Senator Norris' amendment. However, in trying to reach a position that the Minister could find as a compromise, I would point out there are a much smaller number of cases involved in the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Many people involved in those situations would be members of unions or similar organisations which would give them representation anyway. Other people would not be outside the net either.  They would still have some element of money to seek support.</P>
      <P>I would prefer it if lawyers were not let anywhere near the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the social welfare tribunal.  I would feel happier if the Minister could bring forward legislation that would exclude lawyers completely from the Employment Appeals Tribunal and that would be my preferred option.  However, that option is not available to us and it is not up to us to do that.  That tribunal seemed to me to be a domestic tribunal.  People who have had experience of the Employment Appeals Tribunal would be well aware that there is nothing as moving or as cruel as seeing somebody who would not be very articulate and would not have had great experience of dealing or coping with a stressful situation finding themselves, after having being sacked by a large multinational and taking a case against it for unfair dismissal, lined up against a senior or junior counsel or a solicitor and trying to cope with cross examination from those people.  That is grossly unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2014" /> I recognise that under section 27(2)(b) of the Bill the Minister is allowed to extend the scope of the Bill in various ways.  I am sorry that I unavoidably missed the Minister's contribution on his amendment.  Section 27(2)(b) states that the section applies to all civil proceedings &ldquo;conducted in any court or before any tribunal for the time being prescribed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order under this section&rdquo;.  That means that the Minister has the power, by statutory instrument or regulation, to include the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the scope of this Bill should he wish to so do.  I also recognise and accept that the tribunal is not excluded under the exclusion list in the other section.  It is within the Minister's authority to include the EAT.  I am not sure if social welfare tribunals are also envisaged under section 27(2)(b).</P>
    <P>Having said that, the difficulty which remains for us is: how can we drop somebody in it in an unfair dismissals case?  We felt that this would be a very small pressure on the centres, if the 15,000 annual social welfare cases were excluded, leaving the 600 or 700 cases which would come before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, only a proportion of which would qualify for legal aid under the other exclusion clause.  It is reasonable to exclude one and include the other.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment, as he has indicated, I will have no option but to support what was agreed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I oppose the amendment proposed by the Minister.  Senator Norris and I had similar amendments on Committee Stage.  The amendments which were made gave effect to putting this into the legislation.  I am somewhat confused because when I lost a vote on Committee Stage it was pointed out to me that I was not permitted to re-enter an amendment on Report Stage but the Minister apparently can do so.  I would have thought that when the House has made a decision on such a matter it <Col N="2015" /> should be accepted.  I know that there is a three month period after which the Minister can then reject it.  However, I fail to understand how if the House has decided something, the Minister has the right to try to reverse that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  As Senator O'Toole said, the Bill enables the Minister to include these tribunals under the scope of the civil legal aid scheme by order.  That was our specific objective in tabling this amendment. The Minister did not indicate that he was not going to do that.  However, all I can read from the fact that he is now removing the specific requirement for the board to provide representation for people before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and social welfare tribunals is that he does not intend to expand the scope of the board because if he did he would have accepted the amendment and would not be trying to reverse the decision of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Minister made great play on Committee Stage and today of family law cases.  I passionately believe that cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunals and social welfare tribunals are the most vital family law cases.  If a family has no income, I do not know what chance it has to have any kind of a lifestyle.  The only solution which we are offering is that when they get into serious marital difficulties we will be able to provide them with civil legal aid to process their divorce cases, at the risk of losing their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about social welfare cases &mdash; the poorest of the poor in this country.  In order to qualify for social welfare, in the main, one must have little or no income.  We are saying that we will let people get into as much difficulty as possible.  It has been proven that when families find themselves in very difficult circumstances it can lead to separation <Col N="2016" /> or violence in the family.  Pressures such as lack of income lead to the disruption of families.  If the Minister wants to limit the description of family law cases to cases dealing with judicial separation or barring orders, then let him call it that.  However, I believe that employment appeals and social welfare cases are entitled to legal representation if they need it.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that 14,115 cases should have an automatic right to legal representation &mdash; they do not and they will not.  Most of these cases are dealt with by letter and only a small minority of cases, particularly in relation to social welfare, even request an oral hearing.  In some of those cases the board may decide, using the discretion with which the Minister has empowered it under this legislation, not to grant legal aid. That is the board's right.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair in matters of social welfare legislation, which is extremely complex and a legal maze, to tell people who probably have minimal levels of education &mdash; it has been proven that those with limited education are those who become unemployed &mdash; and are the most disadvantaged in society to bat it out with civil servants and their legal advisers, should they be there.</P>
    <P>My colleagues made the case in relation to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and I will not delay unnecessarily on that.  However, a Minister for Equality and Law Reform is saying that he will not grant equality of representation to someone who has to appear before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which, I understand, is a legal forum.  If the Minister is not happy for the Employment Appeals Tribunal to have legal representation, then he should change that and not allow them to have legal representation if he is not going to grant it to somebody whose job is at risk.  I feel very strongly about this and it is not a political issue.  Senator Neville may smirk at that but the bulk of people with whom I deal are social welfare cases.</P>

      <P>I do not mind interruptions but I will not tolerate sniggering at people who are less well off than the Members of this House.  I say this on behalf of the people whom I represent and, I would have hoped, on behalf of the people whom the Minister represents.</P>
      <P>If I have to drag bodies out of anywhere to get the Minister's proposal reversed, I am prepared to do so.  I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, not to push this wrong decision.  The House made a decision on this.  I ask him to abide by that and to extend this facility to those who are surely entitled to the best representation which a pseudo or supposedly socialist Government can provide.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what Senator McGennis said.  The vast majority of social welfare appeals cases would not need legal aid because many of them, as Senator McGennis said, are decided by letter and very few go to an oral hearing.  Legal aid would be necessary for a small number of cases.  As Senator McGennis said, we are dealing with people who are very financially deprived and we should give them legal assistance when they need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt that the Minister might accept the amendment put down by the two Independent Members in relation to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  FLAC sent us information which indicated that the vast majority of cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunal would be very straightforward cases dealing with issues of entitlements and would not involve complex legal arguments.  In <Col N="2018" /> 1993 only 936 cases were considered unfair dismissals, of which 439 were represented by a barrister or solicitor.  That left 500 cases where people obviously could not afford legal services themselves. Those would be the only people who would be likely to qualify on a means test for legal aid, so we are not talking about a huge number of cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say social welfare cases and those going before the Employment Appeals Tribunal were entitled to <Col N="2019" /> obtain legal advice from law centres and that free legal aid could be extended by ministerial order to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the social welfare appeals tribunals when the financial and statutory provisions were in place.  We all acknowledge that this Minister is strongly committed to civil legal aid and has greatly improved the budget for it. Being responsible people, we accept funds are not unlimited and we must prioritise.  However, I am concerned that in certain cases, especially a small number before the EAT, people may not be in a position to afford representation. The Minister has clarified that should these cases go to court after the tribunal, civil legal aid will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable experience of accompanying people to social welfare tribunals and I have found the officials are fair, anxious to obtain the full facts of a case and conscious that those who make an appeal are under certain pressures because of their circumstances.  In most cases I have no reason to intervene, I simply sit with the person and support him.  To turn this into a legal situation would change the nature of the tribunals; they would almost be like courts.  It would be counter productive to have lawyers involved in such tribunals.  Making legal aid available would ensure that everyone entitled to such aid &mdash; about 14,000 people &mdash; would request it.</P>
      <P>It was implied that in some constituencies there would be no social welfare problems.  There are unemployed people in every constituency; I do considerable work with the unemployed and those on social welfare in my area. I am one of the few people here with direct experience of social welfare because I was receiving it when I was elected to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is more legal involvement on the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which is having a negative effect.  As the Minister said, that tribunal was never intended to be a court situation.  The members of the tribunal are extremely <Col N="2020" /> concerned about this and are looking &mdash; so far unsuccessfully &mdash; at ways to roll this back.  We feel the informality which was originally supposed to be part of the tribunal has now been removed.</P>
    <P>The approach of the tribunal is to find the truth &mdash; not the legal truth as found in a court, which may be different to the truth in some circumstances.  For instance, a person may give evidence which in a court could be regarded as hearsay.  I want to know whether it is right or wrong, not whether it is hearsay. Sometimes when matters are investigated by allowing non-legal people to express themselves in their own way &mdash; as the EAT is meant to do, in an informal setting &mdash; one arrives at the real truth, rather than using what is acceptable to be presented as evidence in a court of law.  That is one of the concerns.</P>
    <P>When I sit on the tribunal and a lawyer says something is hearsay or raises an objection, I say that unlike himself, the witness is not a legal person and should be let speak.  In fairness the various chairpersons on the tribunal, who are lawyers, do the same.  Often it is members of the tribunal who intervene in this way and they do so because they are conscious of the need to allow the situation to remain informal.  However, the position is changing and the tribunal is anxious to reverse that change.</P>
    <P>The Minister said 910 of the 5,710 cases before the tribunal last year had legal representation.  I am surprised the figure is so low; I thought it would be higher.  Contrary to what Senator Mulcahy said the last day, 95 per cent of those who come before the tribunal would be entitled to free legal aid if it was available, because they would have been dismissed from employment and living on social welfare.  They do not have jobs and would be entitled to civil legal aid.  Would it be surprising if the figure of 910 with legal representation doubled, trebled or quadrupled because of the developments in the tribunal?</P>
    <P>We on the EAT are in the process of rolling this back.  A decision as was taken the last day encourages and facilitates <Col N="2021" /> more legal involvement on the tribunal because whether we like it or not, people feel they are better represented with a lawyer.  Based on my seven years experience of the tribunal, I do not accept that.  Sometimes it can be to their detriment because one is always conscious of the need to listen fully to a person who does not have such back up.</P>
    <P>Under labour law, a person attending the Employment Appeals Tribunal is presumed unfairly dismissed unless the employer proves that he was fairly dismissed. The Minister said that the 910 people who were legally represented last year at the Employment Appeals Tribunal increased the cost by 38 per cent.  I challenge that because it will not stop at 910,1,800 or half the 5,710 cases. We are talking about more than 38 per cent; a conservative estimate would be between 50 per cent and 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>Under present circumstances we must accept that we do not have £20 million or £30 million to give to the civil legal aid scheme.  To do so would create chaos, as the Minister mentioned.  It would be counterproductive to allow the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the social welfare tribunals to come under this area.  It would destroy the situation which has been developed and improved by the Minister, who in two years has increased the moneys from approximately £2.7 million to over £6 million.  We will not have £20 million or £30 million when the Bill is passed.  Will the Minister for Finance give money to the scheme?  I do not think he will in the present climate, particularly after what happened last week.  What will be the consequences if he does not do so? There will be total chaos and the service which is developing will not be available to the people who now use it.</P>
    <P>Legal aid is not totally excluded from the tribunal.  The Minister has left it open for future consideration by ministerial order.  However, it will destroy the tribunal and the civil legal aid system as it stands at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator Neville said <Col N="2022" /> because he has direct experience of these matters and it is always instructive to listen to the type of speech we have just heard.  I also listened with some sympathy to the Minister.  I accept that he has pushed the boundaries out for free legal aid and that he has done a remarkable and efficient job in this area.  However, I am nailing my colours firmly to the mast and in so doing I am supported by the free legal advice centres and the Coolock community law centre.  The people briefing me are happy for me to continue along this line.</P>
      <P>As far as the budgetary cost and the drain on the Exchequer are concerned, those are problems which the Government must work out for itself.  I am entitled to promote the amendment which I initially promoted on Second Stage and if a sufficient number of Members support it, we are playing a democratic role in assisting the Government to prioritise things.  The Government and the Cabinet should take note of the unusual situation in which this House has a tangible, clear, direct and practical bearing on legislation as it goes through the Houses rather than pleading that there is a comparatively small amount of money available.  I accept that these are times when the Government must make some financial adjustments.  It would be an insult to the nature of democracy in this country if we were to feel inhibited by the sort of budgetary considerations which the Government has appropriately made and if we were negligent in our duty to represent the interests of all the citizens of this country in debate in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>Reference was made on a number of occasions to the Pringle Committee on Civil Legal Aid and the Pringle report. I will preface what I want to say by a quotation from the Pringle committee, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... in a comprehensive scheme, legal aid should be available for all types of civil proceedings.  There seems to us no logical basis on which any particular case category could be excluded. The merits of any case and the question <Col N="2023" /> of granting legal aid should be assessed, not by reference to the category to which it belongs, but by reference to the particular circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>That is the nub of the argument I will make.  It is still possible to sort out some of the cases and to apply certain specific tests so that people who should not morally be entitled to such aid do not get it.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of argument about figures and a further refinement of this argument took place this morning when the Minister indicated that 910 people were legally represented at the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I would like to consider this matter further.  On Committee Stage the Minister argued that the Employment Appeals Tribunal heard 5,710 cases in 1993 and he estimated that 99 per cent of these would qualify for legal aid.  However, it is not necessary to automatically assume that every case coming before the Employment Appeals Tribunal would require legal aid.  For example, 3,480 of those 5,710 cases were under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, on the question of whether the claimant was entitled to notice of dismissal or not.  From the experience of FLAC and the Coolock community law centre, I am told that it is reasonable to suppose that most of those claims would not involve complex legal arguments as they were dealing with straightforward issues of entitlement.  I realise, as I am making this case, that it has already been made in a shorter length of time by Senator Honan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>A merits test applied by the local law centre would eliminate many such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal need for legal aid at the Employment Appeals Tribunal is in the area of unfair dismissal claims, especially those involving complex issues such as the transfer of undertakings, regulations or insolvency and <Col N="2024" /> maternity matters.  In 1993 only 936 cases heard considered unfair dismissals and, of these, 439 were represented by a barrister and/or a solicitor.  This could indicate that almost half of the claimants are in a position to afford private legal services and therefore would in all likelihood not qualify on the means test for legal aid.  We dealt earlier this morning with this area when Senator O'Toole argued about the nature of the board's opinion.  This is the section of the Act which could be operated to exclude a considerable number of those people because a reasonable person could conclude or the board might have the opinion that they were in a position to afford them.</P>
    <P>The Minister also outlined the 1993 statistics for the social welfare appeals officers, who decided on 14,115 appeals in that year.  This seems to be a large number and one could be intimidated by it.  Yet when one looks closer, it is not as substantial as it appears at first sight.  A large proportion of these cases would not have had an oral hearing and would be decided on the facts.  For example, whether one passes a means test in order to qualify for unemployment assistance is a matter of fact, not law.  It is not necessary then to involve professional legal advice.</P>
    <P>As with the Employment Appeals Tribunal, there can be a need for legal arguments to be made at hearings before social welfare appeals officers. Most people will be familiar with the cases concerning arrears of social welfare payments due to married women as a result of discrimination contrary to European Union law.  Many of the concepts in the social welfare code have legal definitions such as &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; or &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; and claimants may need legal assistance where they have been refused payment on one of these grounds.  It is appropriate and proper that persons in those situations should receive such professional legal advice.</P>
    <P>Representation before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the social welfare appeals officers should be seen as part of an overall legal services packmen <Col N="2025" /> age and not in isolation.  For example, if the board had an educational role, the law centres could train welfare rights workers in local resource and citizens' information centres to provide assistance and representation in many of these cases.  When the Minister said in his initial contribution that he had spoken to some of his colleagues it seemed this was the direction in which he was making some tentative moves.  I would approve of that and I would encourage him to continue these moves in the event that the vote which is likely to be called on this is lost by those who wish to extend the services.  I hope that anything we do this afternoon will be seen as an encouragement to the Minister to move in this direction.  There is always the possibility, of course, that we may win the vote, which may not delight the Minister but will at least create an interesting situation.</P>
    <P>The board should have the competence to assess each individual application on its merits and decide whether legal aid is warranted.  In many cases, for example, where the issue of the case is a question of fact and not law, a referral to the local welfare rights officer may be appropriate.  A full legal services approach would encourage local resources citizens information centres to develop first year services in conjunction with the nearby law centre, thereby alleviating much of the prospective work load of the law centre.</P>
    <P>Both social security and employment law are complex areas with which lay people find it difficult to come to terms. Not only is there a large body of domestic legislation but there are many EU Directives affecting entitlements in these areas.  Dismissal from work and claiming social security payments are of great importance to those with limited means and therefore with limited access &mdash; if any access in some circumstances &mdash; to private legal services.  To date, these types of case have been excluded from the remit of legal aid and forced to rely on the services of voluntary organisations and the goodwill of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2026" /> Over many years working with the voluntary organisations I have had much contact with the legal profession. There are many honourable and excellent lawyers who frequently, in cases of merit, give their services free of charge to those who cannot afford it.  I could list a number of these people and I salute them.  I am sometimes critical of the legal profession but I am well aware that even before this legal aid situation was created, there were honourable and decent members of the profession who did good work.</P>

Senator Gallagher and the Minister are included in this, so also is Garrett Sheehan, who was remarkable for the work he did in the rather grimy circumstances of the Dublin District Courts.  I honour him for that.</P>
      <P>There are people who may be excluded under the operation of the law if the amendment is not accepted.  In addition, certain types of case will be excluded.  I remind the House of the quotation from the Pringle Committee with which I opened my contribution, where it states: &ldquo;legal aid should be available for all types of civil proceedings&rdquo;. It goes on to state, uncompromisingly and categorically: &ldquo;There seems no logical basis on which any particular case category could be excluded.&rdquo;  If the Bill is re-amended it will offend against this principle so clearly enunciated by the Pringle Committee in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>As many Senators have eloquently said why civil legal aid should be extended to those involved in employment tribunals I will not address the issue again.  Senator Neville made the important point both on Committee Stage and today, that since so many people, especially from the employer viewpoint, are now bringing legal experts with them to the Employment <Col N="2027" /> Appeals Tribunal, which did not anticipate becoming a legal forum, it is most unfortunate the Minister is unable to extend legal aid to the tribunal at present.</P>
      <P>In the area of family law I have, hopefully, terrorised various Ministers for many years on the subject of the terrible delays in the legal aid centres.  The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women states that 75 per cent of the clients of the law centres are women.  This is hardly surprising given that so many women in Ireland are engaged in home duties or are working in very lowly paid jobs.  They have very little in the way of income if they have to take cases on their own behalf.</P>
      <P>The long waiting lists and the lack of real access to legal aid impacted far more seriously on women than on anybody else in this country.  I am well aware of the importance of finance, but it is also important to remember that there were great delays in many law centres, in addition to the delay in these cases coming to court.  The Minister has made a big effort by increasing the number of centres and the number of people working there.</P>
      <P>However, it was not just a matter of the delay in justice, which was bad enough.  A very large number of these women required considerable courage, and in many instances physical courage, to continue these cases.  Only last night I was told of a woman who obtained a barring order where her husband and his brother broke into their house and beat up their 17 year old son so that he could get at her.  We are dealing not just with situations which have financial implications, although many of the cases before family courts are maintenance cases and so on, but with barring order cases, custody of children cases, applications for access to children and judicial separations.  In all these cases, many people are in constant danger from violent people living in their homes and they do not have the wherewithal to bring them to court to get them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2028" /> I have requested that barring orders be extended to include not only husbands but anybody who is violent in the home, such as co-habitees and sons.  The woman, being the smaller person, is usually the victim of the violence.  In view of this I am unable to support the excellent suggestion that the Employment Appeals Tribunal should be included.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of the means test, which stands at £6,200 at present, a very low figure.  Hopefully the Minister will do something about it in the near future.  The legal aid scheme &mdash; not the civil legal aid scheme &mdash; could save some money if soliciting was decriminalised again.  Legalising prostitution and decriminalising it are two different things.  While the ladies I know who have to go to court when they are arrested are grateful for legal aid, the gardaí would be happy if they had less involvement.  There is little knowledge to suggest that this legislation has been of any value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we opposed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I suggest that the Minister encourage his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to consider this area again.  He could tell her that she would be saving money which could then be applied to the civil legal aid cases.  We might then be in a position to bring more of these worthy cases under the Civil Legal Aid Board in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported the amendment that civil legal aid should be extended to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and to the Social Welfare Appeals Board.  I attended the House to listen carefully to ensure that my vote would follow on careful consideration of the issue.  I was most impressed with Senator McGennis as she appears to be very close to the whole area of employment and social welfare appeals.  I was especially impressed by her point that those most in need and having problems with social welfare are the very people <Col N="2029" /> who are losing their jobs.  Senator Norris then spoke of the need to prioritise. This area really presents the problem to the Minister.</P>
      <P>When it comes down to priorities, Senator Henry's point is one that must be taken into account.  She made the point that family law cases, maintenance orders, barring orders, custody of children and violence in the home take priority.  The Minister says that 95 per cent of civil legal aid goes to family law cases.  If we extend the aid with the best intentions in order to be fair to everybody, we will include the 910 out of 5,710 cases that applied in the Employment Appeals Tribune in 1993.  It seems that if civil legal aid is extended, it will swamp the cases that have top priority, the family law cases.  It is a priority we must face.  It appears to be one of the tough decisions that those who must take decisions in Government, in the Executive and in these Houses, must take.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we must create priorities. The State has had to decide on occasion to allocate more money to the blind than to the deaf.  That is not fair; it is a priority.  The State has decided to allocate more resources to the west than to the east.  That is not fair; it is creating priorities.  In this case the Minister decided to place family law cases at the top of the list of priorities and other cases will take second and third places. On that basis I have no choice but to support the Minister in the view that on this occasion he believes we are going to concentrate on those most in need. At this stage the resources should be allocated to family law cases.  Therefore, on that basis I will support the Minister's view that we should not include employment appeals or social welfare cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has promised a review in certain cases, depending on the situation &mdash; I think they were his words.  He also made the point on section 27, if I remember correctly, that there is the opportunity in that area too.  On that basis I will support the Minister and, therefore, I am not able to support the <Col N="2030" /> amendment to have the services extended to other areas that have been put forward with the best will and intentions in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever contribution I make today need not be lengthy as the arguments have been thoroughly versed, in particular the arguments in favour of the Fianna Fáil position made by Senator McGennis.</P>
      <P>However, I believe the Minister and the Government are out of line with public thinking on the issue.  There is a general need for a comprehensive scheme of free legal advice.  One of the most frequented set of tribunals are the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the social welfare appeals tribunals.  Unlike the Circuit Court, it does not take years to get a case heard in the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  First, one must make application within six months of being dismissed.  After that the time before being heard is relatively short.</P>
      <P>The argument the Minister advanced on Committee Stage and again today is not a valid one.  He tried to drown us with numbers, if I can use that phrase. He claimed there were so many cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunal that this would swamp resources and take money away from other required resources.  The fact of the matter is that most people in my experience &mdash; and I speak as a former vice-chairman of the Employment Appeals Tribunal &mdash; have the necessary means to obtain their own legal representation before the Employment Appeals Tribunal. A small minority of people would be involved &mdash; the underprivileged, the downtrodden, people without resources and information.  A relatively small minority of cases come before that tribunal without the assistance of a legal representative and who face on the other side, as was indicated on Committee Stage, a solicitor and barrister perhaps for the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the Employment Appeals Tribunal was and is supposed to be an informal tribunal.  Sometimes it is and I agree that is the way it was <Col N="2031" /> meant to be.  But surely no Government expects an ordinary member of the public &mdash; someone who did not benefit from a full education perhaps &mdash; to have the expertise, time or knowledge to delve into what is at this stage a fairly voluminous <i>corpus</i> of law, in terms of statutes, precedent at the tribunal and pertinent cases in the Circuit and High Courts, not just is Ireland but also in England, which can pertain and be relevant to a decision.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Minister's position today and on Committee Stage is that certain people will enter the Employment Appeals Tribunal without the assistance or protection of a lawyer in circumstances where such assistance and protection is vitally necessary.  I appreciate the sincerity of the argument advanced by Senators Henry and Quinn but I do not believe the Minister gave sufficient evidence to show that the priority would be taken away from family law cases if this new head of cases were also admitted.  If that occurred family law cases would continue to be dealt with and extra resources would have to be found to cover the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  We are talking about resources.  There is no point in the Minister bringing in a fancy Civil Legal Aid Bill and it falling at the first hurdle, which is money.</P>
    <P>In that regard, will the recently announced embargo on public service recruitment affect the employment of the proposed legal aid solicitors?  That would be a matter of concern to the entire House.  Again, if we bring in this legislation and do not have the solicitors, it hardly makes sense.  I honestly think the Minister is out of step and he should consider whether he will press his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this section has been interesting but there are certain points I want to make.  First, if Senator Norris bases his support on what is contained in the Pringle report. it stated, if I remember correctly, that all legal proceedings should be of equal <Col N="2032" /> value and should be given legal aid.  The fact is that a tribunal case and a social welfare appeal are not termed legal proceedings. By nature they are not legal proceedings and are not meant to be legal proceedings.  Because of those who require them, they are informal.  As Senator Neville rightly explained, the system allows people to speak their mind, not in a legalistic way but in a way that gets at the truth and finds out what is happening.  People who are not trained in the legal profession do not realise the significance of words used, or not used as the case may be, but may nevertheless have a valid claim.  The necessity to achieve justice and fairness by allowing a decision to be made on the basis of what people say, straight up, is more important than getting bogged down in technicalities.  That is what will happen if the Bill, as it now stands with that particular section, goes ahead.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the way we want to deal with things in society.  This is a broader issue.  We can say that the people most in need, those who are dependent on social welfare, should be given legal aid.  However, we must look at the role of the legal profession.  Are they to be dragged into everything?  Are we to get to a stage where we cannot open our mouths without a lawyer by our side?  Justice would not be served by doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take issue with some of Senator Mulcahy's comments.  He said the Government and the Minister were out of line on this issue.  No Minister could have done more for people requiring legal aid than the present Minister, Deputy Taylor.  He deserves great credit for not only getting the extra funds, which have not been considered a top priority by Governments, from the Department of Finance but for using them in a way which is best for those who need them most.  The Minister is not out of touch.  Perhaps Senator Mulcahy is out of line in saying that most people who go before the Employment <Col N="2033" /> Appeals Tribunal can afford legal representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I dispute that.  If legal representation was to be allowed for the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Minister conservatively estimates an increase of 38 per cent in the workload of the Legal Aid Board.  It has been my experience and that of Senator Neville that the vast majority of cases which go before the Employment Appeals Tribunal involve people who have been made unemployed or have been dismissed.</P>

      <P>They are unemployed and do not have the means by which they can take a case.  They may have lost their entire income.  It is sad that people do not realise the financial restraints that exist and the nature of which the Bill seeks to address.</P>
      <P>The country would be crazy if it brings lawyers into everything.  One cannot be a jack of all trades because one is, therefore, master of none.  I have studied employment law and social welfare law and they are very complicated. A solicitor is not always the best person to deal with those matters.</P>

      <P>A solicitor may be dealing with many other cases.  One really needs to build up an expertise in those areas of law if one is determined to handle them properly on behalf of those who seek help.  Trade union officials and people dealing with such cases on a day to day basis are better representatives for the people who need them than a lawyer might be.  For that reason we should leave the system as it is; it works very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at least 14,000 social welfare appeals per year.  If they were to qualify for legal aid, everybody would <Col N="2034" /> automatically appeal decisions.  Why not, as they would have nothing to lose? It would throw the legal aid system and the social welfare system into chaos.  In terms of the administration of social welfare there would be no certainty as to decisions.  The social welfare system is complicated enough without adding to it.  We would be better served by simplifying the social welfare system so that people would be more readily aware of their entitlements.  We should direct our energies to that end rather than further complicate a system which is already overpowering.</P>
    <P>Some of the earlier speakers talked about lawyers not being involved and how they would not be involved if they had their way.  What they go on to say is not only a contradiction in terms but is also counterproductive.  Those who need representation at Employment Appeals Tribunals and when seeking a review of a social welfare decision would not be best served by bringing in the legal profession.  A tribunal or a social welfare officer may not take kindly to the cases being presented by lawyers.  That is not the way we want to get at the truth and provide justice for those who need it.  I support the position of the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Senator Quinn that this is a question of priorities.  It is important to bear that in mind.  With regard to the case being made to try to extend the amount of moneys available, it is better to try to pinpoint the areas where the money would be most needed.  There is a need to provide enough moneys where questions of maintenance of spouses, barring orders, custody of children or judicial separations are involved.  These are most important areas.  However, that is not to minimise the importance of other areas.  If sufficient funds were available I would be happy to go along with the provision of moneys for employment appeals or social welfare appeals.  At present the Minister is correct to pinpoint specific areas which require improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2035" /> When I was in Opposition I paid tribute to the Minister on a number of occasions for a lot of his work.  He was endeavouring to do a lot of difficult work in an area which had not received the required attention, funds or sense of purpose.  The Minister gave that direction and sense of purpose.  I am happy to repeat what I said in Opposition now that 1 am in Government with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis made her points eloquently and I understand there are people who have difficulty presenting their case at a social welfare or employment appeal.  In another regard people who have medical problems and have to go before medical referees often, of necessity, require independent medical advice to counteract the medical referee. I hope there will be a set of priorities and this is something we should work towards in the long term.</P>
    <P>A decision has to be made now about what we are going to do.  The Minister's proposal is reasonable and I fully support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators who have contributed to this interesting and constructive debate.  I know they are all well motivated in what they seek to achieve.  In one sense we all want to achieve the same thing &mdash; the greatest possible expansion and extension of this service as soon as that can be achieved.  Senator Quinn and Senator Henry hit the nail on the head. We are talking ultimately about a question of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the budgetary costs &mdash; I did not quite catch the way he put it &mdash; having to work out for themselves or something to that effect.  The interesting point about the situation we are debating is that it does not involve any budgetary cost at all.  No matter what amendment is agreed or lost today, it does not effect the budget one iota.  It will not produce one single penny more in the money available to <Col N="2036" /> run the legal aid service.  Therein lies the problem.</P>
    <P>If all we had to do was to bring in a provision that the Legal Aid Board may deal with this and that in addition and that, <i>ipso facto</i>, there came with that the money to fund it, we would all be agreed.  None of us would have any problem at all.  The budget of the Legal Aid Board, remains the same, and that is the difficulty I have to face in the real world.  It is true that the much increased fund I have succeeded in building up for the Legal Aid Board over the last couple of years has had major effects.  The waiting lists have been drastically reduced, but there are still waiting lists. It is not as though anybody in any legal aid office has nothing to do; far from it. There is still a large burden of work in the family law area, even as we sit here in this House.</P>
    <P>When this matter was before the House on Committee Stage, I stated that I had under review and hoped to introduce shortly an increase in the eligibility qualifications for people wishing to access the legal aid service. Coincidentally, I got final approval for that from the Department of Finance this morning.  I am happy to be able to tell the House that I will be increasing the eligibility qualification for people who wish to access the Legal Aid Board's services by 18.5 per cent.  The effect of that is that there is now a large number of people who need to access the Legal Aid Board service, who have been disqualified from doing so until now and will now be qualified as a result.  It is understandable that this will <i>ipso facto</i> put an additional burden on the existing resources of the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>The Department, at my request, researched what the likely increase would be if I were simply to allow Employment Appeals Tribunal cases to qualify for Legal Aid Board assistance. The figure they came up with was 910 cases, which represents 38 per cent of the existing capacity of the Legal Aid Board, not counting the new work that will come from the increase in qualifications. <Col N="2037" /> Senator Neville said that this is a gross understatement and that it could perhaps be even double that.  Taking it as a conservative figure, the effective increase in the workload of the Legal Aid Board by 38 per cent at one foul swoop would throw the operation of the system into complete and total disarray. It would be impossible for anybody to get advice or attention within anything like a reasonable time.  That is not to say there is no merit in the need at some stage for representation before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I was at pains to point out in my statement that when the Legal Aid Board builds up and the structures and resources are there, within whatever period it may take, it will be possible to extend by order the operation of the Legal Aid Board to tribunal cases.  It is my intention to build up the board as best I can, depending on budgetary constraints year on year, and I have taken the power in section 27 (2) (b) of the Bill that would enable me to make such <Col N="2038" /> an order without having to trouble this House by coming back to it.  It is my intention to do that when the resources, structures and funds are there to do it.</P>
    <P>I urge Senators to recognise that we are not conducting this debate in a vacuum. We must have regard to the resources that are actually there.  The priorities which I have settled upon are the correct priorities for the moment.  When resources increase, the eligibility of other priorities will come into play and we must decide what they will be.  The question of tribunals will be high on those priorities, although there could be other excluded categories of claims which one would have to look at and balance where one would go.  I concede that the question of tribunals, in some circumstances, would be an important priority but now is not the time.  I ask Senators to accept my bona fides on that and to accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection 4 of section 28 preclude the Legal Aid Board from granting a legal aid certificate if the applicant is acting on behalf of a group of persons having the same interest in the proceedings, or the board is of the opinion that the intended proceedings constitute a test case.  These exclusions exist in the present non-statutory scheme.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage a number of Senators expressed concern about the fact that the Bill precluded the possibility of the board involving itself in test cases and class actions.  The effect of amendment No. 20 is to allow the Minister by order to bring such cases within the scope of the statutory scheme.  That is a considerable advance on what is contained in the Bill as it stands.  I agree with those Senators who are of the view that the Bill should not completely preclude the possibility of legal aid being made available for such cases at some time in the future.  I hope Senators will support my amendment which goes some way towards meeting their concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government amendments Nos. 16 and 22 are consequential on the acceptance of amendment No. 20.  Amendment No. 20 contains some useful redrafting of what constitutes class actions and test cases and it would help to clarify the matter in that regard. Amendment No. 17 proposed by Senator McGennis and Senator Rory Kiely would have the effect of automatically extending legal aid under the Bill to test cases and class actions.  I am not <Col N="2040" /> disposed to accepting such an arrangement because the full implications would have to be worked out having regard to, among other matters, the impact on the limited resources of the board and the Exchequer position.</P>

      <P>I have one question for the Minister although I am probably out of order.  A legal aid certificate is mentioned in amendment No. 22.  At the launch of the Women's Aid document, &ldquo;Zero Tolerance&rdquo;, a few days ago and in a submission made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, mention was made of the fact that women in situations of domestic violence cannot get a legal aid certificate.  Their situation is not considered an emergency.  I do not know where I can raise this matter so I am bringing it to the Minister's attention now.  It is hard to understand how women in such circumstances would not be in emergency situations.  Perhaps the Minister would explain what constitutes an emergency for a legal aid certificate.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for accepting my amendments.  With regard to Senator Honan's query, the position, as I understand it, is that in emergency cases there is no question but that a woman is entitled to and receives a legal aid certificate straight away if there is any danger to life or limb or anything of <Col N="2041" /> that nature for her or her child.  Emergency situations are given immediate, top priority and that is standard procedure in all law centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is a rather good proposal.  I also wish to be associated with the expressions of congratulation and appreciation to the Minister for having secured the 18.5 per cent increase he announced earlier. However, that in itself shows how dependent one is on the success of a Minister at any given time in extracting support from the Government and from the Department of Finance.  It is the first time in several years that an adjustment has been made.  The purpose of this amendment was to ensure regular annual adjustment rather than to leave one dependent on the success of a Minister which may or may not occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I congratulate the Minister I am sorry that this amendment is not being pressed more forcefully.  If legal aid is to be taken seriously on an ongoing institutionalised basis and if it is not to be disproportionately dependent on the goodwill of individual Ministers, these institutional requirements should be built into the legislation.  With <Col N="2044" /> that expression of regret, I congratulate the Minister once more on his individual achievement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Senator Lee's regret is misplaced.  If this amendment was accepted, the Minister would review the means test by application to the consumer price index.  In fact, the increase I just accorded is a good deal in excess of the consumer price index.  I have increased it by 18.5 per cent and if the amendment applied the increase would have been between 14 and 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 30, after &ldquo;subsection (3)&rdquo; to add &ldquo;, subject to the proviso that a law centre cannot provide legal aid to more than one party to a dispute&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This returns to old ground.  To be fair I thought the Minister made a good case on Committee Stage on why we should not proceed with this amendment.  It was not an entirely convincing case but it was a good one.  Our purpose was to try to ensure that the board would establish and maintain a panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument for the amendment is that two people who are party to the same dispute, particularly the woman, should not find themselves in a potentially awkward situation at the same law <Col N="2045" /> centre as the other party.  The argument against the amendment is that in the country centres are so far apart that sending people to other centres is not realistic.  We had some discussion on geographical matters.  Amendment No. 27 relates to the same concept.  Our wish is that a panel of solicitors would be established in the vicinity of the law centre and cases would be contracted out to them.  Then the danger that this type of unfortunate personal contact which could be demoralising to one of the parties involved would not arise.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 26, 27 and 28 are linked.  I can see better arguments to the contrary than I have heard on some of the issues we have already passed but there is a substantive case here which merits careful consideration.  If it is the case that those panels &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be established as distinct from &ldquo;may&rdquo; be established, it would ensure that this potentially unfortunate situation would not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I see the problems which could arise because of distance.  There could be a legal aid centre in a small town and the next legal aid centre could be 30 miles away.  There may be other solicitors in the town but they might not want to take on family law cases.  Despite the Minister's desire to have a panel of private solicitors in the town, he would be unable to get them to serve because I do not think they are obliged to serve on these panels.  Senator Lee has wisely explained that we have seen the problems the Minister has with this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was impressed by the argument advanced by Senator Lee, and certainly by the latter part of his contribution. I said on Second Stage that the Minister should set up panels of solicitors on a countrywide basis.  He should not rely so much on this obsession with employing more and more civil servants as seems to be the direction in which the civil legal aid system is going.  I will not repeat my comments on that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="2046" /> On the issue of whether one legal aid centre can or should be able to act for both sides, I disagree with Senator Lee and agree with the Minister's thinking. It is not just a question of practice; it is also a question of &mdash; to use a much abused word &mdash; ethics.  Both the solicitor and barrister professions proceed on the basis of ethics and trust.  This is an important concept in the legal profession. Much of the business done in courthouses, offices or over the telephone is held in trust and a word is taken on trust.  Within both the Law Society and the Bar Council, there is a remedy when the concept of trust is breached.  The concept of confidentiality is allied to this.</P>
    <P>In firms of solicitors where there are several partners, it is not unknown for two partners to be on different sides of a case.  It is obviously much easier in a large firm where there is a large number of partners and there would not necessarily be a close interaction in relation to any one case.  Similarly in the Law Library two barristers could sit beside each other at the same desk.  Such is the level of trust that one can leave one's papers on the desk and be quite confident that nobody from the other side of the case will spy on them.  If trust and confidentiality are removed from the legal system, one is left with little else. Once suitable arrangements for interviews and so on are in place, there is no reason a law centre cannot act for both sides.  This is not just a matter of practice but one of principle.  Reluctantly I am not in favour of Senator Lee's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Senator Lee's point about the awkwardness of having two people arriving at one centre and the forced personal contact that would entail.  I agree with him even more on the point of law.  I would be concerned about certain law centres where there is only one solicitor.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to act in family law cases and adequately represent both sides and that is where I would be concerned.  The sad reality is that solicitors <Col N="2047" /> must negotiate who will get what in terms of access, custody, maintenance and so on.  My only cause of concern would be that some people would be caught in a situation where the local legal aid centre has only one solicitor, yet both people are entitled to legal aid.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has already opened many centres.  When I spoke on this issue previously, there were no centres in my region.  There is now a centre in Monaghan and another in Cavan.  There is also a centre in Dundalk, County Louth, and they are all within reach.  I accept that it is much easier now to go to a separate legal centre. I also accept that a panel of solicitors will be available to do such work. The practical fallout will be that the difficulty to which I have referred earlier will be reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>To take up Senator Gallagher's point, it would be out of the question for a solicitor in a one solicitor law centre to act on behalf of both parties. That could not possibly arise.  As a result of increased staffing in the law centres in the last couple of years, only one centre is a one solicitor operation. All other law centres have more than one solicitor.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 26 and 28 require that in all cases where both parties are legally aided, they must be represented by separate law centres and were discussed previously on Committee Stage. I regret I cannot accept the amendments because it would not be in the interests of clients, the efficiency generally of law centres or the best use of the resources of the law centres.  It could mean in many cases that applicants for legal aid would have to travel long distances to a law centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any fears regarding possible breaches of confidentiality, as Senator Mulcahy rightly pointed out, are groundless.  I understand that the Law Society of Ireland has issued no directive or guidelines on the matter in so far as private practice is concerned.  It is fair to assume that no particular difficulties have come <Col N="2048" /> to notice.  There is no rule of law on the matter either.  The law centres as a professional agency will, where necessary, make arrangements to ensure that where, through its solicitors, it represents both parties to a dispute, the representation will be on a completely separate basis and that confidentiality will be maintained in each case by the solicitors concerned.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this is the best way to proceed and the best way to use the resources of the board.  I am sure that any necessary and appropriate steps will be taken to ensure that warring parties will not meet in the waiting room of a law centre and that appointments will be made at times to meet the needs of that situation.  For those reasons, I regret I cannot accept amendments Nos. 26 and 28.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not suggesting that the legal people involved would be in breach of any of the ethical standards which they observe so conscientiously.  I was concerned about the human dimension whereby people who do not want to see each other might meet, which could happen by oversight or by accident and which may have traumatic personal consequences on the weaker personality involved.  I am reassured by the Minister, in so far as I have allowed myself to be, that warring parties will not find themselves face to face in unfortunate circumstances.  That is far more important to me than the technicalities on the legal side.  I noticed Senator Gallagher said that there will be panels of solicitors, although I hope I have not misquoted her.  Senator O'Toole and I had in mind panels of solicitors which would help to avoid any danger of such an unscheduled meeting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 34, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> Senator Henry and I are in the same position in our collaborative endeavour, although I must admit I felt like replying to her the last time she seconded my amendment.  Senator O'Toole and I intended this to be a constructive proposal stating &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo;. It does not necessarily oblige the board to establish extensive panels.  The idea of a panel of solicitors and a panel of barristers seems to us to be an eminently sensible one which the board should be obliged to establish rather than leaving it to its discretion to do so. How it would establish a panel, how elaborate it would be or its skill would obviously be entirely for its judgment. The principle involved is important and we hope to help it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I am totally behind Senator Lee as regards this amendment.  I have often had difficulty with the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I am sure that when the Minister replies he will explain why he favours the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>While this seems like a minor amendment, it is important as it concerns the way we will run the legal aid scheme.  I am not sure how the Minister intends to develop it in the future. He is employing more solicitors, which is good, but there is the question of taxation and people are being asked to pay more tax.  I do not know if the Minister has done any studies on whether the Legal Aid Board would be more efficient if it were run by full-time solicitors or if greater use was made of independent solicitors and barristers.  I believe it would be more efficient if greater use was made of the outside services of solicitors.  It would obviate the need to set up personal structures and so on and to employ more public servants. For that reason, I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of whether the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; are used, <Col N="2050" /> when a panel was in operation in my area it worked very well.  If a legal centre has only one solicitor, it is helpful to know that the other party can be represented in the locality by a private practitioner.  Solicitors operating in legal aid centres have built up a marvellous expertise in family law which is hard for a practitioner dealing with other matters to compete with.  My experience of a panel which the Minister provided to relieve a backlog of cases in previous times was that it worked effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 30 (1) provides for legal aid and advice to be made available through law centres or through solicitors or barristers whose names are entered on panels established and maintained by the Legal Aid Board for that purpose.  Subsection (3) provides that the board may establish and maintain two such panels one to be known as the solicitors' panel and the other as the barristers' panel.  I indicated on Committee Stage that this amendment would compel the board to establish and maintain two panels but the reality is that panels have been established and maintained against a background in which there is co-operation between members of both branches of the legal profession in the provision of legal aid and advice under the scheme operated by the board.  That situation can continue only against a background in which the co-operation of members of both branches of the profession with the board continues.  I am satisfied it would be presumptuous to take that co-operation for granted and assume that the board could always establish and maintain panels of barristers and solicitors. Subsection (1) addresses the reality of the situation, although I hope there would never be difficulty in organising panels of solicitors or barristers.  The best course, therefore, is to leave subsection (3) as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the point made by Senator Mulcahy, I have always taken the view that private practitioners have a role to play in complementing the mainstream of the legal aid service which is and will <Col N="2051" /> continue to be run by the law centres. There is a complementary role in particular cases and in certain areas for private practitioners and for that reason I introduced that scheme and will continue to review its progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">

      <P>I would like to briefly comment on the Minister's observations. He has taken a responsible attitude to this and I will defer to his judgment &mdash; it is an area in which I am not an authority &mdash; on the most effective way to employ the expertise of the legal profession for the achievement of these objectives.  I was a little taken aback after we paid tribute to the high standards of the legal profession to hear the Minister use the word &ldquo;presumptuous&rdquo; to designate the possibility or to describe the assumption that one could rely on a willingness to co-operate in the legal profession in general terms towards the achievement of so admirable an objective.  I hope the Minister will take on board Senator Gallagher's observations which express my sentiments admirably if only I had been able to do so in that way.</P>

Leaving <Col N="2052" /> aside what may have been critical comments made by Senator McGennis and myself on Second Stage and Committee Stage, I know the Minister and his staff invested an enormous amount of time and commitment in this legislation. Ireland will be a better place following the enactment of this welcome legislation. In terms of accepting amendments, perhaps the Minister might have a word with the ever-flexible Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who seems to be more than keen to embrace ideas from this side of the House.</P>

During my time as a Senator, I have been impressed to see an increase from 39 to 75 solicitors serving the Civil Legal Aid Board, staff numbers increased from 60 to 129, funding increased from £2.7 million in 1992 to £6.2 million in 1995 and the opening of a legal aid centre in every county, something I thought I would never see.

      <P>I thank all Senators who contributed so forcefully and constructively at all Stages of the debate on this Bill.  It was a good debate and represented democratic politics at its very best.  The interesting element of uncertainty that was always present added a particular spice to the proceedings which is too often absent from parliamentary proceedings.  In many respects, this is all to the good.  There were differences of opinion on particular matters and specific points but our ultimate aims for legal aid were not far apart.  As with most things in politics, this comes down to what is possible at any particular time.  We are doing the best job possible having regard to the current state of development of the legal aid system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to further improvements, extensions and expansions that may be necessary in the future.  I would not like to be considered a Minister who is difficult about amendments from the Opposition.  I do not think I am.  Comments to the contrary were made in connection with the Occupier's Liability Bill, to which an appreciable number of changes were made as it progressed through both Houses.  Some amendments have been made, and changes brought about, as a result of the very <Col N="2054" /> helpful and constructive comments made by Senators on both sides of the House.  The Bill may undergo further change in the other House and may return to this House for consideration of certain aspects.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their help and contributions.  I also thank the staff of my Department who have worked long and hard on this complex Bill which covers quite a wide range of the Civil Legal Aid Board's activities.  Our thanks are due to them for the work they have contributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leader and the Whips for arranging this debate.  The nuclear tests which France proposes to carry out in the South Pacific have come as a complete surprise to most people.  It is my view that, in deciding to proceed with these tests, President Chirac is making a major mistake. It is regrettable that these tests are being carried out at this particular time. It is an arrogant and stupid decision.</P>
      <P>We should cast our minds back to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the establishment of democracy across Europe and the end of the Cold War.  People throughout the world heaved a sigh of relief.  However, we are now faced with a retrograde step.  I am appalled at such a decision.  I am pleased that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have issued strong statements criticising and protesting against this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2055" /> A partial test ban treaty was signed in 1963 which banned all atmospheric tests.  It was signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom.  Regrettably China and France did not sign that treaty.  France has continued to carry out tests in the intervening years.  I regret that.  The French are members of the European Union and as such are our partners. However, this is an act of aggression, particularly against the people living in that area.</P>
    <P>There are a number of worrying points in connection with this.  Records are not being kept on the effects of nuclear testing on people living in the area.  In Tahiti most doctors are attached to French military personnel and a record has not been kept of the damage, suffering and deaths caused by the tests and explosions which have been carried out.</P>
    <P>This is a most serious matter.  Irish people should write to the French ambassador and the Government should continue to protest in the strongest possible manner so that the people of France are aware of the sentiments of our people on this matter.</P>
    <P>In the French magazine <i>Infomatin</i>, a commentator.  Marc Jezegabel, said the timing of the announcement &mdash; just before Mr. Chirac's first grand appearances on the international stage &mdash; was a &ldquo;Gaullist inspiration&rdquo;.  He also stated the decision sent a message that France was still a great power, a nuclear power. Anybody who has to show off his strength in this aggressive manner is nothing other than a bully trying to intimidate people.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for these tests now.  The real danger is that once one country resumes these tests, other countries may feel obliged to follow.  That Russia, China and some western countries may follow this bad example is a cause for concern.  We should make certain the French Government is aware of <Col N="2056" /> the strong feelings of this House against these tests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this matter was raised on the Order of Business because it is of grave concern.  In the last few years we expected the major countries would adopt a programme of decommissioning weapons of mass destruction.  There cannot be a more dangerous weapon of mass destruction than a nuclear weapon.  Nobody knows what will happen when one is exploded. Yesterday we discussed problems in East Timor an area not too far away from the region about which we are talking.  There 200,000 people were killed but not by weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>The Mururoa Atoll is like a necklace. It has been fatally harmed over the years by the tests conducted by the French.  Their arrogant colonial attitude is the same as that of any other colonial power.  I was glad to see Mr. Gerry Collins, MEP, on the news last night criticising the attitude of the French to the resumption of nuclear tests on the Mururoa atoll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Australia and New Zealand have suggested they will freeze all defence contacts with the French Government.  Why do Australia and New Zealand need to buy arms from France, an international supplier of arms, particularly to parts of Africa where enormous numbers of people are being killed?  The French, as members of the EU, continue to condemn atrocities all over the world but still want to supply arms on a commercial basis.  The British do not have a great record in this area.  It has been proved irrefutably that they supplied arms to both sides during the Iran-Iraq war.  They have cancelled some of their contracts but have not withdrawn from the armament supply industry.  The nuclear powers have not agreed to a moratorium on the elimination of nuclear arms but said they would pursue in good faith the elimination of all such <Col N="2057" /> weapons.  However, they are still part of the supply mechanism to kill people.</P>
    <P>We must join with our friends in the southern hemisphere, the Prime of Minister of Australia, Mr. Paul Keating and the New Zealand foreign Minister, Mr. Don McKinnon, who have unreservedly said that these tests should be stopped.  The Japanese and the Americans have suggested the French should think again.  The G7 is meeting in Nova Scotia in the next few days.  I sincerely hope at this meeting the French will be told to stop these tests immediately.</P>
    <P>The headline of the editorial in <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper is &ldquo;A South Pacific Cloud&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, this is not the sort of cloud we have over Ireland on even a beautiful day like today.  The cloud to which that editorial refers is the cloud of a nuclear destruction and a nuclear bomb.</P>
    <P>In this House and in whatever fora are available to us we should urge that instruments of mass destruction are eliminated.  If this is not done they will impact on future generations.  We utterly abhor and must criticise what the French have suggested they intend to do.  The pursuit of good faith in the elimination of nuclear weapons is not enough.  We want the elimination of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make statements on this crazy decision by the French to restart testing on the small Mururoa Atoll.  It should concern every public representative and citizen concerned about peace and world stability.  When one compares the period of peace we have had over the last eight months with the decision of the French to start nuclear testing in September, it should concern us all.  It is an outrageous decision which beggars belief and goes totally against the type of peaceful politics which now dominate the world agenda.  France is not facing a security threat that we know of, so on that account alone the decision is inexplicable. <Col N="2058" /> It tells us more about domestic and internal French politics than about its external relations.  Undoubtedly, the recent change of Government in France seems to have brought about a sharp change in its foreign and military policy which is out of step with current thinking.</P>
      <P>In one fell swoop, the French have plunged themselves back into the thinking and actions which dominated world politics in the Cold War era and it is not surprising that the French decision has been met with anger and worldwide disapproval.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement issued yesterday by the Tánaiste and Minster for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, who expressed deep concern at the announcement that France intends to resume nuclear testing later this year. The Tánaiste rightly said the decision would be viewed as a setback to the efforts to bring about an early and complete ban on nuclear testing.  Indeed, the French decision is puzzling in the light of the recent non-proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference in New York which decided to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty no later than the end of next year.  The conference also called on countries to exercise restraint, but it seems the French have paid little heed to this call.</P>
      <P>The reaction by the Australian and New Zealand Governments to the French decision is understandable.  The New Zealand Prime Minister, Jim Bolger, said the French had shown New Zealand the &ldquo;two fingers&rdquo; in this display of military arrogance.  He was right to say the action of the French Government runs counter to the decision of the New York conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, France seems totally oblivious to any possibility of environmental danger from renewed testing.  It disregarded the claims by environmental groups that the rock bases of Mururoa are being shattered by explosions <Col N="2059" /> and further damaged by leaking radiation. There are serious environmental, health and safety issues concerned with this type of weapons testing which the French seem to be ignoring.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of our Government to a complete abolition of nuclear weapons.  In addition, Ireland supports an end to testing nuclear weapons everywhere, for all time.  We also wish to see an end to the production and stockpiling of materials for use in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>I now call on the French Government to reconsider its decision in the light of the outcry from southern Pacific and other European countries.  This decision goes against all current thinking in world politics.  In the interests of peace and stability, I ask France to please consider this potentially dangerous decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the condemnation, which appears to be international, of the decision by the French Government to resume nuclear testing. What is most extraordinary is that this appears to be for French domestic consumption to show that it is a nuclear power and has a place on the world scene.  If President Chirac felt that way, why was this pledge to renew nuclear testing not at the top of his presidential manifesto?  The result in the recent French Presidential election was extremely close.  Would some of those voters have been swayed if they had known that France was to resume nuclear testing?  I think some of them might have been.  Therefore, he is there under a false premise if he did not explain to his own people what he intended to do, even when he came to office.  The Chinese became involved in nuclear testing and now the French also want to conduct nuclear tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that Ireland should make such strong public condemnations of the resumption of nuclear testing.  We have <Col N="2060" /> a long history of public support for the campaign for nuclear disarmament and the public would feel wronged if this House did not express our abhorrence of what is happening.</P>
    <P>People have talked about the environmental and medical effects.  The French appear to have taken no notice in the past of the environmental and medical effects in the South Pacific, although they are well known and well documented; Senator Enright referred to them.  I have no reason to think that irrespective of the objections made by Greenpeace or any of the other organisations that have been treated so shamefully and disgracefully by the French in the past &mdash; agents from French Intelligence were accused and found guilty of murder in that region &mdash; the French Government is likely to take any more notice of objections on environmental or medical grounds.</P>
    <P>France should be asked to point out who it is proposing to bomb when it has carried out these nuclear tests.  At least if we could know there was some purpose for what it was doing, it might make this ridiculous resumption of testing understandable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The French and the US Administrations have, at various times, turned the South Pacific region into a nuclear playground.  Some 25 years after the signing of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and just a few weeks after the treaty's extension, nuclear games are once again being played in the South Pacific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>French attempts to justify the proposed tests have been disturbing to say the least.  The French Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, stated yesterday that nuclear testing was altogether a matter of France's own national interest. However, it must be made clear to the French Administration that nuclear fall out is no respecter of national boundaries and that the decision by any state to explode a nuclear device, or indeed <Col N="2061" /> to use nuclear energy for so called peaceful purposes, is the concern of the whole international community.  Democratic Left has argued that the UK cannot make decisions regarding Sellafield or THORP without reference to other states and the same principle should be applied to nuclear testing.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned at the eagerness with which the French far Right has rushed in to defend the French Government's decision.  It is symptomatic of a creeping militarism which is once again gaining ground in some parts of Europe and which today is buttressed by the appalling threat of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The French decision to resume nuclear weapons testing has rightly aroused a storm of protest, not just from the countries most immediately affected &mdash; New Zealand and Australia &mdash; but also from our Government.  In this regard I welcome the strong statements issued by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and I hope they are indicative of the stance which this Government intends to assume in the future.</P>
    <P>Amid the storm of protest, however, we should not forget the concerns of those too small to be heard; neighbouring South Pacific states whose environment is being sacrificed to what the Prime Minister of New Zealand has called &ldquo;the arrogant action of a European colonial power&rdquo;.  French colonialism brings the South Pacific region close to home &mdash; right into the European Union to be precise.  Residents of France's overseas territories in French Polynesia are, in almost every respect, French nationals and thus, citizens of the European Union.  Few citizens of the European Union, however, have nuclear bombs exploding in their backyard and it is up to us, as a member of the Union, to help vindicate the rights of our fellow European citizens.  As a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Ireland also has an obligation to ensure that other signatories <Col N="2062" /> stick to the spirit as well as the letter of the treaty.</P>
    <P>During the past 25 years, over 580 nuclear tests have been conducted.  By the end of May 1996, that total will have reached 588 and those are just the tests we know about.  Many of them have been carried out in the South Pacific, reducing islands to environmental wastelands.  People have been forced to leave their homes and two generations on, they are still living in nuclear exile. There is a perverted logic to these tests. We all know that nuclear bombs kill, yet, thousands of hectares of land &mdash; whole islands &mdash; have been sacrificed to the obscene desire to quantify destruction. This Government has pressed for the early introduction and implementation of a total test ban and I welcome the complete test ban treaty, due to be signed next year.</P>
    <P>In advance of the test ban treaty, however, signatories to the non-proliferation treaty extension pledged themselves to exercise restraint.  In view of France's actions, one must wonder what they understand by restraint.  The aim is obviously to get in under the ropes of the test ban, and I fear we will see more nuclear jurisdictions rushing to explode bigger and better bombs before the Test Ban Treaty comes into force.</P>
    <P>As well as campaigning for the comprehensive implementation of a test ban, however, the issue of nuclear test victims should be placed on the international agenda.  I would like to see Ireland taking a lead in the demand for proper compensation for those nuclear exiles forced out of their homes by nuclear testing as well as for those living on a daily basis with the environmental consequences of nuclear testing.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Irish Government has made forceful representations to the French authorities regarding the proposed tests.  We should not leave it there, however.  The matter should be raised in every appropriate international forum until the French agree to <Col N="2063" /> abide by the spirit as well as the letter of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of myself and the Progressive Democrats, I join with other Members in condemning in the strongest possible terms this outrageous decision by the French Government.  I do not understand this decision, given that there is a ban on testing, that there has been a moratorium in France itself on testing since 1992 and that China is the only other country which is continuing to test.  When one considers that the great powers such as Russia and the US have abandoned testing, it puts the French decision into context.</P>
      <P>I note that France said that there will be eight small tests between now and 1996.  I regard that as a contradiction in terms as I do not know how there can be a small nuclear explosion.  By definition, a nuclear explosion must result in tremendous devastation and ruin, even in circumstances where it is contained.</P>
      <P>I also understand, from what I read in the press, that France has 500 warheads already deployed.  What are these warheads needed for in the world in which we now live?  Whom are they pointed at?  Why does France need 500 warheads and why does it need to continue to test?  After the ban on atmospheric testing in 1963 France continued to test for another 11 years, so its record in this respect is not very good and is, perhaps, part of the explanation for this decision. Between 1966 and 1974 there were 44 atmospheric tests and 120 underground tests.  The moratorium was then introduced by President Mitterrand in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The French authorities give no warning of these tests, which is extraordinary. I suppose they take the view that this place is 6,500 kilometres from Sydney; a similar distance from Los Angeles; 4,000 kilometres from Auckland and 1,000 kilometres from Tahiti. However, as has already been said, the <Col N="2064" /> nuclear cloud does not respect such distances.</P>
    <P>The ultimate cynicism of this was shown when President Chirac said that &ldquo;France has every intention of signing the complete test ban treaty, without reserve, in the autumn of 1996&rdquo;.  How can they adopt that position on one hand and on the other say that they are going to continue with nuclear tests? France has given us an example of what civilisation can be and it is a great country. In that context it is even more appalling that it would continue with this policy.  I suspect that it may be driven by the military, who are the people who need to be watched in all societies.  In the film &ldquo;Dr. Strangelove&rdquo; the military were portrayed as those who would go to nuclear war because they seemed to like it.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this from an Irish point of view is the impact which it will have on European policy. There will be an Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 where it is expected that we will proceed towards a common foreign policy which, as the Maastricht Treaty says, might in turn lead to common defence.  I would have nothing to do with a common foreign policy which had nuclear arms as part of its make up. I say that as someone who is committed to the European ideal and who might even be described at times as a federalist. There are enormous implications for European policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan is right that those at the G7 conference must tell France in no uncertain terms their view on this.  If this is an instrument of France's foreign policy, then God help us all.  What are these weapons needed for?  Why are they needed?  I do not see the reason for them, nor do I see the need for France to continue with this very ill advised and wrong policy.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am pleased to have an opportunity to address this very important issue.  Violence against women is a violation of women's human rights which occurs across all economic, social and cultural divides.  It causes serious physical and psychological damage both to women and children and it is a huge social problem.  Physical, sexual and mental abuse of women and children in their own homes is totally unacceptable.  However, that message is only beginning to become part of the public agenda in terms of social concerns.</P>
      <P>In 1995 women in Ireland who are abused still face a huge battle against inadequate refuge space and a huge lack of services when they are trying to leave an abusive partner.  There is still a huge level of misinformation and acceptance of violence against women and children in society.  We need to create a type of society which will enable women to speak out in safety about the horrific assaults which they have endured in the privacy of their own homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, was at the launch on Tuesday of <i>Zero Tolerance &mdash; A National Strategy on Eliminating Violence against Women</i> which was prepared by Women's Aid.  At that conference he talked about the fact that he had a role in the Departments of Health, Justice and Education and that all of these Departments were involved in bringing about changes and in implementing a strategy to bring about an end to domestic violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation of refuges throughout the country is totally unacceptable. There are only 16 family refuge places in Dublin and only 79 nationwide. <Col N="2066" /> When we discuss cases such as the Kilkenny incest case and the case of the west of Ireland farmer, many people tend to blame the women and ask why they did not leave the home to protect the children.  However, where could these women go?  For example, in my constituency of Laois-Offaly there is no hostel or refuge for women and children who are victims of domestic violence. Expecting them to move out of the family home with no place to go is not an option.</P>
    <P>There is an information and advice centre for women who are victims of domestic violence in Dublin, but there are no such centres throughout the country.  Many women are economically dependent on their partners and do not have financial independence.  They are afraid of moving out into situations of poverty and many are willing to accept physical abuse in order to keep their children with them.  They stay in the family home because they are frightened of the consequences if they leave. It would be very helpful if there were information and advice centres throughout the country which would tell them about their legal rights and entitlements if they left the family home.</P>
    <P>We do not have statistics on domestic violence in this country, but if we look around we can see the huge number of women and children living in situations of domestic violence.  For example, the Women's Aid helpline, which was set up in March 1992, has received almost 18,000 calls from women who were physically, sexually or mentally abused by men.  The special domestic violence and sexual assault unit which was set up by the Garda in the Dublin Metropolitan Area received 5,000 calls in one four month period last year.  International research has shown that only between 10 and 15 per cent of women report assault to the police.  If 5,000 calls were made to the domestic violence and sexual assault unit in a four month period, and that is taken to represent only 10 to <Col N="2067" /> 15 per cent of all assaults, the figure is absolutely frightening.</P>
    <P>Womens' Aid were involved in a pilot study in St. James's Hospital in 1993 for which they examined 83 women admitted to that unit as a result of assault by a partner or a spouse.  The injuries these women received were horrifying.  Some 26 fractures were documented, there were 40 cases of blows to the head, multiple bruising, lacerations and attempted strangulations.  These are the results of a pilot study in just one hospital in Dublin. It was shown that pregnant women living with abusive partners are also abused during the pregnancy.  This shows that we must work towards a national strategy to combat domestic violence against both men and women.</P>
    <P>We must look at areas such as male power in the public and the private world.  We need to increase finances to refuges and to improve the standards and staff training in refuges, but we also need to give women access to information and support.  We need to support women and help them to make decisions which will affect their future if they move out of a violent situation in the home.  I am concerned that the recent embargo on recruitment to the public service would have an effect in this area, but I was heartened to see that the Minister for Health indicated during discussions on the Health Estimate that child care and child protection was one of his three priorities and that funds would not be taken out of this area.</P>
    <P>Statistics have shown that 45 per cent of mothers of abused children are themselves battered.  In many of these cases the father is abusing both the woman and the children.  A woman who is being physically, sexually or mentally abused in her own home is in a very vulnerable position when it comes to protecting her children.  It is very difficult for these women to stand up against violent men and to protect themselves and their children. Women who are being abused are <Col N="2068" /> often afraid to contact health care workers or social workers because they are afraid their children will be removed from them.  We need to change this perception quickly so that battered women whose children are being abused as well will seek help from social workers and health care workers.  By protecting women we are protecting their children.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that all social workers and health care workers are trained in dealing with abused women and children. In its recommendations, the Commission on the Status of Women discussed the economic dependency of women and how this controlled their lives.  Some of the statistics outlined in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women were very interesting.  I was a member of that committee. We expect a lot from women and we sometimes forget how vulnerable they are.  Women constitute only 32 per cent of the work force.  They earn on average 68 per cent of mens' incomes. Women constitute 60 per cent of those earning below the low pay threshold. Some 53 per cent of Irish women are working full time in the home and therefore are totally dependent economically on their partners.</P>
    <P>When women who are being abused by their partners are asked why they stay in the situation of domestic abuse, the main reasons they give are economic. They cannot exercise control over their own lives when they are economically dependent or in poverty.  We need to make many changes to combat these problems.</P>
    <P>We need major changes in domestic violence legislation.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has indicated that he will publish legislation on domestic violence shortly and that this will go a long way towards meeting the reservations held by groups such as the Commission on the Status of Women and Womens' Aid, who deal with women who are the victims <Col N="2069" /> of violence.  I look forward to seeing that legislation.</P>
    <P>We need ongoing public awareness campaigns as well as a long term commitment to conducting public education campaigns.  Attitudes must be changed because unless the issue of domestic violence can be brought out of the privacy of the home into the public arena there will be no solution to this problem.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Honan for raising the issue of domestic violence and the need to protect women who are the victims of such violence.  I am glad to have the opportunity to address the Seanad on this important matter.</P>
      <P>First, I wish to let Senators know that the document <i>&ldquo;Zero Tolerance&rdquo;&mdash; A National Strategy on Eliminating Violence Against Women</i> was presented to my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Austin Currie, last Tuesday by Womens' Aid.  This document seeks to bring to public attention the effects of physical and sexual violence on women and their children.  It makes important recommendations on how this appalling problem can be tackled.</P>
      <P>Violence in all its forms is unacceptable in a civilised society. Domestic violence is particularly abhorrent and sinister in that it takes place in the sanctuary of the home and from a position of authority and power.  It is only in recent times that the extent of violence against women and children in our society has come to the forefront of public attention.  It is vital that this crime should be exposed and the perpetrators brought to justice.  However, dealing with the crime is not the only aspect to be tackled.  Paramount consideration must be given to the victims, be they women or children, and this is where the role and responsibility of the Minster for Health must be exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2070" /> I want to assure Senators that we are committed to the development of appropriate services within the health area for victims of domestic violence.  It is our intention to build on the developments costing in the region of £350,000 which were approved last year in providing support for abused women. As a first step in achieving progress in this important area this year we have approved the payment of a grant of £55,000 towards the running costs of the freephone National Helpline service provided by Women's Aid.  We have also approved a grant of £20,000 to the National Federation of Refuges for Abused Women and their Children to support their co-ordinating activities.</P>
    <P>We look forward to studying the national strategy document presented by Women's Aid.  It is our intention to examine this document in conjunction with the policy document already submitted by the National Federation of Refuges for Abused Women and their Children.  Given the co-ordinating role which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, has in the three Departments of Health, Education and Justice, he will ensure that this document is considered fully from the perspective of the three Departments.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned domestic violence in the Laois-Offaly area and the lack of refuge facilities there.  Inquiries have been made with the Midland Health Board about this matter.  Refuge facilities are provided by the health board in Athlone and Tullamore and these are available and used appropriately to assist women from throughout the region who are in need of refuge facilities.  The board also provides assistance in a variety of ways to women and their children who are in need of help and protection.  These include providing them with exceptional needs payments towards the cost of clothing and accommodation and liaising with the local authority in relation to housing requirements. The full range of health and personal <Col N="2071" /> social services is available to women who are the victims of domestic violence in the Laois-Offaly area.  The board has also indicated that it has not received any specific application or request for the provision of refuge facilities in the Laois-Offaly area.  If the Senator has detailed information on the <Col N="2072" /> incidence of domestic violence in this area and the need for emergency refuge accommodation I will make arrangements to have the matter dealt with appropriately.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21 June 1995.</P>
