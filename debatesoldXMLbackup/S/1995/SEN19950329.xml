      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the results of a recent survey by ASH, which showed that 90 per cent of attempted purchases of cigarettes by children under 16 were successful, the need for the Minister for Health to review the 1990 regulations governing same.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for the sewage treatment plant in Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Dardis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Defence to provide an assurance that the Army School of Music and the band of the Curragh Command will continue in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to the National Safety Council in order that a more intensive water safety publicity campaign can be launched this year.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to examine the possibility of transferring the Garda responsibility for Croom and adjoining areas &mdash; County Limerick &mdash; from Askeaton to Limerick city.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will make representations on behalf of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick who has been refused a visa to the United States.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Henry's and Senator Burke's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I had to rule the matter raised by Senator Rory Kiely out of order due to lack of ministerial responsibility.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take item 1 now.  Item 2.  Statements on the Role of the Seanad, will be taken at 2 p.m. with the Acting Leader being called on to make a statement of reply not later than 5.30 p.m.  Item 10.  Motion No. 16, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>As I requested last week, what will be the programme of legislation for the House between now and the Easter recess?  As was also mentioned last week, it may be appropriate for the House to discuss the situation in the North of Ireland.  I would welcome such an opportunity as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed as far as I am concerned.  Could I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht our thanks for his speedy response to our Private Members' motion of last week in respect of Mullaghmore?  It is regrettable that it was not possible for anybody other than Senator Henry to rise when we sought a division on that matter because the Fine Gael Leader of the House indicated that they would be abstaining.  It is significant that, in the course of the debate, the only person on the Government side who indicated clear and positive support was Senator Sherlock.  We welcome the decision and we thank the Minister for his speedy response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again ask the Government to produce the Efficiency Audit Group report on the Army and the changes that are purportedly to take place?  Every week since the information in the report was leaked we have asked about what is in this report.  This week the Army bands are to be disbanded; every day of every week there are leaks about this report but this House has not been given the opportunity to look at it.  Hundreds of people in every constituency, town and city, are under threat because of leaks supposedly come from that report, yet neither this House nor the Lower House has been given the opportunity to discuss it. It is a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said previously, Senator, that such matters are suitable for Private Members' Business.  I urge <Col N="1332" /> Senators to take that on board if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be suitable for Private Members' Business but it is a matter of concern to the nation.  We should have an opportunity to look at the report and discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Acting Leader indicate when we might have an opportunity in this House to discuss the Government's immature decision in relation to Mullaghmore?  Bearing in mind that this Government indicated very clearly its wish to have transparency, how can it reconcile that decision with the fact that an application was before Clare County Council, that the planning process was taking place and would probably be appealed to An Bord Pleanála?  How can this decision have been taken in the light of these developments?</P>
      <P>How does this relate to the Minister of State with responsibility for western development's programme of action? He indicated here last week the desirability of ensuring development in the west; this was a major project which had a great impact on one of the most remote and underdeveloped areas in Ireland.  How does the Government feel that this decision will help the conservation or management of one of our most unique scenic areas?  It is a very bad decision which will put the whole future of the Burren at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister for Health intend to publish the report of the special investigative committee into the contraction by women of hepatitis C from the anti-D vaccine?  I raised the matter last Wednesday and Senator Henry raised it last Thursday.  I understand the Minister has had the report <Col N="1333" /> for more than seven weeks.  The women involved are very concerned at the delay in its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for item 9 on the Order Paper to be taken fairly soon?  Item 10, motion 6, is related.  This is an urgent matter because the Delors package is now being allocated.  If this House is to have any useful discussion on the International Fund for Ireland, the INTERREG programme and the Delors package, we should have it sooner rather than later.  The Leader of the House indicated here that he would be glad to debate this matter in Government time and I would appreciate a favourable response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Acting Leader if it would be in order to send congratulations to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, on going before the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament in Brussels to answer questions on the state of the Irish currency, the Government's use of EU transfers, the likelihood of meeting European Monetary Union targets&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and on his handling in general of our foreign exchange policy?  We are very lucky to have a Minister of the calibre of Deputy Quinn.  One can imagine what would have happened to this country if he had taken advice from Senator Ross. Deputy Michael McDowell or Mary Ellen Synon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Acting Leader when it is envisaged that the Government will finally allocate money to Mallow racecourse?  This is an ongoing debate and many people in the <Col N="1334" /> Cork area and the Irish Racing Authority are very concerned about this issue.  Over £5 million was sanctioned by the last Administration and now consultants are being employed to find out whether it is efficient or economic.  Mallow is the only racecourse in Cork which has a very high horse population and is the home of the thoroughbred industry. I urge the Government to sanction the immediate allocation of that money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>As bouquets and advice are being handed out to the Minister for Finance, whatever about the two gentlemen whom Senator Townsend mentioned, he would need to be careful of the lady.  Financial journalists, when spurned, can be very difficult people to deal with.</P>
      <P>On the issue of bouquets to the Minister for Finance, there is a Fianna Fáil motion &mdash; motion No. 10 on the Order Paper &mdash; on tax covenants.  I see that the Minister has taken our good advice.  We would be willing to congratulate and compliment him because he may have seen the way the wind was blowing in this House.  I welcome his decision to change the Government's propositions on tax covenants, particularly where they affect people who suffer from long term illness.  I think that motion has now served its purpose.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible for us to have a debate at an early date on the Western European Union and on the issue of the intergovernmental conference?  The year 1996 is rapidly approaching and I understand that there is now a considerable amount of preparation under way for it at official level.  It would now be timely to have a debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it also be possible &mdash; perhaps it would be in the context of tonight's Private Members' Business &mdash; for this <Col N="1335" /> House to indicate its dismay at the daft and crazy proposition put before the European Parliament by members of the Green group, which includes two Irish MEP's, to withdraw European Funding from major road projects, particularly the Arklow by-pass?  If there was ever a crazy, daft and ill-considered proposition this is it, and it should stand condemned.  I compliment the Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil MEPs who have taken a proper stand. It is crazy to play politics, which is what these daft people are doing, with the wellbeing of towns like Arklow or Mullingar and we need to register our dismay at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get back to the Senator on that.  On the programme of legislation, we will have the Social Welfare Bill tomorrow and next week. There are a number of Bills on the Order Paper with the Seanad, including the Family Law Bill and the Civil Legal Aid Bill.  There will be details of other legislation coming from the Dáil in the near future and we will get the rest of the details for Senator Wright as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of calls for a debate on Northern Ireland and. again, we hope to organise that in the very near future.  I would agree that such a debate would be timely.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator Daly raised the question of Mullaghmore.  As the House knows, we did have a long debate last week during Private Members' time on that issue.  I would take issue to some extent with Senator Dardis in so far as I also spoke in favour of the motion last week.  We have to agree to differ on the question of Mullaghmore. Senator Daly referred to the fact that stopping this development was an immature decision.  I again would have to disagree with that.  The Minister announced that a plan will be produced for the entire Burren area.  That is a response to Senator Daly's concerns on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have an Adjournment debate on the issue if the <Col N="1337" /> Senator wishes, but we did air it fully last week; it has been aired over a number of years in various fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Laningan Mr. Laningan">

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to get information on the publication of the efficiency audit report on the Army for Senator Lanigan.  Perhaps an Adjournment debate would also be suitable for that.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan referred to hepatitis C.  I agree that it is time for information to be made available on that as soon as possible and I will endeavour to get that information from the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator McGowan.  the Leader of the House indicated last week that we would have a debate on the International Fund for Ireland and the INTERREG and hopefully this will take place as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if Senator Townsend wanted a reply with regard to his question, but I agree with Senator Roche in that I am not certain what kind of advice we would not want to get from the lady the Senator referred to.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Kelleher's point on Mallow racecourse, it would appear that this would be suitable for debate on the Adjournment.  I am aware that it is an issue of concern to the people, not only of the north Cork area but of County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of the Western European Union and the intergovernmental conference raised by Senator Roche, we could have a wide ranging debate on this as there are many related issues. and the Senator referred to other issues of EU funding.  The matter has been raised many times in the House and it would be fruitful to have a debate on <Col N="1338" /> it.  We should be careful that we do not intrude on the territory of the relevant Oireachtas committee, but there is plenty of scope for debate in the Seanad and it would be suitable for Government time if it can be made available as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am uncertain as to the details of the case referred to by Senator Rory Kiely. but perhaps if the Senator provided me with them.  I could request information from the relevant Department, or it may be suitable for debate on the Adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First.  Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may <Col N="1339" /> explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of the Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  Tá áthas orm a bheith ar ais libh anseo.  Baineann na leasuithe atá i gceist anseo le leasuithe a deineadh sa Dáil ar Bille a tógadh sa Seanad.</P>
      <P>There are 16 amendments in my name and one, amendment No. 12, in the name of Deputy Quill.  I propose to group amendments where they are related to each other.  While virtually all the amendments are in my name, many of them arise either from promises made by me in this House or from amendments tabled by Deputy Quill on Committee Stage in the Dáil to which I responded by tabling my own wording on Report Stage in that House.</P>
      <P>I will first take amendments Nos. 1. 13 and 17.  These amendments are related and deal with the placing of the performance of heritage functions of the Commissioners of Public Works under the supervision and direction of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 inserts a new section &mdash; section 24 &mdash; in the Bill to provide that the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works under specified enactments in relation to the national heritage will be performed by <Col N="1340" /> them subject to the supervision and directions of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  This gives effect to the commitment in the policy agreement for Government of December 1994, entitled <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, that the Heritage Council Bill would be amended to provide that &ldquo;the policy functions of the Commissioners of Public Works under legislation relating to the heritage, shall be performed by them subject to the general directions in writing of the Minister for Arts. Culture and the Gaeltacht&rdquo;.  The situation has existed since February 1993, as Senators will be aware, that policy formulation for heritage matters has been my responsibility.  It is very desirable that this principle should now be embodied in legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 17 are consequential amendments and take account of the fact that the Bill will not be dealing solely with the Heritage Council but also, under the proposed new section 24, with the heritage functions of the Office of Public Works. Amendment No. 1 amends the Short Title of the Act in section 1 from the &ldquo;Heritage Council Act, 1994&rdquo;, to the &ldquo;Heritage Act, 1995&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 17 amends the Long Title of the Bill to reflect the provisions of the new section 24 inserted by amendment No. 13.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 4, 7 and 16 are related.  They insert a definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; and provide for the mandatory establishment by the Heritage Council of two additional standing committees, one on architectural heritage and the other on inland waterways.  This is in furtherance of an undertaking given by me in this House.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 inserts in section 2 (1) a definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo;. This definition replaces the definition of &ldquo;works of architecture&rdquo; in that section which, under amendment No. 4 has been deleted.  The definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; is based on the definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo;<Col N="1341" /> contained in the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe, which this country signed in 1985 in Granada, Spain, and which we are currently preparing to ratify.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 substitutes &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; for &ldquo;works of architecture&rdquo; in the definition of national heritage in section 6 (1) which sets out the functions of the council in relation to the national heritage.  Amendment No. 16 amends paragraph 9 (2) of the Schedule &mdash; which already provides for the mandatory establishment by the council of standing committees on wildlife and archaeology &mdash; to provide for the mandatory establishment by the council of two additional standing committees, one on architectural heritage and the other on inland waterways. &ldquo;Inland waterways&rdquo; is defined in section 2 (1).  This fulfils a commitment given by me to this House on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 includes a specific reference to genealogical records in the definition of &ldquo;heritage objects&rdquo; in section 2 (1).  I brought forward this amendment in response to points raised in this House and in the Dáil, and in response to representations received by me from genealogical societies.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5, 6, 10 and 11 are related.  They empower the council to acquire, accept gifts of, hold and dispose of land, including buildings.  They give effect to the commitment contained in the policy agreement for Government of December 1994, entitled <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, to amend the Heritage Council Bill to enable the council to own land and buildings.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 provides in section 5 (3) that the council may acquire, hold and dispose of land, including buildings. Amendment No. 11 removes the prohibition in section 12 (2) on the acceptance by the council of gifts of land and buildings.  The power to acquire whether by way of purchase or gift, hold <Col N="1342" /> and dispose of land and buildings is a standard provision in legislation setting up similar statutory corporate bodies such as the Arts Council, Bord na Gaeilge and An Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and No. 10 provide in sections 5 (4) and 12 (1), respectively, that these powers of acquisition, etc., will be exercised by the council subject to any directions the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, may decide to give.  While I do not wish to anticipate any such directions.  I see this power being used by the council to acquire its own premises and I do not see it becoming involved in the routine acquisition of heritage properties.  In any event the council will be restricted by the limits of its financial allocations.</P>
    <P>Amendments No. 8 and No. 9 were introduced in response to amendments proposed by Deputy Quill during the Dáil Committee Stage debate.  They amend section 6 of the Bill &mdash; which sets out the functions of the council &mdash; to provide that the council will promote heritage education and, in carrying our its functions, co-operate with educational bodies.  It can be pro-active in education matters.</P>
    <P>I believe the study of heritage should be included in the schools curriculum both because of its intrinsic importance and as a contribution to the protection and preservation of our heritage.  The National Heritage Council can play a valuable role in promoting heritage education.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 amends section 6 (3) (a) to include among the functions of the council the promotion of education in relation to the national heritage. Amendment No. 9 amends section 6 (3) (b) to include in the council's functions co-operation with educational bodies in the promotion of the council's functions.  The functions of the council under section 6 include proposing policies and priorities for the identification, protection and preservation of the <Col N="1343" /> national heritage and promoting interest in and appreciation of that heritage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 was proposed by Deputy Quill.  It amends section 21 (2) by providing that the council shall, not later than six months after the end of each financial year, submit its accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  Under this section a copy of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit report, together with a copy of the accounts, must subsequently be presented to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who will be obliged to lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 provides in paragraph 1 (1) of the Schedule that in addition to a chairperson the council will consist of a minimum number of 14 ordinary council members.  This is a technical amendment which removes a potential anomaly.  Prior to amendment, paragraph 1 (1) of the Schedule provided for a maximum number of 16 but no specific minimum number of ordinary council members in addition to a chairperson, whereas paragraph 2 (1) of the Schedule, which is a gender balance provision, assumes the council will have a total membership of at least 14 as it provides for the appointment of seven men and seven women.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 amends paragraph 6 (5) of the Schedule to provide that the council may continue to act. notwithstanding vacancies in its membership which will include vacancies resulting in the gender balance requirements of paragraph 2 (1) of the Schedule not being complied with &mdash; that is. vacancies resulting in fewer than seven men and seven women being members of the council.  This is to ensure that vacancies in council membership resulting in a breach of these gender balance requirements will not prevent the council from acting, pending the filling of such vacancies in accordance with the legislation.  This amendment is similar to the provision in section 10 (5) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 <Col N="1344" /> inserted by me through section 7 (1) (b) of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was first debated here I made the point that in the break up of responsibilities, both at ministerial level and in legislative terms, there was not a clear overall policy approach on heritage.  In my view, this amendment will help to achieve that. My fear was that the division of responsibility for heritage matters between separate Ministers and the lack of clarity as to who had legislative responsibility for these complex matters would lead to fragmentation and an absence of a clear Government policy in this area.  This was damaging to heritage matters and was certainly likely to lead to different views on how they should be approached.  These amendments will go some way towards defining the lines of demarcation and clarifying who has overall responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Commissioners of Public Works in the heritage area is being placed under the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I ask the Minister to clarify <Col N="1345" /> the role of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Commissioners of Public Works.  I also ask him to clarify how the relationship between the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister of State with responsibility for the Commissioners of Public Works will work in relation to the overall development of heritage policy in the next number of years.  I do not believe we will have comprehensive heritage legislation like this before the House again for quite a while.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of the opportunity to disagree with the recent Government decision on Mullaghmore as put forward by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  It appears to conflict with the views of the Minister of State with responsibility for western development and the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  When we look at amendments such as these, we must also examine how the legislation will work in practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say. although I am reluctant to do so, that I made the point very clearly that the only matters which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.  That would not seem to be the case with regard to the matters to which you are now referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is precisely the case.  a Chathaoirligh.  Under amendments Nos. 1, 13 and 17, the performance of heritage functions by the Commissioners of Public Works has been brought under the supervision and direction of the Minister for Arts.  Culture and the Gaeltacht. Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is correct, but the ruling is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard, I take issue with a decision in a particular case &mdash; the Mullaghmore decision &mdash; which is relevant to this amendment.  The Mullaghmore <Col N="1346" /> decision flies in the face of a few realities.  The first is that the issue was before Clare County Council for a planning decision.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that, before this amendment was made, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht gave a direction to the Commissioners of Public Works not to supply some basic, fundamental information required by Clare County Council to enable them to process the application. It was certainly widely reported and I do not think the Minister has denied that he, as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, directed the Commissioners of Public Works, when he did not have the statutory authority to do so, to refrain from supplying some relevant information requested by Clare County Council to enable them to reach a conclusion on the Mullaghmore issue. The Minister might clarify if that is the situation.  Did the Minister for Arts. Culture and the Gaeltacht, without the statutory responsibility being given to him under this amendment, direct the Office of Public Works not to supply the information which was requested by the county council to enable them to reach a conclusion on the planning application for Mullaghmore?</P>
      <P>I find it extraordinary and inexplicable that a Minister would use the phrase &ldquo;indecent haste&rdquo; to describe the start of the Mullaghmore project.  The Minister is well aware that the plan for a national park in Mullaghmore was initiated in the early 1970s and included the provision of an interpretative centre, which was not advanced for many years.  It was accelerated in the 1980s and planning of the centre continued for nine or ten years before initial moves were made to undertake the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is fully aware that quite intense consultations took place in that period between the Commissioners of Public Works and the planning authority regarding the planning aspects of the development.  Discussions took place over three or four years on a technical and administrative level between the Office of Public Works personnel <Col N="1347" /> and the engineering and technical advisers from the County Clare planning authority regarding the detail of the design and planning of the interpretative centre near Mullaghmore.  For this reason, I am at a loss to understand why the Minister would say that undue haste was used in processing the project and commencing work on the site.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the last election on the radio today.  However, both he and the Commissioners of Public Works were aware that the date for the commencement of the project had been set.  The start of the project was planned well in advance, long before anybody had the remotest idea that there would be a snap election in 1992.  The Minister of State at the time.  Deputy Noel Treacy, who planned to commence the project was not in a position to do so on that particular date because the election intervened.  He requested that I, as a Minister of State and a Deputy for County Clare at that time, carry out the sod turning ceremony.</P>
    <P>It is totally misleading to suggest that the sod turning ceremony at Mullaghmore was designed as an election gimmick. This is not in accordance with the facts.  Given that the Minister is fair minded and reasonable, I know he will accept this point.  I hope he will take the opportunity to correct his statement, which created the impression that the sod turning ceremony was expedited for the sole purpose of the election.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware, given his knowledge of the area, that people would have preferred not to have this as an election issue.  It caused some division in the local community because some parts of the Burren objected to the Mullaghmore project.  By and large, it was not a decision which one would have wished to have as an election issue. It is misleading and inaccurate to suggest that the matter was expedited for the purpose of electioneering and I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to correct this point.</P>
    <P>In relation to the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works and how <Col N="1348" /> this will work in practice, the confusion will continue if that body is fragmented. This confusion has brought about a certain amount of the controversy surrounding the Mullaghmore project.  As I understand it, it is the Government's intention to let the Office of Public Works disintegrate.  However, it would be unwise of the Government to fragment and dismantle the body.  It would be a retrograde step and people who have the experience of dealing with the commissioners would be most disappointed. I am not certain whether the Minister has any plans in this regard but I ask him to explain how he can be effective in a situation where the responsibilities for this area are held by another Minister.  Is it the intention at a later date to break up the Office of Public Works. to assign sections of it to his own Department and have other sections retained by the Minister for Finance?  In my view, this will be resisted and would be an unwise decision.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has been established since before the foundation of the State.  It has an extraordinary record of outstanding mention, which has been recognised not only nationally but also internationally.  The Office of Public Works has won international awards for some of its work.  To attempt to fragment the Office of Public Works and to assign various responsibilities to different Ministers would be a backward step and, rather than do that, it would be more advisable to take the opposite course of action and give full responsibility in some of these areas to the Minister with responsibility.</P>
    <P>This applies not only to this Department but to many others.  We have seen several instances here where Ministers have responsibility but do not have the statutory responsibility which is assigned to other Ministers.  I would like clarification from the Minister, in his reply to this debate here, in relation to the whole heritage area, the areas that are covered under this Bill, which has been debated here and in the other House.  What will the overall end result be when all the amendments are made? <Col N="1349" /> Will we see a more co-ordinated situation in relation to legislation, or will it be more fragmented?  Will we see ministerial responsibility coinciding with legislative responsibilities so that we will not have Ministers responsible for legislation in an area which is the responsibility of other Ministers, with the resulting confusion that this kind of situation leads to?</P>
    <P>Overall, I support the main thrust of the amendments; but I avail of this opportunity to question the unwise decision relative to this amendment which has been made by the Minister in going to Government to seek the abandonment of a project which has been well thought out, well planned, well discussed and which the vast majority of the local community in the areas that are affected by this development fully support.  I outlined here on a previous occasion that the voluntary organisations &mdash; farming bodies, representatives of sporting organisations and cultural organisations, such as the Clare Archaeological and Historical Society &mdash; in the areas most immediately affected by the Mullaghmore development are totally in support of that development.  They not only came out locally in support but came here and campaigned outside the gates of the House and outside the offices of the Office of Public Works to highlight the volume and sincerity of the public demand and support for this project.</P>
    <P>This decision will have a damaging impact on the Burren as one of our most historic, scenic and attractive areas.  The conservation and management of the Burren will be put backwards by at least ten years by the decision the Minister took yesterday.  To postpone or abandon the scheme for Mullaghmore will have a permanent adverse impact on one of our most historic areas.  It will damage the conservation and management prospects for the area and send the wrong signal to many people who have worked diligently there year after year, especially the local community. who have cared for the Burren region over the centuries.  It sends out a message <Col N="1350" /> of despair.  There is widespread dismay at this recent Government decision among the local community leaders in the area most immediately affected by it, including farming leaders, leaders of community sporting organisations, cultural associations and other societies.</P>
    <P>We should use this opportunity to draw the Minister's attention to the ongoing need for the conservation and management of the Burren area.  I fully support his proposals for a management plan for the region.  The preparation and completion of such a management plan could take up to 20 years.  If the Minister looks at our most important national park, the Killarney National Park, its management plan was published 25 years after the park was established.  If we are to wait 25 years for a management and conservation policy for the Burren, irreparable damage will have been done and the care and consideration given by the local community for so long would be undermined.</P>
    <P>The Minister should express an urgency about resolving this matter and the decision taken yesterday will not do so.  A certain amount of work has been done which cannot be dismantled.  No one, including the Minister, would like to see the site return to its former state as a disused gravel quarry.  If the Government is to spend taxpayers' money digging up carefully developed car parks and other facilities to return a disused gravel quarry which might be used for dumping rubbish, that would be shortsighted on the Government's part.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister is shortsighted in this regard: he has the best interests of the region at heart but he has been ill advised by those who have told him there is widespread discontent about this project in County Clare and in the Burren region in particular.  There is wholehearted support except in a small region which felt threatened by this development &mdash; that was Kilfenora. Nevertheless, the Minister could resolve that by indicating to Kilfenora through the Heritage Council that the necessary funding will he provided for the refurbishment <Col N="1351" /> and redevelopment of Kilfenora which could go hand in hand with the Mullaghmore development.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gravely undermined Clare County Council.  The Minister of State with responsibility for western development, Deputy Carey, was in this House a week ago and he was a member of Clare County Council when it discussed this matter and he said that Clare County Council had given the greatest consideration to this project at technical and official level.  Yesterday's decision flies in the face of the county council's decision.  Senator Taylor-Quinn is a member of the county council and she knows that the project was widely supported by the council; her party supported it; she and the Minister of State. Deputy Carey, supported it fully.</P>
    <P>We attended packed halls in places such as Corofin when hundreds of people turned out from all over the Burren to demonstrate their support for this project.  These were people who live in the area, who respect the area and wish to live there in the future. However, many of them see their future threatened by a decision such as this. We have seen the depletion of the population of the Burren area; in one area not far from Mullaghmore where there were up to 200 people on the electoral register when I was first elected in 1973. there are now none.  The population of these areas has been devastated and there is now a total lack of hope in any prospect of the population returning.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have decided to halt and dismantle a project which was to bring enormous benefit in terms of conservation and development of jobs.  At the same time the Minister with responsibility for western development is trying to create employment opportunities.  This is a stark and clear conflict.  The Minister of State, in the first test of his responsibility, failed to influence the Government so as to ensure that such projects. which would have beneficial impact on a community which has been devastated by unemployment and lack of opportunity, <Col N="1352" /> continue.  This is one of the most scenic areas in Ireland, but its declining population will not be helped by the decision which was taken yesterday.</P>
    <P>I am sure I am wasting my time asking the Minister to reconsider that decision.  He said that in the management plan he would look at the area to see what can be done.  I urge the Minister to work with speed on this matter. If we must wait for 25 years for a management plan for the Burren National Park area or the Burren area of north Clare, this Minister will have lost an opportunity to make an impact in dealing with problems in this area.  We have seen the devastation which people in this area suffered this winter where houses were flooded, where land was under water and where property was been irreparably damaged.  The response of the Government has been negative up to now.</P>
    <P>While I support these amendments.  I would like clarification from the Minister as to the overall effect they will have on the legislation and whether policy areas will be more clearly defined as a result of the amendments, in that one body will be responsible for the heritage area, will set down and implement national policy and will place heritage aspects of the economy in a legislative framework.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the Government's decision and consult with his colleagues in Fine Gael on the situation &mdash; in fact, he should consult with all of us.  I would be willing to sit down with the Minister at a meeting with Members of the Oireachtas from County Clare to discuss where we should go from here in the light of the Government decision.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his influence with his colleague, Deputy Kemmy, the Chairman of the Labour Party, to refrain form the hysterical statement which he has made about Mullaghmore and the effects expenditure has had Members of the Oireachtas from County Clare can deal with our own business in so far as heritage matters are concerned.  I wish he would deal with <Col N="1353" /> matters in his constituency as capably as we deal with ours.  When he was Lord Mayor of Limerick city and a Member of the Oireachtas, he allowed the desecration of King John's Castle, one of the finest historic buildings in the country. As I said in the House before, this medieval castle now has the appearance of ticket office in a roll-on/roll-off car ferry.  A glass and steel contraption was constructed during Deputy Kemmy's reign of authority in Limerick Corporation.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister, even at this eleventh hour, to reverse the decision which was taken yesterday and to ask his colleague, Deputy Kemmy, to mind his own business and to dismantle the glass menagerie he built in King John's Castle in Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the range of amendments he is introducing which have been accepted in the Dáil.  These amendments are commendable and will add greatly to the Bill.  They compact the detail of the Bill and make it more effective and all-inclusive.  I welcome the amendment which replaces &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; with &ldquo;works of architecture&rdquo;. I am delighted that included in this definition are a wide range of areas <Col N="1354" /> which have been defined by the Council of Europe's convention on the protection of architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>Once the legislation is passed there will he an onus on the Minister and his Department to get to work very quickly in identifying the wide variety of architectural structures and buildings which are covered by this section.  Some of the buildings which could be included but are not currently included may be open to plunder if developers become aware of this section.  There is a responsibility on the Minister to act quickly and to identify buildings and structures which have relevance under this section.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 &ldquo;includes railways and related buildings and structures and any place comprising the remains or traces of any such railway, building or structure&rdquo;.  This is particularly welcome. I am sorry this section was not in place years ago.  The West Clare Railway was world famous.  If this section had been in place years ago, we would have the remains of the old west Clare track and station.  Unfortunately no trace of them remains.  If their basic structure had remained and could be put back into operation, it could be a huge potential tourist attraction.  It would also be useful for economic purposes.  Given the condition of our roads, it would be very helpful if we had a railway through Clare rather than depending on the poor road network.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government made a decision yesterday on the three interpretative centres.  The Mullaghmore interpretative centre relates to the Burren, a very important national heritage which has unique landscape and topography and archaeological and historical monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the announcement of the introduction of a management plan for the greater Burren area.  This is a huge area which ranges from Gort to Corrofin to Lisdoonvarna to Fenore to Ballyvaughan and almost to New Quay.  In deciding on a management plan for that area, many factors will have to be taken into consideration and a great deal of work will have to be done.  This work <Col N="1355" /> will have to relate to the local authority and the county development plan.</P>
    <P>In this plan we are very conscious of the asset of the Burren and particular consideration is given to development and planning applications relating to the Burren.  Very serious discussions will have to take place between Clare County Council, the Department and the Office of Public Works on this management plan.  The farming organisations will also have to be consulted extensively.  Most of these lands are owned by farmers; some are operational, others are not.  They will need to be consulted and discussions will have to take place.  The public liability Bill going through the Oireachtas will have to be considered in relation to this overall management plan.  There are difficulties with access and lack of access to land and historical monuments. Every aspect needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>When announcing his decision the Minister stated that in the meantime partially constructed buildings are to be dismantled and the completed bus and car parks will be retained pending further consideration in light of the management plan.  The Minister may be able to advise the House whether the planning application currently before Clare County Council in relation to the retention of these parks will remain.  If planning permission is granted to retain them, will public toilet facilities be made available?  Will the parks be available to the public for parking or will there be locked gates?  It would be no harm if we could be given clarification of this.  It may be too early for the Minister to give me a reply at this stage but as soon as he has information I would welcome his view on this.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decided that all public authorities and Departments should apply for planning permission for any structures they wish to erect.  We in Fine Gael have been promoting this for a long time.  This decision to force the Office of Public Works to apply for planning permission was a good one. The fact that the Minister for the Marine <Col N="1356" /> agreed to apply for planning permission for Loran C is good.  Having said that, I do not agree with the decision of An Bord Pleanála on this issue.  I hope the Minister, now that he has made a decision on Mullaghmore, will help the Government to decide not to proceed with Loran C.  This has no economic advantage to Clare.  No benefits from a financial or tourism point of view will accrue from this.  One could argue that this is not the case with Mullaghmore. There was money available for the completion of this development. I hope the Minster will be in a position to spend the remaining money in the Corofin-Kilfenora area.</P>

      <P>This money should be available for the greater area. The management plan is very welcome but compiling and completing it could take considerable time.  We have in Kilfenora a centre which is in need of development and refurbishment work.  I appeal to the Minister to invest some of this money there.  In Corofin we have a fantastic heritage centre, which could also do with additional funding and could be further developed.  The Minister should ensure that the outstanding moneys are spent in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the amendments are technical, except for amendment No. 2 to section 2 which defines architectural heritage.  I welcome these amendments which dramatically improve the legislation. The Minister has now made a decision in relation to all three interpretative centres and the onus is on everybody to go forward.  Equally, there is a responsibility on all of us to respect and value our heritage, to treat it with the respect it deserves rather than abuse it.  We must appreciate that in our national heritage we have a major asset <Col N="1357" /> of great value that is part of our traditions as well as being a part of what we are.  This legislation will greatly enhance the preservation of that heritage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome this Bill and the changes to it that have taken place since we last discussed it.  A great number of those changes have overcome the problems that I had with the Bill.  I had not realised that on this occasion we must cover all the amendments in one speech.  I had assumed it was coming back on Committee Stage and so I will have to adjust my thinking on this.</P>
      <P>Since becoming a Member of the Seanad I have looked at all Bills coming through this House &mdash; in areas that I felt I had not got a particular ability to comment on &mdash; to see how they conform to modern management practices.  Having examined this Bill I am impressed and I am happy to congratulate the Minister on the changes and adaptations he has made, compared to what was in the Heritage Council Bill last year.</P>
      <P>As Senator Daly has already mentioned, having one body with overall responsibility for heritage is good management practice.  One difficulty though is the dual accountability &mdash; having two bosses &mdash; which is not good management practice, yet appears to exist in the Office of Public Works.  Obviously, that cannot be easily solved either in this case or in management practice generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking that into account, the Bill is worthy of support for the changes the Minister has undertaken to protect our heritage from the point of view of accountability.  Lately, I have been reading a book which I first read &mdash; though I am ashamed to say how old I am &mdash; back in the late 1950s.  It is called <i>Prosperity Through Competition</i> by Ludwig Erhard, the man who built the financial success story of modern Germany after the war.  In his book Erhard talked about the success of encouraging competition. I try to look on the many Bills which come through this House as <Col N="1358" /> though we are competitors in the market place and have to introduce good business management practice.  This involves checking who the stakeholders are in any organisation, and in the case of our heritage there are two of them. The first is the taxpayer, every citizen who wishes to see our heritage preserved, protected and, wherever possible, enhanced for the future.  The second stakeholder is the customer, not just our own citizens but those who envy the heritage that we have received from previous generations.</P>
    <P>How well have we protected ourselves in this legislation?  I think we have protected ourselves very well with regard to the customers.  From the point of view of heritage the Minister has done a good job in protecting the assets of the State for those who are going to value, avail of and benefit from them. Looking to see if I could find any way of improving this Bill, I found that many steps in the right direction have already been taken in the amendments introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have a number of changes to suggest in the area of introducing speed and urgency into the accountability reports of how the council and the heritage will be preserved.  Because I am more ambitious than the Minister.  I would seek a two-month period for accountability rather than the six months he suggests, although I am willing to negotiate on those limits.  I accept that there has been a big improvement since the last time we looked at this Bill because of the introduction of time limits on reporting.</P>
    <P>Section 21 (2) states that</P>
    <P>Accounts kept in pursuance of this section shall, not later than six months after the end of the financial year of the Council to which they relate, be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit...</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should give serious consideration to reducing that period of six months.  In modern business practice any business worth its while should be able to produce <Col N="1359" /> accounts much earlier than six months. I suggest a period of two months rather than six months, which, it seems to me, is letting off an organisation, particularly one such as a heritage council that is not in the competitive, commercial world and could produce accounts much earlier than six months.</P>
    <P>In section 21 (2), line 25, after the first word &ldquo;audit&rdquo;.  I would like to see the following words substituted, &ldquo;and such audit shall be completed by the Comptroller and Auditor General within two months of receipt of the accounts&rdquo;.  The Minister should set standards that need to be set as an example to other bodies in this State.  For a number of years I had the responsibility of being chairman of An Post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that the Senator is glad he is not there at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are working hard on it.</P>
      <P>In the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I discovered that the accounts were almost two years old, because they were part of a Department and there was no great urgency in those days.  In An Post we set ourselves standards by trying to have the accounts for that first year published within three months.  Part of our problem was that the Department to which we handed the accounts felt on occasion obliged to sit on them rather longer than we would have liked.  We wanted to hand over the accounts to the Minister and publish them the same day.  We were setting standards of three months for producing the accounts and that was not easily handled by the Department.  However.  I must congratulate them for having improved considerably over the past ten years.  In general, standards are being improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since being elected to this House I have looked at Bills to see if the number of months in which reports must be made can be reduced.  In regard to section 21, when the council hands over <Col N="1360" /> its reports the Comptroller and Auditor General could sit on that audit for a long period of time, because the wording of the particular section does not give any limitation; it just says &ldquo;and, immediately after the audit&rdquo;.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to insert the words I have suggested.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; inserted in section 21(2). line 31, so that that part of the section would read:</P>
    <P>... shall be presented to the Minister who shall cause copies of the documents so presented to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas forthwith.</P>
    <P>Each of those cases is an example of what I am trying to encourage the Minister to accept.  They are three areas under section 21 which are in the direction the Minister has already shown willingness to go with the amendments which he accepted in the other House. Those amendments either introduced a time limit for reporting or reduced it to a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The changes I am urging the Minister to consider are to section 21: line 23 to replace &ldquo;six months&rdquo; with &ldquo;one month&rdquo;, but I will agree to &ldquo;two months&rdquo;; line 25 after the words &ldquo;for audit&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and such audit shall be completed by the Comptroller and Auditor General within two months of receipt of the accounts&rdquo; and line 31 after the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister has set an example and has taken steps in the right direction.  I congratulate him on so doing and urge him to consider taking further steps as an example not just to those involved in heritage, but to those involved in all other State concerns which are able to say that this is the direction of the future and that they should urgently become more accountable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for taking on board many amendments, some of <Col N="1361" /> which were originally suggested in this House.  If all Ministers were as open minded we would have a very fruitful time in this and the other House.</P>
      <P>I welcome, in particular, the broadening of the scope of the Heritage Council to include the heritage aspect of the Office of Public Works.  With regard to Senator Daly's attacks on my colleague Deputy Kemmy, his memory is slipping a little because the monstrosity to which he referred was planned and erected by the then Fianna Fáil controlled city council.  It was merely opened by Deputy Kemmy; he did not build it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the amendments to section 5 on a matter I raised, which was to give the Heritage Council the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land. However, it has not been asked to maintain its property.  It would be an awful irony if the council was busy telling all other bodies how to go about their business while not maintaining its own property properly.  It may be in the Bill but I did not think it was stressed.  Perhaps, it does not need to be stressed and the Minister may be confident that the council will look after its own property. However, sad experience has shown that public bodies have not always been the best at maintaining their own property.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the educational aspects of the amendments and Deputy Quill's contribution.  I welcome this educational role for the Heritage Council. The Minister would agree that there is a need to look at our whole education system and the rather narrow examination basis of second level education.  I hope he will agree that there is a need to expand the role of teaching civics. Encouraging the protection of our national heritage should be an integral part of this broad civics based programme which should be compulsory.  It should not be something which an enthusiastic teacher does as a project in the transitional year; rather it should be part of civics training so that young people leave school with a very broad understanding and appreciation of our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> The work of the Heritage Council would be greatly enhanced if young people, in particular, had that broad understanding.  There is also a need for modules of adult education in this field as the public tends to leave it to what they call arty types whom they think are the only ones interested in our natural heritage.  However, it is everybody's natural heritage and we should all protect it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment dealing with educational bodies, I wonder if the definition of &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; is broad enough.  As the Minister is aware, outside of the local and regional authorities the number of bodies in receipt of vast quantities of public funds in terms of area partnership or Leader funding is mushrooming.  These bodies, which are not constituted by statute or as formally based as those which the Minister mentioned in his definition, have the power to obtain and dispose of buildings.  I would like to see an element of control over any acquisition they might make of buildings of architectural value, particularly bodies in receipt of public finances.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn about the inclusion of railways in section 2.  It is a pity this legislation and this power did not exist years ago.  In my home town of Newcastlewest there is a glorious station house which is falling into rack and ruin.  It was disposed of by Iarnród Éireann to two private concerns which many local bodies are afraid will not maintain the building in the style it deserves.  If this power had been on the Statute Book before Iarnród Éireann had disposed of the land it would have had to consult with the Heritage Council which could have determined the manner of the restoration or preservation of this building.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of concern in the west Limerick area about the old Limerick to Kerry railway line.  A group of people are trying to encourage the council to acquire this line from Iarnród Éireann but they are not having much success. Not only has it enormous tourist potential <Col N="1363" /> but it also passes through some remarkable botanical grounds.  Some of the plants that are growing along the old abandoned railway line are rare and unique and it is very much their wish that it would be preserved.  If the rail line is broken up and sold to individual farmers, these natural habitats will be at risk.  I know the Minister would not like me to pursue it too much, in line with what he has said about the power of the Heritage Council not to routinely acquire heritage properties; but this heritage property could be acquired by the council and developed in line with the local community groups.  As it is only a matter of one State body transferring ownership to another, the cost should not be that enormous.  It is not as if either body was there to make an enormous profit on the deal.</P>
    <P>Many in the Labour Party welcome the decision to stop the development at Mullaghmore.  Mullaghmore and the Burren region do not only belong to the people in the parishes of County Clare but to the country at large, and any decision made on that should take this into account.  However, the views of the locals should be consulted first, because they are important.  I am not trying to cut down their views or ideas.  They live there; they are entitled to have their views and to express them as forcibly as possible but this region belongs to the people of Ireland, who, at the end of the day, have the right to say what should become of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> The Bill has been very substantially improved by the amendments that were made both here and in the Lower House.  I congratulate the Minister for his openness in the way that he has dealt with the amendments, several of which were moved by my party.  When the Bill was coming through this House, the Minister accepted the need to include the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo; in the Title of the Bill, as well as &ldquo;appreciation&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;.  The Minister also agreed to the proposal to have a standing committee on inland waterways, which are one of our greatest national heritage resources.  The Minister was also kind enough to accept the need to include regional authorities and to reduce the age of heritage objects from 50 years, as originally proposed, to 25 years.  Subsequently in these amendments, the Minister agreed to Deputy Quill's proposals to have the educational aspect, the railways and the accounting period included.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is necessary to formally second the amendment proposed by Senator Quinn, but if it is, I am prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>There was a point raised about the new section 24 and the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I can see a certain merit in some of the arguments that Senator Daly made, not in respect of Mullaghmore but of the function of the Commissioners of Public Works and the Office of Public Works. It appears there will be a division of responsibility between different Government Departments and that can lead to confusion.  Having said that, I also agree that the matters within the scope of the Bill most appropriately lie within the ambit of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Since the Minister is responsible for the legislation, therefore it is logical that in this area the Commissioners of Public Works should fall within his control.  However, I do see a potential difficulty arising here with different Government Departments. Perhaps the Minister when he replies might address what the outcome of that might be.  There is a requirement that <Col N="1365" /> the section should stand in a legal sense, but there is likely to be an outcome from it.</P>
    <P>The matter of Mullaghmore is relevant to section 24 of the Bill.  The Minister will be aware that there was a Progressive Democrats Private Members' motion before the House last week which asked him, among other things. not to proceed with the project.  I am pleased to see that the Minister and the Government have made that decision. During the course of that debate it was a disappointment that when it came to call for a division, Senator Henry was the only person, apart from myself and Senator Honan, who supported the need for one.  There was no division because the Leader of the Fine Gael group indicated that in the event of one occurring, his group would abstain. Senator Sherlock, on behalf of Democratic Left, said that he strongly supported the motion and, of course. Senator O'Sullivan did agree with the need to stop proceeding with the project. This was not in any way to preempt the Government decision &mdash; that was obviously a matter for the Government &mdash; but it was trying to indicate clearly a position in respect of this and other interpretative centres.  I thank the Minister for the decision he has made; it is a good one.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in this debate does not lie with whether we should have interpretative or heritage centres but with where they should be located.  It is unquestionably the case that in respect of Mullaghmore, apart from whatever problems that might arise about the protection of the flora in the area, the nature of the geology of the area would make it highly undesirable that a structure with large numbers of people going through should be located over porous limestone with the potential for the pollution of ground water.  The point was made about the large numbers of people going into Coole Park and that this in some way would be a defence for the progress of the Mullaghmore centre. That is again a completely different matter in the sense that we are dealing <Col N="1366" /> with different geology.  I do not accept the point that since there is one situation for Coole Park, the same should apply for Mullaghmore.  It should be said, however, that if the house at Coole Park had not been demolished in the first place, there would be no need at all for an interpretative centre.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest heritage elements we have are our great houses and we are losing them at an alarming rate.  The difficulty with the Bill is that it cannot deal with those items which are in private ownership.  If we take a building of the stature of Tullynally Castle in Castlepollard &mdash; if Senator Cassidy were here, he would make this point &mdash; or Carton House in County Kildare, they are of immense importance not only nationally but internationally.  They have the capacity to generate large sums of money from tourist revenue and the Minister will have to give some attention to it in consequence of this Bill.  I accept that the private element will have to be dealt with separately, but something will have to be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to Minister's decision to retain car parks at Luggala, it is obvious if one looks at the aerial pictures or if one has visited Luggala or Mullaghmore as I have, that it is illogical to expect, having spent £3.5 million, that we are going to return these sites to the pristine condition they were in before this environmental vandalism was imposed upon them.  The Minister's decision is therefore sensible as the provision of car parks provides access for the public, and I cannot even envisage a situation where trees would be planted at Luggala.</P>
    <P>I raised a question on the motion for Private Members' Business last week which I now put to the Minister again. Is there any evidence in either Luggala or Mullaghmore that public moneys continued to be expended when it was apparent by virtue of judgments by the courts.  An Bord Pleanála or the Government, that these developments might not proceed?  Is there any evidence that people spent money in the expectation that, having demonstrated that this money was spent, it would <Col N="1367" /> influence the outcome of decisions made by the Government or elsewhere? If, as has been suggested, we have spent £3.5 million, I would regard it as money well spent if it led to legislation imposing the need for planning on public authorities, to improved legislation in the planning area and if it made us concentrate our minds to the degree to which they have been concentrated on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to the farming community and the difficulties or otherwise of farming within the relevant area of County Clare.  This raises another question which will become increasingly important in the coming years, and it is one to which the Minister may give some thought.  It is the degree to which people living in those areas of enormous national and international significance are expected to be the custodians of that environment.  Is it required of the farming community that it pays the price of maintaining these areas in pristine condition for the benefit of the tourists and of the people who visit them?</P>
    <P>The fundamental conundrum in the Mullaghmore situation and in other situations is to balance the needs, priorities, desires and rights of local communities which wish to remain viable, to live and to continue to live in their areas, against the broader rights of Irish society and, in the case of the Burren. international society.  However, there is a cost involved and the question arises as to whether that cost falls to the people who live there, or whether it falls to the greater society.  In the event that society decrees that the value of the resource is such that it must be protected for the community at large, for the international community and for posterity, it falls to society at large to fund whatever is being talked about in terms of protection.</P>
    <P>This issue has arisen in areas of England.  For example, in the Lake District farmers are given assistance because they are compelled to maintain their stone walls in a certain condition <Col N="1368" /> or because they are compelled to maintain the farmhouses, out buildings and so on.  These are questions which we will have to address at some stage and it is highly unlikely that we are going to have the resources to deal with it effectively. It is an issue which is relevant to section 24 of the Bill, concerning the functions of the Office of Public Works and the Commissioners of Public Works and how they relate to these situations.</P>
    <P>I am pleased about the aspect of the Bill dealing with waterways.  A magnificent job has been undertaken by the restoration committee on the Royal Canal and in this respect we must acknowledge the work undertaken by the Office of Public Works throughout the country in renovating our waterways and improving them, especially a waterway which is familiar to Senator Mooney in his part of the country, that between Ballinamore and Lough Erne.</P>
    <P>The legislation is very fine, but unless those responsible are given the resources, it will only be another Act on a shelf and it will not achieve the objective which the Minister has for it. Adequate funding must be made available to allow the council to perform its duties effectively and well.  I agree with the point made by Senator Kelly regarding the funds now being made available to the partnership companies through Leader.  Many of the Leader groups have undertaken very valuable work in terms of renovating local buildings of a heritage quality which had fallen into disuse or disrepair &mdash; for example, old churches or monuments.  Leader funding has been made available and, as this amounts to public moneys, it is important that we ensure they are well spent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements which have been made to the Bill, and it has been substantially improved.  I commend the Minister for the openness with which he accepted the amendments, both in this House and the other House, and for bringing back amendments to deal with the points raised where necessary. I hope the Bill will achieve the objective which the Minister has for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I gather from slight difficulties he had in delivering the detail of the amendments that he may be suffering from a condition which I experienced last week and I hope it will not be long before he recovers from his cold.  It is a most debilitating experience to endure when attempting to address people.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill and the amendments before the House today, I am saddened that this legislation was not before the House many years ago.  I could not help think, for example, of my late father and many others who in the latter part of the 1950s fought against the obdurate bureaucracy of the then CIE, who, once the decision to close them was taken, refused to see any potential whatsoever in not only the retention of the branch railway lines throughout Ireland but in at least retaining and maintaining the buildings past which those railways had run.</P>
      <P>It is an indictment of our predecessors and of the planning ethos of that time that they dismissed completely the intrinsic value of our railways and our structures.  I heartily endorse the comments of my colleagues, especially Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Kelly, in that it is important that railways have been included under the provisions of the Bill.  In this context I could not help think of a small community &mdash; and perhaps it is the kind of thing the Minister has in mind &mdash; not far from me in Drumshanbo called Drumcong.  It is a rural community and its main focal point is a bar and grocery, a church and a school and it adjoins the Shannon-Erne waterway.  Within that small area a refurbishment of an old church is taking place, there is a designated dolmen within two or three minutes' drive, and on Lough Scur, which adjoins this community, there are the remnants of what is known as Reynold's Fort, an underground jail where one of the feudal lords of days past cast away his opponents for indeterminable periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local development organisation in that small community has embarked <Col N="1370" /> on an impressive programme of restoration and maintenance.  It would be remiss of me not to make the Minister aware of an application by the community in Kiltubrid for funding for their church under the recent EU initiative which is being administered by the Office of Public Works and which will now become part of the Minister's remit.  The initiative to fund ecclesiastical buildings of merit throughout the EU is currently under investigation and I understand the Office of Public Works will submit its final recommendations to the relevant section of the Commission by 31 March.</P>
    <P>A limited amount of money is available and the Office of Public Works will recommend to the Commission the applications received by the closing date at the end of January which meet the eligibility standards.  I ask the Minister, if he has influence in this matter, to use it to direct some of the money towards the small community in Kiltubrid.  The community has already expended a considerable amount of money at local level.  It is the type of structure and area that the Minister had in mind in this Bill.  I appreciate that the European Commission will ultimately decide on eligibility.  However, the Minister might take note of this matter.  I will write to him about it when this Bill becomes law because it will come under his aegis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the incorporation of the heritage aspects of the activities of the Office of Public Works into the Minister's Department.  As he has said repeatedly, it is a natural consequence of the brief given to him by the Government in 1993.  While obviously there will be growing pains, especially for an organisation that pre-dates the foundation of the State, it is only logical that the heritage aspects of that office's work should come under the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 10 relate to the ownership of buildings.  The Minister has clarified that he is introducing provisions in this Bill similar to those which already exist in legislation for the establishment of statutory bodies such <Col N="1371" /> as An Bord Gaeilge and An Bord Glas. However, the Heritage Council is different to those quoted as examples in the context of this amendment.  I am not against the inclusion of the amendments. However, I wonder what the consequences will be, particularly with regard to gifts to the State.  Is it true that bequests or gifts were taken on by the Office of Public Works or are gifts to the nation the responsibility of the Department of Finance?  This is a small point but I am curious about the future situation regarding bequests of buildings of architectural and historical merit to the State.  Does that now come under the Minister's aegis or will it first go to the Heritage Council?</P>
    <P>I am pleased and not surprised that the Minister accepted the amendment proposed by Deputy Quill in the Lower House.  I am a member of one of the boards of studies attached to the National Council for Vocational Awards.  This particular board of studies is responsible for communications in the performing arts.  Over the last couple of weeks I have been pleased to note that the number of modules coming before us for consideration for inclusion as part of the school curriculum in post-leaving certificate courses include an increasing number of modules which reflect an interest in local history and heritage matters.  This might address the comments made by Senator Kelly about second level education.  The trend I have seen over the last two months has been towards the initiation of such modules in PLC courses so at least it is happening at that level.  I wonder if the Heritage Council and, in the wider context, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht might consider the establishment of a bursary or some form of encouragement for students who wish to include heritage subjects in their modules in adult education.  That would be important and there would be widespread consensus on the issue.  Perhaps either the council or the Department might take that suggestion on board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> Amendment No. 12 places a time limit on the Heritage Council for the return of its accounts to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is generally accepted that this Bill is long on aspiration but somewhat limited in its financial scope. It will rely heavily on the Department of Finance to fund its objectives.  What will be the financial implications of this Bill?  Many of the sections have a financial consequence.  Deputy Connor during the Dáil debate on Second Stage dwelt in considerable detail on the financial shortcomings of this legislation. He asked &mdash; and I am interested to know if the Minister pursued this matter &mdash; that the Minister include all aspects of the spending of EU funding in the remit of the council.</P>
    <P>As I remarked in the context of the EU initiative on ecclesiastical buildings of architectural merit, there is an increasing amount of money becoming available from European sources. Admittedly, the amount is small but there is an increasing number of initiatives in this area coming from Europe. Does the Minister see this as part of his remit?  I appreciate that, as the Minister pointed out, many of the operational programmes were already at an advanced stage when the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht was set up.  However, I presume the Department has examined this matter.</P>
    <P>At the risk of repeating myself.  I wish to emphasise the promotion of the educational aspects of our heritage. Although it might be premature, could the Minister outline if the Heritage Council will take a proactive role in this area?  I am thinking in terms of mainstream commercial advertising and promotion rather than a subdued policy of circulating large unread press releases and missives to schools and institutions. The Minister will agree it is important that the general public be educated rather than just the school going population.</P>
    <P>Education is not necessarily confined to academic institutions, there is a wider public role.  As a member of the Board of Studies of the National Council for <Col N="1373" /> Vocational Awards I see increasing evidence that modules are being prepared with a large local history content.  Perhaps the Department and the Minister might take an initiative in this area by providing bursaries or scholarships for those who have an interest in developing local history, perhaps to Ph.D. level.  It is a new area which is beginning to be recognised at academic level.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 provides that the minimum membership of the council will be 14.  I welcome the commitment of the Government to gender balance although I am a late convert to the idea of quotas.  I have not been totally convinced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am, however, a late convert to gender quotas and have not become a zealot.  The experience in Europe has been that unless legislation provides for access for women to positions of power and influence, it will not happen on its own.  If we were to have a debate on quotas and gender balance, the Minister and I would not be too far apart; while it is not the best method it seems to be the only method to redress the inequity.</P>
      <P>We should go further, although perhaps not in this Bill because the Minister is anxious for it to become law.  In the wider philosophical discussion on gender, would he consider providing not only that there should be a 50-50 gender balance but that the chairperson or cathaoirleach of these bodies should be a woman?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Minister to an article in the last issue of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> by Ms Terry Prone, who is well known to Members as a communications consultant. She argued forcibly that while women are packed at the lower end of the executive scale, there seems to be some monster eating these executives; <Col N="1374" /> at middle management level they thin out to the point of being negligible or non-existent, when ordinarily they would have gravitated to a higher executive level.  She cited various examples in both the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>In progressing the logic behind a gender balance and quotas, introduced by the partnership Government and by this Government, perhaps the Minister should provide legislatively that the chairpersons of statutory bodies under his aegis should be women.  They might not naturally gravitate to the higher positions; it is not happening in the public or private sectors so one has to assume it will not happen in areas under his control.</P>
    <P>That move would be supported by anyone who favours gender balances and women assuming positions of power and influence at the highest level.  No one would be against nudging them towards that utopia by insisting in the initial stages of this revolution that they be appointed to high positions.</P>
    <P>I have refrained from involvement in the controversy on the Government decisions about Mullaghmore and Luggala. I may be wrong about this, but can the Minister assure me this legislation will not result in vocal minority groups holding up progressive initiatives, especially in tourism, because of a view that all significant heritage areas should remain virgin territory?  The spokespersons for some environmental groups &mdash; I am choosing my words carefully &mdash; tend to be people who have moved to this country for the valid and attractive reason that Ireland offers an unparallelled quality of life.  This view should not have an exaggerated influence on job creation opportunities in the heritage and cultural tourism area that will assist in stabilising rural communities, such as the one I mentioned in Kiltubrid.</P>
    <P>This is a wide issue but I would he interested in the Minister's thoughts on the matter.  There are people who have moved to this country for a specific reason and hold somewhat narrow views. <Col N="1375" /> While their views are valid and they may have the strongest environmental reasons for taking public positions either for or against proposals of a heritage nature, they have a single agenda in that they have moved to this country primarily and specifically because of what they perceive to be virgin territory which should be left completely untouched.  I do not agree with that extreme view and I am curious to know whether a balanced view will be taken of the activities of the National Heritage Council in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I enthusiastically welcome the Bill.  If the Minister was not in this position, this legislation might not have come before the House for some time as it would not have been seen as a priority.  We have come a long way since I was living in England and read in my local newspaper about a councillor, long since gone to his eternal reward, who bitterly opposed an increase in the estimate for library books on the basis that the people did not need books; what they wanted was roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a fhearadh roimh an Aire chun an Teach seo.  Tá súil agam go bhfeicfimid go minic é sa Teach sna blianta atá le teacht &mdash; mar Aire, dár ndóigh agus ní mar Sheanadóir.  I have some specific points about the amendments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the inclusion of genealogical records under amendment No. 3. How does the Minister envisage the relationship developing between this type of record keeping and archival record keeping in the State and what cooperation or co-ordination will there be?  This is not meant as an adversarial question but in terms of the longer term strategic &mdash; if I may use that much abused word &mdash; development of records, what relationship will there be between those of cultural importance, of historical importance and of research importance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also warmly welcome the inclusion of education under amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  I listened with great interest to <Col N="1376" /> the Minister saying the study of heritage should be included in the schools curriculum; I agree with him and with Senator Kelly and Senator Mooney, who endorsed that position.  I wonder if the phraseology in the Bill provides the Minister with as much reinforcement as he would wish in that direction, although there is no better man to look after those interests.</P>
    <P>The reference to education mentions the need to promote interest, education, knowledge and pride in heritage.  That is welcome but education is a general word.  Would one wish to see reference to education within the formal educational system as well as more generally or can it be taken that &ldquo;education&rdquo; encompasses specific inclusion in the formal system?</P>
    <P>Likewise in amendment No. 9 to section 6 (3) (b), I presume the reference to educational bodies includes educational bodies at all levels &mdash; perhaps I am being pernickety here.  There should be no reservation about the types of educational bodies to which the activities might relate.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the possibility of the council providing some financial incentives for heritage studies in the form of bursaries and so on.  I would encourage anything in that direction. In my own department last year we introduced an MA in local history.  That is the direction in which third level institutions should be moving.  The heritage dimension can be very fruitfully included at second level and, indeed, to an extent at first level.  Within the context of a civics education, to which Senator Kelly referred, I would enthusiastically endorse developments in that direction.  Anything that would enhance the status of heritage within education is well worth supporting and the Seanad should do anything it can to reinforce, if necessary, the Minister's commitment in that area.</P>
    <P>As we all know, heritage is a fragmented sector.  I do not know the ins and outs &mdash; and I am not even going to inquire about them at this stage as it would be highly indelicate &mdash; of the <Col N="1377" /> diversity of opinions which may have been expressed within the general bureaucracy and within and between Departments and sections about the way things are going.  However, diversity need not mean fragmentation provided there is a core sense of heritage values informing the approach taken by the public, the bureaucracy and the politicians. The Minister has made an unprecedented contribution to the fostering of a heritage ethos among the public and I hope he is succeeding in doing so among his colleagues and in the Civil Service.  It is an extremely important contribution and one of historic importance in terms of our self image as a society.  I wish the Minister well in the further fostering of that ethos.  This Bill will make a major contribution to its development.  I welcome the Bill and the energy and imagination that underlies it and I wish it well.</P>

      <P>Tá mé thar a bheith buíoch do na Seanadóirí as ucht na tuairimí a nochtaigh siad arís maidir leis na leasuithe atá déanta sa Dáil don reachtaíocht seo agus na tuairimí a nochtaigh siad an chéad uair.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their interest and their thoughtful contributions on this legislation, which equalled their interest in the legislation to amend the National Monuments Act which was enacted last year.  I appreciate and value the genuine concern for our heritage on all sides of this House.  I am delighted to have been able to accept Committee Stage amendments because the quality of the legislation has been improved as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge again the excellent work of the existing non-statutory National Heritage Council, which, under the chairmanship of Lord Killanin, has done such good work.  I had a great and frank relationship with them, though at times not always one of agreement. We have a good relationship, but they stood their ground at a time when they did not have statutory support.  I look forward to developing an equally <Col N="1378" /> good relationship with the new statutory and autonomous Heritage Council. Elected representatives should think long about that word &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo; because they will see it in letters from me.  The purpose of autonomy and responsibility is that I do not interfere and that is why the council are getting powers and being established as a result of the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said in my introduction, the setting up of the Heritage Council as a statutory corporation must be viewed in the context of an overall strategy in setting up the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  This point has been noted by Senators.  Policy formulation in the Department will be assisted by a group of corporate bodies with particular specialist membership who will, in addition to providing advice, also carry out specified executive functions which are outside the ambit of existing institutions.</P>
    <P>A heritage policy unit will draw all aspects of heritage together.  This Bill will <i>inter alia</i> set up one of these bodies, An Chomhairle Oidhreachta.  This should also be seen as part of a package of legislative measures which have been. or are in the process of being, prepared in my Department.  As I already stated, the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, has been enacted.  We now add this Bill and my Department is working on proposals to amend the Wildlife Act, which will be the third component.  We will provide new legislation for museums, libraries and parks.</P>
    <P>We will then have a body of legislation which will take the heritage area and make it strong.  From that will derive the strength of institutions.  We can argue for resources and we will be able to endorse and ratify various European Directives.  As a <i>corpus</i> of legislation, it will compare well with what is available in Europe and it will also be modern.  It will then be given an institutional expression to bring us past the end of this century and into the next.  I appreciate Senators' contributions because this component of the legislation package provides a sound building block.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> I wish to address as fully as I can some of the points made, given the time constraint.  I do not want to delay my own legislation.  A number of Senators raised the question of the clarification of functions.  I would like to be forthright about this.  When I became Minister early in 1993, it was expressed that I was responsible for future policy and that the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works was responsible for implementation.  The idea was that I would decide the general guidelines of policy, we would then agree a year's programme and the Minister of State would look after its implementation. In practice there were difficulties deciding what was policy and what was implementation, what was new and what was ongoing and so forth.</P>
    <P>It made sense, when the present Government was being formed, to try to resolve this by putting it on a statutory basis.  Most Members will be delighted to hear that there have been two Government orders &mdash; one dated December 1994 and the other March 1995 &mdash; which transferred to me all the functions of the Minister for Finance as far as they affect the heritage areas.  This means that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is now responsible for national parks and the wildlife service, the national monuments and historic property service, and the waterways service.</P>
    <P>The work of the Office of Public Works has been admired for a long time by over 90 per cent of the people in this country.  It is of an excellent standard and no one wants to damage that. However, the public are entitled to know who answers Dáil questions and matters raised in the Seanad.  They are entitled to know where the buck stops in relation to heritage.  I am responsible for heritage.  One then has to decide what happens to the other matters dealt with by the Office of Public Works.  A decision on future functions is a matter for the Government.  However, members of the public and elected representatives are entitled to know where <Col N="1380" /> the responsibility for policy and the accountability for a year's work lies.  I take that responsibility and I exercise it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay by mentioning matters which are not strictly within the ambit of the legislation, but I want to reply to the references made about my exercising this power.  I mentioned the dates December 1994 and March 1995. Any suggestion I made in relation to heritage policy was entirely proper in terms of the Government orders that were made.  I do not want to contribute to any recrimination in relation to the decision that was taken.  It is better that a decision has been made and we should learn from it.  Let us admit that the State needed to be told by the Supreme Court that it had to apply for planning permission. Out of dark things come bright things.  We now have legislation requiring the State to do that and I welcome it.  It is a good thing.  We now need to manage the interaction of our heritage. community development and tourism in ways which will be ecologically responsible, dignified in relation to tourism and hopefully achieve a consensus.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to my announcement in which I mentioned a management plan.  It seems to me to make sense that what is done should be placed in the context of a management plan which includes aims and principles of accountability.  The idea in the case of Wicklow is to develop a plan which will serve that area according to the criteria I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The same will apply in relation to the county in which I was reared, County Clare.  I am from the south of Clare rather than the north, and some might suggest that is a good thing at the moment.  I am familiar with and have a great feeling for the county, but anything I say or have said is aimed towards having a management plan and looking at it in context.  We should remember that preparatory documents, such as the Brady shipment plan, are already available. We can integrate our response to the future with these other planning documents, and such consultations have <Col N="1381" /> taken place with the local authority. Groups should be consulted.</P>
    <P>An historic shift in culture is required. There was a time in Irish culture when people imagined that if one presented people with nearly finished items, they would accept them.  However, we are now at a point in our cultural history where people want to see things in the shapes that are to come before their consent is presumed.  We must operate in that manner.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of waiting 25 years for any management plan; I am not noted for tardiness.  However long the Killarney plan took &mdash; and I have an idea that it did not take that long &mdash; it was a prototype plan.  Other plans which derive from it should not necessarily need the same basis work which was required on that occasion.</P>

      <P>It has not reached the level of the debate about Paris yet.  I have covered some of Senator Daly's points.  He asked about functions and I have addressed that issue.  There is also the point that the Office of Public Works predates the State.  There may well be points at which they have statutory functions which are derived from the Ministers and Secretaries Act of the 1920s.  The Government is reviewing the position this regard, not in the sense of being any way destructive of the Office of Public Works, but of merging its statutory functions with the functions I am taking, among others, in relation to heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's point that timescales should be imposed.  My <Col N="1382" /> initial difficulty was interesting, in that if one was late with the accounts, should one use it as an excuse for being late with the report also.  I brought forward the report to change it around so that the report could go ahead, but one would require the accounts to be presented.  All I can say to the Senator at this stage is that I hope to address the aims he suggested by good managerial practice.</P>
    <P>I have responsibility and accountability for a number of different bodies. If I found that there were inordinate delays everywhere in relation to those bodies and legislation was necessary, I would consider introducing a short Bill. It is not good that a report comes out a year or two years late; this is not an example we should give to people.  It is a question of civics and it is good practice to report on what one does.  I will aim to achieve, through administrative practice immediately, the issues raised by the Senator.  I will keep it in mind if we need to return to this point.</P>
    <P>There are two points in the Government policy agreement regarding buildings which constitute architectural heritage. Statutory protection will be given to listed buildings and a full national architectural audit will also be carried out.  A number of Senators were interested in this area and asked about it.  An interdepartmental committee has been established to examine both of these matters.  Officials from my Department, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works constitute the committee and I expect a report before the end of the year.  We will then be in a position to move forward on that issue.</P>
    <P>I am not ignoring points raised by Senators, but I do not want to repeat myself.  Senator Taylor-Quinn welcomed the reference to architectural heritage and the management plan in north County Clare.  She also asked about planning applications.  In relation to the future of the planning application to Clare County Council, my personal impression is that a new application will be required.  It is best to look at everything <Col N="1383" /> in the context of what the management plan indicates is appropriate. There is also hope around which consensus can develop.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly made a number of points.  I am happy that the definition of public authority is wide enough at present.  The Bill provides control over heritage buildings in the ownership of public authorities.  The problem with extending public authority in the ownership sections is that one could encounter constitutional difficulties.  However, the committee to which I referred carrying out the audit will be able to address this issue and come up with proposals which I can then consider.  Senator Kelly also welcomed the general broadening of the Bill and many Senators welcomed the inclusion of railways and related buildings.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Dardis for his party's amendments, both here and in the other House.  I agree that funding is required for the Bill.  Senator Mooney made a number of valuable points.  For his information, there are 85 applications for funding at present.  It is a small amount of money, but I wish his district every success.  It is the type of scheme which should be developed in the future.  It is a project which should qualify in an application to the Heritage Council when it is constituted.</P>
    <P>I also thank the Senator for pointing out that this is the second time I have legislated for gender equality.  Under the Broadcasting Act, the RTE Authority must be composed of either three, three and one or four, four and one.  We have also legislated in that regard in this Bill.  Would that it were not necessary, but it is necessary to make a point.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee made a number of valuable points.  I assure him that the reference to genealogical records was to include it as a fact.  The question of the keeping of archives and the responsibility of transfer is in the legislation dealing with the archives council.  One has a duty in relation to practice, while the other is a reference for inclusion in relation to what constitutes an archive. <Col N="1384" /> I deliberately inserted education so that it would not only be State education, but include all forms of education at all levels.  It is inclusive in the most general sense.</P>
    <P>In relation to other bodies, the Senator's idea is fragmentation.  I assure him that we need autonomy with responsibility, but with a clear delineation of accountability.  When we get the legislation right, we can make a case for funding.  If we have the public behind us and involve ourselves in acts of education, we will have taken a significant step forward.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach. I have always been doubtful of the value of navel gazing in this situation.  We have had this debate before, but navel gazing when there is a football match on is pretty unproductive and does not rival the alternative entertainment. I do not expect an enormous audience here this afternoon but I understand the circumstances in which we find ourselves here debating this particular subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a Member of Seanad Éireann now for 14 years or something close to that.  When I became a Member of this House first I found the procedures, motions and the composition of this House somewhat frustrating, but at the time I admit I had a different status.  I now speak with a different hat on and find it easier to understand the workings of this House. That does not mean that many of us who are a part of the institutional establishment and the parties in this House do not find some of its procedures and methods frustrating and do not believe <Col N="1385" /> that there is a case for Seanad reform; indeed there is.</P>
    <P>Many of the criticisms which have been levelled at this House have come from the Progressive Democrats.  I suppose it is tactless to remind them, because they do not remind us very often, being Members of this House, that one of the great pillars of their platform when they were launching themselves and afterwards was the abolition of this House.  That had a particularly attractive populist ring about it, but they did not seem, when it came to the point, to find it so attractive to ignore the place.</P>
    <P>It would only be fair to acknowledge that those who called for this House's abolition so loudly have been, paradoxically, some of the most constructive contributors to its debates.  That is a paradox which they have not resolved.  I presume abolition of the Seanad is an issue about which they have changed their minds in the intervening period.  It would be interesting to hear a more recent revision of their attitudes to this particular issue and to hear whether they find that their own contributions to this House have been so useful that they think its existence is still justifiable. When the Progressive Democrats come to speak on this they might enlighten us about this.</P>
    <P>The call for abolition of this House was a very hollow one.  It was one which was made in the particular circumstances at the time when there was great frustration with politics and the Seanad became to some extent a target for that frustration.  It shows a lack of knowledge of the activities of the Members of this House and a lack of understanding of why this House was set up; it also panders to populist prejudices.  Whenever a party or an individual calls for something which knocks politicians in the public interest they are absolutely certain to touch a chord among the public, especially if they say that money is being wasted on politicians' salaries. Nobody outside political life ever disagrees with that.  I do not believe that Members of either House are overpaid <Col N="1386" />&mdash; I think they are overworked and underpaid &mdash; but there is scope for giving them more constructive work to do for the salaries which they draw.</P>
    <P>The question of whether the Seanad should exist or whether it should be improved could just as easily be applied to the other House.  In many ways the Seanad plays a more constructive and less combative role than the other House.  People outside the Seanad who have a startling ignorance of the purpose of the House often ask what it achieves and why it is there.  Putting aside recent events in the other House. which were quite unique in that a Government changed, and laudably changed, without a general election, one might well ask before that whether there was any real point in the other House meeting three or four times a week and discussing legislation when the result of legislation was nearly always decided before it reached the Chamber.  It is one of the faults in our parliamentary democracy that, by design, the Government and civil servants make decisions and the Houses of the Oireachtas to a large extent rubberstamp those decisions.  It is not always true, but it is often true.  The Seanad leaves an enormous amount of room for improvement and is beginning to offer room for improvement in the area of legislation and where Bills are initiated here.</P>
    <P>It is a very good thing for the Seanad that the Government is in a minority here, which offers great possibilities for this House which are already being exploited.  One of the major criticisms offered against this House was that it was purely a mirror image of the other House.  It was not even a revision chamber; it was a place where patronage flourished and where legislation passed through without alteration and without notice.  In the present circumstances that is patently not true.  Where the Government has a minority it has to take account of the wishes of the Opposition parties and the Independents and, worse still for a Government, it has to take notice of the views of the people <Col N="1387" /> within its own ranks.  That is a great strength for the Seanad at the moment, because no legislation is guaranteed the same easy passage now as it was six months ago and no one is more aware of this than the Opposition and the Independents in this House.</P>
    <P>Legislation now has to be negotiated through this House rather than rubber stamped.  It has been negotiated through this House with enormous skill in recent weeks.  We have had, as Senators will know, contentious and controversial legislation which has given rise to certain difficulties for Members of the House; but all the legislation has passed, because its value has been explained to independent Members and because nobody with the true interests of the nation or of this House at heart will use the Seanad merely as a platform to make political capital.  If people in this new unique situation behave irresponsibly, the Seanad itself will suffer and will come under the microscope.  That is exactly the sort of situation which I think was envisaged originally by those who set up at least the theory of a second Chamber, even if it did not work in practice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government is in a minority.  A minority situation is ideal for any Seanad because it means that the passage of legislation must be negotiated.  It must take an input from those who are not on the Government side.  That does not mean an adversarial system or that there has to be particularly hostile party political argument in this House.  It means amendments must be negotiated, examined by Ministers and treated on their merits, but must not be rejected because they are from a certain source.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil amendments, proposals, Bills and all types of initiatives are almost automatically rejected if they come from the Opposition.  In the Seanad that is no longer the case, as has been seen on large and small matters, on amendments to legislation and procedural matters.  We have seen agreements negotiated between the Government <Col N="1388" /> and Opposition sides in this House, and long may that last.  Legislation will be improved as a result of this quirk in the Seanad arithmetic.</P>
    <P>Strange circumstances have given rise to the mathematics of the Seanad and the consequent welcome situation.  The circumstances can initially be put down to there being 11 Taoiseach's nominees to the Seanad.  That is a pity and should be looked at.  The great irony of the present Seanad is that of those 11 who were appointed, a majority are now on the Opposition benches.  That was never envisaged by the Constitution, because the Constitution did not envisage a change of Government without a general election.</P>
    <P>If there had been a change of Government without an election and all 11 nominees had been on the Government side and had gone into Opposition, the position would have been untenable as the Opposition majority would have been too big and would have made it impossible for the Government to operate in the Seanad.  It makes one wonder whether the thinking behind an inbuilt majority for the Government in the Seanad was good thinking.  When Mr. de Valera and John Charles McQuaid and whoever else he consulted about the Constitution got together they decided it was most important for the Seanad to have a Government majority and beyond that they did not mind too much about it.</P>
    <P>The lesson of recent times is that we do not need Taoiseach's nominees. They are used as ruthless instruments of patronage; used by all sides as a means of guaranteeing a majority and giving out party political favours to those who failed to get elected to the Dáil, who had done some service for the party or who happened to be a friend of the hierarchy and establishment of the time. They are not appointed on merit.  That is not to say that some or all of them do not have outstanding achievements in their field and have something to contribute to this House.  However, it means their first loyalty is to the Taoiseach or Tánaiste, or to a political party, <Col N="1389" /> and that forces them to take certain actions which denigrates the value of this House to some extent.</P>
    <P>It is not right to be totally impractical; it is important that the Seanad does not obstruct legislation willy-nilly.  It is not a democratically elected body, so we do not have the democratic mandate of the Dáil.  It has been searching for a function for many years and has not yet identified it.  The original idea of the Seanad was that it should be a revision chamber; that it should combine the great and the good, the wise, the young and the old, who represent certain interests in society; that they should look again at legislation passed by the Dáil, discuss it and have the powers to amend it, but to use those powers sparingly.</P>
    <P>In theory that is a worthy objective. In practice, as most Members will be loath to admit, it has become almost entirely a party political Chamber.  It has become a poor reflection of the Dáil.  On the whole, those who sit in this House have been happy and complacent to accept that role because most in this House, including me, have at some stage tried to be or have been elected to the Dáil.  That presents a serious problem to the House in its search for a role.  The actions of Members of the House are governed by that past political ambition or by other ambitions elsewhere, which means their loyalty to the original idea of this House is questionable and their loyalty to a political party is paramount. That remains unresolved.</P>
    <P>The House will know that originally there were 43 seats on various panels, 11 Taoiseach's nominees and six university seats.  Of those 43 seats which are divided into several panels and subpanels, in order to achieve the theoretical objective a large number are selected by vocational bodies.  The theory is that people involved in education, farming, culture, administration &mdash; which I have never quite understood &mdash; labour, trade unions and industry should offer their expertise in those areas having qualified as candidates on the panels which demanded certain qualifications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> That theory is worthy; but in practice, as everybody knows, the electorate which elects these people are the country councillors, county borough councillors and the outgoing Senators and TDs. The problem, as few of us are happy to admit, is that nearly all those people are members of political parties and vote only for members of political parties. Thus, the Seanad is elected with 43 Members who are political party members; the Taoiseach nominates 11 people to give him the majority, and there is a reflection of the Dáil.  Suddenly, all those worthy aspirations reflected in the vocational bodies nominations are gone.  I feel sympathy for the bodies who nominate people to this House because once the nomination is obtained the individuals disappear and put on their party political hats, nodding in passing to their nominating bodies.</P>
    <P>The nominees then have inflicted on them the dreadful and absurd procedure of travelling around the country in the wind and cold to persuade county councillors to vote for them and not for another member of their party.  They do not look for conflicting votes from other parties; their only objective is to dig into the pool which their party offers and to take from those who supposedly offer the same policies.  They say that all they meet on that journey are liars and cheats and that it is utterly frustrating. Each person who goes on that campaign trail complains about it because they must leave their families for weeks and travel from one end of the country to the other, sometimes in a fruitless pursuit of votes.  It costs them a lot of money and they spend most of the time backbiting their political opponents.  It is an appalling system; it is one which, I do not believe, its creators envisaged however worthy their objectives and it should be changed.</P>
    <P>In the end, we should not complain about the composition of the House. The only thing we can all complain about is how unfairly everyone is elected and how the wrong people, except ourselves, are elected.  That is human nature.  The system we have <Col N="1391" /> inflicted on ourselves is inhuman and absurd.  One of the problems of democracy here and elsewhere is that those who hold seats never want to change the system from which they have benefited. One only has to look at the multi-seat proportional representation system here, the obvious need to change it and the refusal of Members of the Dáil or Seanad to do so, to realise that the vested interests of those <i>in situ</i> always dictate that there should be as little change as possible because it might threaten their seats.  That applies as much to the Dáil as to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Dáil system of multi-seat constituencies under proportional representation is unsatisfactory.  Multi-seat constituencies put pressure on members of political parties, not so much to take votes from their opponents but from their colleagues.  Any member of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael who has stood for the Dáil knows there is a quota of votes in a constituency &mdash; a pool into which they all dip.  The person who gets the most votes from that party political pool is the most likely to get elected.  They must overtake their &ldquo;colleague&rdquo; and leave their opponents alone.  This system is a paradise for backstabbers and those who want to knife their friends, colleagues and those who have the same policies as themselves, which is absurd.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of proportional representation which is objectionable is that it forces people to take part in messenger boy politics in their constituencies as a priority over legislation.  The legislative burden on TDs is particularly onerous but if one goes into the Dáil when the bulk of legislation is being discussed, it is nearly always empty.  The reason for this is simple.  In order to survive, TDs are forced to make constituency work a priority over legislation. That means that legislation is not properly scrutinised and that TDs spend more time doing constituency work than they should.  We all get on the merry-go-round of sending numerous letters and circulars and making telephone calls, many of which are absolutely meaningless, <Col N="1392" /> to keep up with our colleagues.  As a result, we do not know what legislation is going through the Dáil because we must look after what are, in effect, small and local problems.  Those who drafted the Constitution should have looked more carefully at this and the dual mandate of Senators and TDs being members of county councils.</P>
    <P>There is a good case for Senators and TDs getting some experience as county councillors &mdash; it should not be obligatory or mandatory &mdash; before they reach either House because it teaches them a great deal about what is happening locally.  I did this the other way round; I was a Member of this House for ten years before I became a county councillor. It was a revelation to me because it taught me a lot about people's problems. There is no shame in that.</P>
    <P>In the context of Seanad and Dáil reform, we should look again at the almost mandatory necessity for Members of the Dáil to sit on county councils.  In my constituency two Senators, Senator Roche and I, are on Wicklow County Council.  There were five TDs on the council, counting the late Deputy Johnny Fox.  To be a Senator or a TD, it appeared that one had to be a member of a county council, but what happens then is that the work of the county council takes priority over work in the Dáil or Seanad.  If a number of Members are on the county council. it puts pressure on others to do likewise. The only solution is to forbid the dual mandate in both cases so that everyone is on an equal footing and cannot use the county council as a means to get elected or re-elected to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision that, after 1998, a Member of the Seanad or Dáil cannot be the chairman of a county council.  However, it does not go far enough.  The next step &mdash; which the last Minister for the Environment funked &mdash; is to say that one can be a local politician or a national one, but not both. This would mean that county councils would provide a tremendous apprenticeship for Members of the Dáil and Seanad.  It would mean Members would <Col N="1393" /> not be compelled to spend their time doing other work while ignoring legislation passing through both Houses.</P>
    <P>I have drifted slightly from Seanad reform which has, in recent weeks, become more topical, but only in a specific sense.  There was one item of Seanad reform on which there was a constitutional referendum in 1979 but which nobody noticed because it was about the redistribution of seats which never happened and probably will not happen in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government there was also a proposal for Seanad reform.  This was to give votes to emigrants so that three Members of the Seanad would be elected by them.  I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that I think this idea is absurd.  It was probably concocted in a very short time, as was the programme itself, which contains some particularly worthy reforms and ideas.  Like all documents and proposals put forward in a short period, this was ill thought out and totally nonspecific.</P>
    <P>From where did the idea of giving not just votes but seats to emigrants come? This reflected a cavalier attitude to the Seanad and a willingness to yield to loud pressure groups at a time when a Government was being formed.  I would not have any objection and think it would be very good if the next Government, when it is being formed &mdash; unfortunately this will not happen because most Governments are formed in a hurry nowadays &mdash; looks long and hard at Seanad Éireann, says reforms are needed and that it could be given a useful role in certain controversial areas in a radical way and a role to give a voice to a large number of people who do not have a voice in Irish society at the moment.</P>
    <P>I object to the piecemeal way in which it was decided by the three parties in Government to give votes and three of the Taoiseach's nominees to emigrants.  Why give them votes and why three seats?  This is about 5 per cent of this House.  This was an utterly arbitrary figure.  The decision to give votes <Col N="1394" /> to emigrants was taken because the emigrants' group was presumably the last group to which somebody who was negotiating the formation of the Government spoke.  There was a great deal of lobbying by this group at the time.  The idea that emigrants should be given 5 per cent of seats in this House is patently absurd unless there is some hidden mystical plan, about which we do not know, in Merrion Street for the reform of this House and to give it a new status and those who are voiceless a new say in what happens in the Oireachtas.  It is plain that no such plan exists.</P>
    <P>Three seats for emigrants came out of the blue without that much pressure at all.  Somebody spoke to somebody else when the ink was being put on the paper and before the ink was dry it was decided to give three seats to emigrants. We are going to have the most extraordinary concoction of people here from New York, Camden Town.  Australia or wherever, speaking for emigrants who will all have votes in the country of their origin.  I cannot understand where this idea came from. Apparently the Taoiseach and the Government are prepared to give up three of their seats in this way after the next election.  I wonder whether this will ever see the light of day.  I hope it never does unless it is in the context of serious Seanad reform.</P>
    <P>If this was a serious proposal it might have spelt out how these emigrants' representatives are to be elected.  Will Mr. Gerry Adams and Mr. Martin McGuinness be elected here by the people of Boston and New York because they cannot get in here any other way and cannot get elected to any other position in Northern Ireland or here.  Will extremists be elected by people who know nothing about Ireland but have sentimental feelings about it? Will 44 million Irish Americans be permitted to express their views on who should represent them in the Oireachtas?  This idea is so absurd that I am convinced it was never thought out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> In the present situation, if we had three representatives of emigrants' bodies instead of the Taoiseach's nominees, they would hold the balance of power in the House and would decided whether legislation went through.  Every Bill, motion and amendment would be in their hands.  Would we be prepared to put up with this?  They would not last very long and this would certainly mean that the Seanad was due for reform at a very early date because nobody could tolerate obstruction from those who represented people who live overseas.</P>
    <P>It would have been more helpful if we had been told how the representatives were to be elected.  It may be unfair to say that they will be elected by the 44 million Irish Americans and all the Irish people in England and Australia.  This may be taking things to absurdity, but I do not know.  On St. Patrick's Day, if we told grandparents and octogenarians who had never been to Ireland that they were not Irish, they would slit our throats because they feel more Irish than many of us who have lived here all our lives.  They would demand the right to vote because they have Irish ancestry and the same loyalties to a past Ireland which no longer exists but which flourishes in other parts of the world.  These people would demand a vote and are being encouraged to do so by this silly proposal which is being used simply to pander to the unfortunate families whose sons and daughters have left them and gone away.</P>
    <P>This will have to be thought out again.  I hope the Government will have the courage to come forward within a short period and say that the proposal in its programme for votes for emigrants was a mistake and that it has decided that the proposal will not go ahead.  In the present circumstances to have three such people exercising such power is too large a proportion of the House.  It would be very difficult for any Government to accept that sort of situation.  To have made that promise at a time when the Government knew it was going to be in a minority situation makes one <Col N="1396" /> question the speed with which its programme was assembled.</P>
    <P>It would be acceptable if we received the indication for which we have all been seeking; that the Government was looking at the Seanad itself and to giving a voice in it to people who do not have it already.  I see great value in giving a seat to the unemployed, which is running at just under 300,000.  Apparently our concern for emigrants and that they be heard is far greater than our concern for the unemployed.  It is not good enough to respond to that by saying the unemployed are represented because they have a vote in Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>That does not recognise the purpose of the Seanad, which, as originally envisaged, was to give groups like the unemployed a say in this House.  I cannot understand why no Taoiseach's nominees have ever included someone to represent the unemployed, who are a deprived group with serious psychological and financial problems.  They are not represented because those who are elected by the unemployed to the Dáil or the Seanad are also elected by many other people.  The unemployed need a spokesman and this would be an appropriate place for them to have one.</P>
    <P>The unemployed did not have any negotiating power when either the absurdly called <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> or the even more absurdly denominated <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were being put together.  They had no say and were cut out completely by the large groups with vested interests &mdash; the trade unions who claim to represent them but do not, the farmers and industry.  The unemployed have been completely and utterly ignored.  In the Dáil they have very little leverage.  No party could claim to represent the unemployed because, if they did, they would be seen to have done a disastrous day's work in recent years with unemployment running at over 280,000.  Every party represents the unemployed when in Opposition but no party represents them <Col N="1397" /> when in Government.  That is the truth of the matter.</P>
    <P>Let us not pretend that everything about this House has been bad in recent years because there have been positive aspects.  It was Mr. Charles J. Haughey who originally and very daringly decided to introduce the new concept of bringing people from Northern Ireland to Seanad Éireann.  It was revolutionary and it worked wonderfully.  The first Members to be appointed from Northern Ireland were Mr. Séamus Mallon and Mr. John Robb, Mr. Mallon was obviously here to represent the Nationalist tradition.  Mr. Robb, although a Protestant, was not here to represent the Unionist tradition and his role here could not possibly have been interpreted as such.  Mr. Mallon was a great eye-opener for those of us in the House at the time because he taught us, in a way which nobody else has since, about the thinking of Northern Irish nationalism.  Many people in Ireland claim not only to understand Northern Irish nationalism but also to be supporters of it.  However, I suspect that some of them had never met a Northern Ireland Nationalist, while others had never been to Northern Ireland.  Mr. Mallon brought us a real insight into that thinking at a particularly difficult time in the troubles there.  It was an innovation which will always stand to Mr. Haughey's great credit.</P>
    <P>Mr. Robb was a different kettle of fish because he was a Protestant who was really a Nationalist and that was confusing for people in this House and further afield.  Mr. Robb also represented a Northern Ireland culture, view and outlook which was radically different to what we believed in down here and which differed also from how we had seen them.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of such people among the Taoiseach's Seanad nominees was one of the more dramatic and useful innovations made by Mr. Haughey in his time.  It showed great courage, because he needed the numbers, but he put them in and allowed them to vote as they thought fit.  I had many scraps <Col N="1398" /> with Mr. Mallon in this House, particularly over issues like extradition, but it was extremely useful to have a debate and to hear a point of view which was new to both of us.</P>
    <P>That tradition continued &mdash; with Garret FitzGerald reappointing Mr. Robb and appointing Bríd Rodgers in Mr. Mallon's place &mdash; until 1987 or 1989.  At that time Mr. Haughey was so tight for numbers in this House and was under such political pressure internally that he had to give all the seats in his power back to his own party political hacks. That was a shame, because a useful experiment came to an end until it was reintroduced in recent years by Deputy Albert Reynolds, who appointed Gordon Wilson.  Senator Wilson's appointment has reflected well on Seanad Éireann and has provided a tremendous interest and understanding of Northern Irish politics.</P>
    <P>We should not over-emphasise the great value, in democratic terms, of people being appointed from Northern Ireland.  While neither Mr. Robb nor Mr. Wilson are democratically elected politicians in their own right in Northern Ireland, they are men of immense principle who reflect the culture in which they live, and they can certainly educate us about the North.  We should not however &mdash; and I do not think either of them would ever expect us to &mdash; take them as representative of Protestant Unionism because they are not democratically elected in their own country. But in terms of education and understanding, they represent a startling and welcome initiative which was originated by Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the day come when a true blue, elected Northern Ireland Unionist would come here and say, &ldquo;Yes, I will take a seat in the Irish Senate. I am a representative of unionism and this is what I think.&rdquo;  When they do that they would be speaking with the authority of what is known as an electoral mandate and they would be recognised as such.</P>
    <P>I apologise for speaking through the football game and I cannot understand <Col N="1399" /> why the audience in the Public Gallery is so large.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where we could improve the procedures in this House.  I do not believe for one moment that there is any case for defeating financial legislation, because the Seanad was never meant to do that.  Indeed, I am not sure that there is any case for a non-democratically elected body to defeat legislation at all.  It can improve it by consent but not in an adversarial way.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that the Seanad was never given the powers to introduce constitutional reforms.  In areas like the divorce referendum we are not allowed to propose the abolition of the Article which many of us find so offensive.  Such initiatives should be introduced here.  It is a pity that over the period when this subject has been debated so intensely, particularly since the 1980s, the Seanad has played such a minor role because we are not entitled to introduce legislation of this sort.  On the other hand, let us welcome the fact that, in recent years, particularly under this Government, legislation has been introduced in this House.  One of the great advantages is that in recent weeks not only has legislation been introduced here but it has also been amended because of the minority Government position in this House.  This means it will also not have to go through the extraordinary procedure of going to the Dáil, coming to this House and going back to the Dáil. We are now in a position where the Government is pledged to introduce legislation here which will be changed here.  We see Seanad Bills debated in the Dáil on a regular basis but the Seanad itself is now playing a more meaningful role, probably because of the numbers rather than any great vision.</P>
    <P>With regard to the university seats, we are all very fond of criticising the way everybody else was elected to this House &mdash; and I have played my part in the past.  I would say to those who criticise the distribution of the university seats, and the university seats themselves, <Col N="1400" /> that Seanad Éireann was never meant to be a popular House in the sense that it was democratically elected by the people.  That would be absurd. We are not terribly popular people, otherwise most of us would be in the Dáil.  However, we are elected in a different way; apparently the original idea was that we should give voice to particular sectional interests.  The university seats were introduced so that academics and minority groups could give voice to a point of view which was not necessarily going to be expressed by anyone else.</P>
    <P>A great deal of fuss is always made over their being elitist and that Dublin University has more seats than the National University of Ireland per head of population.  I do not think they are elitist.  I do not know whether that view was expressed in this debate because people are sensitive in the present atmosphere about criticising the Independents and how they are elected, a reluctance which they never showed before they were in a minority.</P>
    <P>There are at least &mdash; and I am open to correction &mdash; 80,000 electors in the National University of Ireland constituency which must be a fairly large and representative section of the Irish population, although it probably gives a disproportionate say to those who can afford a university education.  There is often a call for this franchise to be widened to other universities, including the University of Limerick, DCU and the regional technical colleges.  No one could reasonably have any great objection to extending that franchise.</P>
    <P>However, if there are 80,000 or 100,000 electors it cannot really be claimed that this is some sort of oligarchic selection procedure.  These people are from every walk of Irish life.  In some ways, we might have to criticise it as being too wide a franchise because it is larger than some Dáil constituencies and as large as many others.  As a result, those elected represent a very broad section of the community and do not necessarily represent any particular <Col N="1401" /> interest.  They are almost democratically elected politicians.</P>
    <P>That criticism is answered by the fact that the National University of Ireland has three seats.  They tend, because it is a multi-seat constituency, to send to this Chamber people who represent particular vocational interests.  Teachers almost automatically take a seat in the NUI constituency, which is probably not a bad thing, and that can only happen provided it is a multi-seat constituency. It is a particularly good thing that teachers, with whom I have many personal disagreements, should be unashamedly represented in a House such as this because it is a sectional group with a vested interest whose voice should be heard.</P>
    <P>Widening the franchise would probably make those constituencies larger than Dáil constituencies and unwieldy in terms of those who stand as candidates. However, to accuse a constituency with around 100,000 electors of being elitist is fairly absurd in a House of this sort which was never democratically elected.</P>
    <P>The same criticism is often made of the Dublin University seats.  There are historical reasons Dublin University was given three seats, of which everyone in this House is aware.  There was a feeling that Protestants in the Irish State might be under-represented and Dublin University, which was at the time an almost exclusively Protestant university, was thought to be an ideal source of representatives of the minority for this House who might not get representation in the Dáil.  In retrospect, that fear was unnecessary.  The Protestant population in the Republic has been extremely well treated and many would say that they have been given preferential treatment in terms of their schools.  The reason for that is another day's work.  They do not feel they have been discriminated against in any way, and not to the extent that they need some sort of special treatment or representation in this House.</P>
    <P>However, the representatives of Trinity College, Dublin &mdash; and I do not wish <Col N="1402" /> to indulge in any praise for my predecessors or, even less, for my colleagues &mdash;have represented a liberal point of view which was lacking in this and the other House.  We only have to look at the names of many of those who have represented Dublin University to realise that there was a common trend running through their philosophy which was almost unanimous throughout this period.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that, in 1969 when Mary Robinson was originally elected, she could have possibly been elected to the Dáil.  Indeed, she stood for the Dáil twice, in 1976 and subsequently, and was defeated.  She found her original platform in a Dublin University Seanad seat.  She had a liberal attitude which at the time was certainly not shared by many people in this House and was definitely not shared by many in the Dáil.  That is a monument to the value of this House.</P>
    <P>Owen Sheehy-Skeffington was also a representative of Dublin University.  He was earlier than Mrs. Robinson although I think that they overlapped for one year before he died.  He presented a point of view which would have prohibited him from getting into the Dáil at that time, just as it prohibited Mrs. Robinson, but which would now be shared by a large number of young people.  Senator Norris would have had enormous difficulties getting elected to Dáil Éireann at the time he was elected to Seanad Éireann.  Indeed, I do not think Senator Norris harbours any such ambitions, although one never knows with him.  Since he came to Seanad Éireann, as a representative of Dublin University, he has led, and often been ahead of, public opinion on many issues and has shown courage which would have obstructed him from receiving a purely democratic mandate elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into a litany of praise for others, but the university seats, as reflected by ex-National University Senators like John A. Murphy and current Senators like Joe Lee and in Trinity's case by Noel Browne, Conor <Col N="1403" /> Cruise O'Brien and many others, have reflected a point of view which has not been reflected in its day elsewhere in Irish parliamentary democracy.  If there is no other justification for Seanad Éireann, and there may not be, these people have justified it in themselves.  A very large public platform had been given to those people to promote a liberal agenda which horrified the rest of the parliamentary population of this country at the time, which in itself is justification for the existence of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>That does not mean &mdash; I do not hesitate to say this &mdash; that Seanad Éireann does not have room for improvement. There is enormous room for improvement. But I have been encouraged, not only in this welcome present minority situation but in other circumstances, to see so many amendments accepted by all Governments in this Chamber and I would like to see more of this happening.</P>
    <P>The Companies Bill was introduced in this House in 1977-78 by Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Séamus Brennan of the Fianna Fáil Government.  After it had got through Second Stage, the Government of the day, because of the less contentious attitude in this House, came back and amended that Bill radically in many stages and forms and cut out many sections.  In particular, it amended the rules on insider dealing in the Stock Exchange.  It introduced penalties which are stricter that that of any of our overseas counterparts.  It recognised the weight of the argument made by many of the Members of this House about the state of our company law and company practices.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Coalition Government, under Garrett FitzGerald, introduced the Control of Clinical Trials Bill in this House as a direct recognition that this House had people who could offer expertise in this area to which not only the Minister was willing to listen but so also were his civil servants, who either listened on their monitors or read the scripts.  In a direct recognition of that, <Col N="1404" /> the Bill was again altered radically having gone through Second Stage.  That was very important, not only for the legislation &mdash; it was vital because it was highly sensitive legislation about experimentation on individuals by doctors &mdash; but also for this House, because it was a recognition of what can be done here, without any rancour and problems, between the parties.  That is what happened that day.  After Second Stage &mdash; its mechanics were a little petty in that amendments were not accepted from the Opposition or the Independents &mdash; the Government introduced its own.  It did this because it liked to; Governments tend to be excessively vain about these matters.  They were introduced in direct response to Opposition and other Senators' pleas.</P>
    <P>That is the type of Seanad we wish to see, a Seanad where party political divisions are reduced but legislation is improved, a Seanad where there are few votes and little political capital to be made but where we can improve legislation and leave the rough and tumble of politics to the very appropriately named Lower House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject, but in so doing one has to wonder about the effect this debate will have.</P>
      <P>I am honoured and proud to be a Member of this House &mdash; I have been elected six times &mdash; and I have listened to a lot of criticism of the Seanad and its Members.  I always reply to that by saying that one can only qualify as a critic after one has become elected.  I have travelled from Cork to Donegal seven times in my effort to get elected to the Seanad.  I know what it is like to be elected.  Some people find it easy to criticise the Seanad; they call it a place for defeated TDs.  I have found the Members of the Seanad to be totally committed people.  If Seanad reform went to a vote, the vast majority of Members would vote in favour of it, although we may differ in the range of reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> A different situation existed when this House was initially established under the Constitution.  I listened to Senator Ross with great interest.  He has a perception of the Seanad which I would not share.  Senator Ross referred to local authorities.  However, he has not had the groundwork or the value of being an active member of a local authority, otherwise he would not talk about them in this way.  He also talked about the value of a university seat.  When the Constitution set up the Seanad, the nation consisted of a semiliterate public and there was a necessity to have an input from the elite or educated classes, which is why the universities were given block representation in this House.  We have long since moved away from this situation.  I do not have any hard feelings towards any university Senator, but the day has come to look at the contribution the Seanad can make.</P>
    <P>I also share the view that the Seanad should extend its representation, if we are to allow all our universities, including the University of Ulster and third level colleges, to nominate people to the Seanad.  This could be carried to the point where it becomes impossible to include all of the different structures. Not all of them can have the privilege of nominating and electing Members to the House.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of Senator Ross with regard to the granting of votes and three Seanad seats for emigrants.  It is impractical and impossible.  Anybody involved in elections and maintaining a register of voters finds it nearly impossible, even at local authority level, to keep a register, given the number of people who have died, have left the area or have changed their addresses. Approximately 15 to 20 per cent of the register of voters in local authority and national elections are invalid.  Given this, how is it possible to prepare a register of electorates for emigrant voters? Where would one begin &mdash; in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, France, Germany &mdash; and end?  How long would it take to compile and how would it be put together, covering as it would every part <Col N="1406" /> of the world?  For, example, would we include the countries which the President visited recently?</P>
    <P>It is not possible to proceed with this, and those who propose it have not considered the matter fully.  I say this, knowing how difficult it is to compile the register of electors, even on a county basis, and make it efficient.  The voting register is not compiled properly even at national level.  For this reason I have not given serious consideration to the proposal to give votes to emigrants.  It is not possible and it will never happen.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should be reformed to the point where somebody from County Cork does not have to travel to County Donegal or where, for example, I would not have to visit County Cork, because I will only return to make contact with the same voter at the next Seanad election. There is no element of communication or representation in this.  The structures should be regionalised so that elections take place on a regional basis, employing, for example, the system of constituencies in use in the European elections.  This must be considered sooner rather than later, because we will never get away from talking about reform of the House if some Government does not do something about it. Regionalising the vote is a first step and one which I strongly urge.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 18 Oireachtas committees.  This is almost an impossible number given the need to attend them while at the same time being an effective Member of one of the two Houses.  Until the public becomes more familiar with the work we undertake, it looks good to establish committees, to be more efficient, more effective and sit more days, including during the summer.  However, deliberations by committees must be implemented by this House and the other House and the process then becomes difficult to operate.</P>
    <P>We find it necessary to establish 18 committees, yet every second month &mdash; if not more frequently &mdash; there are demands in the House for a debate on the North of Ireland.  Given this, and <Col N="1407" /> given the proposal in the Framework Document for cross Border institutions, the Seanad should be representative of all Ireland.  It would be sensible and practical to proceed on this basis. Members from the North of Ireland have been involved in the Seanad going back to its formation, including Willie Sheldon and various nominated Members.  They have been active and major contributors to the House, up to and including Senator Wilson and Senator Haughey, two active participating Members.  They have not been less efficient because they are from the North of Ireland or of different religions and they have indicated that there is a possibility of building a cross-Border bridge.  From this, we can have a Parliament in Stormont and in Dublin, with a Seanad that undertakes less controversial business.</P>
    <P>Reform of this House could make it an all-Ireland Seanad.  If we are to do anything other than tinker with the structure of the Seanad, we must be imaginative.  We are a small island and, whatever the present problems, we must look to the day when this island will be administered as one unit, and I could enumerate endlessly on the benefits of this.  Some people will revolt at the thought of it, but in a European and world context we are far too small an island to endure division.</P>
    <P>I was recently at the launch in Killybegs of a boat for the fishing industry which cost £32 million, but yesterday a representative from a union in the shipbuilding industry in Belfast was on the news programmes advising that Harland and Woolff was about to close down as it had no business.  We are losing the skill and the knowledge of building ships on this island and are going outside the EU &mdash; to Norway &mdash; to get all of our major fishing boats built.  We must get rid of bigotry and shortsightedness; economic necessity will force us to be practical and to look to ourselves. We will have to do more of this, because the large amounts of EU funding will not continue and the economy of the <Col N="1408" /> day will force us to look to the business institutions which must survive.</P>
    <P>The Republic of Ireland can help to sustain and maintain employment in the shipbuilding firm of Harland and Woolff in Belfast.  It is a company which had a name in the past of employing those who were, perhaps, religious bigots.  A view of the firm, as shown on film, indicates that this has changed somewhat.  It will change more, and we will get away from thinking about where people went to church on Sunday.  I have sat with the Acting Leader of the House in this Chamber for the past two years and I would not have known her religion but for a controversy involving her and the Bishop of Limerick.</P>
    <P>Religious persuasion does not make me or the Acting Leader of the House different people.  As I always say during a religious debate, if a person goes to a bank manager for a loan of a few thousand pounds he does not wonder whether he is a Protestant or a Catholic or if a person is undergoing a serious operation he does not wonder if the surgeon is a Protestant or Catholic.  In Dublin the question of religion and bigotry does not arise.  However, where I come from one has to be aware of it; that is the reality.  Psychologically one is thinking of where a person comes from. I say that for a reason &mdash; I honestly believe it is slowly but surely disappearing from this island.</P>
    <P>There are not many Members here today &mdash; we are keeping the House going while the other Members are enjoying the match.  Nevertheless, I suggest that this island could progress if we could secure agreement or move towards an agreement on an all-Ireland Seanad.  At first we might have difficulty getting people to agree to participate. However, I believe it is on the cards.  It would be an appropriate step while we are talking about cross-Border institutions that might or might not be accepted and the political connotations of such bodies.</P>
    <P>This is an open House where there is no impediment to anybody's political or religious beliefs and we must be seen to <Col N="1409" /> be open, fair and honest in tackling the problems of the country.  North and South.  Every month there is a request in this House to debate the North.  Often debates overlap into discussions of problems in the North of Ireland.  In fact the problems of the whole island are affected by the current difficulties in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will urge my party colleagues and my colleagues at senior level in the party to look at the possibility of making the Seanad an all-Ireland institution. I am sure I could persuade the Acting Leader of the House, Senator O'Sullivan, to think in the same terms.  If one looks into the future one can see the need to be outward looking and the need for that progressive approach.</P>
    <P>I could speak at length about how Senators are elected; I could speak favourably or unfavourably about Senators representing the universities but, ultimately, there must be a review. The Seanad was established 70 years ago.  A newspaper printed 70 years ago is out of date today.  The Constitution under which this House was established did tremendous work and had a stabilising effect on the nation at the time. However, it must be re-examined and altered.  This House is crying out for change.  All of us have a contribution to make and I will continue to advocate that we examine the concept of an all-Ireland Seanad.  It will be a hard sell and will take a long time.  However, I see a future in which this House will be recognised by and will receive participation from everybody on this island.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the electorate will be organised.  That is another day's work.  The issue can be researched; there might be more representation through the universities.  However, local authorities can never be ignored.  Their members carry the burden, even though they are under-financed, for the services they must deliver.  The elected members of local authorities are the grassroots of political life and they must never be ignored.  The people elected by councillors are worthy of being in this House. <Col N="1410" /> I am elected by local authorities.  I have no difficulty with that and I do not consider myself a less favourable Member of this House than other Members.  I am elected by the grassroots; I am not here through the universities or by nomination.</P>
    <P>Whether I am the most eloquent or least eloquent person who was ever in the House does not affect my strong commitment to the House.  This House can do much better.  We have reached the stage where we need reform and I would like to see such reform implemented in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been good and wide ranging contributions to this debate.  However, I pay particular tribute to the previous two speakers who offered interesting and strongly felt opinions. Senator McGowan's concept of an all-Ireland Seanad is not possible under the present Constitution.  However, it gives us food for thought and should certainly be examined in the context of our discussions on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senators have discussed comprehensively a number of aspects of the Seanad that could be reformed &mdash; its composition, its structures, its procedures for debate, the facilities for Members and how Senators are elected.  Obviously we are limited by the Constitution in the reforms we can contemplate although, as Senator McGowan said, there is discussion at present about constitutional reform.  Perhaps the Seanad might be part of that discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members referred to calls that are made from time to time for the abolition of the Seanad.  I am glad to see there is no serious call for its abolition at present.  The most important functions of the Seanad include the initiation of legislation and discussion of legislation with a view to amending and improving it.  Senator Ross made a good point when he said that because the Government has a minority in the Seanad there has been greater focus by all sides of the House in discussion of legislation.  The fact that the Government has a minority has focused our <Col N="1411" /> minds more clearly than was the case in the past on the need to take on board all views in the House.  In addition, the fact that the Seanad is probably less confrontational than the Dáil makes it easier to amend legislation without being party political or contentious about it.  That is an important function of the House.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to facilitating the questioning of Ministers.  Although that occurred recently, it is not common practice.  Members suggest that it might become a more common occurrence.  It was also suggested that we might vary the length of speeches to allow different and fuller participation and debate.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions have been made about the composition of the Seanad. That is a matter for the Constitution. Already representation for emigrants has been proposed, although Senator Ross believed the proposal to have been made at short notice without adequate forethought.  This was also suggested in the last debate on reform of the Seanad, which was before I became a Member. In the synopsis of the recommendations at that time, votes for emigrants was mentioned, so this is not a new concept dreamed up in the consultations on the make up of the present Government.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan said there should be more Northern voices; other Senators referred to the fine contributions from Northern Members at various times.  There have also been fine contributions from various university Senators through the years.  It has been advocated that we should extend the franchise to graduates of the newer universities and the regional technical colleges. Other suggestions were made about Oireachtas committees; that would not be a voice for this House alone but for the Oireachtas as a whole.</P>
    <P>Content of debates was discussed and Members felt there should be more emphasis on European and foreign affairs.  Some said minority voices and views should always be heard in this House.  I mentioned earlier that young people have only a slight interest in the <Col N="1412" /> political process and perhaps the Seanad should take their views on board and be more accessible to them so that they would feel they participated in the political process.</P>
    <P>We have had a wide ranging discussion. On the last day the Leader proposed setting up a committee to examine all the proposals put forward in this and previous debates on reform of the House.  This will probably be a subcommittee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as the full committee would be too large.  Those proposals would then come before the Seanad for consideration.</P>
    <P>This has been a good debate and the recommendations will not be left on the shelf; once the committee gets to work action will be taken on the proposals.  I thank all who contributed, particularly those who spoke today when there were other calls on our attention.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for the reduction in funding for non-national roads, and calls on the Minister for the Environment to provide additional financial allocations immediately to local authorities to deal with the rapidly deteriorating county and regional road network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county road network throughout the whole country is in a critical state of repair and requires urgent financial <Col N="1413" /> investment to prevent its further deterioration and collapse.  Over the past number of years substantial additional funding has been provided by the Government to local authorities to deal with the chronic condition of the system. Some improvements were taking place and the prospect of having a decent county road network was very real.  It was therefore with dismay and alarm that the allocation for this year, showing a reduction in the grants for local authorities, was received.  Lack of commitment on the part of the Government to the local communities affected by dreadful road conditions is a national disgrace and must be condemned.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the condition of the county roads is not a new development. Over a period of about ten years there has been a steady disintegration of the structure and the best efforts of local authorities have not been able to cope with the problem.  A combination of increased volumes of heavy traffic, bad weather conditions and the effects of water schemes and other services &mdash; for example, the placing of telephone lines underground &mdash; has caused a rapid deterioration.  In some areas this undermined an already very fragile system. Even with some maintenance and improvements, the roads were unable to stand up to the pressures.  The very foundations of some roads were undermined and threatened.  The rehabilitation works which are required are very expensive.</P>
    <P>Ireland has the most extensive system of public roads in Europe: 26 kilometres for every 1,000 people.  There has been a dramatic rise in terms of the volume and nature of vehicular traffic carried by our non-national roads, which account for over 94 per cent of all public roads and carry 63 per cent of all traffic.  Many are used by heavy commercial vehicles, including milk collection lorries and lorries transporting animals and fertilisers. The volume of heavy agricultural machinery is also increasing.  Border counties had particular problems with increased volumes of commercial and passenger traffic on minor roads due to <Col N="1414" /> the fact that many cross Border roads had been closed.  Thankfully, there is some movement in that regard now which might alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>The previous Government had given a commitment in the national development plan to increase the level of funding for non-national roads.  It had been planned to spend £475 million approximately on improvement works over the period of the plan.  In 1994, the Government, recognising the very serious state of the county roads, provided an additional £26 million over the 1993 allocation to local authorities.  Allowing for local authorities' own expenditure, the total expenditure on regional, county and urban roads in 1994 was estimated to be in excess of £160 million. The estimated figure is now somewhere in the region of £162 million.  A special allocation of £15 million for maintenance was provided from the receipts of the tax amnesty.  This again underlined the seriousness of the situation, the necessity to provide funding and the realisation at Government level that a serious crisis was emerging that needed to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, speaking in Cavan on 14 February 1994 stated: &ldquo;Non-national roads are clearly a priority.  Communities are themselves establishing them as a priority.  The Government, backed by the taxpayers' money, has made them a priority&rdquo;.  It is regrettable therefore that the new Government has not honoured the commitment given previously to keep a sustained level of investment over a period of years to ensure that these problems would be tackled.  I urge the current Minister to make an extra allocation immediately to enable the programme planned by local authorities to proceed.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, the local authorities are now planning in a more reasonable way.  Many of the plans which are in train and where work had already commenced are at a standstill because of the lack of financial commitment to undertake these works.  If this were to continue, the whole county and <Col N="1415" /> regional road structure network would be seriously delayed and undermined with the prospect of more damage being done, especially in the areas which are worst hit.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the communities most affected by bad roads are those living in the underdeveloped areas, including the western counties, areas of great scenic attraction, the Border areas and remote and isolated local communities.  Some of the areas most severely affected by the recent storms are tourist and coastal areas where some of the coastal roads are now impassable.  A combination of bad weather conditions, coastal erosion and the unavailability of resources means that some roads, especially in the most scenic parts of Ireland, are totally impassable and are creating enormous problems for local communities trying to get to and from work and their businesses.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the communities in rural areas are totally disillusioned with the Government?  Many people are resorting to refusing to pay their road tax and fines and are opting to go to prison in an effort to get some action and to highlight the problems with which they are faced.  This is a most deplorable situation and it leads to a deep sense of inequality.  With the availability of some European Union funding, people had expected that the grant allocations would be increased and that they could look forward to an accelerated programme of repairs.  One can understand their grave disillusionment when the allocations were reduced.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Government's commitments, it undertook a number of pilot schemes.  These were particularly in the Border areas of Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and Longford where the local residents, assisted by the local authorities, carried out minor works on county and byroads roads involving hedgecutting, the provision of minor drainage works, maintenance and the opening up of small culverts and gullets which were blocked.  A vigorous campaign by the local authorities and community <Col N="1416" /> groups combined in a last ditch effort to try to come to grips with the problem.</P>
    <P>I understand these pilot schemes were very successful.  I compliment the Minister on that initiative and urge its continuation. In view of their success, the Minister provided, approximately, an additional £1 million last year.  I suggest the results of these pilot projects could now be used by extending the scheme nationwide.  There is a willingness on the part of many communities, if they could be satisfied on such issues as insurance and liability, to co-operate with local authorities and undertake necessary minor works.  This would relieve the burden on local authorities in many areas and ensure the best possible use of scarce financial resources.</P>
    <P>It is most depressing for people living with cratered and impassable roads when they look at what is happening in terms of expenditure on the national road network while the county roads collapse.  A total investment of over £1.2 billion is being spent in the operational programme for national roads, with Structural Funds, Cohesion Funds and national money providing a huge financial investment in this area.  By any standard, this is a substantial investment; but residents who find that their local road is deteriorating to the point of inaccessibility while huge amounts are expended on motorways, flyovers or dual carriageways are not impressed.  In many cases, they are furious and very vexed.</P>
    <P>We welcome a reasonable and realistic national roads network. However, one must question priorities when £40 million is spent on approximately 20 kilometres of the Cork-Mallow bypass while the total allocation to Cork County Council for all non-national roads this year is £9.8 million. This is an approximate reduction of £1 million in the allocation it received last year.  The whole County Cork regional road network will receive less than £10 million, while a total of approximately £60-70 million will be spent on the bypass.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> I welcome these important developments, but there is a similar situation regarding the Shannon-Limerick-Bun-ratty bypass.  This bypass on the national route will cost approximately £13-14 million, while a parallel road serving a huge local community in the Portdrine-Cratloe area is almost impassable.  It is little consolation to the local community who cannot get their children out to school without running the risk of them being soaked in the potholes and craters that now make up the Portdrine Road. I use this as an example.  The very least these people can expect is that emergency attention will be given to these problems before millions are spent on bypasses and motorways.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that we support the development of the national road programme.  However, I wish to put forward a proposal that a fixed percentage of allocations for such huge multi-million pound developments be set aside for local authorities to attend to the small local county roads adjacent to and serving these big projects.  This would ensure that the local people living adjacent to these developments are assured of a decent road in their locality.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that a huge motorway passes a housing estate or small local community, while at the same time the roads to it are impassable.  There was a debate in the House recently on arterial drainage.  If there are to be huge developments, such as the Bunratty-Limerick bypass, it is surely realistic to expect that a percentage of that money will be allocated to deal with roads, which serve local communities, running into those developments.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that the pilot schemes in the Border areas be extended nationwide, with co-operation between community voluntary bodies and local authorities in matters of hedgecutting and the clearing of small culverts and drains to take surface water off the roads.  This could be successfully organised by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is also an opportune time to examine some control measures on the size <Col N="1418" /> of huge heavy articulated lorries and traffic on minor roads.  I travelled behind one such vehicle the other day on my way to Dublin.  I could see the whole road moving beneath the extreme weight of the huge milk tanker.  Minor roads were never intended to take such loads and they are incapable of handling them.  Some action must be taken on this matter.</P>
    <P>Time and again we have drawn the attention of Ministers and the Government to the necessity to invest in roads which are used by tourists.  Coastal roads in tourism areas are hit worse than others and the recent bad weather has also taken its toll.  In fact, some such roads are now impassable due to coastal erosion and tidal effects.  The situation is now so chronic that there is widespread fear among people in the tourism industry that huge volumes of business will be lost, with the resulting impact on communities which are already severely hit, unless something is done urgently to deal with the situation.  There has already been a decline of the rural population in the most scenic areas of the west.</P>
    <P>We have had countless opportunities to raise these issues.  However, could we impress upon those who plan these works that while it is important to have a major national network capable of carrying heavy volumes of traffic as our economy develops, there are other people living in these areas.  They also have rights and entitlements.  Surely it is possible in the planning and design of such major infrastructural developments to give care and attention to the needs of local communities.</P>
    <P>We do not wish to be negative in this debate.  However, at this stage the general public is disillusioned with all public representatives regarding county roads. We have put forward this motion in the hope that the Government will respond generously to this crisis by making further substantial allocations to local authorities for this year to deal with the problem.  The Government can no longer disregard the human misery, expense and inconvenience which bad <Col N="1419" /> county roads inflict on local communities. I urge the Minister to take this matter seriously and act accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to second the motion proposed by Senator Daly on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party. The Minister should accept the content of the motion.  It sets a very bad precedent to reduce the allocations for non-national roads.  This is particularly so in a year when people have experienced terrible weather conditions, with rain causing massive flooding and damage to roads.</P>
      <P>I understand from figures available to me that £107 million was allocated by the Government in 1994 for regional and county roads.  Under that heading the allocation for 1995 is £103 million, which is a £4 million reduction.  This is all the more serious if one takes flooding into consideration.  However, we must also be conscious of costs and inflation, and in real terms there is a reduction of £6 million in the non-national roads category in 1995 rather than £4 million, if we take inflation, increased costs and the actual reduction in funding itself into consideration, and I am being very conservative in giving a figure of £6 million.  I believe that figure shows a lack of commitment by the Minister and the Government &mdash; perhaps the Minister did not have total discretion in the matter &mdash; to our non-national network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By allowing a decrease in the funds for that category of road, the category which gets the most use, the Minister is to some extent turning his back on the people who live in outlying areas.  That is a very serious thing to say but I would have to be convinced otherwise.  I have looked at the allocations on a national basis and I find there is a reduction in the allocation made to every county on the western seaboard.  I also looked at other areas.  I welcome the increases for some of the Dublin areas but, if it was necessary to increase the funding allocated to some counties, was it not just as necessary to at least maintain the <Col N="1420" /> existing level of funding to other counties? Am I to understand that the Minister sees the counties whose funding was increased as being of higher priority? Do I further understand that he sees a political difference in those counties?  I would not like to think that.  I hope he feels that all counties should be treated equally.</P>
    <P>We all agree that an increase in funding should be given in exceptional situations. However, if we were to look at areas where severe flooding occurred in 1995, it would appear that exceptional circumstances were not taken into consideration by the Minister in deciding allocations.  The non-national roads allocation to the counties of, for instance, Roscommon, Longford, Galway and Laois, the areas which bore the brunt of the flooding from the Shannon valley area, has been reduced; there has been a decrease in the non-national roads allocation to the south Galway and Clare area also.  It would appear that the Minister did not and has not to date taken into consideration or given any support to the counties that suffered so badly as a result of the recent flooding.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House tonight clearly identifies a need for extra funds for non-national roads to each local authority.  The Minister was mistaken to allow a decrease in this funding.  I do not know what forces applied.  I do not know what pressures the Minister was under or from where those pressures came, but he was wrong to agree a budget that reduced by £4 million the allocation to non-national roads.  I reiterate that I do not consider that to be the true figure; we must take increased costs and inflation into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister should respond to the motion before the House by providing extra funds for non-national roads in 1995.  If this does not happen the network, bad as it is, will deteriorate even further.  Hundreds of miles in the western region have suffered very badly from flooding.  The small maintenance programmes by the local authorities in these areas will not maintain the fabric <Col N="1421" /> of those roads.  A surface dressing programme is needed.  The Minister should take a second look at the funding of local authorities under the heading of non-national roads and he should make a significant announcement in this regard immediately because the local roads meetings are about to take place. We have to divide the money that has been made available and it will be a futile exercise unless we receive extra funds.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach.  Tá sí ag éisteacht go cúramach leis an díospóireacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> This Government has a real commitment to improving county roads.  I am sure this commitment will be welcomed by the people of rural Ireland who are forced to travel on roads which are in dire condition because of continuous neglect over a number of years.  The case for improving the county road network has been continuous and consistent over the last number of years.  I recall in particular a submission from the General Council of County Councils, of which I happen to be a member; Senator Finneran is also a member of this prestigious body.  A submission was made to the Minister for the Environment in the early 1990s in which the general council sought that the block grant be allowed to be spent at the discretion of the local authorities.  The general council also pointed to the continuous and significant erosion of the amount transferred to local authorities from central Government since the abolition of domestic rates and the loss of revenue from agricultural rates and stated that those losses have jointly contributed to the precarious financial position of local authorities.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the general council recorded in a submission its regret that the level of support grants allocated to its member local authorities for 1992 was at the same level as the allocation for 1991. The council asked the Minister to ensure that eligibility for Structural Funds assistance be included to allow work for county roads.  The general council, while agreeing that the development of a proper national road structure is vital, feels that adequate funding to maintain and improve the county road network is essential.</P>
    <P>The council asked the Minister to ensure that eligibility for Structural Funding assistance be extended to work on county roads and also asked the Minister to initiate a formal request by the Irish Government to the EU to launch a special programme funded from the portion of the EU Structural Funds reserved for Commission initiatives to assist the improvement of county roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> The General Council of County Councils has been consistent in its representation to Governments, particularly since 1990, in seeking funding for our national county road network.  The general council represents every council in the country.  It is comprised of councillors from all over the country and nobody knows more about the roads than the county councillors.  Regretfully, the response from Government has been negative, to say the least; otherwise we would not have the position that pertains for the county roads.</P>
    <P>The funding problems for county roads started in 1977 with the greatest election gimmick of all time when domestic rates were abolished.  Since then councils have never been adequately compensated for the loss of revenue accruing from this decision.  Local authorities have survived on sufferance and on a pittance from Government.  Councils are at their wits' end to maintain their current level of employment.  Over the last number of years the number of workers on the roads has decreased dramatically.  In County Galway the numbers have reduced from 750 to a mere 250.  This has contributed greatly to the lack of work on our roads and to the current condition of the county roads.</P>
    <P>The Government has inherited a major problem &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;inherited&rdquo;.  The Galway county engineer, speaking at the roads estimates meeting in Galway last year, referred to the need for a rescue programme for the county and regional roads of County Galway.  He quoted a figure of £12 million per annum over a number of years for county roads and £3 million for regional roads to bring the roads up to a reasonable standard.  I have listened to this call from our engineer since I was elected to the council in 1985 and it has become stronger since 1988.  I am sure the same tune has been sung by many other county engineers.</P>
    <P>The county engineers have been left like John the Baptist crying in the wilderness, with the Government of the <Col N="1424" /> day refusing to respond to the cries of desperation.  This is why we have such rapidly deteriorating county roads, as noted in the Fianna Fáil motion.  The City and County Managers Association has also made many submissions over the years to Government seeking adequate funds for county roads and they have also been left crying in the wilderness with no positive response forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Our roads are in a worse state than ever as a result of the recent rains and flooding.  The increased traffic of trucks and milk lorries further exacerbates the problem of the crumbling county road system.  There is a need for a complete rescue strategy and the Government is moving towards that and should be complimented for this initiative taken in its infancy.  The Government is in office just 105 days today.</P>

    <P>Senator Daly referred to what the former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, <Col N="1425" /> said in Cavan.  I remind Senator Daly that the American poet, Walt Whitman, said that words are like leaves, they can be tossed in many directions.  A lot has been said but little has been done.  This Government is under no illusion about the enormity of the task and I know that a rescue strategy is being put in place to halt the further deterioration of our non-national roads, which, due to sheer neglect and lack of finance, are now in an abysmal state.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion allows us to touch on an issue close to our hearts, not to mention the springs of our cars. In addition to the treachery we have witnessed in the savage cutbacks in real terms in a number of counties in this allocation, I want to record my abhorrence at a suggestion which has come from the Greens in Europe, and which has been condemned by MEPs from all parties, to cut back the allocation to the road network of Ireland from the EU. This is a foolhardy and dangerous proposition.</P>
      <P>The Green MEPs, Ms van Dyck and Mr. Langer, have apparently decided that the people of Ireland are not deserving of the same road networks as the people of Holland, Italy or any other part of Europe.  They have put forward a resolution that the European Parliament should suggest that moneys which have been allocated to roads such as the N11, the Euroroute 1, would be diverted into the rail network.  I raise this issue now because there is no other opportunity to do so.  Members from all sides of this House and members of the Government are as concerned as I.  It is outrageous that an MEP from County Wicklow is associated with a motion which, if agreed, will end the chances of a bypass around Arklow.  No sane person would regard the Arklow bypass as anything other than an economic and environmental necessity.  It is vital to the future economic development of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that it is also vital in environmental terms, because any Member of either House, or even <Col N="1426" /> people from the remote outposts of the European Parliament, who have travelled on the N11 will know that one can spend one hour stuck in traffic on the main street in Arklow or, indeed, on the associated road network around the town, which is heavily congested at present.  Anyone who is familiar with the traffic situation in Arklow would see that the bypass is, therefore, defensible from an environmental point of view, even if we choose to ignore economic realities, as the Greens tend to in such debates.</P>
    <P>For generations people in Arklow have suffered from major traffic jams, which pump noxious fumes into the air. If the Greens have their way, they will be stuck with that for at least another generation.  I regard the motion which the Greens put forward as foolhardy and extremely stupid, but it also borders on economic treachery.  This House should have a strong view on this issue. I commend MEPs from the other parties who have come together for once to indicate the sheer stupidity of what the two Green Party MEPs representing this country are up to.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the specific impact of the cuts in the road allocation this year. It is true there has been criticism over the years about the state of the road network and that people have made political hay about this.  However, the current allocation is a scandal.  In a county such as mine it represents a slap&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We await Senator Farrelly's contribution with glee.  The 1995 road allocation for County Wicklow is £2.118 million, while last year's allocation was an inadequate £2.52 million. Most importantly, the total discretionary funds in County Wicklow this year are being subject to a punishing series of cutback in real terms and in monetary terms.  In 1994 the discretionary improvement grant for County Wicklow was £630,000, while this year it has been reduced to £544,000.  Last year County Wicklow got supplementary improvement grants of £100,000, which have been halved this year to £50,000.  The supplementary maintenance grant for County Wicklow last year provided a much needed £445,000 for Wicklow roads.  This year that figure has been reduced to £265,000.

      <P>I am sorry the truth stings that particular gentleman.  For the past five years in County Wicklow we listened to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, hectoring year in, year out, when there were increases in discretionary grants, saying that they were not sufficient.  On the first occasion she gets her hands on power we get a savage cutback of 21 per cent in real <Col N="1428" /> terms on last year and a 25 per cent cut back in real terms on the previous year. All we can be thankful for in County Wicklow is that she was not elevated to the full status of Minister because we would have to walk to work across the bogs.</P>
      <P>The severity of the road cutbacks in County Wicklow can be best judged if we listen to the Minister's defence of them.  I am sad she is not here to do so, but she has made it in local newspapers. She suggested, for example, that last year's improvement in road discretionary grants was once off.  Figures produced today by the county management in Wicklow show that last year the total discretionary grant was £1.478 million, while this year it is £1.064 million.  This year's cutback is also a cutback on the previous year when it stood at £1.446 million, on the year before that when it stood at £1.5 million and on the year before that when it stood at £1.624 million. There have been cutbacks in a county where the roads are destroyed. The county management warned us recently that some of the roads are becoming impassable The whole fabric&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, another Corkman, to the House.  It is important that the House should discuss non-national roads.  Unfortunately, this year there has been an unprecedented amount of rainfall and flooding has caused damage to roads.  Many roads were like the beds of rivers for a long time and the lodging point of flood waters.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Large lorries from cooperatives travel along these roads.  In my part of the country large fish lorries from Castletownbere thunder across roads which are unsuitable for them.  A considerable amount of damage is <Col N="1430" /> caused as a result of this and lorries delivering oil, etc.  Damage is also being done to county roads by lorries entering Coillte Teoranta plantations.  These are small road roads intended for cars and tractors, but not for heavy machinery.</P>
      <P>We must get value for money if we are to carry out a programme of repairs on roads.  Temporary repairs are carried out and tarmacadam is filled into a hole in the road, but after a few days the situation is the same again.  Is this value for money?  We must adopt a better policy in this regard.</P>
      <P>We need more road workers.  A number of years go there was an embargo and people were made redundant, although there was plenty of work for them.  It is important that these people are put back to work again on the roads. If money can be easily made available for social welfare, it should also be easy for local authorities to get their hands on money to provide work.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is preparing an overall plan.  The amendment to the motion refers to a Government initiative in commissioning a report on the overall state of the county road system and its intention to put in place a coherent and integrated plan to achieve the necessary improvements over the next ten years.</P>
      <P>Figures can be very deceiving and statistics can be switched around to say what we want them to say.  In 1993 £75 million was provided for non-national roads, in 1994 £107 million was provided and this year £103 million.  The 1994 amount included £15 million from the tax amnesty.  If this is excluded the 1994 figure is reduced from £107 million to £92 million.  There was also a supplementary allocation of £5 million in 1994.  There was a real increase of 18.3 per cent this year, which is about £16 million, for non-national roads.  If we do not take account of the money from the amnesty, there was an increase of 11.8 per cent, which is £11 million.  We are progressing, unless somebody suggests we have another amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for giving money to national roads.  I particularly <Col N="1431" /> welcome the money provided for the N71 from Cork to Bandon, with which the Minister is very familiar.  The national routes are good value for money.  We hear people continuously criticising the flyovers and motorways around Dublin.  I know well, especially from the Seanad election campaign, that when one goes off those roads in counties near Dublin, the county roads are as bad as those in the more peripheral areas.  In Cork, we do not have any national primary road but have the N71 running through the area.  Work done on these roads is a tremendous boost to the country.</P>
    <P>When we develop regional roads, we must take into account roads leading to fishery ports.  I am very glad to see that money has been granted for the road to Castletownbere.  Due to the progress being made by local fishermen in the Union Hall area, money will be provided to bring this road up to standard. This is not for the road to be admired. It is necessary for the big lorries which deliver the catches brought in there. Because of the progress also being made in Whiddy Island, I will be looking for money to develop the road from Bandon through Dunmanway to Bantry, which is the shortest route from Cork to the terminal which is being developed in west Cork.  This is very welcome because it will provide employment in a town which has been starved of jobs for many years.</P>
    <P>Many of our county roads are taking traffic which is suitable only for autobahns. Small roads which criss-cross the country are taking huge loads from coops and factories.  Lime and other loads are being transported along these roads. I know the engineering staff in west Cork and the work they are doing, and they have told me that in each area these roads have been identified as ones on which money must be spent.  Money for non-national and regional roads is being used to improve them and to make them more usable for existing traffic.  We need a plan where materials, labour and machinery can be used <Col N="1432" /> wisely.  If we do not make good use of the money, we will not benefit from the end results of this work.</P>
    <P>I recommend the amendment because the money provided for these roads has increased from year to year. If we do not take account of the money from the tax amnesty, there has been natural progress.  Why not have another amnesty this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and deplore the reduction in the allocation to non-national roads.  In the last two weeks I had to travel down the country to attend the funeral of the late councillor, Mr. Michael Sinnott.  I was very lucky I did not have a car crash.  I came on to a very bad part of the road so quickly that I was certain I had damaged the car.  I also had to travel to Waterford.  I looked at the roads as I travelled through every county.  Because I am a county councillor I was very concerned about and interested in this problem.  Communities live near non-national roads, not main roads.</P>
      <P>I questioned the grant paid to South Dublin County Council.  We have been told we have been given an increase this year.  This is not so; in fact, there is a decrease in the discretionary improvement grant.  This grant amounted to £183,000; the maintenance grant amounted to £69,000 and the supplementary grant came to £89,000.  Thus a total of £341,000 was provided this year.  In 1994 the total was £423,000.  Yet we are told there has been an increase of £2 million for the country's non-national roads.  I asked the engineers if my interpretation was correct and they said yes, that there has been a reduction in the money provided for the maintenance of non-national roads in my county area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do not provide for the maintenance of these roads, we are affecting the infrastructure of each area.  This is a very big issue.  Only six months ago, when they were on the other side of the fence, I spoke to my Fine Gael colleagues about this and they agreed that we need more money.  Now that they <Col N="1433" /> are in the front line, they say there has been an increase in the allocation for non-national roads.</P>
    <P>I question the material costs of the surface dressing of roads.  Over a number of years these costs have increased by 6 or 7 per cent.  Is the Minister aware that the material used for surfacing roads has a natural span of only seven to eight years?  Yet we are to expect this material surfacing to last for over 20 years.  How can we have good byroads when no money is being provided to help resurface them?  Unless we tackle the problem at the root, we will find we do not have enough money to maintain the roads.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have a huge volume of heavy traffic on our roads.  There are many excavation works because gas pipes are being laid.  We also have underground cabling.  All this leaves roads in such a mess that communities are outraged at the difficulties in getting from one place to another.  There is no support from the Government for the development and resurfacing of roads. If we do not satisfy the local communities there will not be a community or a local authority which will not question the allocation of money for non-national roads especially in a year when we have had very serious flooding and roads deteriorated at an unprecedented rate.  Anybody who watched television over the last four months will have seen the plight of the people in the west and in other rural areas.</P>
    <P>Speaking for an urban area I have great difficulty in trying to talk to residents' meetings about the condition of urban, non-national roads.  I empathise totally with the people in rural areas who are trying to handle this problem. In considering how best to tackle the huge problem of non-national roads, perhaps we should call in our county managers and discuss with them how this money can best be spent.  Non-national roads are not being given priority at the moment, although they should be, and I wonder if we should not tie in levies to get co-operation in <Col N="1434" /> finding a way around this.  The roads are in a dreadful state and there is a reduction this year.</P>

I am talking about the whole country, because I have travelled the length and breadth of it.  Be it rural or urban, we have a huge problem which is not being dealt with.  We are not giving priority to community or non-national roads and unless we tackle that, the collapse of infrastructure will not be taken into account in the overall development of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the House knows exactly what the scene was last year and to try to put a different face on it is unworthy of some people.  The baseline is that when you take out the £15 million or £20 million from the tax amnesty last year and the £5 million once off discretionary payment as well, there was a substantial increase in funding for roads this year &mdash; somewhere around 18 per cent.  Would the Minister say that that is enough?  He certainly would not, nor do I think that anybody here would say it is enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not enough.  Looking back, since 1986 at the figures for the rate support grant, which is supposed to be own resources for local authorities, I find that every year until a couple of years ago the rates support grant figures were reduced.  There was some sleight of hand going on, because the Minister said he was providing more money for roads while on the other hand the allocation to county councils was being reduced, and it did not do anything for road surfaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us admit that we had years of neglect, but in many cases county councillors are not taking the matter seriously themselves.  Quite a number of county councils are not increasing the amount <Col N="1436" /> of their own resources from last year. That is a fact, and whinging and whining at the Minister is only part of the problem. We all whinge and whine at the Minister, because in County Monaghan alone we need about £50 million to get the roads back into shape; yet we know that the Minister has not got a hope of providing that kind of resource.  Cavan County Council needs a bit more, probably £55 million or £60 million, but there is no way that the Minister can provide that.</P>
    <P>If county councillors are serious and if they want to impress the Government and the Minister, then they should put it on the line at estimates time and show that they are serious about providing their own resources to match the Government's.  How many local authorities have increased their own resources by 18 per cent this year?</P>

      <P>My own county council has enormous problems arising from a small rate base of around £970,000.  In other words, if we doubled the rate tomorrow morning we would only have an extra £970,000 to put into the roads. While that is a major problem for us, I question our own loyalty to the people who live in rural Ireland because this year we have not increased the amount of own resources going into the roads. Surely we have to say mea culpa because that is not an adequate response.  We must look into our hearts to see whether we are spending the money properly.  We have to ask ourselves whether local authorities are responding in a proper way to the dire needs of rural areas and whether we are doing our best in all areas of work?</P>
      <P>In Monaghan and Cavan, but Monaghan in particular, we have intensive farming, which is not found anywhere else in Ireland.  Many small mushroom and poultry units are dispersed throughout the county which bring a lot of traffic along small roads.  In addition, milk tankers and deliveries of meal to poultry farms causes further road problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take note that we also need to see a peace dividend on the ground.  Now that we have opportunities, we are taking steps to develop tourism in the Border counties.  We have had no tourism there up to now because we were reckoned to be in the war zone.  However, we cannot develop tourism unless we get an injection of funding to open hotels and other facilities for people.  The Government will have to release funding for the Border counties under the heading of tourism. There is great untapped potential to develop tourism and to increase our rates base to give everybody a better lifestyle and increase employment levels. The Minister should keep that in mind when he has discussions with the Government because it is one area in which we have fantastic growth potential. We must grasp the opportunity and not let it pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> Traditionally we did not worry about the issue because we did not have any tourists and there was no point in putting money into an area where you would get no return.  Now we will have a return, but only if people come on a regular basis.  In many cases the conditions of the roads are bad and if fourists were to travel them once, they would not return.  I appeal to the Minister to let us see a peace dividend on the ground &mdash; a practical input which everybody can see as part of the peace dividend. We are opening up our rivers, lakes and all our amenities to tourists. We are happy that money is there for marketing and we are using it.  I support the Minister is his efforts.  This year we got a 5 per cent increase in our rates support grant, which is the largest support we have had in that area for a long time.</P>

As Members of the House will, no doubt, be aware, a motion couched in similar terms was debated recently in the other House.  It is inevitable, therefore, that this debate will cover much of the same ground and <Col N="1439" /> that similar arguments &mdash; for and against &mdash; will be put forward.  I would like, however, in the short time which is available to me to begin, as the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, did in the Dáil, by robustly rejecting the contention that funding for non-national roads has been reduced by the Government.  The reality is that when certain exceptional, nonrecurring elements are removed from the 1994 grants package, the 1995 grants will be seen to be up, not only on the underlying 1994 level but up on any previous year.</P>

Let us be realistic about a real issue and a real problem.

      <P>Some of us are serious about achieving things in public life, <Col N="1440" /> others are only interested in making a name for themselves.</P>
      <P>The Government, as I will outline, is well aware of the problems affecting our non-national roads and has already made two significant responses to deal with these problems.  The Government has provided additional funding in the budget and has also asked &mdash; which is a very important issue &mdash; for a comprehensive report on the state of the network so that a proper plan can be put in place and implemented over a reasonable period of time.</P>
      <P>I have approached every task which has befallen me in the two and half years since I became a Minister by identifying and analysing the problem and then coming forward with a comprehensive solution.  I have managed reasonably well to deal with a range of intractable issues which had been on the agenda for many years.</P>
      <P>I would like to come directly to the question of the 1995 grants to local authorities for non-national roads. These grants amount to almost £103 million, or over £1,900 for every single mile of network.  This level of funding represents a very significant contribution on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>While the funding for non-national roads in 1995 may well compare unfavourably with expenditure in 1994, the overall 1994 allocation of £107 million included, as I said, an additional £15 million provided from the tax amnesty receipts.  The source of this funding was accepted to be a once off benefit to the Exchequer and a categorical assurance was given at the time that this windfall for the Exchequer would not affect the underlying pattern of spending.  That reassurance, as I said, was given by the then Minister for Finance, who is now the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The special once off nature of the 1994 grants was further recognised by the fact that they were allocated as separate and distinct categories of grants to county councils rather than being absorbed into the general pool of discretionary grant moneys.  Besides, in making these separate allocations, local authorities were required to apply these moneys to categories of works and/or types of works, thereby further distinguishing these moneys from the normal discretionary grants which were made available to them.</P>
      <P>If one excludes the additional £15 million provided in 1994, a very different picture emerges in that overall expenditure on non-national roads is seen to be up.  For comparison purposes I will include the three years 1993, 1994 and 1995 and the relevant moneys in these years amounted to £75.3 million, £92 million and £102.898 million respectively.  This means that the 1995 allocations are up by nearly £11 million, or almost 12 per cent, on the underlying 1994 expenditure figure, and up by nearly £28 million, or over 36 per cent, on the 1993 figure, which the Senators opposite were happy to support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A further point of relevance here is that much play has been made of the fact that the funding for INTERREG II has been included in the overall grant moneys for 1995, with the implication that without this source of funding the 1995 grants would compare <Col N="1442" /> even more unfavourably with 1994. Again, this is simply not the case.  When one excludes the additional £15 million and the INTERREG II funding, the 1995 allocation is still greater than the grants paid in 1994.  Whether certain Members choose to accept this or not, this is the reality.</P>
      <P>On the issue of overall resources, let me also say that it is premature for the House to make any definitive judgment about how the 1995 finances for non-national roads compare with the 1994 position.  The motion before the House is not comparing like with like but instead is comparing the final expenditure figure for 1994 with the initial provision for 1995.  As the experience of 1994 shows, any judgment at this stage as to the year's final expenditure is speculative.</P>
      <P>I should point out here that the Government accepts that the non-national road network is of particular economic importance in Ireland and that it is vital that we improve the system. However, the task of upgrading our county and regional roads places a particularly heavy responsibility and financial burden on our society as we have a very extensive system of public roads by European standards.  For example, for each 1,000 population we have over three times as many kilometres of road as in Italy, the Netherlands or Spain. This, combined with the low density of our population and our relatively low level of urbanisation, inevitably means that maintaining our road system in general, and the non-national element in particular, creates very significant demands on our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall situation has been worsened in recent months by the extraordinary levels of rainfall in areas such as south Galway which has caused widespread damage and distress.  As the House will be aware, an interdepartmental committee has been established to co-ordinate the Government's response to the bad weather.  However, insofar as flood damage to roads is concerned, I must point out that the cost of remedial works to non-national roads as <Col N="1443" /> a result of flooding and storm damage must be met by local authorities from their own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants paid by my Department.  The general conditions governing these grants require local authorities to provide a contingency sum from their overall allocations so as to finance road restoration works which may be necessitated by extreme weather conditions.</P>
    <P>However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Government decided, following my intervention, to increase the allocation for non-national roads provided in the abridged estimates by an additional £8 million as part of its budget strategy.  The extra funding includes £4 million as an immediate response to the unsatisfactory condition of county roads which has been further aggravated by the recent bad weather. The allocations to local authorities for 1995 take account of these additional funds.  It is a matter for each authority to determine its work programme, including remedial works, having regard to the overall resources available to it.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside for the moment, however, the financial dimension, there have been a number of important changes in key circumstances in recent years which have affected our non-national roads and which, taken together, strongly suggest that the time has come for an overall appraisal of the network and a planned approach to where we are going for the future.  I would now like to detail a number of these factors.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge increase in recent years in the volume and nature of the traffic using our non-national roads. Many of these roads are carrying traffic loads greatly exceeding their limited capacity.  These loads arise, for example, from bulk milk tankers, oil delivery vehicles, timber extraction operators, heavy agricultural machinery, lorries carrying agricultural produce, such as beet and grain as well as traffic serving industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> Very little of the regional and county road system was designed or purpose built.  Most of the network has water-bound macadam, broken stone or gravel bases over which one or more surface dressings have been provided to seal the surface and prevent water penetration. Many county roads have only received one surface dressing.  The width of much of the network is inadequate to accommodate a heavy goods and an opposing vehicle, with the result that large vehicles overrun the pavement and cause severe damage to its support.</P>
    <P>The situation again has been aggravated by EU directives which provide for increased vehicle axle weights and dimensions.  Goods vehicles over eight tonnes have increased four fold in the last 30 years and are believed now to account for over 90 per cent of road pavement damage.  The consequences of increasing vehicle weights and axle loadings are to accelerate the process of damaging road surfaces and bridges. particularly on roads having little structural capacity to withstand such loadings.</P>
    <P>Weather and ground conditions both affect road conditions.  Freezing and thawing cycles can break up perished or cracked road surfaces and cause total foundation failure.  Many rural roads have no satisfactory drainage arrangements and water penetration through cracked surfaces which are not drained leads quickly and progressively to potholes and major road damage.  The large reduction in essential maintenance operations, such as surface dressings and the clearing of drainage outlets as a result of cutbacks over the years in local funding and reductions in maintenance operations, particularly following the voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme of some years ago, has exacerbated all of the above problems and accelerated the decline in the condition of regional and county roads.  These facts present a huge issue for us to address nationally.</P>
    <P>Because of all of these factors, the Government has asked for a report to be prepared as a matter of urgency on <Col N="1445" /> the overall state of our county roads, including changed traffic patterns, methods used for repair, future planning, etc.  The aim will be to put before the Government an up to date review of the state of the network, the extent and nature of the problems and the cost implications of bringing the network up to an acceptable standard over the next ten years.  I can assure the House that this will be a major job.  When this report is available to the Government &mdash; I expect this to be in about two months time &mdash; the question of funding will be considered further.  The Government is fully committed to improving our county roads system and when it has an opportunity to consider the overall situation, a realistic plan will be put in place to achieve this.  The financial implications of the plan will be an integral part of the exercise and the Government will play its part in ensuring that this plan can be properly implemented.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate this task.  We have allowed black topping to be put on roads that were never properly built in the first place.  They are not designed for and cannot cope with the traffic volumes and widths that they currently have.  It is not a matter of adding an extra few million pounds to non-national roads.  I am acutely aware that if I had allocated £109 million or an extra £2 million over last year's figure &mdash; £6 million over what had actually been allocated &mdash; instead of £103 million, there may not have been a row in this House tonight.  I put my hand on my heart and invite Senators to examine it here.  The number of potholes and the road system would be exactly the same. We have major problems &mdash; I see some people are shaking their heads.  Senators are deluding themselves if they think an extra £5 million to £8 million will solve this problem.  The problem goes far beyond that and it is one that all of us, as a society, will have to address if we are to maintain the fabric of rural Ireland and the network of roads that are required to maintain a rurally based population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> On the question of funding, it is imperative that local authorities too maintain their own commitment to investment in the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads and that the very substantial contribution of the State is not used by them as an excuse to reduce funding from their own resources.  State grants are provided to supplement local authorities' own resources, not to replace them.  In this connection, road authorities are spending from their own resources at the same general level, in money terms, as they spent in the early 1980s.  If central Government was spending that amount, there would be a paltry amount of money available to deal with the roads. The real value of this expenditure has been reduced clearly by inflation in the interim.</P>
    <P>We have also seen a dramatic shift in the balance of funding for non-national roads since 1986, which was not that long ago.  In that year, grants from central Government accounted for one third of total expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of these roads.  That is an interesting fact.  In 1995, the State's contribution stands at over 63 per cent.</P>
    <P>A further factor here is that there are wide variations among county councils in the provisions they make in their estimates for maintenance and improvement work on regional and county roads.  On a cost per mile basis, excluding Dublin authorities whose large expenditure levels would distort the situation, county councils' spending ranges &mdash; this is an interesting fact &mdash; from £165 per mile in one county to over £1,500 per mile in another.  Since I have been asked in previous fora to name these counties, I will.  I understand that the provision from the resources of Longford County Council this year is £165 per mile while Meath County Council were providing £1,584 per mile from its own resources.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to local authorities to provide realistically for the maintenance and upkeep of county roads in particular. Some of the counties that are most vociferous in demanding extra resources from the Exchequer are the least forthcoming in prioritising it in their own expenditure and that question has to be answered at local level.  Not all counties are in the same comfortable position to provide money and that has to be understood, but it also depends on the priority that local councils make.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde talked about the poor allocation made to South Dublin County Council.  I was very conscious of giving such a tremendous increase to the Dublin local authorities.  Last year, the total non-national road allocation to South County Dublin was £1.148 million. This year, this allocation was £2.968 million; an increase of 159 per cent.</P>

This is a specious argument <Col N="1448" /> if ever there was one.  The Government has been in office for just over three months.  Every schoolboy and schoolgirl in the country would be expected to know that road surfaces deteriorate very slowly over a long period.</P>

      <P>What this means is that the current state of the network reflects ongoing under-investment over a considerable number of years.  In this connection, I will not cause embarrassment to any Members of the House by reminding them which party has been in power for the longest period over the last ten years.  If political blame is to be apportioned, I suggest that the culprits are other than those currently in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I put it to the House that the Government's commitment to the non-national road network is beyond question.  This has been clearly demonstrated by the actions which the <Col N="1449" /> Government has taken by way of allocating very significant resources to these roads and taking steps to get an overall picture of the problem and of what must be done to really get to grips with it.</P>
    <P>I believe the House will agree that the Government is acting reasonably and responsibly.  It is very hard to constantly listen to demands for more funding while at the same time the Government is castigated by the Leader of the Opposition for being spendthrift and profligate with money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to listen to his reply to the motion before I spoke, because I welcome many aspects of it.  The main issue raised by constituents today is the condition of the county roads and the belief that, instead of getting better, they are deteriorating.  The proliferation of potholes and the year in, year out bad state of repairs is a constant torment to many people living in rural Ireland and they believe, whether true or not, that this issue is not being taken seriously at central Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people would wish, once and for all, to try to bring our roads up to an acceptable level and maintain them at that level.  I had hoped that there would <Col N="1451" /> be a major injection of funds over the next three to five years, but I accept from the Minister's remarks that this will be done over a ten year period, which is quite a long time.  However, if we were assured that it would be done, with the problem finally resolved, people, being reasonable, would be willing to accept this; but they must have confidence that it will be done.</P>
    <P>I accept also that the national primary roads are receiving substantial funding and that the improvement in their condition and the by-passes and so on going around the major towns is welcomed. However, the majority of people do not spend their time travelling the main roads of Ireland, and going about their daily activities they encounter roads which they consider to be unfit for use. We have tended to pay lip service to people living in rural Ireland, and the state of our roads is causing many problems for business people, farmers, school children and so on.  I accept the Minister's acknowledgment that the Government accepts that the non-national road network is of particular economic importance in Ireland and that it is vital that we improve the system.</P>
    <P>Talking to people about rural development and renewal is a nonsense unless we are prepared to put our money where our mouth is and address the problem once and for all.  Last year, the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy M. Smith, said that if county councils and engineers prepared a plan for major work on the roads over a period, the Government would be prepared to fund this if it believed that it would finally solve the problem. However, I am worried that the level of funding required by the local authorities appears to be at huge variance with what the Government seems to be prepared to dedicate to county roads.</P>
    <P>In the past few years there has been a shift away from specific improvement grants for remedial works and this has been done to maximise the drawing down of money from Europe, which is <Col N="1452" /> understandable.  However, it has taken money away from repair work in general and while some beneficial work is being undertaken in certain areas, enough money is not available to, as the Minister said, regain the ground that has been lost from under-funding in the past.  County councils are losing ground on the maintenance of the remainder of the network after they have looked after these specific areas.</P>
    <P>There were improvements in the early 1990s, but there appears to have been a shift in emphasis and the effect of it was masked by the tax amnesty.  I accept the Minister's assertion that as a country we probably have too many public roads and that there are too many roads in the charge of local authorities. However, we must grasp the nettle of funding local authorities properly, of telling people that the roads will be brought up to a certain level and that they will then have to take care of them. We cannot pretend that we are adequately funding them if we are not doing so.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's remarks regarding the funding of local authorities, but will he consider the whole problem of their funding and be honest with the people?  If we cannot afford to do things, tell them; but there should not be any measures such as fiddling with the service charges and attempting to tell people that they do not have to pay them and they will not be cut off, because that is unfair.  It is only further increasing a dependency culture and making people believe that the Government has money to do everything when clearly it has not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement the Minister acknowledges the position with regard to many rural roads and advises on the commissioning of a report on the overall state of the roads and so on.  I read a booklet issued by the Minister's Department in 1993-94, and if the provisions of the 1994 Act are implemented, the Minister will go a long way towards improving the county and regional roads.  In the latter months the <Col N="1453" /> amount of water deliberately drained onto the public roads is nothing short of scandalous.  It is a danger in many instances and it is causing a grave deterioration in the condition of the roads. The councils do not appear to be able to do anything about it.</P>
      <P>The year 1988-89 was the year of fiscal rectitude.  It was also the year when the county council's workers, including clerical and technical staff, were all cleared out.  There is hardly anybody left to do anything.  If the local authority does not have its eight or nine groups of men working on the county road system, whatever expenditure it invests will not be successful.  The road system must be maintained.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the National Roads Authority resulted in a two tier system to some extent.  There appears to be substantial expenditure on our national primary and secondary roads.  I am sure the Minister is sincere in seeking equality.  My local authority previously made a submission on how local authorities could employ more people, without incurring any great extra costs, by taking the social welfare system into account.  I have given an updated copy of that document to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Consultation and dialogue might be helpful.</P>

The Government recently announced a special allocation for Border roads, which is once off funding, that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We certainly do, although it is not enough.  We are being embarrassed by the British rebuilding roads right up to the Border and we are unable to match them.  We can only match them in language, unfortunately. My county is embarrassed.  The county manager in the manager's report has included INTERREG funding of £1, 617,000.  However, that is maybe money &mdash; it is not there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to differ; it is not there now.  The paper money has not arrived.  Special Border funding was announced as a bonus to the small rural communities which suffered as a result <Col N="1455" /> of the closure for 25 years of the Border roads.  The special funding was allocated to recover the routes.  However, even after taking that into consideration the INTERREG funding, we are still short of funds.  To add insult to injury, £0.5 million is being given to my county out of £112 million being allocated to the National Roads Authority.  We are embarrassed.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to support a motion in order to condemn anybody.  That is negative thinking.  I must do it, however, to focus on the importance of the motion.  I would rather appeal to the Minister.  I disagree with his comment that another couple of million makes no difference.  It makes a serious difference to those counties at a loss.  My county manager is worried for two reasons.  I do not wish to change the debate, but I appeal to the Minister on this matter.  It will cost the Minister and his party more in votes than he thinks.</P>

Recently Donegal received over £10 million for both national, primary and secondary roads and for non-national roads.  The allocation for Donegal this year is up £700,000 on the 1994 figure.  That represents an increase of 14 per cent.  It was unbelievable how quiet the county council meeting was on Monday.  I have been at such roads meetings before and this one was the quietest I have ever attended.</P>

      <P>When the allocation was announced on 8 March, a young doctor in my town who is a TD welcomed the allocation.  He has not opened his mouth since.  Recently a local TD and MEP said that we are swindling the money from the INTERREG funds.  However, he has had to retreat on that matter because it was discovered that he was wrong.  A former Senator from the county spoke confusedly on the radio yesterday.  First he said that we were down £2 million but by the time he finished his statement he said that we were down £1 million. He has a problem with his figures as well.</P>
      <P>The grants to the Border counties represent a figure of £2,400 per mile for every mile of non-national road.  The corresponding figure for other counties, excluding Dublin, is £1,600 per mile.  We have done well out of this.  Without the tax amnesty, which was a once off figure last year, the figure for 1994 would have been £92 million.  The allocation for this year, 1995, is increased to £103 million in total.  I welcome the allocation for Border roads, which is almost £1 million. Donegal will receive £1.6 million from a total of £6 million in INTERREG funding.  That is almost one third of the total allocation this year.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has done for Donegal.  We will never be entirely satisfied &mdash; we would all like to get more.  Deputy Noel Dempsey, in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 16 March, pointed out that Donegal received £6.185 million for 1994, while in 1995 the county was allocated £6.899 million.  If that is a reduction, somebody is fooling themselves.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  Listening to some speakers, one would believe that this problem happened overnight on 19 December 1994, but it has been with us for about 20 years.  Successive <Col N="1458" /> Governments, including the Fianna Fáil minority Government from 1987-1989, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government from 1989 to 1982 and the last Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, have not dealt with it directly.  I am delighted the Minister and the Government have decided to put together a plan to discover what the problem is and to come up with a solution.  All the money in the world would not solve the problem under the present system.</P>
      <P>I have said publicly before and have no hesitation in saying again that 7p on a gallon of petrol would collect £50 million for this purpose; 85 per cent of the responses to this suggestion, which I made on RTE Radio a fortnight ago, have been positive.  Taking into consideration the cost per 10,000 miles of running an average family car, such a levy would cost in the region of £35 a year.  The majority of people running cars are spending much more than that on parts, tyre repair and other problems arising from the roads.  I discussed this matter at my first meeting with the Taoiseach since he went into office.  He is deeply concerned about this problem and wants a plan put in place so that whatever money the Government provides is spent properly.  Some of the money spent has been wasted.</P>

      <P>There are problems such as drainage and, for example, up to three milk tankers from different co-ops travelling on the same road to different farmers.  These must be tackled because we do not have a road network to deal with that traffic flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this plan is put in place we can re-examine the allocation given last year, taking into account the tax amnesty.  Listening to my colleague in the other House, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Environment.  Deputy Dempsey, one would believe no local authority in the country received any funds this year, for housing or anything else.  He said this evening that the local <Col N="1459" /> authority structure has fallen to pieces. Does he know the position in rural Ireland in 1995?  Has he forgotten that he has only been out of office for three months?  Was he not aware of the problems rural people have?</P>
    <P>I look forward to the report which will be presented to the Cabinet and to supporting the plan which will be put in place.  As a Senator and an elected local authority member, I am prepared to back the Government's proposals, even one to raise extra finances to deal with the problem.  Some £96 million went into State coffers last year from the lottery. One sector of the health budget received £35 million of that and £11 million of that was spent building hospitals, although it was never meant for that.  There is nothing to stop substantial funding from the lottery being given for two or three years to solve the county roads problem.  I have listened to seven Opposition speakers and have not heard one proposal to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. I welcome the debate but I am disappointed <Col N="1460" /> I have only three minutes.  I listened with interest to the speakers.  If one was to say some local authorities were not pulling their weight one would have to justify it.  My county was one of the first to introduce service charges, and not alone for water and refuse.  It was the first to introduce a sewerage charge to supplement the Government grants.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech seemed to be rather defensive.  There was much juggling of figures to justify the reality. There is a problem and the Minister knows it.  The county roads are falling apart, no matter who is in Government. My party was in power with the Minister's party for a period and I continually brought up the state of the county roads.  It is particularly serious in County Kerry, which depends on tourism. An extra £1.8 million came to Kerry from the tax amnesty and was put to good use.  We started rebuilding the roads, not just refilling the potholes.  We have restructured the county roads in half mile stretches.  The then Government gave us a guarantee that this would be ongoing and that we could continue over a three to four year period while the money was coming from Europe, so we could get the county roads back in shape.</P>
      <P>Those roads are tarred only once every 40 to 50 years.  When I first was on the county council, one could expect the roads to be retarred on an eight year cycle.  That means the road falls apart in between.  One can use the weather or heavy traffic or any other excuse for the state of the roads, and they all have an effect, but the Minister is in a position of power.  He is in a difficult position but he has to handle the matter and do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money will have to be found. Although some people say money will not solve the problem, it has to be given. Any tourist who comes to Kerry this year and sees the position of the roads will get a bad impression of the county. He will see we have lovely hotels, great facilities and beautiful scenery, but terrible roads.  He will wonder what we are <Col N="1461" /> doing.  Moneys will have to be transferred between the Departments to be put into the county road network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I have and I can show the Minister many places where he can get money.  In the last budget the banks were given back about £15 million. Those are the fat cats from whom the Government should have taken more money.  If I was in a position of power I would have put extra taxation on the banks, because they have reduced their workforces and have done nothing for the betterment of Ireland.  By imposing exorbitant charges in rates, they have only taken what they can from people who are trying to develop the country. It was the banks who were given tax breaks in the budget, but the money should be taken from them and put into county roads.</P>
      <P>The amount of money involved is small.  The Tánaiste, the leader of the Minister's party, comes from my county, which suffered a reduction of £500,000. If we were given an extra £150,000 we could do a great deal, because it could be spent on materials and on real work. As the Minister knows, a certain amount must be spent for operational purposes, but any extra money can be seen to be of use.</P>
      <P>Something must be done about the roads.  I appeal to the Minister because he comes from a rural area. He is lucky to be driving a fine car, but if he was in a small boneshaker he would know exactly what the roads are like &mdash; they are in a deplorable state.  The weather conditions, heavy milk trucks and other things cause problems, but it is the Minister who must solve them.  We cannot solve them; we can only nudge him in the right direction.</P>

About 95 per cent of council time at the last meeting was spent on country roads.  Even the Minister's party voted for the whole discretionary grant to be spent on county roads this year; only two Fine Gael councillors were against it.  That shows the seriousness of the position in Kerry. We have to look at the structure and the fabric of the country.  We have spent millions building up the tourism business. We have people abroad trying to bring tourists into this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little disappointed. He did something in the Department of Health which he might do for county councils.  Health boards were in debt. We came out badly in the north west because we were not far enough in debt. However, those that were in debt got extra money to pay off their debts and take them out of the grip of the banks. We were paying about £300,000 a year in bank charges.  If the Minister could solve those problems, we would have £300,000 more to spend on roads.  Much of the money we raise goes to pay bank debts.  The Minister should look at the councils in that regard as many of them are in debt.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is talking about selling off housing loans. What about selling off some housing loans and giving the money to the council to pay the banks and clear their overdrafts? That is one positive way in which the Minister could be remembered as doing a good job for local authorities. We talk about promoting tourism. We should also put a statutory charge on forestry, because forestry trucks are causing much damage and we cannot recoup the money.  The Minister could do something positive to ensure they pay and repair the roads they have damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for roads. We are down a lot of money in Sligo as is every other county.  We depended on INTERREG money as a little shot in the arm every year.  The INTERREG <Col N="1464" /> money was great in the Border counties. We will not get that this year because it is built into the national finances.  That is a retrograde step and I appeal to the Minister to look at it.  In the North they are building concrete roads and so on with money from Europe.  We have to do everything through the Minister for Finance.  Every council should get its share of the European money directly. Far too much of it is spent on administration. The Minister should make arrangements for every local authority to get its money directly.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are doing and would do a good job.  When county councils were running the health boards they were told they were not doing a good job.  Look at the job they were doing with a paltry amount of money.  How many millions have we ploughed into the health boards since?  Are we getting the same return?  We are downgrading councils, but councils did a good job over the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister should introduce a Supplementary Estimate.  He should provide that European money would go directly to each county council and avoid them having to go through this bureaucratic machine, where every time a wheel moves a cog it costs hundreds of thousands of pounds.  I appeal to the Minister to make those few amendments and especially to introduce a Supplementary Estimate.  I appeal to him to at least give every council what they got last year.  It still will not be in line with inflation and we will still be down.  It is important that the Minister does this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I congratulate him on his new portfolio and I wish him the best of luck in the Department of the Environment. I have no doubt he will do an excellent job; he was an excellent Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The sewerage system in Castlebar is in a terrible state.  This problem can be divided into three areas: first, the Castlebar environs, which covers all around the town; second, a tertiary unit for Castlebar; and third, the overloading of the current sewerage system in the town itself, which is the most pressing need at present.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for the Castlebar environs sewerage scheme to go ahead as the expansion of the town is most important because all existing developments in two areas of the town are using septic tanks.  The provision of a tertiary unit is of the utmost importance because a very high level of phosphates are entering Lough Conn.  As the Minister is aware, Lough Conn &mdash; an important fishing lake &mdash; is a great natural resource for the west.  The stock in Lough Conn has been reduced over the last number of years and the high level of phosphates entering the lake has been pinpointed as the reason.  It is of the utmost importance that the tertiary unit for the Castlebar sewage plant come on-stream in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Solving the problem of the overloading of the present system is also of the utmost importance.  As I said, we are talking about a very small urban area which has been included in the extension of the urban boundaries.  Castlebar Urban Council has asked Mayo County Council to refuse any planning applications which would be using Castlebar town sewerage scheme because of the overloading of the existing system.  It is very important from an expansion point of view to alleviate this problem very quickly because Mayo County Council is on the verge of refusing every planning application that comes before it <Col N="1467" /> which would be using the Castlebar sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>This Government has appointed a Minister with special responsibility for the west.  We cannot on one hand appoint a Minister for the west and on the other curtail development.  I know the Minister has done many things for Castlebar in the past &mdash; he has given the go ahead to the hospital and to the kidney unit and we thank him for that; the people in Castlebar and in Mayo appreciate it.  This is very important for the development of the town.  Castlebar is the capital of Mayo, it is the largest town in the county and we cannot afford to curtail any developments.  I urge the Minister to provide the funds to alleviate the overloading of the present sewerage system in the town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Burke said, the town of Castlebar has grown steadily in recent years and is now an active commercial and industrial centre with a population of around 11,000, including the environs.  It is obvious that Castlebar is a town which has benefited from a substantial investment in public service infrastructure in recent times and I am delighted that Senator Burke mentioned some of the ones in which I was involved.  The town is well served by a new road network as well as a modern water supply system and a sewage treatment plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing sewerage system, constructed during the 1980s and completed about five years ago, includes a sewage treatment plant with a design capacity for a population equivalent of 20,000 persons.  This modern plant has sufficient capacity to meet the future medium term needs of industry, tourism and the private residential sector.  The areas within the UDC boundary are also provided with new and upgraded foul and storm water collection systems. Allied to these developments, phase 1 of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme, developed at a cost of around £15 million, provided Castlebar <Col N="1468" /> with a high quality high capacity public water supply capable of meeting all development needs well into the next century.</P>
    <P>Much of the recent industrial and residential development could not be accommodated within the urban boundary with the result that the town's environs have seen substantial growth in size and population.  This in turn has placed additional pressure on the existing urban area collection system which, on occasion, has given rise to surcharging of the sewers within the urban boundary.  Other residential developments, such as those adjacent to the Ballinrobe Road and Saleen Lough, are outside the collection catchment and are served by private septic tank systems.  It is desirable that the collection system should accommodate these and similar developments elsewhere within the Castlebar environs.</P>
    <P>With the objective of relieving pressure on the town collection system and to extend the system to serve the industrial and residential needs of the town's environs, Mayo County Council has proposed the construction of a new Castlebar environs sewerage scheme costing an estimated £1.6 million.  The project consists of the laying of over 12,000 metres of sewers and the construction of three pumping stations.  The resulting waste load will be treated at the UDC's treatment plant at Knockthomas.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke will appreciate that there are many urgent demands being made at this time on the finances available under my Department's water and sewerage programme.  In County Mayo alone, the cost of water and sewerage schemes approved for construction or at present being constructed amounts to some £43 million.  This includes new sewerage schemes for the towns of Westport, Bangor Erris and Ballinrobe. A number of other urgently needed schemes have been prioritised for investment under the Cohesion Fund. Applications for grant assistance have been lodged with the EU Commission and a decision on these is awaited.  The <Col N="1469" /> principal projects involved are new water supply schemes for the towns of Knock, Ballyhaunis, Westport and Louisburgh costing an estimated £26 million.  Also included is the proposed sewerage scheme for Claremorris costing around £5.5 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke will know that Castlebar and County Mayo in general fared very well as far as past investment in water and sewerage services is concerned. The level of existing and planned investment is also very substantial, amounting to some £75 million.  The Senator has described well the problems associated with the collection system on the outskirts of the town.  I would like to assure him that I appreciate the need for additional sewerage services for Castlebar and its environs.  The need must, however, be considered in the context of the available resources and the demands of schemes already prioritised for significant investment.  That includes not alone the enormous investment needs of those Mayo schemes referred to earlier, but the many high priority schemes from other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The capacity of a project, such as the major works proposed for the Castlebar environs, to attract EU co-financing greatly enhances my Department's ability to finance such schemes.  In this regard, Mayo County Council recently submitted an application for Cohesion Funds for the Castlebar scheme in the context of an integrated application for the protection of the Lough Cullen/Lough Conn catchments.  This is being examined at present and my Department will be in contact with Mayo County Council regarding progress with this application.  I cannot anticipate when it may be possible to approve the Castlebar scheme.  It will take some time yet before the position on EU co-financing can be clarified.  I do, however, note the Senator's concern to have this scheme advanced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I know he has an interest in this topic, having given up smoking cigarettes himself.  The adverse effects of tobacco smoking on health have been well documented.  In this country cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the main causes of premature death.  The smoking of tobacco has been implicated in both cancer of the lung and of the bladder, and a high incidence of deaths due to strokes and heart attacks long before the proverbial three score years and ten are very much more common in smokers than in non-smokers.  In fact, the level of early death from cardiovascular disease in Ireland is the worst in Europe.</P>
      <P>With our present health regulations it would be hard to see Sir Walter Raleigh returning from North America and starting smoking in Youghal with nothing more happening to him than a young woman throwing water over him to prevent him going on fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the emphasis in health promotion literature is on stopping smoking. Advertising, while it is not supposed to be directed at children, is often subtle and appeals to children.  I want to address the issue of preventing or, at <Col N="1471" /> least, delaying young people from starting smoking.  We have not seriously addressed this issue.  While cigarette smoking is harmful in itself, most surveys regarding the illegal use of drugs suggest that children who are on illegal drugs were already tobacco smokers. This group is far more likely to become involved with taking drugs and with the appalling social and medical consequences that ensue.</P>
    <P>Under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, and the 1990 regulations it is illegal for a retailer to sell cigarettes to anyone under 16 years.  However, I am sure the Minister will have seen the results of a recent survey by ASH &mdash; Action on Smoking and Health &mdash; which showed that children aged between 11 and 13 years successfully bought cigarettes in the areas of Cork, Wexford, Carlow and Dublin in 90 per cent of cases.  In all these cases there was an adult with them in the shop who witnessed the sale and it was verified by an environmental health officer who was outside.  There was no possibility that these children, as they were so young, could have been considered to have been 16 years; they were all instructed to give their true ages if asked, but none of them was.  Of the 500 shops visited, only 43 displayed a sign saying it was illegal to sell cigarettes to children under 16.</P>
    <P>While RGDATA and the newsagents have expressed their alarm at the results of the survey, they know that no retailers have been prosecuted for illegally selling cigarettes to children under 16.  This is the nub of the problem. According to ASH there is a greater problem in that many young shop assistants do not seem to be aware that it is illegal to sell cigarettes to under 16 year olds.</P>
    <P>Most adults who smoke admit they began smoking before they were 16 years.  Therefore, the sale of cigarettes to children is important, and the fact that charges are not being brought against any of the retailers means there is really no risk if they sell to children. <Col N="1472" /> A charge cannot be brought unless the retailer is caught in the act by an environmental health officer in the shop.  It is the environmental health officer's direct responsibility to enforce the legislation.  It must be possible to make regulations so that the environmental health officer could stay outside the shop and verify the sale.</P>
    <P>Until this survey was published I doubted that anyone would sell cigarettes to under 16 year olds, but considering how ill-understood the regulations are and how difficult it is to enforce them, I am not surprised.  I travel from my home to the Rotunda Hospital often through the Fenian Street and Gardiner Street areas.  Quite often at around 9 a.m.  I see young children going to school smoking, and while stopped in the traffic I have seen them going into shops and coming out with cigarettes.  If the environmental health officer could be outside the shop there could be some hope of convictions.</P>
    <P>There are other steps the Department of Health could take to bring the issue to retailers' attention.  It should be essential to have permanent fixed signs over counters and vending machines and employees should be told about regulations.  One could have a follow up of test purchase surveys, such as that carried out by ASH.  This could lead to a reduction in the incidence of under age selling, as happened in the Liverpool area, where they managed to decrease the incidence in two years from 100 per cent to 3 per cent.  In Britain the Children's and Young Persons' Protection from Tobacco Act, 1991, involved increasing the publicity regarding the regulations and rigorous investigation of any people found to be selling cigarettes to children.</P>
    <P>Any gains made in the reduction of cigarette smoking by older people is being lost because of young people taking up the habit.  Vast sums of money are not being made by retailers in selling cigarettes to children.  The problem is that the regulations are not well enough known and it is too difficult to <Col N="1473" /> enforce them.  I ask the Minister to respond urgently to the matter.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and I thank Senator Henry for sharing her time.  Society does not accept that smoking is the biggest cause of death in Ireland.  In 1995 alone, 2,000 deaths in people between the ages of 35 to 69 years will occur as a result of smoking, and overall 6,000 deaths from smoking will occur in 1995.  Those who start smoking in their teenage years run a high risk and if they carry on smoking half of them will be killed by tobacco. Most of those who die as a result of smoking are not particularly heavy smokers but started in their teenage years. Young teenagers must be told the dangers of taking up smoking.  They are not aware of the dangers.  They should also be made aware of the difficulty of giving up once they start.  I recently talked to young people who smoke and they said they should have been told how difficult it would be for them to give up once they started.</P>
      <P>The recent report published by ASH, to which Senator Henry referred, said that any gains we have made in reducing smoking have really been achieved by older people quitting or dying as a result of smoking and not by fewer people taking it up.  The Exchequer has benefited to the tune of £6 million in 1994 from the illegal sale of cigarettes to children. This is frightening and we have to ask if the Government is as addicted to the revenue it gets from cigarette sales as the smokers are to the tobacco itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers of young women taking up smoking is worrying.  It shows the Government's anti-smoking campaign to be scandalously inadequate.  Men seem to be getting the message, but there is a huge increase in the number of women smoking.  They are not aware of the danger to their health.  If we look at the amount of money put into reducing the deaths on our roads, of which there are approximately 400 per year, and the smaller number of deaths from AIDS, and we see the massive road <Col N="1474" /> safety and AIDS awareness campaigns, we can readily appreciate the inadequate level of Government funding in its anti-smoking campaign.  We have the frightening unenviable record of having the third highest rate of smoking of the 22 OECD countries.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Government and the Department of Health mount a massive anti-smoking campaign with particular targeted messages to young people in school.  People are starting to smoke younger and younger, and the difficulty of giving it up is so great that many of them will continue smoking for quite a substantial part of their lives.  We must graphically spell out the medical horrors of smoking.  The work done by ASH in this regard should be commended and its recommendations should be implemented by the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this important issue and I thank Senator Honan for her contribution.</P>
      <P>I have noted with concern that despite the efforts of the Department and the health boards to prevent retailers from selling cigarettes to children under 16 years of age, some retailers appear to be continuing the practice.  My Department is currently evaluating the ASH survey and proposes to address the issues raised in the survey as appropriate.  I assure the Senators that the points they have raised and their suggestions will be referred by me to that evaluation.</P>
      <P>I regard it as a matter of prime importance that we discourage smoking among teenagers and young adults.  My Department's prevention and education campaigns are geared towards this objective.  It is essential that we take whatever steps are necessary to restrict access by children to cigarettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an offence under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act. 1988, to sell cigarettes to children under the age of 16 years.  Responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of <Col N="1475" /> the legislation rests with the health boards and they have, in the past 12 months, been attempting to ensure that the provisions of the legislation are complied with.  My Department has also written to the organisation representing retail outlets seeking their advice and co-operation on how incidents of the sale of cigarettes to under age children might be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Senators will appreciate that, given the large number of outlets at which cigarettes may be purchased, policing the legislation is not always easy. However, the health boards have been asked to ensure that those responsible for retail outlets are aware of their responsibilities under the law.  In addition, notices prepared by the health promotion unit of my Department, designed for display in retail outlets, have been widely circulated.  These notices specify that the sale of tobacco products to persons under 16 year is prohibited by law.</P>
    <P>I intend to keep this area under close review over the coming months to ensure that we achieve our objective.  I will also consider what other courses of action may be open to me to ensure that the practice of selling cigarettes to children <Col N="1476" /> is eliminated.  I assure Senators that I take this matter seriously.  Since 1970 there has been a considerable reduction in the number of smokers, which is encouraging.  However, as has been pointed out, the percentage of smokers among young people is a matter of concern, although recently I got information which indicates that the situation may possibly be levelling off or even declining.  Obviously, there is a great deal more to be done.  I thank Senators for their constructive contributions and I assure them that their suggestions will be taken into consideration as we move to further the campaign.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comments.  The regulations are there and it is important that they are enforced.  It was alarming that so many people working in retail outlets did not realise that it was against the law to sell cigarettes to children and that the notices which have been sent out are not on display.  It would be a great help if the Minister could ensure that these notices would be on display.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 March 1995.</P>
