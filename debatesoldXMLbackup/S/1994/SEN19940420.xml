      <P>I have notice from Senator Enright that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Government to use their influence at the UN and EU to take all necessary emergency action to help bring to an end the massacre of innocent civilians in Gorazde by the Bosnian Serb forces.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the appointment of a home/school liaison officer at St. Anne's primary school, Rathkeale, County Limerick, in view of the large <Col N="2" /> number of traveller children attending the school.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of the Ryanair service between Shannon and Stanstead, the consequent loss of 60,000 passengers into the mid-west region, and the efforts, if any, being made by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to replace this service.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to allocate money towards the repair of vandalised graves in the Jewish cemeteries in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> I regard the matters raised by Senators Enright and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule the matters raised by Senators Taylor-Quinn and Ross as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds that both matters lack ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>As a long term friend and colleague of Senator Hillery, both at University College Dublin and in this House, I extend my very warm congratulations. It is a great honour for him and for the House.  He will bring all the qualities we have come to admire to his new position.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to urgently arrange a debate on Northern Ireland; it was the last thing we asked for at the end of the previous session.  In the meantime, there has been a succession of loyalist terrorism, which is growing daily in depth and depravity.  The situation in Northern Ireland is spiralling out of control. We would all welcome a debate to review political developments and to express our views on this matter.  We would all like to hear the type of condemnations that have come from this House when the IRA commit atrocities from some of the unionist politicians of the deeds that are being committed in the name of the Protestant people of Northern Ireland.  Some of these condemnations have been deafening in their silence and some of the twisting and twirling in recent days has been quite sickening. I ask the Leader of the House for a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader also indicate what legislation it is intended to take in the early part of this session?  Will Item 38 be taken in European time or European summer time this evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request.  I agree with the response of the Chair to the request from Senator Enright in relation to the unspeakable developments in Bosnia. Later today we will discuss the consequences of illegal drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this island the most unspeakable depravity is perpetrated by people who call themselves loyalists, to whatever they may be loyal.  That is not to say that any one of us is in any way reluctant to condemn what has been done by so-called republicans over the years; indeed we have condemned these actions.  That people are being targeted consistently and maliciously by an element on this <Col N="5" /> island of Ireland is unbelievable and unspeakable.  I join with Senator Manning in saying that those who have jurisdiction over the North must ensure that these actions are not allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had planned to ask you to say a few words on Senator Hillery's appointment, a Chathaoirligh but I gather you would prefer to leave that to a later stage.  We are honoured that he has been given this appointment.</P>
      <P>I support the suggestions for a debate on Northern Ireland at the earliest opportunity and I agree with the concerns expressed within the last few minutes. The comments in regard to Northern Ireland should have covered not just terrorist activities but the joy we felt when we heard the announcement today of the 250 new jobs in Northern Ireland.  The people in Ballymena who achieved this have our support and goodwill.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Manning's efforts for an immediate debate on Bosnia.  The Independent Senators asked for this debate some weeks ago.  The situation in Bosnia has disimproved to such an extent that it is of the utmost importance that we find time in this House to debate it almost immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I ask the Leader of the House if the Minister for the Environment or the Taoiseach would come here to clarify the Government's intention in relation to residential property tax, rates or the funding of local authorities at an early date.  Many of us have an interest in this area and we are very concerned at the way things are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to Senator Honan's comments on local authority funding, I call for clarification by the Taoiseach of his explicit statement regarding the reintroduction of rates on private houses.  Reports in today's paper suggest that the Government is intent on going down that road and householders around the country are very worried about this.  It is incumbent on the Taoiseach <Col N="6" /> to come into this House, to clarify the position and to tell us if the Government is intent on bringing back rates on private houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support those Members who called for a debate on the problems in the North.  Both sides of the House have requested this debate on a number of occasions.  We are all aware that murder and butchery continues to escalate there.  The authorities in the North and the British Government are the responsible authority there.  We must have a debate in this House and send a clear message that we are not satisfied with the controls put in place by the present administration in the North.</P>
      <P>The second item I wish to raise affects our beef producers.  I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the beef industry at an early opportunity. The German Government recently made a statement that they were considering banning the purchase of Irish beef on the grounds that we had a high incidence of BSE.  Every branch of the media in Europe carried that news.  A great deal of damage was done to the Irish beef trade by that news item.  I listened at seven o'clock in the morning on Radio Four and that news spread far and wide and much damage was done.  We must give a very positive response in this House and I ask for an opportunity to debate this matter and to refute the statements that have been made about the health of the Irish beef trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on Northern Ireland.  It is often said that actions speak louder than words and the action of the authorities on both sides over the last 48 hours is to be commended. Such action will, hopefully, help to curb the activities of the paramilitaries. With regard to the point about clarification of the Taoiseach's speech as the Leader of the Government, Ministers and backbenchers speak with diverse tongues these days on the issue of rates.</P>

      <P>With regard to Item 7, the Second Stage of the Adoptive Leave Bill, <Col N="7" /> 1993 was taken last November, six months ago; there are obviously some difficulties.  Would the Leader of the House inform us privately of the reasons for the delay in taking the Committee Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the Tánaiste aware of the feelings of the House that a debate on Northern Ireland should take place urgently.  Over the weekend I listened to Archbishop Eames give leadership in condemning out of hand the atrocities that have been carried out in the name of Protestants; he has given leadership to others who might have a say in this issue.  With regard to legislation, next week we will take the Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 1994 and in the coming weeks we will deal with the Casual Trading Bill, 1994, and the Irish Shipping Limited (Payments to Former Employees) Bill, 1994.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my unqualified support and enthusiasm for the measures being introduced in this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for the effective action she is introducing to deal with the contagion of drug trafficking and addiction.  Communities previously untouched by crime, who lived in peace and harmony, have in recent times suffered the consequence of this contagion in that drug addicts, in the urgent need <Col N="8" /> to feed their addiction, are attacking old and defenceless people in their homes. This has become an unfortunate feature not just of this country in recent times but of every country.  The majority of the unspeakable and mindless violence we witness is drug related.</P>
      <P>We must all be enthusiastic and supportive of actions, such as those proposed by the Minister in this Bill, to target those who engage in drug trafficking and who cream off their profits from the suffering of addicts and the unfortunate victims of crimes of horrific violence perpetrated by mindless, crazed people who are addicted to drugs.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the community at large, particularly those who would normally not even have an awareness of drugs, much less be victims of drug addiction, in other countries, in our communities and in parts of our cities.  The most peaceful parts of Ireland are now suffering the consequences of this addiction and that demands the kind of action proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>For the first time &mdash; and this can be confirmed by an analysis of proposed penalties in legislation &mdash; the concept of the burden of proof is being introduced on a convicted person.  As the Minister said, this Bill does not introduce a burden of proof in relation to the charge of possession or distribution; when a person has been convicted of such an offence the burden of proof passes to that person. This is unique; it is right that we demonstrate that such a person's ill gotten gains do not derive from drug addiction or drug trafficking.  If that person cannot discharge that burden then he or she faces the consequence of a confiscation of assets.  This important part of the Bill is a welcome innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the issue of money laundering, which I have addressed on a previous debate in the House, our financial institutions have been used and abused. They have not perhaps taken the stringent precautions which they should; it does not always require Government or a Minister to insist on action.  These institutions have their standards and obligations and they should, here and <Col N="9" /> elsewhere, without any direction from Government, ensure that they will not be used as distribution outlet or a safe haven for the ill gotten gains of drug barons and drug traffickers.</P>
    <P>However, this has not been successfully done by common cause between the financial institutions.  Indeed, I have indicated on previous occasions that the evidence would sometimes suggest the contrary.  For example, the banking system in Switzerland still asks no questions and uses numbered accounts.  That is a norm which is being followed in many countries now.  I have commented on this scandal many times and will continue to do so until it is eradicated.</P>
    <P>There is nothing about banks which should allow them to operate under secrecy of that kind, with no questions about the origin of the funds.  In many cases it is known that funds came from ill gotten gains &mdash; and from tyrants, but that is another day's work.  For that reason I welcome this provision in the Bill, but I would prefer if the banks here or elsewhere would ensure that the requirements the Minister is introducing will be implemented.  This would enable them to know the identity of each person, the source of their funds and matters of that sort to prevent the laundering of ill-gotten gains through the financial services system.  The practical provisions which are a feature of the Bill will go a long way towards dealing with this problem but I am sure the Minister would not suggest that the Bill goes all the way.</P>
    <P>Some economies are based on a drug culture and on drug trafficking and addiction. There is criminal enterprise today which makes the Mafia days of Al Capone seem almost harmless by comparison. Drug barons control the distribution and supply of drugs to addicts who crave them.  We can see the consequences of this.  For example, there are regions in Europe, notably Galicia in Spain, where the administration has been corrupted and undermined by drug trafficking through Colombia and other countries.</P>
    <P>We have to look at another reality: no matter how much action we take, is it <Col N="10" /> possible to patrol the seas to prevent from landing those who would bring illict drugs into our country which would undermine the basis of society?  Last summer I was walking along the Sky Road, a beautiful part of Connemara, and saw two young men.  I wondered what they were doing there.  I saluted them and they recognised and saluted me.  They were two gardaí on duty, observing the sea line as far as the eye could see.  This is commendable but one would have to say that this task was impossible.  Will we ever have enough gardaí to deal with this problem?  If we succeed in putting these criminals away &mdash; and I want this to happen &mdash; will we have enough space in our prisons to accommodate them?  Can our courts system cope with the growth of this empire of drug related crime?</P>
    <P>I welcome the action being taken in this Bill but is there something new which needs to be considered?  If not we are reacting to those who control this criminal empire, who are happy to see us attempting to tackle this problem.  It was demonstrated in the days of prohibition in America that once distribution through criminal channels is confined, whether it is of alcohol or other addictive drugs, criminals control the empires. They can limit supply to keep up the price.  The more supply is limited the higher the price and the more addicts will not be able to get drugs which they crave. This will result in increased crime.  We must begin to undermine this control.  If not, we will play into the hands of those who want the control of the supply of drugs to be outside the regulation of the only authority which should exercise this control, that is, our elected Government.</P>
    <P>Studies recently undertaken, particularly in America and in Europe, suggest there is another way.  I would be regarded as very conservative on almost all issues and people might be surprised that I would suggest that it is time for governments to look at that other way mentioned in reports and surveys I read recently.  That other way is &mdash; and I know there are precedents for this, even in our city &mdash; for governments to ensure that <Col N="11" /> the supply of drugs, which are illegal at the moment, is regulated and controlled so that it is taken out of the hands of the drug barons.  It has been suggested to me &mdash; and there is evidence of this in many cases &mdash; that they actually support programmes which try to restrict the supply of drugs because they know that as long as it is kept an exclusively criminal activity they will win all the time by maintaining limited supplies and increasing price levels.</P>
    <P>The evidence from Colombia, Spain and elsewhere suggests that the conventional way of battling this problem is not effective.  If we always look at it as just a question of law and order and security &mdash; which I agree it is &mdash; we will just be reacting.  Will we ever have enough gardaí or prison places?  Can we ensure that we will be able to cope by dealing with it on a criminal basis only?</P>
    <P>Prosecution, court proceedings, penalties, imprisonment, all have a very effective function in vindicating the role of the State and protecting the rights of the citizen and I strongly welcome what is proposed in this Bill in that regard. However, I would like us to take a broader view and link into much of the work which has been done, for example, in Holland, Switzerland, Sweden, America, etc.  People there are now saying that if drugs &mdash; and I am not saying that alcohol and tobacco are not drugs &mdash; are causing problems in society, as they are in ours, then it is time that all governments consulted to see if there is a better way of dealing with this as a medical problem.</P>
    <P>The distribution and supply of drugs should be controlled through medically or socially regulated channels as distinct from leaving it to the drug barons to operate very successfully in the criminal world they dominate.  I hope this Bill gives us an opportunity to at least deflect them.  I do not have any experience in this area, direct or otherwise, but I have increasingly observed in recent times a number of reports which suggest that is a very important trend in thinking in relation to drug contagion.</P>
    <Col N="12" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very good and important Bill.  I thought I would never see the day when I would be speaking in Parliament about the problem of drugs in our country.  We always thought it was a major problem in the cities but, unfortunately, every other day one hears of the problems drugs are creating in local communities.  We hear frequently about the use of drugs by young people and, consequently, there is a need for legislation of this nature.</P>
      <P>Although it is a complex matter to legislate that criminals should not be allowed to benefit financially from their activities, much of that work has been done by the Law Reform Commission. However, the delay in introducing this legislation has allowed the drug dealers much leeway in the last couple of years. Drugs have become an enormous problem as we can see from reading the newspapers and seeing the concern of parents.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been published against a background of record seizures of illicit drugs and a resurgence in the level of drug abuse and drug trading, especially in our capital city.  However, in 1993 the phenomenal value of drugs trawled from the seabed at Kinsale in County Cork was estimated at £12 million.  Such a quantity of drugs was not destined solely for the people of Cork so we can be sure that a large criminal ring must be operating.  The most recent report to the Garda Commissioner offers the worrying evidence that, despite the successes of the drugs squad, we are far from winning the battle against the drug barons.  This legislation attempts to address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the indulgent attitude to the use of drugs of those who grew up in the sixties, the evidence since then vividly shows that drug abuse is one of the most serious social problems facing the world. It has destroyed countless lives and has made unimaginable profits for the unscrupulous people who control the trade.  In this country intravenous drug abuse has been the largest contributing factor to the spread of AIDS.  If we can control drug abuse we have a greater <Col N="13" /> chance of controlling the spread of AIDS.</P>
    <P>There should be specific guarantees to protect the interests of the innocent family members who may share in or benefit from property owned by those who will be the subject of action to be taken under this Bill.  It is wrong to assume that a spouse would be aware that a partner may be involved in drug trading.  Children do not choose the family into which they are born and cannot be held responsible for the actions of their parents.  While we must pursue without mercy those who are primarily responsible and while we must not leave legal loopholes which can be exploited, it is important that interested innocent parties be protected.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister must &mdash; and I am sure she will &mdash; pull out all the stops to deal with the problem of drug dealing. People must be protected.  The Minister must increase the number of gardaí and enforce the law.  The operation carried out by the gardaí during the last 48 hours is commendable.  Such actions give people confidence that we have a force which can take decisive action to curb the activity of criminals.  Legislation similar to this has been in operation in Britain since 1986 and has resulted in the forfeiture of substantial amounts of money and assets belonging to drug dealers.  We must address the issue of what should be done with the money.  Under this Bill the money will go to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Extra gardaí are necessary to curb the activities of drug dealers.  I was sad to hear recently that a young boy was kicked out of his local club.  The club in question said that he was obstreperous but it was decided to keep it quiet because it was obvious that he had taken drugs.  It is very bad if a local club, one of the pillars of society, would not report this to the Garda.  The Garda need that kind of support to follow, investigate and ensure that whoever is trafficking in these drugs is prosecuted.</P>
    <P>As with much of the general crime problem, the roots of drug addiction can be found in economic and social problems. Just as it is no coincidence that <Col N="14" /> the problems of crime and vandalism are more frequently found in areas of greatest social deprivation, neither is it an accident that the same areas suffer from the highest level of drug addiction.  Poverty, unemployment and social deprivation are conditions in which drug abuse thrives.  A good job, a decent home and an adequate income are no guarantee that a person will not become addicted to drugs, but there is no doubt that those who feel abandoned by society and who are without jobs, a future and hope are easy prey for drug dealers.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and am confident the Minister will ensure that it will be implemented in full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Drug addiction and the unscrupulous way in which it is dealt with must be one of the most serious problems in society today.  It currently poses a tremendous threat to our young people. Words like &ldquo;drug culture&rdquo; are often used to describe the situation.  Calling it a &ldquo;culture&rdquo; gives it an air of respectability; it is a sub-culture.</P>
      <P>A drug addict will rob, plunder and kill to feed this terrible craving.  However, I want to refer to the suffering they go through.  I have experience of a person who tried to come off drugs.  The torture they have to go through is extraordinary; it is frightening to see it.  Even if a person comes off the drug, the physical, mental and spiritual damage is frightful.  Even taking a small amount of drugs can lead to a person losing their senses of smell and taste for life.  A person on the other side of society who is seriously afflicted by drugs needs money to feed their habit. Initially that will lead them to commit petty crimes and later serious robberies, and killing can result from that.  Because drug trafficking is illegal, there are no controls or limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those making money out of this trade, often through fear, have no concern for the welfare of the recipients of these drugs.  The human misery that can result from this practice is unbelievable.  They have no concern for the welfare of those who take drugs.  It is unbelievable to see <Col N="15" /> the misery suffered by the family, friends and work colleagues of a drug addict.</P>
    <P>As a teacher, I know the dangers young people face.  When we were at school we tried new experiences because it was part of being young.  The cigarette, the glass of beer and now drugs will be tried.  Ruthless people will try to tempt young people to use drugs because it is in their nature to want to experiment.  We must stamp out drug trafficking where people make money from the misery of others.  If the class hero tries something new, everyone else will follow.  If that hero can be manipulated by a pusher who is probably an addict &mdash; pushers will influence students because they are vulnerable &mdash; there will be problems and the performance, concentration and physical well being of students will be affected. Students who are addicted to drugs will steal to finance their habit.</P>
    <P>Many drug hauls have been made recently in the south-west.  I was delighted the gardaí and the Drugs Squad recently arrested individuals and confiscated the drugs coming into this country. Ireland is an island with many sheltered coves and harbours and the coast is being used by these people. However, it is impossible to patrol it. This Bill will discourage such criminals who do not worry about what they bring into the country or the damage they do as long as they make money from it.</P>
    <P>Drug addiction also causes problems in our hospitals.  Health boards, social workers and doctors spend a considerable amount of time and money dealing with the problem of drug addiction and the people who fall into its trap. I compliment the addiction centres which treat people for drug addiction.  Tabor Lodge in my own area is a centre which rehabilitates those affected by drugs. These centres do a great job and they often help people to rise above the misery caused by the unscrupulous people pushing drugs.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious offences. Money laundering is now an offence and <Col N="16" /> international measures have been introduced to cope with the drugs problem.  I compliment the Minister on this Bill and I support the measures she is taking to help those who have fallen into the trap of drug addiction and to bring to justice those who are making money, without any concern for the misery they are causing.</P>

      <P>I join with other speakers in congratulating the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  She is to be complimented on her performance in the Department of Justice, not least in the area of criminal legislation.  This is but one Bill she has brought forward in a relatively short space of time.  The initiative for this and previous Bills and the legislation being prepared is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill has tackled a glaring anomaly in our legislation where the criminal godfathers were able to profit from the proceeds of organised crime.  We have read in the newspapers over the years of famous figures whose obvious wealth was generated from the proceeds of crime &mdash; some of them are now behind bars, more are not. It is not before time for those people to be brought within the law.  There is widespread welcome for the strong measures contained in this Bill which deals with people living off the proceeds of those crimes with impunity.</P>
      <P>The specific provisions in the Bill are more than adequate.  I compliment those who drafted the Bill on its detail, especially in the area of confiscation. Section 5 provides that, at the time of conviction, all income and assets received by the defendant in the previous six years can be taken as being from drug trafficking. Such a provision will make it possible for the courts to take drastic action on proceeds earned in such a manner.  Our experience tells us these people can make a good case in their defence and hire the best lawyers to provide them with protection in the courts. Consequently the provisions in the Bill on confiscation are completely sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> The parts of the Bill on money laundering and the international instruments on drug trafficking deal with areas where there have been glaring omissions in the past.  Undoubtedly this country has been used if not as a base, certainly as a centre through which money has been laundered. It is clear that many Irish criminal godfathers have been involved in money laundering with international criminals. The Bill should make it possible for them to be apprehended.  The international instruments given effect in this Bill will make it possible for EU Council Directives to be implemented and to make it much easier to arrest people in cooperation with police agencies in other countries.</P>
    <P>In her Second Stage speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, under the terms of the Bill, where a person is convicted on indictment of a non-drug trafficking offence, the court will be able to make a confiscation order against the offender up to the amount of the benefit the court is satisfied was obtained as a result of the offence in question.</P>
    <P>Are the proceeds of crimes which are not received from drug trafficking, for example, armed robbery or the obvious gains of god fathers received from other crimes, covered by this Bill?  This is of concern to many people because major criminals are openly committing crimes. The Garda Síochána and others know these criminals who have received publicity in the newspapers, but it is impossible for the gardaí to apprehend them.</P>
    <P>I am not a right-winger, but it is time that whatever hard measures are needed will be implemented so that these people may be brought to justice.  Over the years the gardaí have made intensive efforts to bring some of these well known criminals to justice.  However, they roam free because the gardaí cannot provide the sufficient evidence to bring them to justice. Although this is not related to the Bill, the public demand that we take a tough line with well known criminals and that we implement whatever measures are necessary to apprehend and charge <Col N="18" /> them with the crimes which the gardaí are satisfied they have committed.  If this is done, the provisions in this Bill will be more significant in the future.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday World</i> of 3 April 1994 ran a story which identified major criminals who operate in this city.  The story received a front page headline which has not been denied by anyone.  Crime reporter, Mr. Paul Williams, carried out an investigation and he referred to several crimes masterminded by a particular criminal.  The article, which ran for several pages, detailed several crimes, and one in particular.  If what is in this article is true, the situation has gone beyond a joke.  The article referred to the Lacey kidnapping and it stated:</P>
    <P>As they searched the house where the National Irish Bank executive's family began their terrifying ordeal 18 hours earlier, they found a box of chocolates on a table with a note which simply read: &ldquo;All because the lady loves Milk Tray&rdquo;.  But this innocuous note was not left for the lady of the house by a tall dark and handsome mystery man.  It was a sinister message from a mysterious and dangerous man. It was a calling card from the notorious crime boss.</P>
    <P>Sharp and positive action is needed to apprehend criminals because we have reached a stage where people can commit this type of crime and treat the gardaí with disrespect.  The Garda Síochána has done everything possible and it is time that we, as legislators, gave the Garda additional powers to deal with such people.  The Garda know those who are carrying out these crimes but they do not have sufficient evidence to convict them in court.  The general public want us, as politicians, to introduce more rigorous legislation which will give the gardaí greater power to apprehend those people and put them behind bars.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister today.  She has done very well to date and her reforms have been progressive and significant.  If my colleague the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, must go one step further, I ask her to have the courage to do <Col N="19" /> whatever is necessary to ensure we do not tolerate people who are prepared to play games with our police force and the lives of so many people in this city and throughout the country which are being ruined as a result of the drug trafficking and other crimes.  I do not for one moment blame the Minister or the Garda.  I compliment them on the job they are doing.  It is now time to take the final step which is a radical one but the present situation demands it.  We must put the people we all know are responsible for serious crime behind bars once and for all.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to the Justice spokespersons in the Seanad.  Over the past 12 months they have borne the brunt of the work here which arises from what we have agreed is a major programme of law reform.  I appreciate the fact that they work under difficult circumstances.  The only hope I cannot hold out for them is an ease in their work load in the future. As Senator Neville is aware, we have quite a programme in the Justice area before us in this House and there are already a number of other measures before the other House.  I place on record my thanks to all spokespersons.</P>

      <P>No, indeed. It was inevitable that, during the debate, general operational matters and issues would be raised particularly in relation to tackling the drugs problem which was mentioned on both occasions.  I would like to respond in general terms to some of the points raised.  As Senators agreed, it is no consolation to me or any Member of either House that the drugs situation in Ireland is relatively small by international standards because it is certainly serious and needs careful and continuous attention.</P>
      <P>International experience has shown that it is a notoriously difficult problem to overcome even for countries which have much greater resources to deal with the problem than we have.  However I am determined &mdash; and I accept the acknowledgement of that determination by the Members of this House &mdash; to make significant progress in the fight against drug abuse and the Bill we are discussing is clear evidence of that determination. The Garda authorities share my determination and I am more than satisfied from the frequent discussions I have with them that it is at the top of their agenda.</P>
      <P>With specific reference to Dublin I would mention just two examples of the practical measures undertaken which reflect the priority being given to the problem of drug abuse.  Meetings are now held on a monthly basis and attended by members of the Dublin Drug Squad and other units at which recent seizures and trends are discussed and future operations are initiated and planned.  A detective superintendent has been appointed on a full-time basis to head the Central Drug Squad which is based at Harcourt Square.  These developments have resulted in major surveillance of persons involved in drug activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions have been made from time to time that a new, separate national drugs enforcement agency should be established to deal with the problem of the illegal availability of drugs.  I examined that question in great detail and consulted many people, including members of the United States Drug Administration Enforcement Agency <Col N="21" /> who were here some time ago and I am not convinced that such an operation or organisation would be appropriate to the situation we have here.  Rather than establishing a separate agency, the proper road to take is to ensure that the resources of all the agencies involved can be co-ordinated and used effectively in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy mentioned patrolling the seas and gave an example of something he witnessed in Clifden, Connemara, during his holiday last year.  One of the discussions we have had at European Union Council of Ministers meetings over the last six or eight months is that, while it has taken a considerable amount of time, everyone now believes that the drug situation does not just impinge on one member of the European Union but transcends the borders of individual member states.  All 12 members of the Union must work together to eradicate the problem and work towards a plan to provide resources to member states who have to patrol the seas around their coast.  While the Irish Navy patrols what is commonly known as Irish waters, they are, in effect, also European Union waters and therefore all 12 EU members believe there is an onus on the European Union, and on the Commission in particular, to give strong resource assistance to member states to do this work through the relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>A number of Members in both Houses have expressed concern about what they would see as a lack of the tight and close co-operation there should be between the agencies involved in drug enforcement. We are talking about three agencies: the Garda Síochána, the Naval Service and the customs authorities.  It was in the context of the perception of a lack of close co-operation that people suggested that a drugs enforcement agency would be the answer to the problem.  I have already given my opinion on that suggestion.</P>
    <P>As Members and particularly Justice spokespersons will know, I commissioned a report from an assistant secretary in my Department as to what the situation was on the ground.  He talked <Col N="22" /> to the various people involved and also to those involved in the administration of justice, particularly in the drugs area, who had expressed public concern in the media about, what they called, a lack of inter-agency co-operation.  He has just completed a comprehensive report of the drugs issue, the main task of which is to secure the best possible arrangement for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the relevant enforcement agencies. The report also addresses the level of resources required to tackle the drugs problem.  I am studying the report but I have also made it available to a wide range of Departments and agencies because I would like their input.  When they have completed their consideration shortly, I will have an opportunity to make a strong recommendation to Government and, hopefully, get agreement for the co-operation measures I feel are necessary.</P>
    <P>Senators clearly recognised the importance of international co-operation in combating the availability of drugs, and this was mentioned again today.  This Bill, which allows us to ratify three international conventions related to this area, should significantly enhance our ability to benefit and provide assistance on an international level.  I mentioned already that Ministers for Justice throughout the European Union are giving this area a high level of attention and that process can only be enhanced by the justice related provisions of the Maastricht Treaty.  One development in this area &mdash; and I should have mentioned it earlier when I spoke of the European Union Ministers and what we have done &mdash; is the decision to establish a Europol drugs unit.  This will act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit for drug related information between member states.  It is a very positive and forward looking decision.</P>
    <P>In relation to the detail of the Bill before the House, I am sure it will be accepted given the complexity of the measure.  It would be more appropriate to deal comprehensively on Committee Stage with some very specific points <Col N="23" /> raised on Second Stage.  However, there is nothing in the Bill which will preclude appropriate levels of expertise, for example, in the area of accounting, being made available to the Garda Síochána. As part of my law enforcement package, I announced the appointment of three accountants to the Fraud Squad.  While it is the case that the statutory functions in the Bill are generally conferred on the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda Síochána, arranging for appropriate expertise to be made available to assist them can, in effect, be done administratively.</P>
    <P>The actual powers contained in the Bill in relation to confiscation are quite extensive, including orders for disclosure of information and the issue of search warrants.  To reinforce what Senator Fahey took from my indication to him when he was speaking, of course that reflects on crimes and not just on those related to drugs.  The provision for the issue of restraint orders without advance notice to the party involved is a very powerful weapon in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to bail. This is an issue about which there has been widespread concern, both inside and outside the Oireachtas.  As I have made clear on a number of occasions, I share that concern.  In this context, following a review I initiated in my Department because of my concern about our bail laws at present, and with Government approval, I requested the Attorney General to secure the advice of the Law Reform Commission on the options that may be open in order to bring about a change in our bail laws.  Given that everybody who spoke in this House and in the other House accepts that there are many complex issues involved in changing the laws on bail, the Law Reform Commission is uniquely well placed to provide the type of in-depth analysis and considered proposals for change that are required.  I look forward to the commission's proposals and I assure the House that they will get my urgent attention. There will be no delay in <Col N="24" /> implementing the recommendations of that report.</P>
    <P>Senators also put forward various proposals for the disposal of funds which might be realised under the confiscation provisions of the Bill.  This was discussed in the other House and on Committee Stage there.  While I do not propose to deal with it in any detail in the context of a Second Stage debate, it would be appropriate to indicate my position.  I have sympathy for the idea that the proceeds of confiscation should be applied for drug related and other very specific projects.  When the matter was brought up in the other House, I raised it with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  He has informed me that for a number of reasons he would be opposed to any such proposal.  His reasons for adopting that view are not related to the worthiness of the type of project concerned.  While I am well disposed towards the allocation of confiscated proceeds as the Senators suggested, in the light of the views that have been expressed by the Minister for Finance, I do not think I could accept such a proposal.</P>
    <P>Another point raised during the debate was whether certain provisions in the Bill would withstand a constitutional challenge. I am sure the Members of this House will appreciate that I could not give any guarantee that a piece of legislation would not be held to be unconstitutional by the courts.  In relation to the present Bill, I have been advised by the Attorney General that it is consistent with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I indicated on the first day this Bill was discussed that I would be open to suggestions for improving it.  I will consider further the very specific points that were raised by Senators.  However, a strong message has gone from this House to those people who profit from crime, that we are prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.  We should not be ashamed or shy to say so.</P>
    <P>I look forward to returning for Committee Stage.  I presume it will be a lively and lengthy debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That for the term of the present contract for televising of the proceedings of Seanad Éireann, Seanad Éireann resolves that the proceedings of Seanad Éireann be recorded on sound and televised in-House each day from the commencement to the adjournment of the proceedings and that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  three Members of Seanad Éireann be appointed to the Broadcasting Control Committee established by Dáil Éireann on 8 July 1993;</P>
      <P>(b)  Seanad Éireann authorise, on payment of such fees as may be determined by the Broadcasting Control Committee from time to time, the broadcasting on sound and vision by national, local and foreign broadcasters of the proceedings of the Seanad subject to the following conditions:</P>
      <P>(i)  that recordings or extracts of the proceedings should not be used in programmes of light entertainment, political satire, party political broadcasts or in any form of advertising or publicity, other than in the form of news and current affairs programme trailers;</P>
      <P>(ii)  that broadcasters be permitted on request to carry live coverage of any item of business subject to the following provisos:</P>
      <P>(I)  that such item be broadcast in its entirety and not be interrupted by commentary, analysis or commercial breaks;</P>
      <P>and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(II)  that such item may not be rebroadcast in whole or in part <Col N="26" /> except as permitted in and subject to the terms of this Order;</P>
    <P>(iii)  that broadcasters ensure political balance in the material they use;</P>
    <P>(iv)  that the Rules of Coverage be determined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges;</P>
    <P>(c)  that the necessary monitoring, administrative and financial arrangements for televising and for broadcasts, televised broadcasting and sound broadcasting be discharged by the Broadcasting Control Committee;</P>
    <P>(d)  that copyright of all audio and televised material be vested in the Cathaoirleach on behalf of Seanad Éireann;</P>
    <P>(e)  that the contractor establish and maintain an archive of proceedings in accordance with the Rules of Access laid down by the Broadcasting Control Committee.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in moving this motion and, in doing so, I express the consensus of the House that the operation of television coverage is working well.  For some, the arrival of television cameras in this House was a painful transition to the technological age.  However, the misgivings expressed at the time have largely evaporated in the light of experience. The presence of cameras are generally ignored by most Members making contributions and in the normal cut and thrust of debate.  That is how it should be because we are about serious business in this House.  It is not a television show as some Members of the House might interpret their activities.  There are performers and posers in every profession and Members of this House have no monopoly in this regard.  This opinion is not always shared by the public at large but it is an aspect of political life that comes with the territory.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Broadcasting Control Committee, I participated in the committee's deliberations subsequent to the decision of the Oireachtas to introduce <Col N="27" /> television coverage of its proceedings. Concerns at that time have proven to be largely groundless.  For example, the question of whether those with a natural aptitude for the camera would somehow dominate the proceedings of the House and diminish the contribution of those shrinking violets among us was raised on a number of occasions.  I am sure all sides will agree that debates or the contributions of Members have not been in any way diminished as a result of the presence of television cameras.</P>
    <P>The overriding concern of the committee and of the Members of both Houses at the time of the general debate on whether television cameras should be introduced centred on the maintenance of the dignity of the Houses.  It was interesting that comment seemed to centre on whether in some way the dignity of the Houses of the Oireachtas would be eroded as a result of the physical introduction of television cameras.  I am sure all sides will agree that experience has proved that this concern is without foundation.  It is a tribute to the technical expertise that was available to the Broadcasting Control Committee that although there were some initial difficulties about the location of the cameras, these have been ironed out.  Given that technology is moving so fast in this area, if the debate had taken place ten or 15 years ago, the technology at that time would definitely have intruded on the workings of the House.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who believed that we did not go far enough.  For example, in other parliaments and institutions, such as the European Parliament, although it is a much larger Chamber than either the Seanad or the Dáil, the use of cameras on the floor has proved to be of benefit in conveying the message of the activities of the Parliament to the public at large.  This move was debated at the time and ruled out because it was felt that it would be an intrusion on the dignity of the House.  In the light of experience I am not so sure whether that is necessarily true in relation to this <Col N="28" /> House, where we are confined in terms of space, but it might be of interest in regard to the Dáil.  I raise this aspect of the technical side of television coverage of proceedings because the use of a floor camera was precluded.  Due to the location of the overhead cameras, in some cases when a Member is making a contribution on his or her feet viewers see the top of the Member's head rather than his or her face.  This does not benefit the contributions and may detract from the message the Member is attempting to convey within the House and to the wider television viewing public.  This aspect of coverage might be re-examined in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>I pity those who have difficulty with the upper regions of their anatomy.  I will not go any further than that.  I am sure Members get the message.  I am not suggesting that make-up artists should be brought into the House to improve Member's images.  If image is everything then perhaps there is a question to be addressed about the introduction of make-up artists into the House prior to contributions being made by the Members to whom I have referred in as oblique and diplomatic a way as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the Senator's greater wit in that area.</P>
      <P>I wish to turn to a more serious matter, that is, the actual coverage of the proceedings of this House.  At the time it was introduced, television coverage was rightly hailed as a great innovation.  For the first time our electorate had the opportunity to view the proceedings of the House at first hand as distinct from only hearing them.  As our television coverage came very soon after radio coverage, the changes in the last decade have been quite dramatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult now to imagine that less than a decade ago if one wanted to interpret the essence of what was being said as distinct from the statement of fact, one's only resource was the newspapers. Speeches did not always come across in <Col N="29" /> print in the manner in which they were put forward and the message was lost to some degree as a result.  One has only to think, for example, of the passion that was brought to speeches by some of our parliamentary leaders prior to Independence. When one reads them now in the newspapers or in the Official Report, they somehow lack immediacy.  We must be grateful that television is there as a record for future generations.</P>
    <P>In discussing the coverage that emanates from this House I have to put on record, speaking as a Senator, that the coverage afforded to the activities of this House leaves a lot to be desired.  The editorial decision is taken by RTE, who have the franchise to transmit the proceedings of this House to the Irish nation. They also have the right to sell the proceedings of the House to foreign news agencies.  Ultimately, editorial control rests not within this House but with the television crew, particularly the editorial crew, assigned by RTE Radio and Television.</P>
    <P>In commenting on this aspect of television coverage of the proceedings of the Oireachtas, I will confine my remarks to the Seanad, I compliment Barney Kavanagh, who represents RTE, and the back up team assigned to edit the proceedings of the House &mdash; not an easy thing to do &mdash; for their excellent work. Today there were several contributions, including that of the Minister, the Order of Business and there is more to come.  It is extremely difficult to condense those contributions, package the entire programme and have it ready for transmission, on radio and television, for 10.40 p.m. on radio and a little later on television, and it requires a great deal of editorial expertise.</P>
    <P>I criticise the decision taken long before television cameras came in here that the Seanad was to be an afterthought. If business of an extraordinary nature takes place in the Dáil, it takes precedence over any activities in this House, but on quiet days, on normal days when normal legislation passes through this House, I have found time and again on radio and television, remember what <Col N="30" /> listeners hear on radio is what is subsequently transmitted on television &mdash; I sometimes wonder why this is so, I presume it is a matter of resources convenience &mdash; two or three minutes at the end of the programme are devoted to Seanad business.</P>
    <P>If there has been a row or an argument on the Order of Business, as there sometimes is, that will be the highlight of the Seanad proceedings as far as the Oireachtas package is concerned.  All debate on subsequent legislation passing through this House, very serious and interesting debate, is then ignored.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that in approaching the packaging of Oireachtas proceedings the editorial choice should be based on hard news which seems to be the case.  We are not necessarily a current news programme where one makes editorial choices about priorities.  Of course choices have to be made, but I am not so sure that that should be the only criteria.  I question RTE's editorial policy in this regard, particularly where serious business of this House is relegated either to second place or to oblivion because of what is perceived to be a row, because of a populist view of the Seanad that there is nothing like a good row to get people's interest.</P>
    <P>Finally, I seriously question the timing of the transmissions of &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; and &ldquo;Today in the Seanad&rdquo;.  This is a matter for the Whips to discuss with RTE.  Time and again &mdash; and I am sure every Member of this House will testify to this &mdash; the reaction of the public to coverage of individual Members has been positive.  The public has certainly noticed it.  If one considers that in many cases, with the exception of radio which goes out from 10.40 p.m. to 11 o'clock, the television coverage tends to be post-mid-night with a repeat programme the following day, large of sections of the population are fast asleep when coverage is transmitted.</P>
    <P>There is a need to discuss with RTE when coverage of the Oireachtas should be broadcast.  There should be some improvement.  The timing of coverage is traditionally late at night.  &ldquo;Today in the <Col N="31" /> Dáil&rdquo; always went out late at night because the proceedings finished late. Now we are in the television age.  Television is a very strong medium and we would be better served in this House if there was a more equitable sharing the schedule of the proceedings of this House.  I am sure my colleagues wish to dwell on other aspects of this motion, but they were two aspects I wished to bring before the House.  I am very happy to move this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note the way attitudes have changed in the Houses to the televising and broadcasting of the proceedings of the Oireachtas.  The idea to televise the Dáil and Seanad was put forward by Deputy John Bruton; he pushed this idea for some time against an apathetic if not hostile Dáil.  The reason for this apathy or hostility was that politicians, by their nature, tend to be suspicious of the media and most of us feel that it is difficult to get fair play from the media.  When this proposal was first mooted there was the feeling that television, being such a powerful medium, could be used in a way that was unfair, that editing could distort what was happening or that a short film clip on television or what has now become known as a &ldquo;sound bite&rdquo; would not be able to capture the full essence of what goes on in the Houses.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of suspicion &mdash; which we all felt in the early stages &mdash; about the possibility and presentation not being even handed.  At this stage we all feel that what we say deserves greater coverage than what others say, but there is a feeling that RTE has behaved in an even handed way, and that the integrity of those who edit the pieces for presentation has been above reproach.  There may be the occasional error of judgment or lapse in what might have been broadcast, but, by and large, the integrity and fairness of those involved are not in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke at length about another aspect of televising the Houses &mdash; the fears that it might change the <Col N="32" /> essential nature of the Houses.  It has not; the cameras are unobtrusive.  We barely know they are there and they have not taken from the splendour of this Chamber. Members in the other House are not aware of the cameras either.  In itself that has been a great technological feat.  Once we get up to speak, most of us quickly become unaware of the presence of the cameras; it is almost as if they are not there.  We do not see Members outside with compacts powdering their faces or any other part that is in need of the antiglisten protection.  We do not see the play-acting which people thought television might induce; for example, people wanting to be suspended from the sittings of the House simply for the notoriety this would bring when shown on television.</P>
    <P>Most people behave as they did before the arrival of television.  If they were excessive on occasion before the arrival of television, they are still excessive; and if they were limelight hoggers before television arrived, it has not changed their behaviour.  People adapted quickly to the presence of television and it is now so unobtrusive that most of us behave as if it was not there, which is a good thing. Women Senators have advantages over their male colleagues in that the degree of colour in their clothing and their generally more photogenic nature present them in a more attractive light on television.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact of life and we all appreciate it.  Perhaps we could wear more primary colours or wear clothes that would make us stand out under the cameras.  My colleague, Senator Neville, occasionally sports a particularly colourful jacket which stands out on camera.  The arrival of television here has not changed the style of the House, has not been intrusive and has not made people behave out of character as many thought it might.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney talked about the bad viewing times &mdash; late at night or the morning when people are busy &mdash; and I agree <Col N="33" /> with him.  We should move toward a single channel to broadcast continuously the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is not a new idea.  In 1946 or 1947 in a debate on the then Radio Éireann Estimate, the late James Dillon suggested that there should be a single radio channel which would broadcast all the proceedings of the Dáil during all its sitting hours.</P>
    <P>This was seen as an extension of democracy and of the people's right of access to the Houses so that they could see what was being done in their name. Most people would not want to do that but, nonetheless, there is something for saying that, in so far as parliamentary proceedings can be carried in their entirety, at least the people would then be in a position to judge for themselves rather than have selective excerpts &mdash; done with the best editorial judgment in the world but they are still selective excerpts &mdash; from which to judge.</P>
    <P>I should point out that in 1946 or 1947 when James Dillon made this suggestion, another fine Deputy of the time, the late Paddy Beegan of Fianna Fáil, said that this was arrant nonsense and that all most people wanted from the radio, apart from music and sport, was the price of the cattle in the Dublin cattle market on that day. They were two different views of communications.</P>
    <P>With the increasing availability of television and radio channels we should move towards a situation where a viewer or listener at home can automatically tune in to what is happening in the Houses of Parliament.  That is a logical extension of the access which television and radio provides in a democracy, where people can see, hear and judge for themselves what their representatives are doing in their name.  In Canada, a vast country, the single television channel dedicated to the Federal House of Parliament has a surprisingly high viewership. There is often greater interest in what is happening in Parliament than we might expect.</P>
    <P>We cannot automatically expect that people will take an interest in the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="34" /> or that they should automatically be broadcast unless we, in turn, move part of the way toward meeting the needs of a television age.  Nobody can argue that Parliament is a static institution.  The nature of Parliament is such that it has been growing over the years; every decade has put its mark on the development of Parliament and added to the procedures or practices.  Parliament should not be a static institution.  We live in a television age where we have to compete for the people's attention.  Of its nature, Parliament is institutionalised theatre &mdash; it is meant to be theatre &mdash; where people come together to discuss the important issues of the day and to contribute to the making of the laws which bind all the people.</P>
    <P>Parliament has a product to sell &mdash; if I can put it in market terms &mdash; and we must ensure that what we are offering is of interest to a sufficient number of people. The Standing Orders of this House allow us great flexibility.  There is nothing to stop us, for example, having the House give audience to Members of the European Parliament, so that there could be one or two sessions per month dedicated to European Affairs with MEPs present. That would give the people an opportunity to hear their MEPs say what they are doing and be questioned on it, and television is the ideal medium to carry this message which would be of interest to a great number of people.</P>
    <P>We can also invite distinguished visitors who have an important message to convey and television is a medium which would be ideally suited to a greater use of this facility on which we have voted in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and which has been adopted by the House.  We also have the facility to hold hearings on specific issues; this would provide ideal material for television.</P>
    <P>We should take the view that television in the Houses of Parliament is there to be exploited not in a vulgar or personal sense, but to raise the prestige of the Houses of the Oireachtas and have them seen as a useful institution, rather than being passive in bringing in television and not reacting to it.  We should not remain <Col N="35" /> static but should move on and try to anticipate the needs of television, not in a showy, flashy way, but in a way that is based on substantial work undertaken by us in the House.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of information, paragraph (e) of the motion states:</P>
    <P>that the contractor establish and maintain an archive of proceedings in accordance with the Rules of Access laid down by the Broadcasting Control Committee.</P>
    <P>I am interested to ascertain what progress has been made towards the establishment of this archive because it is only when it is too late that we will realise how valuable an archive would have been.  There has been much valuable material lost over the years and it would be a great shame if this aspect was not taken seriously.  I hope the archive has been established.</P>
    <P>I welcome this motion.  The introduction of television to the Houses of the Oireachtas has been beneficial, but we should not be complacent.  We must fight for greater coverage of this House on RTE as it is not covered sufficiently well. However, if we wish for more coverage, we have a duty to make our proceedings more substantial.  There are many vacuous and boring days in this House for which, thankfully, there is no coverage, because if there were, people would wonder what we were at and would not be pleased with what they see.</P>
    <P>It is for us to make our sittings more substantial and if we are more newsworthy, not in a spectacular, sensational sense, but in a genuine news sense, television and radio will follow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is, in many ways, a continuation of the practice that exists in the House.  Unlike the previous two speakers, I did not experience the introduction of cameras as I am only a recent Member and I did not have experience of the changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, when I first attended the House, I was not aware for quite some time of the location of the cameras.  This <Col N="36" /> indicates how unobtrusive they are and how little they affect Members' contributions. For most of the time most Members are not aware of the cameras. In addition, the cameras do not interfere with the architecture and the embellishments of this fine Chamber.  That is as it should be; if there was any such interference we would all have objections.</P>
    <P>The regulations are such that the presence of cameras do not detract or distract from the contributions made by Members.  For example, if a Member interrupts a speaker, the camera does not focus on him or her so there is no encouragement by television coverage for Members to interrupt a speaker.  In addition, political balance is required by the regulations and this is generally observed as all sides of the House are fairly treated.</P>
    <P>Regarding other physical aspects, such as the portrayal of the tops of Members' heads, Senator Manning suggested that, in this respect, the female Members had an advantage over the male Members. However, the tie worn by Senator Quinn today outshines anything worn by any of the female Members.  This indicates that the male Members can respond if they wish and there are many in the House who have been quite colourful from time to time.  Perhaps this issue is a challenge rather than a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the coverage of the House and the items covered, it is inevitable, given that coverage of political activity is about news, that the newsworthy items and the newsworthy things people say will be highlighted.  However, I wish to plead for more coverage of the Committee Stage of Bills because that is the meat of the work in this House and in the Dáil, in that our primary function is to examine legislation and change it if necessary before passing it into law.  The Committee Stage of a Bill is where this work is undertaken; it facilitates the introduction of amendments and the discussion of Bills section by section in detail.</P>
    <P>Before I became a Member of the Oireachtas I was not aware, as a member <Col N="37" /> of the public, of the amount of detail discussed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In view of this and in the interests of our primary role, which is the making of legislation, there should be more coverage of the Committee Stage of Bills, even if the Second Stage speeches are more newsworthy in that people will use the sound bite on such speeches.</P>
    <P>There is a <i>quid pro quo</i> regarding coverage.  The coverage is available and it is for us to be clear, precise and innovative in what we say.  If our contributions are repetitive, turgid and uninteresting we do not deserve to be covered.  It is, therefore, a challenge to us as public representatives to respond to the television age so that when we speak we have something definite and clear to say.  It is good that this pressure should exist when we speak in the House.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) (i) of the motion ensures that what is covered in the House is not used for purposes other than what is intended.  It suggests that the coverage should not be used for: &ldquo;...light entertainment, political satire, party political broadcasts...&rdquo; and so on.  This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) (iv) states &ldquo;that the Rules of Coverage be determined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges;&rdquo;. I understand this has been inserted because the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is, in effect, a Dáil committee with Members of the Seanad on it.  This ensures the Seanad has the control it should have over what is broadcast from this House and that we are fully protected under the regulations.</P>
    <P>I conclude by reiterating my support for the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion, it is important that we recognise the superb work undertaken by the broadcasting unit since broadcasting commenced in the House some years ago.  I often listen to debates in the House and wonder at the skill of the editor who manages to make some sense, in a number of minutes late at night, of some of the debates which have taken place <Col N="38" /> during the day, because the reality is that they are often boring, Members are inclined to ramble on, and they are not newsworthy.  We must examine this aspect of our activities.</P>
      <P>Advancing into the television age does not merely mean introducing television cameras and technology.  It also requires a change in our system of communicating which is not happening.  Many people feel that the advent of television means simply the introduction of technology to broadcast the proceedings of this House to a wider audience.  However, the reality of television is that the communication skills required are different to those applicable to speaking in this House.  This has not been adequately addressed by us in terms of the way we conduct our business.</P>
      <P>It is wrong if Members feel they do not have to compromise, change or adapt their speaking or communication styles to accommodate television.  The introduction of a new facility requires flexibility from us.  We have a duty, in attempting to communicate with a wider audience, to ensure that what we undertake in this House has, each day, an element of interest, topicality and relevance. There is no point in demanding coverage for something in which nobody is interested.  The idea of pushing the work of the Oireachtas or of legislators or of public institutions down the throats of an unwilling public is not feasible.  We must ensure that what we say is relevant at all time.  This requires a balance.</P>
      <P>As a legislator I consider the Third Stages of Bills to be the most important part of our work.  It is difficult to present this Stage of a Bill to a wider audience. We must deal with this part of Bills in the way we have always done.  In terms of ordering our business and our contributions we should try to achieve a balance between doing the boring trench work of legislation adequately and conveying the work of the House to a wider audience by ensuring that the business of the House each week contains elements of interest, topicality and relevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree somewhat with the point made about the rules of coverage and the <Col N="39" /> fact that it cannot be used in certain ways, such as for political satire.  We should take our job and the business of the House seriously but we should not take ourselves too seriously.  If somebody wants to use the operation of the House for political satire, it might make us sit up and take notice.  I have always had difficulty with this issue.  I accept that the proceedings of the House should not be abused or used in advertising or party political broadcasts but protecting ourselves from political satire is no longer valid.  The editor is not allowed to use reaction shots.  I have noticed that a change has taken place recently, which has not been provided for in writing.  It is good to see that there is a more flexible approach to the editing of debates which allows an element of reaction.</P>
    <P>The rules which do not allow coverage of arguments, disruption and commotion in the House are unreal.  This is not a Sunday school.  There will be arguments here.  People expect public representatives to have rows and differences of opinion.  There is nothing wrong with this; it is healthy.  If the editor and broadcasters were allowed to use disruptions and arguments, pressure would be put on us to ensure that what we say during those moments stands the test of televisual coverage.  This would have an ameliorating rather than an adverse effect on the operation of the House.  Far from bringing the House into disrepute, viewers would realise that it contains real people who have differences of opinion and arguments and lose the cool now and then.</P>
    <P>The availability of extra broadcasting time, particularly on the new Teilifís na Gaeilge channel, would allow wider and more extensive coverage of Parliament. There should be chunks of broadcasting of Parliament at off peak hours so that people could see its operation over a few hours.  This would convey our message in a positive way and better than the edited highlights late at night.</P>
    <P>We should look clearly at aspects of the role of the House and our legislative functions, such as the modification, <Col N="40" /> initiation and review of legislation.  This is within the ambit of the House.  We rarely have the opportunity to consider groups of Bills with a view to having a discussion before legislation is consolidated. This is one of the functions of the House but one we rarely exercise.</P>
    <P>In terms of the relevance and interest of the work of the House, foreign policy is an area which does not create conflict between Government and other Members.  Tonight we are having a debate on East Timor.  Over the years we have had debates on foreign policy issues. This shows a wider audience our concern for the wider world.</P>
    <P>I welcome this motion.  Although none of the Members appointed to the Broadcasting Control Committee comes from the Independent benches, we are happy that our interests have always been adequately represented.  We have always taken the view that the Members representing the interests of the House on the committee also represent our interests and we feel free to raise with them any problems which may arise for us and which we wish to have raised at the committee.  I wish them well in their work and ask them to adopt a looser interpretation of the rules than heretofore and to give more scope to the broadcasters and editors to use reaction shots and cover more of the operations of the House.  I also ask the Members to put the case for longer coverage of the proceedings of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support the motion.  My colleagues have commented on the advantages and disadvantages of the broadcasting of the proceedings of the House.  I could have one of the handicaps but Members could have worse than mine, because mine does not impede my performance.  The public are capable of assessment and I would never under-estimate those who view these broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more serious aspect of the televising of the House is the number of empty seats.  Not every subject is of interest to every Member in the House; this is also true of the other House but this is not <Col N="41" /> always clearly understood by the public. One is often asked why so few Members attend and why there is so little interest in certain debates.  One has to explain that the matter being discussed at any time may be of interest to only a section of Members; other Members watch the proceedings on television monitors in their rooms.  They are aware of the debate and come to contribute at suitable times.  I share the concern which has been expressed by a number of speakers.</P>
    <P>Debates are televised at the wrong time.  This gives an indication of the importance attached to debates.  I question those who decide the time of these programmes.  The public are more interested than the programmers are aware.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said that the Independents are not represented on the committee. Independents get more than their fair share of coverage.  Those who compile the programmes feel they are impartial if they concentrate on an Independent's contribution; Independents may have to be given a greater focus than party Members.  The Independents do a great job.  Some of them are professional in their presentations and know how to use the media.</P>
    <P>People are interested in the proceedings of Parliament.  I have watched parliamentary debates in Britain, and in the US one channel is allocated to the debate in the Houses of Congress.  The Dáil, Seanad and local government are of tremendous interest because what Members do affects them.  At the end of the day, the people on the ground, the taxpayers, are paying for the upkeep and maintenance of Parliament and of television.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult job for the committee to persuade those who select the items for broadcast because it is hard to change a person's mind.  The perception which a broadcaster has of those who watch the programme has to be guided by research. I wonder how much research, if any, has been done on how many people watch the televised Dáil and Seanad debates.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the televising of this and the other House.  It is right that the <Col N="42" /> public should be involved because if I come to the House to represent the people of Donegal it is right that my contribution is judged by those people to whom I must return.  There is a link there and it is of paramount importance that the proceedings of the Seanad and Dáil are televised at a reasonable hour so that people do not have to stay up late at night to watch.</P>
    <P>Those who edit the programme do an excellent and professional job.  It is put together in a very presentable form. However, when proceedings are televised the first or second speaker might be shown.  If Senator Manning makes a contribution from the other side of the House he will be covered and the second speaker might be covered.  This is a mistake on the part of those who edit the programme.  I am not condemning Senator Manning &mdash; he is an excellent Member of the House and it is right that he should get coverage &mdash; but there are other Members who feel they are entitled to fair and equal coverage.  That is an aspect which should be looked at.  All Members have equal rights and should get equal coverage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this motion.  However, in welcoming it I am not sure that I will be praising the people who currently edit the output from this and the other House on our main national channel.  The biggest problem I see in this area is the derisory amount of time given to broadcasting both Houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but in particular &mdash; and there is always a fear in this House that one will upset somebody in the media if one says what one truly feels &mdash; the derisory amount of time given to the coverage of Seanad Éireann.  This is not a fault of the programme makers but of the authorities in RTE who allocate so little broadcasting time and resources to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to bring television cameras and radio into both Houses of the <Col N="43" /> Oireachtas was very welcome.  It was an extension of democracy and an important decision in the life of the nation.  It brought the people in every corner, nook and cranny of Ireland into both Houses. It was fulfilling our constitutional responsibility.  It is not fulfilling the statutory responsibility given to a State agency when a number of seconds are allocated to coverage of one House of the Oireachtas.  There are not many people here who would in truth disagree with me, at least not in private.</P>
    <P>The major problem is that the amount of time given to both the Dáil and Seanad is so truncated that the best which can be got across is a caricature of what has happened.  Moreover, the staff resources in RTE allocated to this area, and specifically to this House, are very small. The staff who cover the Houses do their best within the time available to them. The actual output, in terms of editing and continuity, is excellent, it is superb and nobody could fault it.  The biggest problem is that it is too truncated.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme on RTE Radio 1 is a particular case in point. I realise that the broadcasters and editors who put together that programme are operating under a particular constraint. They must pack a huge amount of output into a very short time.  However, I suggest that we might contrast the way the Houses of the Oireachtas are treated on that programme with the way the Houses of Parliament are treated on BBC Radio 4.  I do not think that any objective examination would suggest that the two coverages compare.  Some fundamental rethinking needs to be done in RTE at very senior level as to how it handles the output from both Houses.  That view is widely shared in both Houses and throughout politics in general.</P>
    <P>I would also like the committee to ensure that the coverage of the House is truly balanced; I do not believe it is.  I am not suggesting that it is unbalanced in a partisan, that is, party political way. However, taking up a few points which were made by other Members, it is clearly not balanced in the sense of being representative <Col N="44" /> of the output of all the Members of this House.  I have no personal complaint as I am sure other speakers who have professional expertise do not.  However, it is grossly unfair when Senators who have laboured long and hard to prepare contributions are edited out because luminaries have displaced them.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that in the editing of the coverage of this House, some effort must be made to measure how ministerial input is represented.  For example, if the Seanad is allocated three or four minutes on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and one and a half minutes are given to the Minister's contribution &mdash; which is understandable &mdash; the rest of the time will be taken up by the contributions of the spokespersons. Again, the problem is that there is not enough time.  It would not be possible or right for the editor to edit out the Minister and it would be grossly wrong to edit out the main spokespersons of the Opposition parties.  However, it is unjust and gives an unbalanced representation of the output of this House if some Members simply do not appear.</P>
    <P>Having made those criticisms, I will make a suggestion which I made elsewhere. I notice that in parliamentary broadcasts in other countries there is a tradition that, in addition to featuring a clip from the Leader of the House or of the Opposition, for example, when the report is concluded reference is made to the other Members who also contributed. I ask the Members of the Broadcasting Control Committee to make this suggestion to RTE.  It is important to record the fact that Members contributed to a debate.  The fact that they contribute to a debate should be recorded.  Film clips of contributions by Members from both sides of the House have often not been included due to the truncated nature of the coverage.  It would be fair and a courtesy to both Houses if the names of other major contributors to the debates were mentioned.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the constraints. I agree with Senator O'Toole that the reaction shots should be shown.  It would also be no harm if the empty seats in the <Col N="45" /> Chamber could occasionally be shown.  I would like to see reaction shots because sometimes during the cut and thrust of political debate the real essence of politics is conveyed.</P>
    <P>Some years ago representatives of RTE appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  The committee was informed that a running order of appearances is kept, although I am not sure if the order is based on Members or on party.  That is probably carried out to fulfil RTE's statutory responsibility to be balanced.  I have no complaint about balance. However, I have a problem about who appears and who never appears.  It might be a good idea for the broadcasting committee to contact RTE and look at that matter.</P>
    <P>It is an undeniable fact that there are star performers in both Houses. They receive disproportionate coverage because, perhaps, they have a colourful turn of phrase or they are not subject to the constraints on other Members or they are simply colourful people.  An objective analysis of the output during the last two years could be undertaken to see how often high profile individuals feature in the coverage of debates.  If a limited amount of time is available it must be decided whether to put out the meat or the side dressings.</P>
    <P>The committee should look at the cable systems.  At present we have plenty of spare time on cable and channels often only broadcast test cards.  Live coverage should be broadcast at those times.  Many of us believe that live coverage might be tedious.  However, Irish people seem to be more political than any other nation. They certainly have more interest in politics than in some of the imported soaps which fill the space between ads, although I could be wrong in saying that. Some thought should be given to more extensive coverage when there is spare capacity on these channels.</P>
    <P>It never ceases to amaze me how often people may mention that they have seen me or some other Member on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  I do not know what the viewing figures are for that programme. <Col N="46" /> Although it is a short programme and is broadcast very late it generates huge reaction.  I urge the people responsible for programme decisions in RTE to look at the amount of time they allocate to coverage of the Oireachtas.  More coverage of both Houses would be a public service. Obviously, being a Member of the Seanad I have a vested interest in extending the amount of coverage of this Chamber and I make no apology for saying so. However, the current rather truncated programme does no justice to the capacity of our broadcasters or to the contributions in this House.  We all wish that it was otherwise.</P>
    <P>The programme content is excellent. It is superbly edited in particular with regard to continuity.  However, we could do with more rather than less of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion and support the view that we should let the electorate see how we conduct our affairs in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Initially, as Senator Manning said, I had reservations about broadcasting the proceedings. I wondered if Members would alter their contributions and performance. Having become accustomed to the cameras and to the fair editing, I am satisfied with the standard of material being broadcast.  As many Senators have said, broadcasting proceedings on radio and television has heightened public awareness of the hard work and dedication of the Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I specifically mention those two media because I welcome the time that has been allocated by local radio to such broadcasts. A Leas-Chathaoirligh, you and I are from the same constituency and we have one local radio station.  We are aware that the work of Senators and members of local authorities is receiving much coverage on local radio and we are very grateful for that.  I offer my appreciation to the managers of local radio stations such as Radio 3, Shannonside Radio, Northern Sound and LM/FM.  They are courteous, co-operative and generous in facilitating our views on the improvement of facilities or <Col N="47" /> the allocation of money to our areas. Local radio offers an opportunity to give the good news about our locality.</P>
    <P>Regulations were made regarding television coverage and editing standards. They have been adhered to professionally and coverage has been within the spirit of the regulations.  A number of Senators have said that there should be looser editing to show reactions and general activity during debate.  If that were permitted the type of broadcasting would be quite different.  There are many current affairs programmes on television which afford the opportunity for such debate.  However, the proceedings of the Oireachtas which are currently broadcast are more meaningful and to the point. On the other hand, if there were freer regulations, opportunists would take advantage.  There would be many irrelevant remarks and interruptions which, like the banner headlines used by newspapers to catch the eye of the reader, do not reflect the true story.  In that regard, Members should be cautious in expressing such views.</P>
    <P>Senators have mentioned that the proceedings of the Houses are broadcast late in the evenings and in the mornings when most people are at work.  That is a genuine grievance.  Perhaps the times could be shared so that the full broadcast does not take place so late in the evening. Senator Roche expressed satisfaction with the coverage given to him.  The coverage given to me has been more than fair with one exception.  I have often found that either Adjournment matters or any issue debated after 6 o'clock does not get relayed.  An earlier edited version could be transmitted while the later broadcast could include all of the Business of the Seanad up until 8.30 p.m. Members put in long hours in researching their contributions but they are not given the coverage they deserve unless they are spokespersons or Ministers.  That is unfair and does not encourage Members to contribute past the second or third speakers of all parties.  We are elected to represent all the people in our constituencies; <Col N="48" /> therefore, fairness must be the operative word.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Committee have now heard the views of the various Members of this House.  RTE has a worthy representative on that committee who will be reading these contributions and another look will be taken.  I am a member of the Committee for Procedure and Privileges.  Maybe the proceedings as they currently stand could be reviewed in the future.  We could also see how we can help the Broadcasting Committee to make coverage of both Houses more attractive and interesting.  The positive response gained from the broadcasting of the Houses of the Oireachtas both on television and radio &mdash; especially on television because advertisers say that it captures 70 per cent of the possible audience &mdash; has had a significant effect on the attitude of constituents in general.</P>
    <P>I have often mentioned how unfair the newspaper media have been to Members of the Oireachtas.  Their headlines often do not correspond with the facts; their aim is sensationalism.  The broadcasting of both Houses on television and radio is a breath of fresh air.  It lets the people know exactly what is happening.  As one paper used to say, it gives the truth of the news.  People see proceedings at first hand without an editor trying to turn the story around to their advantage.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report and look forward to the working of this fine committee.  It has made a great contribution in the past and will do so in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this proposal. Television the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas has added to the understanding and interest of the public in its proceedings and it is only proper that this opportunity should have be taken.  Naturally, there are time restrictions on media coverage and this gives rise to questions as to fairness of coverage.  Since politicians have to be reelected, they are always sensitive to the coverage they do or do not get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fairness of coverage is difficult to deal with.  The Fine Gael Party has 16 <Col N="49" /> Members in this House.  If one tunes into &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; any night, the chances are that only one contribution will be from a Fine Gael speaker, one from the nine Members of the Labour Party and one from the seven Independents. While this may be justified in the interests of political balance, it may not be fair to individual Members.  This aspect will have to be re-examined and dealt with more fairly.  Even a member of a political group with a considerable number of Members should not be debarred from coverage.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche said that in a debate covered on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; for example, the broadcaster should also mention those who contributed as well as those who were featured on the programme. As Senator Manning pointed out, on-going coverage of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be available. While politicians can often get carried away in the heat of battle, such coverage could be useful in schools as a means of educating our young people as to the workings of both Houses and the democratic process.  If one asked a random sample of young people about the workings of both Houses and related aspects, one might be surprised at the answers. While we are still a young democracy of approximately 70 years, we have a long way to go in selling and upholding democracy. Young people should be made to realise that democracy does not fall out of the sky; it has to be built up, respected, enlarged and portrayed as a system which is the fairest devised so far.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, satirical portrayals of the Houses seem to get more coverage. There is nothing wrong with that; one must always see the humorous side. However, the workings of both Houses and the electoral system does not seem to be held as being an important issue.</P>
    <P>Members know how difficult it is for students to vote at election time.  Third level students must travel 100 miles to vote because they are not registered to vote in the town where they are attending college.  Improvements should be made in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> Private Members' time and Adjournment debates are never shown on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  However, this programme is a step in the right direction because it brings the proceedings of both Houses to those who are interested in the debates.  It is interesting to note that people will say they saw a person on television, but they will never say they heard them on television.  Television is a powerful medium, but people are more inclined to look than to listen.  It is important for all Members to get coverage. The Members who will be appointed to the Broadcasting Control Committee will have our full support.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  Senator Quinn has 12 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, conscious of the considerable potential benefits to business, tourism, road safety and the quality of life in Ireland; conscious of the desirability of taking decisions independent of domestic considerations in the United Kingdom; calls on the Government to adopt Central European Time for this country as soon as practicable, and in any case not later than 24 September 1995.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This is not the first occasion this matter has been discussed in the Seanad; I raised it last October.  I will cover some of the ground gone over in the past but I will make new points also.  I have pleasure in proposing this motion and I hope the Government will move forward on this important subject, rather than the stonewalling we have seen in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose that we drop British time <Col N="51" /> and adopt Central European Time; in practical terms this means putting our clocks forward by one hour.  At the end of the summer when other European countries go back to winter time, we would not change our clocks.  We would then be on Central European Time.  At the beginning of the following summer we would put our clocks forward along with the other countries and put them back at the end of the summer.</P>
    <P>I would like to see that happen this year.  However, since airline timetables and similar schedules are fixed well in advance, it might be more practical to do so at the end of summer in 1995.  There is no reason why it could not be done then and that is why the specific date in 1995 is mentioned in the motion.  To remove the deadline and merely ask the Government to think about the issue, as is suggested in the amendment, is to emasculate the motion and to dodge the issue entirely.  We should make this change because it would bring great benefits and not many disadvantages.  The main benefits will be in four areas &mdash; business, tourism, road safety and, most importantly, quality of life.</P>
    <P>In business, the big advantage is that we would be aligning our time with that of the vast majority of mainland members of the European Union.  The countries on Central European Time include all our important continental European trading partners, including Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands.  I am not arguing for the harmonisation of European time, that all the EU must be in the same time zone.  The United States is a single market which happily contains three time zones.  I am arguing that we in Ireland are at a clear disadvantage by being an hour behind the vast majority of EU members.</P>
    <P>We can fix this problem ourselves.  It is not that we are out of step but that we are behind the rest of Europe.  In the other countries people start work before us and our image is damaged because we cannot be reached on the telephone until the morning is half over.  Anyone who does business with Europe knows how <Col N="52" /> much time is wasted trying to catch people on the telephone.  Irish people may not yet be in work; European workers may have gone to lunch; Europeans may be back from lunch but we may have gone for lunch; or they may have left for the evening while it is only mid-afternoon in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another problem for business people is travelling to Europe.  The extra hour makes is difficult to do a day's business in Europe and return the same day; in the case of some cities it is impossible. What should be a one day trip becomes a two day trip, adding to the cost by involving an overnight stay and an extra day away from one's desk.  We are on the edge of Europe and often speak of the associated problems.  In this case we are making the problem worse.  We cannot change our geography but we can change our clocks.  It would significantly improve our competitiveness in the EU market, the main strategic target for increasing exports.</P>
    <P>The business sector would not be the only people to benefit from this change; everyone would gain through tourism. The main problem for that sector is the short season for tourists.  The main aim is to stretch the season on either side of the summer.  Changing our time would help us to achieve that because it would lengthen the season at the two crucial points in spring and autumn.</P>
    <P>In April it is bright at 6 a.m., which is not much use to the holiday visitor.  If that daylight is transferred to the end of the day, there is a real bonus for visitors. People coming for short breaks on activity holidays such as golfing or fishing would have much more time to enjoy themselves.  This would make April attractive for a holiday, whereas it is not at present.  The same applies to an even greater extent in October.  All through the year there would be a tourist advantage in stretching the evenings.</P>
    <P>There would also be an advantage in road safety.  Studies have shown that stretching daylight into the evenings would reduce the number of accidents. This reduction exceeds any increase that might result from darker mornings in the <Col N="53" /> depths of winter.  This means lives saved and injuries avoided.  If we have the means to save even one life in this way we should take it.</P>
    <P>The final area of benefit is the quality of life in Ireland.  Everyone knows what happens when the hour is added in spring, as it was a few weeks ago.  People can work in their gardens after returning from work &mdash; most people would regard that as an advantage, although some would not; children can play together outside after tea; and sports teams can train in the evenings.  The coming of summer time means people can enjoy leisure time every evening of the week. Changing to Central European Time would give us an extra month at each end of the summer in which people would be able to be outside in the evenings.  Longer evenings would be a benefit all through the year, although the benefits would be felt most in spring and autumn.</P>
    <P>There are many other advantages. There will be less crime, less danger on our streets, and more energy savings for every home in the country.  Why have we not made the change up to now?  I raised this matter last October and it was clear from the Minister of State's reply that Government policy is based on one cardinal principle &mdash; whatever Britain does we do also.</P>
    <P>In 1971 the British conducted an experiment of this kind and, like poodles, we followed suit.  The British then made a monumental good.  It drew the wrong conclusions from statistics on road accidents and caved in to the most vocal opponents of this change.  They returned to the old system and, surprisingly, so did the poodles on this side of the water.  We huffed and puffed in order to find a fig leaf of respectability for that decision.  The reason was that the Department of Justice was incapable of imagining Ireland in a different time zone to Britain.  The policy appears to be that when Britain moves, we move and if Britain does not move, we will not do so.</P>
    <P>In Britain opinion is growing that it made a horse's collar of that decision &mdash; a strong lobby is making that charge. Part of the present British Government's <Col N="54" /> legislative programme in the last election was to make that change in its lifetime. It seems that Government does not want to give any hostages to fortune to the Euro sceptics in its party so that idea has been shelved.  Where does that leave us? It means that if we continue with the present policy of &ldquo;follow thy neighbour&rdquo;, we will deny ourselves many benefits because the British Prime Minister has difficulty with the lunatic fringe of his party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an acceptable basis for policy making in an independent state.  I am ashamed that we are behaving in this way.  The public will find such an approach unacceptable and unworthy of a sovereign Government.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why we should keep our time in step with Britain.  Britain is our main trading partner, but we would not be disadvantaged if we were one hour ahead.  I believe it would be an advantage and it is in our hands to do something in this regard.  The difficulty with Europe is that we are one hour behind, rather than out of step.  If we were one hour ahead, it would be a different matter.  The change proposed in this motion would put us one hour ahead of Britain.  I am not the only one to see a commercial advantage in that.</P>
      <P>No doubt someone will ask about the North.  This was not a problem in the 1940s when I was young and Eamon Dé Valera was in power and it should not be a problem for us in the 1990s.  We had double Summer Time south of the Border, while single Summer Time was in operation north of the Border.  There was a time difference between Newry and Dundalk.  If this was not a problem in the 1940s, it is only red herring now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lazy argument that we must follow Britain rightly or wrongly has no rational foundation.  It is time to show that we have grown up and we can take a step out of the nursery even if we do so without holding nanny's hand.  Some 20 years later we are closer to Europe and less <Col N="55" /> dependent on our neighbour.  Over ten years ago we had the courage to break the link with sterling.  Will we now have the courage to take a smaller and less expensive step, but one which will present us with huge benefits?  I hope we will, because the net benefit of making this change is enormous.  <i>Carpe diem,</i> we should grab the opportunity; it is time to take action and accept this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I raised this issue in the past when the Order for summer time came before the House.  The two areas incompatibility with Europe are time and the side of the road on which we drive.  We are losing out in regard to time.  The issue is not the time difference, which does cause problems, but the fact that we are behind rather than ahead.  If we were one hour ahead, it would change matters considerably in terms of marketing and sales abroad.  Less than one-third of our export market is with Britain, while over one-third is with continental Europe.  Often our competitors in the European market operate from the UK and, therefore, it would be useful for business if we were one hour ahead.</P>
      <P>This issue not only concerns manufacturing and business but also general communication throughout the European Union.  Those working in Brussels will be in their offices until ten o'clock before anyone is in an office in Dublin. They will then have one hour from ten to 11 before people go on coffee breaks. This continues throughout the day.  For three hours of the day there is no contact between Ireland and Europe if people are working normal office hours.  During lunch time, and particularly late in the afternoon, it is impossible to make contact because European offices are closed. It is like an obstacle race trying to make and return calls to Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other problems arise when trying to do business in Europe.  The 7.30 a.m. flight from Dublin to Paris does not arrive there until 10.30 a.m. and business may not be done for another 45 minutes.  One must therefore travel the night before. <Col N="56" /> There is a slight advantage in that one may return to one's office by mid afternoon, although it is not a sufficient gain.</P>
    <P>The proposal contained in this motion will make life safer, healthier and brighter. These three words reflect our intention. At one time I had reservations about this because of road safety in regard to children going to school in the morning.  I support the point made by Senator Quinn that the evidence presented ten years ago, when I first raised this issue, was incorrect.  Evidence suggests that problems are not created on dark mornings but on dark evenings. That was the only reticence I had in regard to this proposal.  As a teacher, the Minister will appreciate that in the morning there is an openness and a readiness to learn.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment to the motion is buying time.  However, it will be welcome if the Minister decides to move in this direction.  It is a mistake to try to push this off the agenda for another year.  I have not heard a case made against this change to Central European Time, although some people have said it may be awkward and it could cause problems.</P>
    <P>In relation to what Senator Quinn said about tourism, this not only affects the beginning and the end of the season. Anyone who has holidayed on the Continent, particularly in August, where south of Paris or in Spain it is dark very early, knows that many Continental people go to places with long evenings at that time of the year.  Long evenings increase road safety, reduce crime, because crime and darkness go together, and also create more space and time for outdoor pursuits such as hobbies, sport or general activities.  Although I have not got evidence to prove it, I believe it also saves energy.  People have to get up in the morning, but huge amounts of electricity are used when making dinner in the evening and there are many appliances which tend to be used more after tea than in the early morning.  I concede that I do not have evidence on that point but I have raised the question and hope to <Col N="57" /> have it answered at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that we change the time regime to something that would be safer, healthier and brighter, whether it be due to safer roads, less crime or the possibility of saving energy.  It would also give Irish industry the edge when competing with the UK for business in Europe.  I do not understand why we do not move forward.  There may be some element of this that creates a difficulty but it is one of those proposals which is just lying there because nobody is pushing for a decision on it.  It is not being seriously considered.  In <i>The Economist</i> magazine about six months ago a strong case was made in favour of the UK moving towards Central European Time.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister should grasp the nettle on this one or seize the day, as Senator Quinn said, and move forward.  I also compliment Senator Quinn on correctly defining hames as being a horse's collar.  Its correct definition is rarely used.  The current scenario is unacceptable and the proposal has some attractiveness.  Anything that gets us going earlier in the morning is to be recommended.  I have been saying for years that schools should open earlier in the morning and I believe that the best of work is done in the morning.  Speaking from personal experience, I believe that if the day's work is not finished by 9 a.m. it is not going to be done.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to be a crusading Minister and bring us in a time capsule in line with the rest of Europe. We offer it to the Minister as something on which she can act quickly.</P>

      <P>I was reminded of that this evening.  I was a crusading trade unionist then and I am now a crusading Minister.  I thank Senators Quinn and O'Toole for raising this matter today and giving me an opportunity to debate the matter in the House. I have listened with interest to the points that have been put forward in favour of the motion.</P>
      <P>The arguments for and against the adoption in Ireland of Central European Time have, of course, as Senators O'Toole and Quinn rightly said, been raised in this House on previous occasions, particularly when in 1968 the Standard Time Act was enacted and again in 1971 when that Act was amended. I would like to set out for the information of the House a brief statement of the historical background to this issue in the time available to me &mdash; no pun intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Statutes (Definition of Time) Act, 1880, provided for the recognition in Britain of Greenwich Mean Time and in Ireland of Dublin Mean Time which was 25 minutes behind Greenwich Mean Time.  Then in 1916 the Summer Time Act of that year provided for an advance of one hour on Standard (Dublin Mean) Time, thereby providing for what we term summer time in the period from 27 May to 1 October.  Later in the same year, the Time (Ireland) Act, 1916, abolished <Col N="59" /> Dublin Mean Time as from 1 October 1916, and synchronised Standard Time in Ireland with that in Britain, that is, Greenwich Mean Time.</P>
    <P>The Acts I mentioned were repealed in 1968 when the Standard Time Act, 1968, was enacted.  This was when both Ireland and Britain experimented with what might be colloquially called having summer time all year round.  This Act provided that:</P>
    <P>the time for general purposes in the State (to be known as standard time) shall be one hour in advance of Greenwich Mean Time throughout the year...</P>
    <P>As I said, this step was taken in parallel with a similar move in Britain, where the change was effected by the British Standard Time Act, 1968.  However, in 1971, when Britain decided to revert to having separate periods of summer time and winter time, the public here were consulted by the Department of Justice in the matter and a majority favoured maintaining synchronisation with Britain and enabling legislation was passed to provide for this in the form of the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>I take exception to the terminology used by Senator Quinn when he referred to the Irish as British poodles.  I take exception to that terminology.  We are not talking about the Minister for Justice or the Department of Justice here.  The public were consulted in 1971.  I would not like anybody to feel a sense of shame at being Irish.  I certainly never have and I regret that Senator Quinn has.  I am sorry to raise another point, but I think it is inappropriate for any Member of either House of the Oireachtas to refer to perceived difficulties that a Prime Minister of a sovereign state might have in relation to his or her own party.  The kind of comments that were made in relation to a lunatic fringe are not at all appropriate for these Houses and I want to disassociate myself from them.</P>
    <P>Ireland and Britain had adopted Central European Time for the three years 1968 to 1971 but then abandoned it. <Col N="60" /> Speaking on the Second Stage of the 1971 Bill, the then Minister for Justice, in the Official Report of the Dáil, 7 July 1971; Vol. 255, col. 701 said:</P>
    <P>When the British decision to revert to Greenwich mean time for part of the year had been taken, bodies and organisations that might have an interest in the matter were consulted by my Department as to whether the law should be changed to permit of this country's synchronising with Britain, and the public were invited to express their views also.  The great majority of the bodies and organisations that were consulted, which included the major State-sponsored bodies, were in favour of our preserving parity with Britain. Slightly more than 300 private persons gave their views on the matter in letters to my Department.  There was a fairly even balance as between those in favour of and those against a change to preserve parity with Britain, slightly more than half being in favour.  The Government are satisfied that the weight of representative opinion is in favour of our keeping in line with Britain.</P>
    <P>That was the view in 1971; it remains to be seen if this has changed 23 years later in 1994.</P>
    <P>The debate on the issue of standard time was not effectively dropped at that point.  With Ireland and Britain's entry into the EEC in 1973, an initiative was taken by the European Commission to examine the different practices of member states regulating the commencement and finishing dates for summer time in the member states.  It was recognised that having summer time start and finish on different dates caused considerable difficulties and inconvenience for the business sector and in particular for transport and communications undertakings.</P>
    <P>I want to take issue with Senator O'Toole.  He made a very good case in relation to people who wish to do business in European capitals.  He made the point that if one gets a 7.30 a.m. flight from Dublin airport, by the time one gets <Col N="61" /> to the centre of the European capital in which one is going to do business half the morning is over.  I suggest that there is a very simple solution to that.  The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland can meet with the main airline, Aer Lingus, and point out that they are not happy with the scheduling of services.  I am sure the airline would be happy to reschedule their services and instead of leaving at 7.30 in the morning one could leave at 6 a.m. and get there in plenty of time to do business and get a flight back.  That is the solution to Senator O'Toole's problem.</P>

      <P>The result of discussions between the member states has been a series of Council directives on summer time arrangements dating from 1981.  Statutory Orders, entitled &ldquo;Winter Time Orders&rdquo;, to implement the series of Directives were presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1981, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1992.  The present directive in force is the Sixth Council Directive on Summertime Arrangements, which prescribed dates for the years 1993 and 1994.  Arrangements are already well advanced for a further directive, the seventh.  The proposals under consideration provide that after a one year transition period in 1995, the 12 member states of the European Union will synchronise both the commencing date and finishing date for summer time in the years 1996 and 1997.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the date which now applies in Ireland and Britain for ending summer time, namely the end of October, will be adopted by all the European Union states.  The draft seventh directive also provides that the European Commission will undertake to carry out a thorough study of the effects of the adoption of summer time to appraise how such changes affect areas, such as energy, agriculture, road safety, the tourism industry, etc.  Ireland will fully co-operate with the Commission in any research that may be required in relation to this study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the terms of the motion, I am aware of the strength of Senator <Col N="62" /> Quinn's views on the adoption by Ireland of Central European Time and I read his recent <i>Irish Times</i> newspaper article on the topic.  He has enumerated the undoubted benefits which would accrue for the tourism, communications, commercial and transport sectors, but has he looked at the possible disadvantages? Things are seldom as black and white as the Senators proposing the motion would suggest.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House and the arguments adduced in its favour do not make it clear, for example, that were the clocks to go forward one hour in the move to Central European Time, it would also be necessary to go forward a further hour in summer time in compliance with the terms of the EC directive so as to ensure Ireland is not out of step for the duration of the seven months of the year when Summer Time is in effect throughout the rest of the European Union.  The result would be that, at the height of summer, darkness would not fall until as late as midnight.  Would this be met with unanimous acceptance?</P>
    <P>More importantly, the motion seeks to ignore our time relationship with Britain. The Senators proposing the motion seek to make light of the fact that if we move unilaterally to Central European Time we will have a one hour time difference throughout the year with Britain and, more importantly, with the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.  Mention has been made of the point that for a period, namely during the Second World War, different dates for commencement and ending summer time were in operation in the two countries and their respective times were not in parity.  However, given the war time restrictions which operated then, time differences between Ireland and Britain must have been the least of people's worries.</P>
    <P>We live in the 1990s and we must recognise the reality that 42 per cent of Ireland's imports are from Britain and 31 per cent of our exports go to Britain.  As Senator Quinn acknowledged, Britain is thus by far our largest trading partner. No unnecessary barriers or obstructions should be put in the way of such trade. <Col N="63" /> Arising from our having a land border with Northern Ireland, the effects of a unilateral switch by this country to Central European Time would have the unwelcome effect of emphasising the existence of a border.  It would lay stress on difference and could hinder rather than help the cross-Border trade and co-operation we would all like to see developed.  Many people would welcome this anomaly, not least drinkers in the Border counties, but, seriously, I would have grave doubts of allowing such a situation to arise.</P>
    <P>There would be other anomalies.  On a lighter note, for instance, there would be the effect on closing times of pubs under the liquor licensing laws.  If Ireland were to adopt Central European Time unilaterally, it would be possible for the clientele of a pub to finish drinking in Dundalk at the pub closing time of 11 p.m. and then travel to Newry to enjoy a further hour or so drinking time as Northern Ireland time would then be only 10 p.m. I am sure the House can visualise numerous anomalies and similar complications which would eventually arise.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to Senator Quinn and Senator O'Toole that I have an open mind on this issue.  At a personal level, I admit that I find the proposal attractive and can see many benefits accruing from it.  As far as Senator Quinn is concerned, if the Government was to accept his motion, the late opening hours of his stores would indeed be late as it would be effectively 10 p.m. before his doors were closed.  Bearing in mind &mdash; and I say this tongue in cheek &mdash; his hands on approach to running his business, I suggest it would leave him very little time to engage in his pastime of horse riding. As he raised the issue of horses, perhaps I can take my tongue out of my cheek.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister, while I may be charged with responsibility for the legislation governing the regulation of time in this country, I do not have the luxury enjoyed by the Senators of depending solely on my own inclinations as to how I exercise that responsibility.  I do not <Col N="64" /> mean that in any condescending way.  The change the Senators are advocating is one which will affect all areas of society, both in economic and social terms.  It is, therefore, a matter which requires wide consultation and a consensus for change. This is particularly so if, as the Senators proposing the motion suggest, it is contemplated that we make the change to Central European Time even if our nearest neighbour and biggest trading partner, Britain, does not.  I can see the advantages which may derive from such a change but I can also see disadvantages.</P>
    <P>What the balance of advantage may be is a matter to be decided following extensive consultation with industry; farmers, educationalists, trade unions and other representative bodies in the wider community.  I do not know if Senator O'Toole is an early riser but I am.  As a former teacher I strongly support one of his points which was that if school started earlier in the morning, it would much more beneficial.  It is a proven fact educationally that students learn far more in the early part of the day than they do in the afternoon.  I am sure Senator O'Toole in saying that is not just stating a personal opinion but that he is speaking as the General Secretary of the INTO and is indicating that his union members would be willing to go down that road.  It would not just mean an earlier start for teachers in the morning but longer teaching hours every day and much shorter holidays in exchange for long weekends from time to time during the year.  I am glad Senator O'Toole went that far down the road in preparing us for this change when it comes.</P>
    <P>The fact that my Department raised these issues in response to Senator Quinn's proposal is not mealy mouthed as the Senator stated in another forum. It is no more than a recognition of the fact that a proposal for radical change of this nature must be considered in a careful and democratic way.  However, the proposers of the motion will be glad to hear that I have already given consideration, in the light of the general desire at European level for harmonisation, to the initiation of such a <Col N="65" /> consultative process so that views on this issue can be obtained from all sectors of the community.  It is also my intention to raise the matter at European level with my British counterpart to see whether a unified approach could be taken in this matter as this would obviate many of the disadvantages that would otherwise accompany such a change.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of the proposers in putting down this motion was to have the change to Central European Time actively considered, I think they will be satisfied to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Fitzgerald.  I would not support the motion in its original form as, in essence, it begs the question, and it is a big question.  It also seeks to impose an unrealistic time-frame on deliberations.</P>
    <P>In response to a point raised by Senator O'Toole &mdash; he was worried that the amendment might mean I was putting a decision on the long finger &mdash; I hope he will be satisfied with what I have said. It is not a long fingering exercise.  The process of consultation has started.  At any time in the past when proposals were made and I asked for or initiated a consultation process, there has not been a delay when we received the result of that consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the Minister's reply.  I agree with her that the Senator's comment regarding Prime Minister Major was unfair.  It did an injustice to his motion.  We can do without that type of comment and it is irrelevant to the point he eloquently expressed.  However, I am happy that the idea of changing to Central European Time is being actively considered by the EU.  As a nation we can no longer do anything without discussion at European level and that being so, within three years, there will be a change in this area. I welcome that.  We should not be alone when there is no need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision made in 1971 was insufficiently considered.  I am delighted that at least our education structure readily admits that our schools should open earlier each morning.  At present, travelling <Col N="66" /> to school on dark mornings poses a big danger for children and I worry about that.  However, I am pleased to learn the new statistics regarding accidents involving children travelling to school in the morning.  Schools starting at the same time as businesses will not do much for trading.  This should be examined.  Every consideration should be given to the point made by Senator O'Toole with regard to the education structure.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Quinn's points, we should take advantage of the time zone.  We are the most westerly European country.  The impression given by Europeans generally is that we have longer days, in other words, we have long evenings while on the mainland night falls quickly.  In the Canaries or in Spain at 8 p.m. on a summer night it is dark.  Every summer's day they have 12 hours of daylight; we do not.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to learn that during the war there was a time difference between Northern and Southern Ireland.  We should avail of every opportunity people in other countries do not have.  We could have more daylight if we changed to European time, and I am sure people would want that.  Last winter was the darkest and dullest in the experience of many people.  The clouds were very low.</P>
    <P>More hours of daylight would provide many advantages of which our young people would avail and they would also be beneficial from an environmental point of view.  During the oil crisis in the early 1970s we took the opportunity to introduce the change the time for one winter.</P>
    <P>Everything possible should be done to give us more daylight time.  I agree with the motion; Senator Quinn should agree to the amendment.  Discussion on this matter will continue at EU level over the next one or two years.  Whether we like it or not, they tell us what to do.  They tell us how much money they are giving us long before we think we are going to get it, and then they come back and say we are only getting half that amount.  Let us be realistic.  We should very seriously put forward the argument at EU ministerial level whether to adopt this one <Col N="67" /> hour time change.  This is very important. I do not want to be political about this, and I do not want anybody else to be political, but we should avail of every possible advantage, such as having more daylight in comparison to the mainland of Europe.</P>
    <P>I agree there are problems from a business point of view, for example, catching earlier flights to get to European capitals. If a passenger travelling to Berlin or Hamburg must stopover in London first, it may be noon before he or she arrives at their destination.  We could start with earlier flights.  In case the Minister does not know, early flights have already started in Cork.  Everything starts in Cork, of course.  The first flight out of Cork leaves at 6.30 a.m.; the first flight out of Dublin is 7.30 a.m. so I have to get up early in the morning if I want to get to another European capital.</P>
    <P>Because of the cutbacks in Aer Lingus, flights have to start earlier if travellers are to make connecting flights.  If you can get your business done and go home in the one day big savings can be made. That is very important but while Aer Lingus is trying to get everybody into the capital to make connecting flights, other companies have direct flights.  We could be losing business because we want to bring everybody into the capital.  That situation should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Generally I am happy with the amendment, I would be happy if I thought something would be done within the next two to three years but we should always take every advantage including the fact that we have a stretch in the evenings which other countries do not enjoy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is very timely; I know that is a pun.  I listened very carefully to the Minister.  This is a very important issue and she understands the position very well and is aware of the benefits we will get from Central European Time.  We must be aware of what it really means to us if we have a unified time, but we must move cautiously on this.  There are many views on this and <Col N="68" /> many people are discussing this at all levels.</P>
      <P>I have just come back from a trip abroad and had to adjust my watch so many times that I began to get confused about where I was in relation to timetables and appointments.  This change would make it easier for all of us who are trying to do a day's work.  There are many positive aspects to this.  It would be beneficial in terms of visitors and outdoor activities could be pursued through the summer months.  We would have daylight until 11.30 p.m.  This is an advantage we should maximise.</P>
      <P>We should look at how best to use the daylight hours.  We thrive in daylight; we are brighter during the summer; even our clothes sense changes.  During the winter we wear dark clothes, we seem to hibernate, by 9 p.m. we are comfortably watching the television when, as a race, we like to be out and about.  We are a social race and longer hours of daylight would do us good.  From April until October we are all much brighter and full of laughter. I feel it myself, and I am not exceptional in this regard; it is part of our nature.</P>
      <P>The timing of a long day is important. We should finish work in daylight, go home and pursue a leisure activity.  That is helpful in developing our whole personality, whereas if we hibernate it tends to stultify our personality.  It is important to bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>On a more serious note, it would be of great benefit to our commercial, agricultural and transport sectors.  Knowing that time is centralised would impact on all aspects of employment.  We should not slavishly follow the United Kingdom concept of time.  I acknowledge the way the history of the difference in time emerged in this country but, nevertheless, we should be proactive and acknowledge that we are fully paid up members of the European Union.  We should be looking at a more continental rather than a more localised approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has an open mind on this issue.  We should take a consultative approach for the moment and not get too tied up in making a commitment unless we have explored all aspects of it.  I am a <Col N="69" /> little concerned with the early start in the morning.  I would have great difficulty with that as I am a late night person.  I would move cautiously on this, knowing that it would affect me and that perhaps I would be out of a job in no time.</P>
    <P>It would mean getting up early and our school children would have to travel to school in the dark.  Consultation should take place with parents, teachers and the community at large on how best to overcome that problem.  It is not insurmountable but we have to think of that aspect of it.  As a teacher I think it is something we will have to look at.</P>
    <P>We have had an excellent debate on this motion, a real dinner time discussion. I hope that in future we will be able to discuss such debates in the open air and not indoors.  I would support the amendment in that we are looking for consensus on this issue and the Minister has made a commitment on that point.  We should move slowly, cautiously and with consultation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion and the Minister's response, particularly, her comment that she has an open mind on the issue.  On balance I am in favour of the motion and there is considerable merit in it.  For a variety of reasons some people will applaud the idea that we should act independently of the UK whenever possible.  That is not and cannot be the compelling reason why we should align ourselves with Central European Time.  I am nonetheless intrigued reading the amendment and comparing it to the motion because the amendment accepts all that is in the motion with the exception of one point.  The words which would appear to have caused fright on the other side of the House are: &ldquo;conscious of the desirability of taking decisions independent of domestic considerations in the United Kingdom&rdquo;.  That seems to be the only significant difference between the motion and the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons we should align ourselves with Central European Time are expressed where the motion refers to the benefits which would accrue to &ldquo;business, tourism, road safety and the quality of <Col N="70" /> life in Ireland&rdquo;.  The beneficial effects have been enumerated and I want to add a few points which may not yet have been made.  While I recognise the importance of our trade and commerce with the UK, our business with the European Union and with the countries that aspire to membership of the EU is rapidly expanding. There is no doubt that it will be the growth market of the future and, therefore, any steps we can take to ease any difficulties should be taken.</P>
    <P>The time difference is of no value or benefit to Irish business in its dealings with the EU; it is an unnecessary disadvantage in many ways and some of these have been dealt with.  I am always concerned that if we are behind Europe there is always the possibility that European business people may subconsciously assume that because we are behind in time we are in some way a backward island or an insignificant appendage of the UK.  It is no more than a subconscious assumption, if it exists.  I am not in a position to say that it does exist but the circumstances permit that type of assumption to arise and it is not to Ireland's advantage.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made a valid point when he said that the time difference is responsible for the loss of three office hours per day &mdash; in the morning, at lunch time and in the evening.  The Minister referred to consultations and decisions taken in 1971, but 23 years later times and conditions have changed.  Although the decisions taken were valid and acceptable in 1971, time alone justifies a re-examination of the arguments which then existed in favour of aligning ourselves with the UK and I am glad to see that examination is in progress.</P>
    <P>This argument can apply with great force in relation to tourism.  The preliminary figures for last year indicate that about one million visitors came from the European countries.  It does nothing for the progressive image of the tourism industry here that the first thing a European tourist arriving here has to do is put their watch or clock back by one hour. As we all know, first impressions can often dominate a person's perception <Col N="71" /> during the remainder of their holiday. We should ensure that people coming to this country to holiday should start with a positive and not a negative perception.</P>
    <P>In tourism circles considerable emphasis is being put on expanding the shoulders of the holiday season, that is, developing spring and autumn holidays. The previous speaker mentioned the value of activity holidays.  My family has for some years been involved in a tourism project in the field of activity holidays.  It is a season that can and has run from February to December.  However, in recent years it has finished on 1 November because once the clocks go back and lunch has finished, and depending on the weather, there is at most two hours of daylight in the afternoon.  If tourism is to be successfully developed in early spring and in autumn it is important that we go with the intent of this motion.</P>
    <P>The best potential for the expansion of off-season tourism is among European tourists.  North Europeans who come here have no problem with our weather; they expect it to be as it is and they come prepared for it.  However, they certainly have problems and are not slow to express them with the short winter afternoons. The strongest argument for the motion relates to tourism.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat already well made arguments about the motion.  I support and endorse the arguments made regarding road safety; they are good arguments.  As far as the quality of life is concerned, it is a matter of personal perception, of individual expectation and desire and views will vary on the matter. The longer daylight hours, particularly in the evenings, would improve my quality of life.  For these reasons I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The salesmanship of Senator Quinn, the negotiating powers of Senator O'Toole and some of what has been said by Senator Ormonde and Senator Howard have almost persuaded me that we could have summer, as opposed to summer time, all year round. There is almost a feeling here that we can <Col N="72" /> have longer hours of brightness if we change the time on our watches. However, that is not true.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier today to Senator Quinn's tie in relation to the televising of debates.  Senator Manning talked about the women Senators having an advantage in wearing brighter colours and I referred to the mens' ties.  I would refer to Senator Quinn's colourful tie as his summer time tie because he is dressed in accordance with the motion.</P>
      <P>We cannot change our latitude and we cannot stop the earth spinning on its axis, so we cannot gain more brightness by changing and the impression has been given that we can do so.  We will lose it at one end of the day if we gain it at the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn and Senator O'Toole are right to have raised this issue.  Their intention is to stimulate debate and they have succeeded in doing so.  The Minister's response has been positive and the view of the House is that there should be consideration of the issue.  In her address the Minister advised that there would be a need for wide consultation and a consensus for change as a practical response to the issue and I support the amendment to the motion on that basis.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole indicated that we would use less energy in cooking if this was undertaken in brightness rather than darkness. However, we use the same amount of energy in turning on the cooker, irrespective of whether the light is on at the same time or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are strong arguments in favour of giving serious consideration to the motion, but we should try to work in coordination and in co-operation with our nearest neighbours rather than having a oneupmanship attitude to the issue, which was evident to some extent in a number of contributions to this debate. In conjunction with the UK, I would prefer to see us attempting to move <Col N="73" /> towards Central European Time as this would bring most of the advantages without the considerable disadvantage which would arise from acting unilaterally on this matter.</P>
    <P>The UK is our biggest trading partner and our biggest tourism market.  Recent statistics for tourism for 1993 indicate that over one million tourists visited Ireland from the UK, just under one million visited from the rest of Europe and fewer than that from the USA and North America.  We cannot ignore the fact that the UK is our biggest market in terms of trade and tourism and in view of this it would be preferable if we worked in co-operation with the UK on this issue.</P>
    <P>The north-south factor cannot be ignored also.  Yesterday I attended the relaunch of the midwest region of Co-Operation North.  If there is to be real co-operation with the North of Ireland, changing our time and making if different from that in the North would not be productive or useful.</P>
    <P>The idea behind the motion is good, but it would be preferable if we moved with Britain and Northern Ireland on this issue.  In view of this I support the amendment to the motion rather than the motion, as we require consultation not only within this country but also with our nearest neighbour and our biggest tourism and trading market.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with the implications of the motion regarding children attending school in the morning.  There is a short number of hours of brightness in winter regardless of what steps are taken.  At present children attend school with light and return home with light.  If the change to Central European Time is implemented there would be one end of the day where they would not have light and, with regard to safety, this must be a primary consideration.</P>
    <P>It was indicated in the debate that figures suggest that our road safety would be improved by this proposal.  I am not aware of those figures and would appreciate if they were provided to me as I am open to persuasion on the matter. However, our primary concern must be with children attending school in the <Col N="74" /> morning and this is my major reservation on the issue.</P>
    <P>I conclude by reiterating that we should move in conjunction with the UK on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody once told me that there is no such thing as a bad short speech and my speech on this issue will be short.  I have read the Minister's statement of the background and that of the proposers of the motion &mdash; some of whose views I agree with &mdash; speaking solely from a commercial perspective. But I would speak for another section of the community.  We lesser mortals, coming from a place called rural Ireland, are aware of what may described as new time and old time, and when old time is introduced we know and understand it.</P>
      <P>There has been a problem in recent years with school transport where there has been a curtailment of the routes with the result that children have to travel to school buses.  In view of this, if the motion were to be adopted it would result in small children having to be on the road at 6.30 in the morning, making their way to school buses, which is not acceptable. It would mean that it would be dark until 9 o'clock in the morning and the children would return home in the evening in darkness.</P>
      <P>Whatever the merits or demerits of the motion, I cannot support it for those reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending the House to participate in the debate.  The contributions were interesting and I was impressed by the level of debate and the interest shown in it.  At first I was concerned that there might be a belief that this issue is rather frivolous. I must emphasise that for me, and clearly for my colleagues in the House, it has not been regarded in a frivolous way.</P>
      <P>I was in Israel some seven or eight years ago when the debate took place to adopt a summer time.  It was a difficult debate, given the religious background. However, Israel decided to join summer time for the reason that it made good commercial advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> The motion I proposed in the House today was influenced by the fact that it made good commercial sense for us to take an advantage over our competitors in adopting Central European Time. However, I am not accepting many of the points made in the House on this debate. Senator Sherlock referred to the fact that I spoke solely from a commercial viewpoint. If Senator Sherlock has a chance to read my speech proposing the motion he will discover that the commercial factor was only one of the reasons for proposing the motion.  There are considerable advantages to the motion, not solely commercial in nature.  These advantages were touched upon by Senator O'Toole when he spoke of a safer, healthier, brighter and, I suggest, wealthier Ireland if we proceeded in this direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde appeared to assume that I spoke of unified time and endeavours to get Europe unified.  I did not speak of unified time.  Each country and each sovereign nation should make its own decisions on this.  This is an opportunity for us to move and for us to take an advantage.  It should not be a decision obliging us to consider the rest of Europe. It is not up to Europe; it is up to us and as a sovereign nation we should make this decision.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan referred to the fact that we cannot create more daylight.  We do not as a nation get up at 5 o'clock in the morning, nor do we tend to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning.  Therefore we can create more daylight that we use by changing the time.  This answers some of the criticisms made previously and it illustrates that there are some matters in our hands.  I accept that if we move in this direction, we will make some changes.  It might be suggested that schools could have different opening times for the months of November, December and January if there are difficulties arising. However, these are matters in our hands and it underlines my point when I speak of a sovereign nation having the ability to take action on its own.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> The Minister criticised two terms I used when proposing the motion.  One of these terms was in my referral to the &ldquo;lunatic fringe&rdquo; of the British Government party.  If I have broken a code in the use this term then I will withdraw it, but in using the term I refer to those who are so strongly pro-British that they believe Britain should have nothing to do with Europe.  It is madness to suggest that Britain should not join Central European Time because somehow or other it associates Britain more closely with mainland Europe.  It is not a sensible approach and I do not regard my words as being out of place on this matter.  However, I would be upset if it was believed that I was using words considered to be unparliamentary.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other term I used, I have no apologies.  The Minister was also upset, and she appeared to suggest that I was ashamed to be Irish because I suggested that we acted like poodles.  When we believe we can act only when our next door neighbour says so, we behave like poodles.  We should not be so influenced by our neighbour that we say we will never do such a thing.  If it gives us an advantage in tourism, about which Senator Howard spoke, safety, health and business, we should grab that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I was pleased with what I thought I heard the Minister say.  I have since looked at her speech.  She said that &ldquo;I have already been giving consideration, in the light of the general desire at European level for harmonisation, to the initiation of such a consultation process&rdquo;. I thought she said she had taken the first steps.  I became a little worried when I read this.  On 28 October the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, told the House that &ldquo;I will certainly give this suggestion some consideration&rdquo;.  I am worried when I hear words like &ldquo;giving this consideration&rdquo;. I proposed October 1995 in this motion.  The crucial difference &mdash; I know Senator Howard referred to the difference as being something else &mdash; between the motion and the Government's amendment is that the latter does not mention October 1995.  I am concerned that &ldquo;giving consideration&rdquo; is not <Col N="77" /> as strong as what I thought I heard the Minister say.</P>
    <P>I was also concerned that the Minister said that &ldquo;It is also my intention to raise the matter at European level with my British counterpart to see whether a unified approach could be taken in this matter&rdquo;.  I am worried that there is a danger we are being fobbed off by these words and the issue is being put on a longer and longer finger.  I am fully convinced, and have not heard arguments to the contrary, that this is a matter we as a sovereign nation should take into our hands and act in our own best interests, even if our next door neighbour does not come with us.  I am also pleased at the level of the debate today and it may be the start of a debate which will continue in the near future.  I listened carefully to the Minister and will support the amendment. I do so almost reluctantly because of the words used, which I do not believe are strong enough.  If this is just a question of giving the issue consideration, the House should in the near future push urgently for more action and should be unhappy to allow the matter to rest.  We should keep it on the agenda and urge the nation to take it into its own hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to address the Seanad on the question of East Timor.  I know there is great concern in Ireland at the situation in East Timor and at the gross abuses of human rights which have been reported from the territory.  The Dili massacre, the disappearances, the torture and ill-treatment of political detainees, the extra-judicial executions <Col N="78" /> by Indonesian forces engaged in counterinsurgency operations have been documented by such respected organisations as Amnesty International and Asia Watch.</P>
      <P>The concern in this country reflects, I believe, a very deeply held feeling of Irish people for the victims of human rights abuses and injustice wherever they occur. A decade ago, Irish people were justifiably enraged at the appalling human rights abuses perpetrated on the people of Cambodia.  In recent years, Irish people have clearly shown this same concern in the case of the terrible misfortunes which befell the people of Somalia.  More recently, the human rights abuses and the humanitarian needs in former Yugoslavia, the Sudan and Angola have struck deep chords in Irish people.  The same chord of concern touched people here when they learned about the human rights situation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to inform Members of the Seanad of the considerable efforts the Government has made in recent years to bring our concerns at the situation in East Timor to the attention of the Indonesian authorities and to those international for a with influence.</P>
      <P>I do not need to rehearse in detail the history of East Timor for the Members of the Seanad, most of whom will already be well informed on the recent history of the territory since its invasion by Indonesia in December 1975 and its annexation as the 27th province of Indonesia in July 1976.  These illegal acts were condemned by UN Security Council and General Assembly resolutions in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Indonesia was called to withdraw from the territory by the UN which continues to regard Portugal as the administering power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since their occupation of the territory there have been consistent and well documented reports of persistent and gross human rights abuses by the Indonesian armed forces there.  It has been estimated that some 200,000 East Timorese &mdash; out of an original population of 650,000 &mdash;<Col N="79" /> have died from starvation, hostilities and disease stemming from the conflict.</P>
    <P>The plight of the people of East Timor returned to the world headlines in November 1991 when Indonesian security forces opened fire on a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in the capital, Dili. Reports from sources in East Timor put the number killed in this shooting at between 200 and 300 people.  A further 200 people who disappeared after the massacre have not yet been accounted for.</P>
    <P>It was this incident more than any other which shocked public opinion throughout the world and particularly here in Ireland.  The Government has consistently condemned human rights abuses in East Timor and we have used all avenues open to us to bring this concern to the attention of the Indonesian authorities and to seek action at international level.</P>
    <P>Bilaterally, we have conveyed our concerns directly to the Government of Indonesia.  I myself wrote to the Foreign Minister of Indonesia last year.  My Department has taken up the matter with representatives of the Indonesian embassy.  Officials from my Department have also frequently met with individuals and representatives of groups here in Ireland and abroad concerned with the human rights situation in East Timor. We have also joined with our European Union partners in condemning human rights violations in East Timor.  I maintain close contact on this matter with my colleague, the Foreign Minister of Portugal.</P>
    <P>The question of East Timor is the subject of ongoing talks between the Foreign Ministers of Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UN Secretary General who was given a mediating role by the General Assembly in 1982.  The last round of talks between the two Foreign Ministers took place in New York last September.  On that occasion they considered possible confidence building measures as a means of fostering an atmosphere propitious to addressing the substance of the question of East Timor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> After that meeting, the Secretary General reported to the Security Council that he was moderately encouraged by the substance and tone of the discussion.  The two Foreign Ministers are due to meet again in Geneva in May.  I very much hope that the positive tone of their talks last September will continue at their next meeting.  In addition to sponsoring these talks, the Secretary General has committed himself to monitoring the human rights situation in East Timor and a UN special representative visited Portugal and Indonesia in January of this year in preparation for the next round of talks.</P>
    <P>We believe that this mediating process under the auspices of the Secretary General is the best means available to resolve the substantive question of East Timor. Together with our European Union partners we have regularly expressed our support for the Secretary General's unstinting efforts.  With goodwill on both sides we would hope that this process will lead to a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor.</P>
    <P>Since the Dili massacre in 1991 the human rights situation in East Timor has been on the agenda of the annual session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.  Although Ireland is not at present a member of the commission we attend the annual sessions as observers and our delegation is active in the work of the commission as well as within the European Union.  At this year's session Ireland played an active part in ensuring that the statement made by the European Union to the commission reflected our national concerns.  The statement noted that since last year's session of the commission the Indonesian Government had undertaken a number of steps particularly by inviting the representative of the UN Secretary-General and by extending an invitation to the commission's special rapporteur on summary and arbitrary executions.  The statement also calls on the Indonesian authorities to comply fully with the decisions of the UN Commission; it calls for better access to East Timor for human rights bodies and the international media; it urges that <Col N="81" /> those members of the security forces responsible for the Dili massacre be prosecuted, tried and punished; and it calls on the Indonesian Government to account for all those still missing.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of this year's session an agreed chairman's statement on the human rights situation in East Timor was issued.  This noted with concern the continuing allegations of human rights abuses in East Timor while recognising the positive measures taken by the Indonesian Government to improve the situation.  A matter of preoccupation to the commission was the incomplete information concerning the number of people killed and persons still unaccounted for as a result of the Dili massacre on 12 November 1991.  The commission called on Indonesia to continue its investigation on those still missing and the circumstances surrounding the matter.  The commission also expressed its encouragement at the greater access recently granted by the Indonesian authorities to some human rights and humanitarian organisations as well as to international media.</P>
    <P>Of considerable importance is the fact that the commission has requested the UN Secretary-General to report to it on the human rights situation in East Timor and that the matter remains on the commission's agenda.</P>
    <P>Arising from concerns expressed by Deputies in the Dáil in March, discussions have taken place in my Department with the Australian Ambassador. Officials of my Department have outlined to the ambassador the concerns of the Government at the human rights situation and have asked the Australian Government to use its influence with Indonesia to achieve an improvement in that country's record in East Timor.  The ambassador confirmed his country's concern about human rights in East Timor and said that Australia was using all its influence with Indonesia to raise individual human rights cases.  This policy of constructive engagement was outlined by the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Paul Keating, when he met the Taoiseach during his visit to Ireland last September.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> Australia recognises Indonesia's sovereignty over East Timor and this has, in their view, enabled the Australian Government to pursue its concerns for human rights and the economic development of the East Timorese people in a constructive and effective manner with the Indonesian authorities.  The Australian Government has pointed out that this recognition does not, of course, imply approval of the circumstances of the Indonesian acquisition of East Timor. The Australian Government firmly believes that the development of a more substantial relationship in recent years with Indonesia has assisted their efforts to maintain dialogue on these issues, a dialogue in which Australia's views are clearly conveyed to the Indonesian authorities at the highest level.  In this respect, the Australian Government has long emphasised to the Indonesian Government the need for a process of reconciliation with the people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>The question of trade sanctions against Indonesia because of its policy on East Timor has been raised from time to time. As Senators will be aware Ireland is not in a position unilaterally to introduce trade sanctions against Indonesia.  These are matters for the United Nations acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter or for the European Union in accordance with Article 228(a) of the Maastricht Treaty.  At present, while the dialogue is under way between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General, I do not believe there would be sufficient agreement within the UN or in the European Union to impose sanctions on Indonesia.  Nonetheless, I recognise the concern that has been expressed about the reported use of military equipment supplied to Indonesia by some of our partners in the European Union and I intend to take up this issue with them.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that the Government has an active and developed policy on East Timor which seeks to use all the resources at our disposal to bring pressure to bear on the Indonesian authorities.  There have been some signs recently of Indonesian awareness <Col N="83" /> of the damage that the activities of its security forces in East Timor are doing to its international reputation and of the need to take action.  The Government will continue to work bilaterally, within the European Union and at the United Nations, to ensure that justice is done and that the people of East Timor can live in conditions of peace and stability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the abuse of human rights in East Timor.  Since the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia in December 1975 human rights abuses have occurred on an alarming scale.  They include mass murder of unarmed civilians, political murders, imprisonment without trial, execution of the old and sick, widespread torture, rape and the regular disappearance of civilians.</P>
      <P>The population of East Timor is approximately 600,000.  Since the invasion 200,000 people are believed to have been killed or to have died of starvation. Due to the strategic position of Indonesia and its considerable oil resources criticism by the west has been sadly missing.  Most western governments and the United Nations have failed to make any criticism of or to take positive action to prevent the massacre of the people of East Timor.  Even worse, East Timor's nearest neighbour, Australia, has helped to train some of Indonesia's armed forces.  The United States and Britain have sold a considerable number of aircraft, including Skyhawks, to Indonesia.  Recently Britain agreed to sell that country 40 Hawk military jets.</P>
      <P>I note from the Tánaiste's address that the Taoiseach had discussions with the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Paul Keating, when he visited this country last year.  Did the Tánaiste, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, also raise the matter with the Australian Prime Minister?  It is important that the depth of the feeling among Irish people about this issue was conveyed to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It saddens me that most of the world's prominent nations continue to trade with Indonesia.  It is likely that other countries, <Col N="84" /> in addition to the United States and Britain, may be selling sold arms to Indonesia.  Ireland, as a sovereign nation, should table a resolution at the United Nations condemning the sale of arms to Indonesia by all governments.  The resolution should also state that no arms should be supplied to Indonesia in future. We should also be courageous enough to call for the isolation of Indonesia until it ceases the genocide of the people in East Timor.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to contrast the situation in East Timor with what happened when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The western nations united in opposition to him.  If oil and mineral wealth had been involved would such a soft approach have been adopted towards what is now happening in East Timor?  There appears to be a large measure of double-dealing in the approach of western governments to Kuwait when contrasted to their failure to take any action on the invasion of East Timor.</P>
    <P>The United Nations are fully aware of the horrors and tragedy that are inflicted daily on the people of this small country. For years, Amnesty International have been highlighting the problems in East Timor.  Western governments have undoubtedly been aware of the atrocities occurring there.  In Ireland, the issue has been highlighted and kept alive by Tom Hyland and his East Timor Action Group, who have been tireless in their efforts to ensure these atrocities are brought to our attention.</P>
    <P>As a small independent nation which had to fight to obtain its freedom, we should lead public opinion to mobilise support for the people of East Timor. This should be done at national, European and United Nations levels.  We should continue regularly to press for the withdrawal of Indonesian troops from East Timor and highlight and fight for the safety and protection of an innocent people who are being slaughtered by an invading Indonesian army.  One-third of the population of this small country has been slaughtered.  In the years to come people will look back on this crime with disgust.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Ireland is a democratic country. Democratic countries which allow such abuses to occur and who pursue a policy of quiet diplomacy hit the heart of their democracies.  Any Member of this House or of any other government who saw John Pilger's special TV report &ldquo;Death of a Nation&rdquo;, which was filmed in secret, will be aware of just how serious are the problems confronting this small nation.</P>
    <P>I have been told that the Indonesian authorities have arrested people, transported them across from East Timor and treated them as slaves; only today, I was informed that 400 East Timorese have recently been taken to Indonesia as slaves.  I ask the Tánaiste and his officials to investigate these reports.  There has been considerable progress in eliminating slavery.  If the Indonesian Government are practising slavery, concerted action is necessary at all levels of international diplomacy to ensure it is stopped and never allowed to happen again.  This is a matter of the utmost gravity.</P>
    <P>Many people have disputed that 200,000 people have been killed in East Timor.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that massacres have occurred, are occurring and will continue to occur on an unprecedented scale unless western countries take action to prevent these horrors.  This can be done through diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions and embargoes and the prevention of any further Indonesian troops from entering East Timor.  It is essential that we take a firm and determined position and give a positive lead in this matter on behalf of those in East Timor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minster for Foreign Affairs for the excellent work he has done since he was appointed to the position.  The Minister has, at every opportunity, brought the problems of East Timor to the world stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many calls in this House and in other parts of Ireland to debate what happened in East Timor. Many would ask why this problem should be discussed.  East Timor is just another country where atrocities take place.  It is far from Ireland, so why should we worry <Col N="86" /> about it?  Every time an atrocity or a deprivation of human rights takes place, Ireland should oppose it.  We have an honourable history in terms of our support for those under pressure.  Many might say that this is only because we were not big enough to be a colonial power and do what other European countries did to what is now commonly called the Third World.  What difference does it make to us if the Indonesian Government kills 200,000 or 300,000 people?  I believe we must think, react and use whatever pressure we can to ensure the East Timorese live as we live.  Despite our economic, personal or political problems, we must give them our support in their fight against the residue of the colonial powers.</P>
    <P>The Indonesian Government is the power we are opposing on this issue. Indonesia emerged as a country because of European colonisation over many years.  Timor was governed by the Portuguese from 1702 to 1975; a period of over 250 years.  The Portuguese left a similar residue to that left&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in northern and southern Africa, by the British, the Germans and the Italians.  All our current friends in the EU colonised what is now called the Third World and left behind them a residue of poverty that is impacting on all of us.  These people are not going to sit still.</P>
      <P>John Pilger's recent programme, &ldquo;Death of a Nation&rdquo;, concentrated our minds on what happened in East Timor. It showed the number of people who had been killed but it did not show the depth of degradation which the Indonesians had gone through to go into that country and eliminate the population of East Timor.  The Portuguese, our partners in the European Union, are to blame for what happened there, in the same way as the Dutch, the Germans and the British are to blame for what is happening in the world at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> There is no country where one cannot buy French arms, French planes, British planes, American armaments and armaments from the former Soviet nations. These are now being used to eliminate small nations, and we are doing nothing about it.  The London <i>Independent</i> of 6 April 1993, as reported by Reuter, stated that &ldquo;The Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said yesterday he had raised concerns about the relatively light sentences given to Indonesian soldiers tried in the shootings of protesters demanding independence for East Timor.&rdquo;  When did one hear Mr. Douglas Hurd commenting on the &ldquo;light sentences&rdquo; passed on British soldiers in the North of Ireland when they committed similar atrocities to what happened in East Timor?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On Her Majesty's Bloody Service&rdquo; is the heading of an article on Mr. John Pilger's magnificent report on what happened in East Timor.  Anyone who has read the Alan Clarke diaries will know that he said it does not matter if a Minister tells a lie in Parliament because it is expected of Ministers to tell lies.  He was not talking about the situation in the North of Ireland or in Europe, but in East Timor.  Mr. Alan Clarke will not be remembered for anything except the diaries he published and the insight he gave into what government is about.  If one compares the Alan Clarke diaries to the programme, &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo;, one will see the similarities between the two.  Mr. Alan Clarke was being honest when he suggested that British Ministers tell lies when it suits them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senator Lanigan is not suggesting that Irish Ministers would do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that; I am talking about the Alan Clarke diaries. It is nonsense to say he was defence procurement Minister because he was a man who bought airplanes and armaments for the British Government, not for the defence of the United Kingdom, but for export.  In his diaries he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> I put it to him that ministers had talked about guarantees from the Indonesians that the Hawks would not be used in East Timor.  I asked what exactly these guarantees were.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Well I never asked for a guarantee&rdquo;, he said&rdquo; ...a guarantee is worthless from any government as far as I'm concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is what Alan Clarke said about East Timor, not about domestic policy in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>We must be careful about our colleagues in America or in the European Union who sell armaments throughout the world.  Each time a plane is sold to Indonesia we must ask if it can be used for military purposes.  If someone tells me a plane cannot be used for military purposes I am a Dutchman rather than a Kilkenny man.  There is no such thing as a plane which cannot be adapted to military purposes.</P>
    <P>The armaments industry in Europe and the United States is thriving and we have a so-called cessation of East-West conflict. We have concentrated our minds on nationalistic enterprises in which the major nations are supplying the armaments and these are being used to kill people in East Timor and elsewhere. There are 17 wars taking place in what was formerly Eastern Europe and the armaments are coming from Holland, Britain, Spain, and the area of which we are members and support.</P>
    <P>After 250 years of domination by the Portuguese, the East Timor people are being decimated by the Indonesians.  This is not a decimation of small proportions but an absolute elimination.  We should not support any government which supplies arms to kill a nation and this is happening in front of our eyes.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for making time available for this debate and I also thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy O'Shea, for facilitating us.  I welcome the debate on the atrocities perpetuated by the Indonesian regime on the people of East Timor since it invaded the country in 1975.</P>
      <P>It is important to discuss the level of atrocities committed in East Timor.  Until recently, there was a conspiracy of silence by the western world towards the atrocities in that country.  East Timor has endured this suffering, despite the brutal killings of a third of its population; men, women and children have been annihilated. We must condemn unreservedly the destruction of the nation and people of East Timor.  We must also condemn the open support for the Indonesian Government by prominent nations throughout the world.  These nations have continued a lucrative trade with Indonesia, including arms sales to the military by France, the United States and the United Kingdom in particular.  Arms have allegedly been used to kill and maim the Timorese people and I have no doubt these arms and planes are used to annihilate innocent people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I saw a special report on RTE, &ldquo;Death of a Nation&rdquo;, by Mr. John Pilger produced by ITV.  This was a frightening exposé of how ethnic cleansing at its worst is carried out.  Although Ireland is a small nation involved in peace-keeping throughout the world, we must do everything in our power to stop this slaughter.  We must use our position as a prominent member of the United Nations to highlight and object to what is happening.  A solution to the plight of the people will not be forthcoming until international pressure forces an end to all trading with Indonesia and full economic sanctions and a total embargo are imposed on Indonesia, similar to that <Col N="90" /> imposed on Iraq and which proved successful in South Africa.  Only then will we see an end to the massacre of this peaceful people.</P>
    <P>Such a cessation of violence seems far off at present.  As already stated here, Australia has provided military training for the Indonesian armed forces and Britain has recently sold 40 Hawk military jets to Indonesia.  It was said that the `planes would not be used against civilians but as Senator Lanigan said, and as John Pilger proved in his programme, this is not the case; the `planes have been used for military purposes against civilians. The Indonesian Trade and Industry Minister, Mr. Habibie, clearly stated: &ldquo;The 'planes will not only be used to train pilots but also for ground attacks&rdquo;. What kind of morality allows governments to turn a blind eye to atrocities in their hunger to exploit economic opportunities? Lethal weapons should not be used without legal guarantees that they will not be used to kill innocent people.</P>
    <P>I quote from a report of Amnesty International:</P>
    <P>When governments pretend not to notice suffering, to whom can peoples like those of Indonesia and East Timor turn for help?  The United Nations? Alas, the deeper you delve, the redder the faces.  The cynicism of realpolitik extends even to the UN Commission on Human Rights, of which Indonesia is a member.  When Amnesty attended the commission in Geneva recently to urge action on Indonesia and East Timor, we met only embarrassment. The governments to which we spoke repeated what they have been promising us for 30 years, that they will pursue a policy of quiet diplomacy. They might as well go fishing.</P>
    <P>Indonesia became a member of the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1991. As such it bears a special responsibility to implement recommendations enumerated in that body's statements and resolutions.  Yet with some minor exceptions it has not done so.  Indeed it has indicated it does not feel bound to abide by the provisions of those resolutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> If the Government of Indonesia trusts the role of UN bodies, particularly the UN Commission on Human Rights, to discharge its mandate to promote and protect human rights, it should comply and co-operate fully with the suggestions and recommendations of that body.  To do so selectively raises questions about the sincerity of the Indonesian Government's commitment to those principles and institutions.  That Government has also failed to become a party to the most important international human rights conventions, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</P>
    <P>The principal responsibility for improving human rights in East Timor rests with the Indonesian Government but member states of the United Nations also have a role to play.  By encouraging Indonesia to allow international monitoring of human rights and insisting that the Government abide by international human rights standards, the international community has recently begun to have an impact on Indonesian Government policy and practice, although it has been limited.  That success, however modest, is one of the strongest arguments for the reiteration of international concern for the situation.  It also points to the need for broadening the focus of UN concern from East Timor to Indonesia.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International made recommendations to members of the UN Commission on Human Rights which should be endorsed by this House.  We should urge the Indonesian authorities to account fully for the dead and disappeared from the Santa Cruz massacre and its aftermath and to establish durable mechanisms to ensure that the victims of other serious human rights violations in East Timor have an effective avenue through which to seek redress and compensation. The House should express its concern at the Indonesian Government's failure to bring to justice all those ultimately responsible for the Santa Cruz massacre and at the disparity in sentencing <Col N="92" /> between members of the security forces and their civilian victims.  We should also call on the Indonesian authorities to ensure that all those believed to be responsible for human rights violations in East Timor are tried by a civilian court and punished in accordance with the severity of their crimes.</P>
    <P>This House should express its concern about the unfair treatment and unfair trial and imprisonment of the government's political opponents in East Timor and call for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience throughout that country.  We should call on the Indonesian authorities to implement the recommendations of the UN special rapporteur on torture and urge them to take immediate steps to ensure the recently created national commission on human rights meets the standards of impartiality and independence enumerated in the UN's principles on the status of national institutions for the production and protection of human rights.  We should demand that the Government of Indonesia further improve access to East Timor for human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, and put an end to the legal and other obstacles that continue to impede the work of international and domestic human rights and humanitarian bodies in East Timor.</P>
    <P>We should also welcome that Government's decision to invite the special rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions to visit East Timor in 1994 and suggest that it also extend invitations to the special rapporteur on torture, the working group on advisory detention and the working group on enforced and involuntary disappearance. We should urge that Government to invite all four monitoring mechanisms into East Timor.  Finally, we should seek a full report to the UN Commission on Human Rights at its next session from the UN Secretary General, regarding the result of the two visits to East Timor by his personal envoy, Mr. Amos Wako.</P>

      <P>It is only fair to say that the issue of East Timor has been pursued <Col N="93" /> in this House by Senator Norris for a long time.  We should pay tribute to him for pressurising to have this debate.  The Tánaiste was anxious to come to the House and issue a statement on the matter and for that reason the debate was delayed by at least a week until time became available for him to do so.  I know of his interest in and concern for the matter.</P>
      <P>Like everyone else, I feel a sense of powerlessness in dealing with the issue.  I saw the television programme and one would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by it.  It was a shocking programme, which showed history repeating itself &mdash; it reminded me of the Nazis and the Jews, or the Americans in Vietnam.  People were being killed and a small population was being destroyed. There were 600,000 people in East Timor and 200,000 have been murdered already.  The scale of the killing is awesome.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the role of Britain.  Britain is not alone in this and I would be slow to indulge in anti-British criticism, but they certainly took a cavalier approach to selling Hawk aircraft to Indonesia.  They blatantly lied about its capabilities and in saying that it was solely a training aircraft.  They were guilty of gross duplicity because there is no doubt Hawk aircraft have been used to slaughter people in East Timor; there is independent proof of that.</P>
      <P>The British, especially under Lady Thatcher, courted Indonesia which has a population of approximately 190 million, in order to get a share of its economy.  It is a shame that a country like Australia, a former penal colony where besieged people, including the Irish, who were badly treated by administrations in their native countries were sent, gives succour to this regime for economic reasons.  It is hypocritical for the Australian Government to suggest that by legitimising the seizure of East Timor by Indonesia, it can influence the rate of killing by Indonesians.  It is a grotesque and convoluted way of thinking on the part of Australians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> Senator Neville outlined a number of ways the Government could proceed and I agree that everything possible should be done.  We must look at this from all angles, including the human rights angle. As regards UN or EU sanctions, I believe it will be impossible to get a decision from the EU on sanctions against Indonesia on economic grounds.  The EU wants to trade and some countries, including Britain, put the shilling and the pound before other considerations.  I despair of some of our friends in the EU to take a stand on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville said that in addition to the economic damage sanctions cause, they also influence how a country is perceived by the rest of the world.  The sanctions imposed on South Africa brought about the situation which exists today. With the transition from white to majority rule, and now that the ANC, Inkatha, and the National Party have reached an agreement, I hope South Africa will have a bright and peaceful future.  Sanctions made South Africa an international leper and they shook the confidence of whites and made them more amenable to the ANC's realistic demands.  The only way Indonesia will back away from its policy on East Timor is if similar measures are applied so that it becomes a leper.</P>
    <P>We must convince the EU to adopt that policy because that is where our influence lies, if it lies anywhere.  I fear that so-called market forces will prove stronger than political ones, particularly when one examines the recent history of the UK Government in relation to trade with Indonesia.  One becomes confused as to where the political and the economic barrier was crossed, because it seems Lady Thatcher on the one hand and her son on the other were hawking arms to Indonesia. As she said &ldquo;batting for Britain&rdquo;, but in effect she was killing for Britain.  The Hawk aircraft has been one of the main weapons used in trying to exterminate a race.</P>
    <P>Nothing divides the House on this issue and I concur with opinions expressed by parties on the other side.  We must keep the pressure on the Government and it <Col N="95" /> in turn will keep the pressure on those it can influence internationally in order to end this dreadful situation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Minster to the House, I regret the delay in debating this matter.  I am not sure if the Tánaiste was as anxious as he might have been to debate this.  We pressed for this debate since Christmas on every Order of Business, but it has taken until now to discuss it at a time in the evening when it will attract little attention.  In that context, I wonder if there may be embarrassment about what might be said about our efforts in regard to the situation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>We owe a debt to the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign, Amnesty International, Mr. John Pilger and other courageous people like him.  It is important to underline the courage of such people, given that six journalists were killed in the early days of this conflict while trying to report it.  The most effective way the Indonesian authorities can ensure these matters are not brought to public attention is to prevent journalists and parliamentarians from covering what is happening.  That is a measure of Mr. Pilger's success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw Mr. Pilger's programme twice and, like all Members, I was impressed and disturbed by what I saw.  The evidence presented is incontrovertible and it is supported by people of distinction, including Bishop Belo of East Timor.  At last there is an awareness of the scale of the human tragedy in East Timor.  I will not repeat the facts and figures presented by other speakers other than to say that despite the terrible nature of the conflict we experience in terms of the loss of human life, it pales in significance compared to what has happened in East Timor.  It is an indictment of the international community that it can stand back and remain powerless purely on the basis of economic expediency.  We are balancing 200,000 lives against the economic benefits of trading with Indonesia, where <Col N="96" /> trade has increased and the economy has grown.</P>
    <P>I refer to what happened in the Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili.  According to whatever report one reads, approximately 250 to 300 people were wiped out during a peaceful protest.  That is the type of regime we are dealing with.  We must not presume that we are dealing with a sanitised military junta, we are dealing with military thugs who do not understand the language we use; it is not part of their vocabulary and we must be aware of that.</P>
    <P>One might ask why should we worry about East Timor.  We should worry because we are members in good standing of the international community and our opinion carries weight in the EU and the UN.  We must continue to press in those fora for this matter to be given the attention it deserves.  If we do not show that we care, how can we ask the international community to show concern for our problems?  International awareness must be converted into concrete action which will benefit those affected by this human catastrophe.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to meetings which have taken place.  I thank the Department of Foreign Affairs for the briefing material I received before visiting the UN Secretary General with parliamentary colleagues from the UK, Australia and Sweden.  It was evident from the briefing I got that meetings took place between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Indonesian Embassy last September.  I know that the matter was raised by the Taoiseach with Mr. Keating when he was here and that there have been subsequent meetings, but no response has been recorded in any of these documents.  What have these people said in response to the queries that were legitimately raised by our Government?  It is not to be seen anywhere.</P>
    <P>On 3 February last I availed of the invitation of the East Timor Irish solidarity campaign to bring the case to the United Nations with parliamentary colleagues from the countries I mentioned. <Col N="97" /> At that meeting we made all the points made here by speakers as to what should be done.  In a memo which was presented to the Secretary General we called for the withdrawal of Indonesian troops and the holding of a referendum on self-determination for East Timor under international supervision.  Pending the holding of the referendum, we urged the Secretary General to open an office in East Timor to oversee its demilitarisation, provide humanitarian aid and monitor human rights.</P>
    <P>We asked the Secretary General to urge Indonesia to comply with the terms of the 1993 resolution of the UN Human Rights Commission, which we believed would be the most important confidence building measure that could take place. That resolution called on Indonesia to allow visits by two UN special rapporteurs and two UN working groups which investigate torture, extra-judicial killings, disappearances and arbitrary detention.  It asked for free access to the territory by human rights organisations &mdash; this would be uppermost in my mind &mdash; and the release of political prisoners. We also asked the Secretary General to set up a commission to study the events leading to the invasion and annexation of the territory.  The Secretary General, to be fair to him, received us very courteously and listened to our case.  My sympathy is with the Secretary General, because without the support of the international community it is difficult to see what the Secretary General can do in practical terms to solve this human tragedy.</P>
    <P>The other matter which impressed me greatly was meeting a student who had been forced to flee East Timor.  It is again a measure of the regime with which we are dealing, and something difficult for us in Ireland to comprehend, that that person could not return to his own country and family.  That was the fact of the matter and in one very isolated case showed what was happening.</P>
    <P>I could speak on this for a considerable length of time but I know time is limited. The first priority is that there must be access for the human rights organisations. <Col N="98" /> There has been one visit by Swedish parliamentarians and they came away very depressed because they could not see anything and were speaking to people who were living in fear.  Therefore, there must be access for human rights organisations.  Xanana Gusmao, who is the leader in the country, was jailed for life &mdash; his sentence has now been reduced &mdash; on a trumped up charge. That matter is one to which we must attend.</P>
    <P>In May the Indonesian and Portuguese Foreign Ministers meet in Geneva and have been meeting on a regular basis. We have to bring whatever pressure we can to bear in order to achieve progress there and assist the Portuguese people. I want to contradict something Senator Lanigan said in respect of Portugal.  He more or less suggested that they were to blame for this situation.  That is not the case.  They were there for 450 years and, like all colonial powers, I am sure they were not without blame.  However, I am also quite certain that in the event of the Timorese people wanting self-determination it would have been granted to them at this stage because Portugal's record in respect of other countries is quite good.</P>
    <P>There is the question of what should happen in Geneva in May and the other question is the arms sales.  Hawk aircraft and arms from other countries are being sold to Indonesia and that is just appalling. I have a letter which was sent to a person in Dublin on 18 January from the British Embassy here and it states among other things:</P>
    <P>On the specific question of defence sales, the British Government do not believe that abolition of defence sales to Indonesia would promote the cause of human rights in Indonesia or East Timor; [imagine that] rather, we believe that constructive dialogue is more likely to encourage the Indonesians to improve their human rights record.</P>
    <P>There is a very interesting phrase there: &ldquo;constructive dialogue&rdquo;.  In the course of the Minister's address we heard <Col N="99" /> that Australia are talking about constructive engagement.  What do the phrases &ldquo;constructive dialogue&rdquo; and &ldquo;constructive engagement&rdquo; mean?  I do not know what they mean.  This letter goes on to state that:</P>
    <P>...applications for export licences in respect of defence equipment are rejected (not &ldquo;are likely to be rejected&rdquo; as your letter suggested) [to the correspondent] in those cases where the equipment is likely to be used against civil populations.</P>
    <P>Does the British Government support that statement or does it not?  If it does support that statement there are no circumstances under which military equipment could be sent to Indonesia and they may need to be reminded of that.</P>
    <P>We support the dialogue taking place between Indonesia and Portugal.  The East Timorese should have access to that dialogue.  The International Committee of the Red Cross should have access to political prisoners and the UN resolutions should be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I am delighted that the Minister and the Government saw fit to respond to this issue because it is one of fundamental human rights.  The situation in Timor is a problem for the Portuguese national conscience to some extent.  It is also an embarrassment for them due to the lack of conscience with which the major powers defend their own interest for which they still invoke the Communist threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regime in Indonesia, which is the aggressor in Timor, is one of the few surviving examples of a national security state.  The army holds power, Communism is identified as the enemy and tentative attempts have been made at liberalisation.  The need for security against aggression from external forces is assumed.  When Indonesia was attempting to take over western Papua New Guinea, it announced that it would submit to the rule of colonial self-determination and expressly denied <Col N="100" /> having pretensions to Portuguese Timor in order to strengthen its claims. However, having won its case in Papua New Guinea, which had been independent since 1975, it then started to pursue insurgence.  Indonesia invoked the usual pretext of enemy of the state and of national security, as in the case of East Timor at the time of the Portuguese revolutionary decolonisation, focusing on the danger of it becoming a sanctuary for guerrillas or a source of subversion. In this way everything could be justified in terms of national security.  It was really a police action which became terribly abusive and they just took over the country.</P>
    <P>Since 1961 the United Nations had considered Portuguese overseas territories, including East Timor, as non-autonomous territories; but after 1974 the Portuguese state itself assumed the status of administering power under the regime of trust territories.  Although it is not stated explicitly, it is patently undeniable that relations between the UN, the Portuguese state and Timor developed in the usual framework of trust territories and Portugal was acting under the mandate of the international community.  One of the functions of the General Assembly of the UN under the authority of its custodial council in Article 87 is to make periodic visits to trust territories on dates agreed with the administering power.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the UN Charter which allows one of its members to boycott the complete application of the decolonisation programme.  On the contrary to act against this objective violates the Charter, and thus the Security Council would be authorised to act upon it.  I know the Security Council has not got a great record and one only has to look at the problems in former Yugoslavia to see that they do not always act as quickly as they should.  The UN is directly responsible for decolonisation, the repudiation of aggression and the struggle against genocide.</P>
    <P>The problem in Timor is that it is still one of the territories that does not have and is not recognised as having self government.  As such it is possible to <Col N="101" /> invoke resolutions 1514/XV and 1541/XV ordering that the people of East Timor be allowed exercise the right to independence and self-determination and that these be respected.  The occupation by the Indonesian troops has, for nearly 15 years, constituted an extremely grave violation of fundamental principles of international law, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Convention of Civil and Political Rights.  Portugal in its laws, including law 7/74, and its constitution recognises the inalienable right of the people of Timor freely to choose their political, economic and cultural future.</P>
    <P>A number of conditions are necessary for the achievement of peace.  The first, as has been called for by a number of Senators, is a ban on arms sales to Indonesia in addition to whatever other economic sanctions are required or judged appropriate.  The second is to recognise clearly that the Timorese people must have a part in any negotiation process.  It has been said that only Portugal and Indonesia are involved but that is untrue.  They are two interested parties but the Timorese people are the main negotiators.</P>
    <P>The legitimate representatives of the people of East Timor must be heard and called upon to intervene actively in decision making.  This implies the strengthening of Timor's capacity to intervene, both at international and national levels, but they should be provided with the means which would allow them to do that.  Everybody has mentioned the terror and death of 200,000 people but without any major political changes in Indonesia and its policy of annexation and extermination, which is supported by democratic countries such as Australia and the USA and other western countries, no peace effort will be successful.  Legality, self-determination and decolonisation will only be possible if human rights violations end, Indonesian troops and administration are withdrawn, citizens in exile return and contracts regarding the mineral wealth of the Sea of Timor are declared invalid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> A Senator mentioned the BBC TV film about East Timor.  I saw that film as did the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans and the former Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ali Alatas.  They concluded an agreement on the Timor Gap Zone of Co-operation Treaty which was signed in mid-air over the oil fields owned by East Timor.  It has been hailed by both countries as a creative and peaceful alternative to a protracted delimitation dispute.  In fact, it is only the annexation of wealth that should rightly belong to the East Timorese.</P>
    <P>What will become of the East Timor and what should we do?  As democratic countries we must speak out against the horror that has happened.  A number of other things could happen.  Independence must be the final goal for East Timor and a number of phases could lead to this.  The first is the withdrawal of the Indonesian forces; the second may not appear correct but at some level there must be a reconstitution of the Portuguese Administration in the intervening period; third, there must be a referendum; and fourth, independence.</P>
    <P>Law 7/75 of the Revolutionary Council of Portugal states that the Portuguese State will confine the definition of the political future of Timor to a representative popular assembly, to be elected by universal, direct and secret suffrage in obedience to the principles expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Once elected, the popular assembly will define by simple majority and by direct secret vote the administrative and political status of the territory of Timor.  The Portuguese Administration must for some time be returned to East Timor before independence because they can act as mediators.  They have knowledge of the situation and before independence there are always a number of warring factions, even within the Timorese.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators that this horrific situation must be brought to an end.  If one saw that film, one saw the actions taken by people, such as Henry Kissinger and Senator Daniel Moynihan to prevent it reaching the UN.  This is horrific when <Col N="103" /> one considers it.  Perhaps they did it because the Indonesians are against Communism or a perceived Communist threat and Australia is counted as a western country against Communism. However, there are people in this small country who are suffering and dying &mdash; although I agree that is not due to the Portuguese &mdash; who are being exploited because they have oil wealth.  If this oil was a little closer to home, as in Kuwait, there would be no trouble.  The oil will go to Indonesia and Australia while the Timorese just get death.</P>
    <P>At all levels we must keep up the fight for these poor people; I do not mean poor in a condescending sense but poor because nobody seems to be on their side.  We should at least do that.  We know what it means to be colonised because we were colonised for a long time.  It is up to us and other countries to insist that this issue is repeatedly brought before the United Nations, to ensure that East Timor is made a trust territory and that the Security Council is given authorisation to go in, monitor and demand that free elections take place which will lead to independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted this matter has come up for discussion.  In 1989, former Senator Brendan Ryan and I first raised the issue of East Timor.  I recall that not one Member at that time was aware of the situation there.  I have had a number of experiences in dealing with this issue and the article written by Mr. Hugh O'Shaughnessy in the <i>Observer</i>, which was carried by <i>The Irish Times</i>, in April 1991, raised awareness to a great extent in the same way as the documentary by John Pilger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put in context the type of difficulties one encounters in East Timor. In January 1993, I arranged for the question of civil rights in East Timor to be discussed in Stockholm by a gathering of a representative group of 25 million teachers worldwide.  I arranged to speak in favour of a motion put forward by the Portuguese teachers' union which was in favour of the restoration of human rights <Col N="104" /> in East Timor.  Unfortunately, I was unable to attend but the president of the INTO made a contribution in favour of the motion, which was passed almost unanimously.  A small number of teachers from Australia and Indonesia opposed it.</P>
    <P>A month later I received a glossy publication, entitled &ldquo;East Timor, The Rising Province of Indonesia&rdquo;.  One part states that the people of East Timor are free and united and that East Timor is the 27th province of Indonesia.  It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>We praise to God that the people of East Timor, as well as the people of Indonesia's other provinces, have the opportunity to live as a free country and are able to take part in the national development programme to elevate their welfare and prosperity in an equally balanced and just way.</P>
    <P>This is the tone of the whole publication. It includes a number of photographs of East Timor in 1976, one of which shows a ramshackle house, East Timor girls with a dim future and traditional farms with a low productivity rate in a very faded picture.  On another page, in full colour, a photograph shows East Timor in 1989 where everything is rosy and there is no sign of a bullet, a gun or deprivation of human rights, etc.  It is important to recognise that the Indonesian teachers' union could not afford to send that document all over the world.  It went to every teachers' union, probably to the members of the executive of each union, and that involved a huge cost.  This is the limits to which the Indonesian Government will go to put a spin on the publicity and discussion of what is happening in East Timor.  In every walk of life we should try to raise this issue.  We should recognise that this country can have an impact.  Countries such as Ireland, which is considered neutral, should speak out and make its views known.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister of State, as a teacher, is aware of the fact that the concern of teachers was with the suppression of culture and language.  The difficulty is that the main language of the <Col N="105" /> East Timorese people is banned from the education system, they are not allowed to develop their own culture.  A new generation of children is being told that the reason for Indonesian rule in East Timor is that in 1975 the East Timorese people invited the Indonesian Government to look after the country.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a very wide understanding of the level of human rights violations in East Timor.  Portugal was a colonising state and like any other colonising state over the period of 400 years of rule, it was guilty of many actions which it would not be proud of today.  It is important to state that as soon as the Portuguese people in Europe managed to rid themselves of the dictatorship that trammelled that country for many years, they moved to give independence to what were until that time the colonies, including East Timor.  At that point the Indonesians were not prepared to let the newly declared State of East Timor achieve viability.  It is also important to state that East Timor, with its indigenous wealth, has the potential to be a viable state and to take its place among the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>In terms of how we are approaching this issue tonight, it is easy to make statements. I would have preferred a clear motion stating our opinion for the record. I would like this House to call on the Government to support at the United Nations the right of East Timor to self-determination; to condemn the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia and to further condemn the continuing human rights violations by Indonesia.  This House should press the Irish Government to put pressure on the Indonesian Government to invite to East Timor the UN special rapporteurs mentioned by a number of speakers already, those dealing with extra-judicial execution or torture, to satisfy themselves as to the condition of that country.  This House should ask the Irish Government to call on the Indonesian Government for the release of all political prisoners in East Timor.  I would like the Irish Government to immediately express publicly on behalf of the Irish people its moral revulsion at the continuing <Col N="106" /> atrocities being perpetrated in East Timor.  It is important that we, as public representatives, make this statement.</P>
    <P>It is my intention over the next number of weeks to put together a petition stating our support for the UN on the self-determination of the people of East Timor, the condemnation of the invasion and human rights violations by Indonesia, supporting pressure for the facilitation of the UN rapporteurs, the release of political prisoners and expressing our revulsion at the atrocities being carried out in East Timor.  I intend writing to every Member of both Houses and asking them to sign a petition, in other words to put their money where their mouths are on this issue.  Let us show clearly on the record that elected Irish parliamentarians are prepared to express their opposition and revulsion on behalf of the people they represent for what is going on in a tiny, far away, forgotten country in the furthest corner of the globe from us.  We should be clear in our condemnation and a very clear signal should go out from this House.</P>
    <P>It is easy to restate lists of atrocities. We are talking about a small country, half a million people, who could be wiped out and their culture completely suppressed. They need our support and we need to give our Government the confidence to know that our public statements and position on this issue will carry weight.  We need to move on it.  I ask the Minister to take this view to the Government. I hope the House will clearly express its position not just by statement but by resolution of the House and action of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur wholeheartedly with the last speaker on the last point he made.  It is very significant that this debate is taking place.  It is informative, constructive and shows the solidarity of the representatives of the various parties who have spoken on the East TimorIreland solidarity campaign.  Solidarity is what this is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is shocking to say that we have no media presence to report on this debate <Col N="107" /> tonight.  I do not care whether they quote me, but each speaker has made a very constructive and significant contribution in Seanad Éireann tonight and not a line of it will be reported.  I wish to put that on the record.  It is a dereliction of duty by the media, the print media especially, not to take that interest because, whether it is American foreign policy or British foreign policy, there is no reason we should not castigate them for their involvement in the sale of arms to Indonesia.  If we are sincere we should not hesitate to do so.</P>
    <P>Reports on events in East Timor are scant because of the iron fist approach of the military.  I wish to record our appreciation of the efforts by John Pilger and the film he made which brought the situation home to the Irish people in no uncertain manner.  The massacre of over 250 innocent mourners in the Santa Cruz cemetery by members of the Indonesian army was particularly shocking.  It was an atrocious attack on defenceless people and, since Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, they have followed a policy of systematic genocide against the indigenous population.  It has been stated that in excess of one-third of the population have died at the hands of the Indonesian military and if the Indonesian military are supplied with arms by any other country we should condemn and never fail to mention those countries.</P>
    <P>We should impress upon the United Nations Secretary General that the people of Ireland are concerned about the conflict in East Timor and expect the UN to do something about it.  The majority of East Timorese reject their forced integration with Indonesia and continue to call for international support, particularly from the United Nations. The UN which is the appropriate body to address the gross injustice inflicted on a small, relatively defenceless people has condemned the actions but they did not apply any pressure.</P>
    <P>The failure of the international community to secure the implementation of UN resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Indonesian forces is deplorable but <Col N="108" /> the decision of Australia to recognise the illegal incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia is particularly shameful.  The Indonesians have been guilty of well documented severe abuses of human rights since the invasion in 1975 and, despite successive UN resolutions, Australia has not only offered economic and military support to Indonesia but is now co-operating by occupying a position of power in oil exploration in East Timor waters.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Security Council has neglected its duty to the people of East Timor.  Human rights abuses continue and I refer again to the lack of media attention.  I support the call by Senator O'Toole that we should pass a resolution which might gain some attention. That is what is needed if we are to show the solidarity which the people of East Timor need from us.</P>

They will strengthen me in my resolve to see what efforts can be made.  We will continue our efforts with the Australian Government and the Indonesian Government.  As has been said, it is time we had a strong position and it has been well articulated in the Seanad.  I will continue in my contacts, in particular with my Portuguese colleague in the European Union, who, along with the Portuguese Government, has a particular interest in the matter under the auspices of the UN Secretary General who was given his role in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a difficult and complex situation, but nobody can stand over the abuse of human rights which we have seen over the last ten years, all of which were highlighted in Mr. Pilger's film.  It has struck a chord with the world.  I had the opportunity of seeing it and, although it was absolutely horrendous, it gave everybody a clear summary of the situation.  I assure the Members of the Seanad who contributed to the debate that I will take <Col N="109" /> strength and further resolve from what they have said and continue with my efforts on behalf of the Irish Government to see if any progress can be made, however small, to end the massive abuse of human rights and restore dignity to the people of East Timor.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, is in the House for this Adjournment Matter.  It is with considerable regret that I have to say that the situation in Gorazde is deteriorating by the minute.  The ceasefire that had been brokered has totally collapsed.  As the House may be aware, reports have come in that the hospital in Gorazde has been hit by rocket fire and at least ten people, and possibly more, have been killed.</P>
      <P>The city of Gorazde is at present being razed to the ground by rocket fire.  Gorazde had a population of about 30,000 but it now has a population of 65,000 to 70,000 with refugees flooding into the city.  There are approximately 3.5 million refugees in the former Yugoslavia.  Many years ago my wife and I spent our honeymoon in Yugoslavia and it was a magnificent country.  It is sad to see what is happening there now.  The Austrian Chancellor, Franz Vranitsky, was interviewed last night and he stated that approximately 75,000 refugees have fled to Austria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that we are facing a situation in Gorazde where the United Nations is not just being totally ignored but is being insulted.  Many people will remember Haile Selassie addressing the League of Nations when his country was invaded by Italy and no action was taken. Haile Selassie got a poor hearing at the League of Nations at that time.  Italy invaded his country and from then on we saw the beginning of the end of the League of Nations as we knew it.  If the United Nations continues to be insulted and ignored and fails to take positive action it will cause such damage to the UN that it may signal the beginning of <Col N="111" /> the end of the UN.  That would be a tragedy for the world because of the high standing of the UN.</P>
    <P>I regret to state that there has not been sufficient support from Britain, France and the US for the action necessary to stop the Serbian forces from attacking and slaughtering innocent civilians and carrying out atrocities the likes of which have not been seen in Europe for many years.  The time has come for us to make certain that we endeavour to put our case to the United Nations to take positive action to prevent all of the former Yugoslavia being taken over by the Serbs. If this kind of aggression continues and armies are allowed to take over a city, town or country while democratic countries sit idly by, then I fear not only for the Balkan States as we know them but for other countries across Europe.</P>
    <P>The UN must not be seen only as a talking shop but as an organisation which can ensure that when a conflict arises it will, following a meeting of the Security Council and following democratic decisions at the top echelons of the organisation, have the necessary resolve and determination to help to prevent military power from annexing territory, to prevent tyranny and to prevent total annihilation of unarmed civilians.  This is what is happening at present.  Gorazde, which is a case in point, has been humbled and brought to its knees, with the entire city razed to the ground.  It is a matter that could not be more serious and I have great fears about what will happen over the next 24 to 48 hours.</P>
    <P>I call upon the Tánaiste, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to ensure that his views are brought to the attention of all of the relevant Governments, and of the UN, that the necessary action must be taken to ensure that the slaughter which is continuing is terminated immediately.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate on the adjournment of the Seanad regarding the recent and ongoing tragic events in and around Gorazde.  I fully share the concerns <Col N="112" /> over these events which have been expressed so vividly by Senator Enright.</P>
      <P>Before turning to Gorazde, I wish to state that the Government have pursued three essential aims in our policy on former Yugoslavia.  These are, first, to maintain and develop the search for a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Bosnia on the basis of the European Union's peace plan; secondly, to prevent the spread of the conflict; and thirdly, to ensure the supply and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims.</P>
      <P>Gorazde has been isolated and under siege for two years.  For that period its inhabitants have been without running water and electricity.  Most of the humanitarian needs of its inhabitants have had to be provided by the airdrop operation.  The horrific events which have unfolded at Gorazde in recent days have shocked the international community. This assault on a small town, where some 65,000 people have huddled for protection, is an affront to human dignity.  It has left over 300 people dead and more than 1,000 seriously injured.  It is a further flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, examples of which we have witnessed all so frequently in Bosnia for over two years.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that many thousands of displaced persons had taken refuge in Gorazde and five other mostly Muslim towns, these were designated as safe areas by the Security Council in May 1993.  Senators will recall that this step was advocated by the Irish Government at that time.  Clearly it did not prove possible to achieve all of the UN's objectives in the designated safe areas, due to the inflexible attitude of the Bosnian Serbs and their continuing military actions.  Events in Gorazde have highlighted this situation dramatically.</P>
      <P>We should bear in mind, however, that Sarajevo is, at last, free from attack and while the situations at a number of other designated safe areas remains critical, the UN has, unlike in Gorazde, now been able to deploy in considerable strength in these towns.  This has been a major factor in enabling UNPROFOR to work towards achieving its objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> In Gorazde, the UN made repeated attempts to secure the agreement of the Bosnian Serbs to an effective ceasefire and to stop their advance into the enclave.  Undertakings to do so were repeatedly violated.  In light of the shelling of Gorazde, which had jeopardised the lives of UN personnel there, as well as inflicting high casualties on the town's population, close air support was provided by NATO forces at the request of the Secretary General on 10 and 11 April 1994.  The use of air power at safe areas under the authority of the UN was provided for in the Resolution 836, adopted by the Security Council in June 1993.</P>
    <P>In advance of the action by NATO forces, clear and unambiguous warnings were repeatedly given to the Bosnian Serbs to cease their onslaught.  Decisions to use force, including air power, to achieve the specific objectives of Security Council resolutions raise difficult and complex questions.  I believe that the Secretary General's decision to authorise close air support in defence of UN personnel was taken after giving due weight to all the factors involved.  Those Bosnians Serb commanders who defied the appeals and warnings of the international community bear the responsibility for the action taken.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that the Bosnian Serbs have continued their action against Gorazde, inflicting high casualties on its population and threatening the lives of UN personnel who courageously remained in the town.  The actions of the Bosnian Serbs are a substantial setback for the peace process.</P>
    <P>This is especially disheartening, given that much progress had been made recently towards an overall settlement in former Yugoslavia.  The fighting between Bosnian Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia, the major conflict area for over nine months, has been brought to an end. Both parties have agreed to establish a Croat-Muslim Federation in Bosnia.  In Croatia a ceasefire was agreed last month and forces are withdrawing from the confrontation lines.  In Bosnia the vital issue of the delimitation of the Croat-Muslim Federation, as well as the future relationship <Col N="114" /> between this Federation and the Bosnian-Serb territory, remain to be determined.  These questions can be resolved only by negotiations conducted in good faith by all the parties.</P>
    <P>The recent events at Gorazde have given rise to questions in some quarters as to whether the UN should continue to be engaged in Bosnia.  It is clear that the UN has not been able to achieve all of its objectives.  It would be the ultimate tragedy if, following events at Gorazde, despair should precipitate a withdrawal of the UN peace keeping force.  However difficult and frustrating the process may be, the presence of the UN in Bosnia is vital to create the climate for negotiations and to provide desperately needed aid, not least in Gorazde, whose inhabitants are threatened by an appalling humanitarian crisis.</P>
    <P>The EU, which co-chairs the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, is fully engaged in the search for peace.  Many people do not realise that EU member states are contributing some 15,000 personnel to UNPROFOR.  A valuable contribution is also being made to a peaceful settlement by the 200 EU monitors in the EU Monitor Mission. Some 65 per cent of the total cost of the humanitarian aid in former Yugoslavia has been provided by the EU and its member states.  The EU has also agreed in principle to administer the town of Mostar for a two year period and this is a major contribution to the rapprochement between Bosnian Croats and Muslims.</P>
    <P>For Ireland's part, we will continue our efforts to promote the essential objectives I have outlined through our participation in the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia and our participation in UNPROFOR and in the EU Monitor Mission.  We are also providing help for the victims of the conflict and we support the work of the international tribunal which has been established to prosecute the perpetrators of war crimes.  We will continue our support for the vigorous implementation of the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> Along with our EU partners we are fully engaged in the search for an overall settlement for Bosnia.  Our aim is a comprehensive and durable peace for that country and the region.  What has been achieved in recent weeks must not be lost.  A ceasefire at Gorazde is now essential. This should be built upon and extended throughout Bosnia.  EU Foreign Ministers, in Luxembourg on 18 April, demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, the withdrawal of Bosnian Serbs from the vicinity of Gorazde and the lifting of all obstructions which have been placed in UNPRO-FOR's path.</P>
    <P>Ministers also called for an intensive and co-ordinated effort by the international community, involving the EU, UN, United States and Russia, to relaunch the negotiations on the basis of the EU Plan of Action, which has been accepted by all of the parties to the conflict. President Yeltsin has proposed a summit meeting between Russia, the United States and the European Union. On behalf of the Government, I welcome this initiative.  The Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Kozyrev, who met Dr. Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg in Moscow today, also said that these powers and the UN, which effectively represent the greater part of the world, must co-operate.  This is necessary to provide the resolve and determination needed to bring about a solution.  I will have the opportunity to discuss these matters with Mr. Kozyrev in Moscow next week.</P>
    <P>All civilised people must be outraged by the recent and ongoing events at Gorazde but I think it is important to bear in mind two points.  First, a lasting settlement cannot be imposed on Bosnia.  The Bosnian Serbs, in particular, must return to the negotiating table to arrive at a solution through negotiation.  The world must convince and impress on them that this is the only option.  Failure to do so will rightly condemn the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia to isolation from Europe. Second, while the Security Council has authorised the use of force in certain circumstances, the mandate of UNPROFOR <Col N="116" /> in Bosnia is of an essentially humanitarian nature &mdash; to facilitate the distribution of aid and to promote a political settlement.</P>
    <P>A ceasefire at Gorazde was negotiated early this morning.  This provided for the deployment of some 100 UNPROFOR troops to the left bank of the Drina river. In addition UN military observers are to be deployed throughout the town.  It was hoped that these arrangements would facilitate the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance and the immediate evacuation of the wounded.  The latest information available to me, however, indicates that the Serb shelling against Gorazde is continuing and that it has not yet been possible to deploy the UNPROFOR personnel.  An effective ceasefire and the immediate deployment of UN troops is absolutely essential in Gorazde. The Government is fully supportive of the ongoing UN efforts to bring this about.</P>
    <P>In our approach to the conflict in former Yugoslavia the Irish Government has always favoured dialogue and negotiation. However, as we have seen in Sarajevo, the threat or use of force is sometimes necessary to achieve our humanitarian and political objectives.  In the case of Gorazde, the international community cannot leave the besieged citizens defenceless.  We hope the negotiations can be successful.  But if these do not succeed, the most serious consideration will have to be given to the request from the UN Secretary-General to NATO to authorise air strikes, at the request of the United Nations, against artillery, mortar positions or tanks in or around Gorazde and the other safe areas which are determined by UNPROFOR to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets within those areas.</P>
    <P>I know that Senators fully share my preoccupations regarding the safety of the two Irish citizens who are trapped in Gorazde.  They are part of a small UNHCR team who have been doing outstanding work in the most appalling of conditions.  I wish to confirm that I have directly requested the intervention of the Bosnian Serb leader, Dr. Karadzic, to <Col N="117" /> guarantee safe passage for the evacuation of these aid workers from Gorazde.  Mrs. Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, is also working to this end.</P>
    <P>My latest information is that Dr. McLoughlin and Mr. O'Dwyer are safe. It is hoped that the ceasefire, which the UN is working strenuously to put in place, will permit UNHCR staff to reach Gorazde and those who wish to leave to do so in safety.  I am sure that all Senators will agree that these two Irish citizens deserve our highest commendation and support for their efforts on behalf of the victims of war in Gorazde.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter on the Adjournment. I want to point out the need for the Minister for Education to sanction the appointment of a home/school liaison officer at St. Anne's girls' school and St. Joseph's boys' school in Rathkeale, County Limerick, in view of the large number of traveller children attending the schools.  I raised this problem in May 1993 and I am extremely disappointed to learn that I must raise it again as no appointment has been made in the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>Rathkeale town, as I have expressed on numerous occasions in this House, is unique in that 45 per cent of its population consists of members of the travelling community.  There is also a large number of transient travellers who come to the town.  There are many social problems generated because of the presence of two quite different cultures in the town.  It is important that there is more communication and understanding between the travelling and the settled communities in Rathkeale.  Much work has been done in the area.  While the settled community should do what it can to address the problem, I think it feels threatened by the growth of the traveller community in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, both St. Anne's girls' school and St. Joseph's boys' school do <Col N="118" /> everything they can to encourage the travelling community to educate their children.  Tonight, I am asking the Minister for Education to provide a home/school liaison officer to liaise between the school and the travelling families to assist them in their role as parents of school going traveller children.</P>
    <P>There are over 200 settled children and 40 travelling children attending St. Anne's school; 22 of the travelling children are placed in ordinary classes and 18 attend ordinary classes but are on a special roll.  These children and their parents need a great deal of counselling and advice before they are placed in ordinary classes.  Of the 22 travelling children enrolled in ordinary classes, after three-quarters of the school year, 20 are still attending school while two left.  Of the 18 who are enrolled on the special roll, six have, unfortunately, opted out of school. Four of these came for a short period, dropped out, returned when the garda visited their homes but eventually dropped out altogether.  A school liaison officer is the key person needed to advise those families and to encourage the children to return to school.</P>
    <P>At St. Joseph's primary school 12 boys were enrolled for ordinary classes.  One left and two others are expected to leave shortly because they are going travelling. The other nine are settled in and will be there for the entire school year.  Ten more boys will attend classes in this school in early September.  It is also expected that between ten and 12 extra girls will enrol in St. Anne's primary school.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to assist the travelling children in Rathkeale to obtain a basic education.  This includes the provision of pre-school classes for traveller children which vary from 12 to 18 children. Last November, the special section of the Department of Education gave St. Anne's primary school permission to employ a temporary teacher for these 12 traveller children.  These children were found to be extremely difficult, disruptive and almost impossible to work with.</P>
    <P>During the school year the teachers plan to meet the parents of traveller children at the end of each month.  This has <Col N="119" /> proved to be very worthwhile.  It is a very informal way and a friendly atmosphere has been created and a relationship has been developed with this small group of traveller parents.  It is a small beginning but a very valuable one from the aspect of home/school link up.  The principals and managers of both schools are encouraged by the rapport between the traveller parents and the teachers.  A school liaison officer is urgently needed to develop this to involve more parents and to involve parents of traveller children who do not attend school at all or who drop out of primary school at an early stage, which is occurring.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline some of the problems which the principals and managers of the schools have highlighted with regard to traveller children in the schools. Although attendances of traveller children in Rathkeale schools have improved, punctuality and taking unnecessary half days are causing real difficulties with their education.  The level of disruptive behaviour in schools is unacceptable, especially in the girls' school. The children have special needs to which the schools must respond.  It is difficult to keep a balance when a school is doing its best to help two communities in the same classroom.</P>
    <P>The teachers strongly believe that a home/school liaison person should be appointed to link the two communities in every possible way and to assist both schools in doing so.  We are disappointed that such an appointment has not been made to date as it is a necessary appointment. The Minister should understand the special needs and problems of such schools, the need for the school to encourage the traveller parents to continue their children's education and the importance of primary education to the children of the travelling community. That is why I ask the Minister to appoint a school/home liaison officer.</P>
    <P>People outside the area and members of the special task force on travellers, when they hear about this problem, cannot understand why the Department of Education will not respond to such a <Col N="120" /> glaring need.  I should not have to come to the Seanad to press the case &mdash; it should be an automatic appointment. Teachers work hard in liaising with traveller parents.  If there is hope for the future development of the town &mdash; and nobody is suggesting that we destroy the culture of the travelling community &mdash; the travellers must understand the difficulties which arise between the two cultures. It should be highlighted in school that unique cultures should be recognised. It should also be highlighted that basic literary and numeracy skills are necessary.</P>
    <P>Every parent, including travellers, has the right to choose their children's education. However, counselling is necessary in making such choices.  Discussions with teachers of pre-school classes, special classes and ordinary classes should determine when a traveller child is ready to participate in standard class-work. Counselling should take place between the parents, the school and the child to determine when the child should no longer be in a special category.</P>
    <P>Traveller children usually cope well when placed in ordinary classes, especially in junior classes.  However, they start to lose interest when they reach senior classes.  There are various reasons for this, and some of them are cultural. One of the most important reasons is that parents are often illiterate and cannot assist their children with homework. There is an obvious need for counselling in this area.</P>
    <P>If Rathkeale schools had the service I am seeking tonight there would be opportunities for full participation by traveller children in ordinary classes.  There could be full integration with ordinary classes in selected subjects such as music, art, crafts, physical education, reading and so forth.  Pupils from senior special classes in the school, who have achieved a good standard of reading, might benefit from one or two years in the ordinary senior classes even though they would be a little older that the other pupils.</P>
    <P>In view of the unique problems in Rathkeale schools there should be a better teacher/pupil ratio.  As is the case <Col N="121" /> in schools in similar towns, deprived children who are not travellers attend the schools.  Sometimes such children might be more deprived than the traveller children. Rathkeale schools are unique and should be treated as such by the Department so that they can effectively carry out their unique role.  The pupil/teacher ratio in the ordinary classes should be reduced to 25:1.  This will allow teachers to help deprived children from both communities to perform better.  The home/school liaison officer is urgently needed to work with parents and children for the benefit of the settled and travelling communities.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will look favourably on the application.  I read last year's response and I will compare it to the response tonight.  The case stands on its merits and I look forward to a comprehensive reply from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Neville on making a comprehensive case on behalf of St. Anne's primary school in Rathkeale, County Limerick.  I understand the position with regard to the traditional indigenous traveller population in Rathkeale.  I compliment Senator Neville and the people of Rathkeale on their positive attitude in ensuring that equality of opportunity prevails for the travelling community at all levels.  That is most important in primary education where young children from both communities can be integrated and work together through the education system to build a community that accepts each person's culture and diversity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville has outlined the problems in the community.  It is obvious that in a large school with 200 pupils, 40 of whom are traveller children, the difficulties of children from the settled community are compounded if additional services are necessary for the traveller children.  It is incumbent on the Department of Education to provide support and back-up services.  The disruption of classes does not help the school environment nor does it create a settled environment <Col N="122" /> in which children at a very formative age can study and benefit from teaching.  It is vital that back-up service is provided and our efforts should seek to ensure that it is made available.  It is also important that the pupil/teacher ratio takes account of the problems in the school and of the environment it serves.</P>
    <P>This matter is once again under consideration in the Department of Education. I regret that neither the Minister for Education nor the Minister of State at the Department of Education is available. They are engaged in other Government business.  They asked me to deputise for them and to assure the House that they are cognisant of the situation. I will speak with my colleagues in the morning and I will impress on them the importance of this appointment.  I will wholeheartedly recommend it based on the case made by Senator Neville.</P>

      <P>I call on the Government to define the relationship between the Garda drug squad and the national drugs team.  At present the work of the Garda drugs squad is being hampered by the conflict of mandate between it and the national drugs team.  That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>It is farcical that members of the Garda drugs squad, on the trail of a drug smuggler, are apprehended by the national drugs team and hampered from doing their work.  Consequently, those who receive the drugs are sometimes not apprehended.  Both organisations have a mandate to wipe out drug dealers.  To date, because of the lack of clearly defined guidelines, each group is working to its own agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that the Customs officials see it as their function to confiscate illegal substances while the Garda drug squad must trace the footsteps of smugglers past the point of entry to establish the identity and operating bases of drug barons.  The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance must sort out this farcical situation.  There is evidence <Col N="123" /> that Ireland is becoming a major drug smuggling area since the dismantling of European customs frontiers under the Single European Act.  The present confusion a very serious issue and the <Col N="124" /> Government must resolve it as a matter of urgency.</P>
