      <P>I have notice from Senator Farrelly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The failure of the Minister for the Environment to approve a taxi rank for the town of Navan to facilitate the large number of hackney drivers working in the town and to alleviate traffic congestion.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed that Items 1 and 2 be taken together for the purpose of debate.  I suggest 20 minutes for spokespersons and 15 minutes thereafter and that the Minister be called to conclude not later than 5.45 p.m.  Item 24 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House allocate time either today or tomorrow to allow Senators to express the genuine concerns of the public <Col N="642" /> about the approach and powers of agencies dealing with child abuse?  Could he also ask the Minister for Health to indicate when it is planned to fully implement the Child Care Act and the recommendations of the report on the Kilkenny incest case?  The public needs to be assured that similar cases do not occur and that we are satisfied that known child abuse is reported and acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On my own behalf, I would wish for the opposite.  In politics we suffer from the dog muzzling syndrome. We saw this some years ago when, after somebody was savaged by a rottweiler, we introduced legislation within a month requiring muzzles to be put on dogs in public places.  That requirement has gone the way of dog licences and radio licences.</P>
      <P>It would not be helpful to have a debate on this issue.  There are platforms of reports on how to deal with it and the question is about the implementation of the reports.  The implementation of the Child Care Act is critically important and should be carried out. What is happening at present is that there are serious problems at school level and at local level.  The issue will not be helped by discussions in this House.  I feel in my heart and soul that it will just provide the opportunity for people to stand up and do some crawthumping. This is an issue that must be dealt with.  The Child Care Act is the first way forward and it should be implemented.  We should not have a debate on this; it does not get us anywhere and it removes pressure for legislation to deal with it properly.  I would prefer to deal with the problem legislatively rather than discursively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past month or so politics has been demeaned and diminished by accusations and rows with right and certainty expressed on all sides.  There is genuine confusion among Members of the Oireachtas as well as among the public as to standards in politics and what is ethical, correct and permissable. Until we set the required standards it is <Col N="643" /> not helpful to have politicians and their families dragged through the mud by way of allegation and raising such issues for debate.  I do not think the required standards will be achieved by the ethics Bill.  We should follow the example of the House of Commons and set up a joint committee to look at ethics and standards in public life in order to set guidelines to people inside and outside the House who seem confused as to what it is they should or should not do. I ask the Leader of the House to take that on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Cathaoirleach would wish to hear it said that we greatly admired the contributions made by Senator Norris and Senator Wilson at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation last week.  Both Senators reflected very well on this House and they brought the mood of the House to bear on that forum.  We hope it will be successful but we owe the Senators a debt of gratitude for reflecting in a positive way what has been said in debates here during the past year.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Neville's request.  I do not seek to discuss the particular case but to discuss the lessons that can be learned from several cases which have occurred during the past couple of years.  It would be useful for us to discuss this matter in a constructive and sensitive way.</P>
      <P>With regard to ethics, it is people who do not conduct themselves properly who diminish the political process rather than those who bring these matters to public light.  That distinction must be made.  However, I accept the point about ethics.  The ethics Bill currently before the Dáil has more to do with disclosure of interests than with ethics which is a much broader subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if time could be provided to discuss the implications and effects of the British criminal justice public order Bill which has gone through the House of Commons and the House of Lords and <Col N="644" /> is due for royal assent.  I raise this because of the influx of new age travellers to west Cork, which is causing great strain on the services in the area.  This matter needs to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who said that there is not much point discussing particular cases in terms of the Child Care Act.  Regarding the implementation of this Act, not only is the flesh weak but the spirit is very weak.  It has been a shocking week when those with authority refused to take responsibility and those who have responsibility apparently have little authority to do anything.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to find out, from whomever will take responsibility for the question &mdash; and to avoid asking a colleague in the House of Commons to ask it &mdash; if there are any guidelines for those employing a person who is accused and suspected of paedophilia regarding access to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if he has any plans for a debate on the North, which was requested last week.  I am particularly interested in a debate on the Foyle Fishery Commission.  At present, we are considering the establishment of a number of cross-Border institutions. However, before they are modelled on the Foyle Fishery Commission, I ask the Leader of the House for a debate on the success of the structures involved and if they could be improved.  It would be a useful contribution if we could examine the structure of the commission from the day it was formed until now.  This would help to allay the fears of those who are concerned about the political connotations of cross-Border institutions. It would serve a useful purpose if the Leader of the House provided an opportunity to debate this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I previously asked for a debate on the McKinsey report and the threatened loss of approximately 3,000 jobs in the ESB.  It is important that we <Col N="645" /> have an opportunity to discuss this matter as it affects the whole country.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Neville's request, he is seeking the full implementation of the Child Care Act.  He also wants the implementation of the recommendations of the report on the Kilkenny incest case.  Senator O'Toole is anxious to avoid crawthumping; he is in grave danger of wearing out his craw when he raises some matters on occasions.  It is essential that a matter of this nature is discussed in the House.  It is not good enough for somebody to try to denigrate an important request.  This issue is causing genuine concern among the public.</P>
      <P>I note we are seeking the establishment of a similar committee to the Nolan committee which is investigating the &ldquo;sleaze factor&rdquo; in the House of Commons.  In 1895 the House of Commons set up a similar committee; a similar body is set up every few years and the last report dates from 1964.  Nevertheless, if we require a similar committee I would not object to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I again ask the Leader if he can indicate to the House when the Minister will bring forward amending legislation to the existing copyright Act. I raise this matter again today because of the recent seizure of almost £2 million worth of illegal tapes.  I compliment the authorities on their action.  There is great concern among disco and hotel owners and people who provide live and recorded entertainment about the demands made on them without any appeals system &mdash; they must either pay up or close down.  That is not good enough.  This legislation must be brought forward on those two fronts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully agree with my colleague, Senator O'Toole, as I do not see how a debate in this House on the issue of responsibility for children would be damaging.  It might be useful in monitoring the implementation of the <Col N="646" /> Child Care Act.  The House will recall that in a previous session we had a full debate on the then Child Care Bill and at the last minute we persuaded the Minister to include amendments from this House, in particular, the one I tabled which sought the implementation of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> provision which was accepted.</P>
      <P>I do not think that anything is being done practically to implement this legislation and, for that reason, this House would have a particular interest in having a debate to exert further pressure and to monitor the implementation of serious measures in which this House played a role.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on copyright matters.  As I mentioned last week, I would like to extend it beyond broadcast and music copyright, important as they are, and I congratulate the Garda on the seizure of large quantities of counterfeit materials over the last few weeks.  The issue which concerns me and should concern us all is that we are being railroaded by the European Union into a position which is directly inimical to our interests as regards copyright.</P>
      <P>I will give one example, that is, the works of James Joyce which have emerged already from copyright.  I have a book being published next week and we now have the absurd situation where an artist of international reputation, such as James Joyce, emerges from copyright and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;people publish material.  Are they then to be told that the works are to be put back into copyright and everything has to be renegotiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a principle under international law by which retrospective legislation is anathema &mdash; the only example I can recall is the legislation which established the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.  It is absurd that a writer emerges from copyright and at <Col N="647" /> the behest of the Europeans we have to put him back in.  What happens to all the books?  Are we reinventing a kind of literary limbo to satisfy the grandchildren of our artists and writers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the implementation of the Child Care Act, it needs to be stated that its time scale and plan have been clearly identified by the Minister for Health.  Money has been allocated to health boards to implement certain parts of the Child Care Act and a sizeable number of staff is being recruited.  A simplistic knee-jerk reaction is not what is needed; there is a time scale and it needs to be carried out carefully.  Properly trained staff need to be recruited and this is being done; it has been agreed by the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Senator Norris will have a copy of his new book for everyone in the Seanad.  I concur with his request for a debate on copyright legislation.  I made the point last week about the serious situation in which the music industry finds itself and I call for an amendment to be made to legislation that gives the law some strength.  It is appalling to see how outdated <Col N="648" /> the fines are in relation to recent events.  Hundreds of people in the music business are in a difficult position.</P>

      <P>Would the Leader consent to a debate on the functioning of broadcasting in this country?  I congratulate &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on its tenth anniversary but will action be taken to prevent RTE advertising illegal operations?  For example, Senator Henry featured on a recent programme which also included a representative of the Irish Family Planning Association, who openly admitted that her organisation was referring people for abortions in contravention of the law.</P>

      <P>All sides of the House share the wish that the Child Care Act be implemented.  However, as Senator O'Sullivan has rightly stated, it is important to note the record of the Minister and the Government on this issue.  Some 370 extra staff have been employed and £20 million extra funding has been allocated.  The Minister is working to a set agenda to ensure the best possible staff and infrastructure are put in place.  With permanent extra funding being made available, the agenda to which he is adhering will bring the provisions in the Act into operation, as is the wish of everyone in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994, will be before us in the near future and Senators will be able to make their views known then.  Senator McGowan mentioned the Foyle Fisheries Commission and I am sure the Whips will find an opportunity to discuss that this session.  Senator Finneran and others mentioned copyright and I will communicate their views to the relevant <Col N="650" /> Minister.  I will try to obtain the information sought by Senator Calnan and Senator Henry.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the Seanad for this debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1994. This Bill amends the European Communities Acts, 1972 to 1993, and makes provisions of the Treaty of Accession of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway part of the domestic law of the State. Passage of this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas is a necessary step which will allow Ireland to ratify the Accession Treaty.  All member states of the European Union and all accession countries have undertaken to complete <Col N="651" /> their ratification procedures by 31 December 1994 at the latest.  I am also pleased to be able to speak on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs' &mdash;<i>The Enlargement of the European Union.</i></P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, referenda will be held in all four accession countries to decide on membership of the EU.  To date two referenda have been held &mdash; in Austria on 12 June and in Finland on 16 October.  On both occasions the people of these two countries decided to vote in favour of membership of the EU.  May I say at the outset that I welcome the results of the referenda in Austria and Finland.  Both countries will be very welcome additions to the European Union.</P>
      <P>On 13 November in Sweden and on 28 November in Norway the remaining two referenda will be held.  We will await the outcome of these referenda with great interest.  While it is up to the people of Sweden and Norway to decide for themselves on membership of the European Union, it is true to say that all four accession countries will be very welcome additions to the European Union.</P>
      <P>The negotiations on the enlargement of the European Union began in February 1993 for three of the applicant countries &mdash; Austria, Sweden and Finland &mdash; and in April 1993 for Norway.  After a relatively short period of approximately one year the negotiations were brought to a successful conclusion.  The Accession Treaty was signed in Corfu last June.  With ratification by all signatories due by the end of this year, accessions are due to take place on 1 January 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The completion of the accession negotiations in such a relatively short period of time reflected the already existing close relations between these four EFTA countries and the European Union.  Before negotiations opened on accession, the European Economic Area Agreement was in place.  The EEA agreement allowed the four applicant <Col N="652" /> countries to participate in the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The fact that the European Economic Area had been agreed paved the way for this round of enlargement.  It allowed the negotiations to concentrate on the issues not covered by the EEA Agreement.  This is not to say that the negotiations were without any difficulty. However, a large body of work that otherwise would have been part of the negotiation was resolved.  As a result, attention could, and did, focus in these negotiations on more defined issues from the start than was possible in previous negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Government approached this round of negotiations for membership of the European Union from the start very positively.  From the outset of the negotiations the Government welcomed the prospect of accession by member states of EFTA.  These are countries with which Ireland already has close relations.  It shares with them a similarity of outlook on a range of international issues.</P>
    <P>The Government was of the view with regard to this round of enlargement that what is good for the development of the Union was good for Ireland.  The Commission opinions on the applications for membership preceded the opening of formal negotiations.  The opinions had pointed to the strengthening of the Union in various areas of its activity that could be expected from accession by advanced industrialised economies of the EFTA type.</P>
    <P>The four EFTA applicants to the Union also have a lot to offer the Union.  All four countries have long democratic traditions, a refined respect for human rights, an advanced level of social protection and high environmental standards.  The Nordic countries, in particular, have a system of openness in Government and the contributions they will make to the ongoing debate in the European Union on this issue will be very welcome.</P>
    <P>As the negotiations progressed it was clear that within the Union the interests of the applicant countries and Ireland <Col N="653" /> would coincide on a number of issues. For example, all the applicant countries have specific agricultural and regional concerns, a range of which overlap with ours.  This will have its own implications for the continuation and development of agricultural and regional policies within the European Union.</P>
    <P>While the three Nordic accession countries have a large land mass, all four accession countries have relatively small populations.  Again, in the forthcoming debate on the need to adapt the European Union's institutions to cope with a membership of over 20, the accession countries' interests and ours will overlap in certain key areas.</P>
    <P>All four accession countries have played a significant role in the development of policies designed to enhance the peaceful settlement of international disputes.  We also share with the accession countries a similarity of outlook on a range of international issues.</P>
    <P>All these factors will have a bearing on discussions and negotiations that will shape the European Union and its relationship with the world in the years to come.  The most contentious part of the negotiations, from the point of view of the European Union, involved the difficulty of reaching a decision within the Union concerning the institutional adjustments required to accommodate this round of enlargement.</P>
    <P>After lengthy discussion, a linear transposition of weighted voting at Council was agreed.  This will allow the blocking minority to move after accession from 23 votes to 27.  In addition, the member states agreed to a delaying mechanism when it was clear that at least 23 votes were opposed to a proposal.  A solution must be found, or a blocking minority of 27 must emerge within a reasonable time, otherwise the measures on the table can be adopted.</P>
    <P>The basis for a solution to the deadlock in the Council over the weighted voting issue emerged following discussions at the informal Foreign Ministers meeting at Ioannina in Greece last March.  The agreement paved the way to <Col N="654" /> the successful conclusion of the negotiations. The Ministers also agreed that the question of the reform of the institutions, including the weighting of votes and the threshold of the qualified majority in the Council, would be examined during the conference of the representatives of the governments of the member states which will be convened in 1996.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted both by the accession countries and the member states of the European Union that the outcome of the negotiations was a good one.  A balance was struck between the legitimate needs of the applicants on the one hand and the need for the Union to ensure uniform application of its laws on the other.  Where specific national concerns were raised, the Union showed flexibility without undermining in any way the integrity of its legal system. Where specific national needs were raised, the Union responded imaginatively. One example of the imaginative response of the Union to specific national needs was in the creation of a new objective six region, based on low population density, which brought a large portion of the northern part of the Nordic countries within the ambit of regional policy.  Initiatives by the Union in this and other areas went far in persuading the peoples of Austria and Finland to vote in favour of European Union membership.</P>
    <P>The Government was aware from the start that if Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway decided to join the European Union, the shape of that Union would become different.  On the assumption that all will join, the land mass of the Union will increase by more than 1.2 million square kilometres to 3,560,000 square kilometres.  For the first time the Union will include an area of the Arctic Circle and the borders of the Union will stretch as far east as Russia. The population of the Union will increase by more than 25 million people to a total of 369 million people.</P>
    <P>Now that a successful end to this round of accessions is in sight, the attention of the Union will focus on other <Col N="655" /> possible enlargements which will further change the shape of the Union.  In the meantime, the strengthening of the Community's relations with its neighbours to the south and east is an essential element in promoting greater European prosperity and stability.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate here to acknowledge the report, <i>The Enlargement of the European Union</i>, prepared by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  This report is a substantial contribution to the important debate on the implications for the Union and for Ireland of the enlargement of the European Union to encompass 20 and more member states.  The report examines the issues which will face the Union in the institutional, budgetary and political spheres.  Many questions are raised about the implications for both Ireland and the Union of future enlargement. While the report acknowledges that there will be challenges ahead, it also refers to the opportunities both for the Union and for Ireland which will accrue from future enlargements.  I welcome this report and I welcome the opportunity presented by this debate to address some of the issues which will face Ireland and the Union in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Both before and after the negotiations with the EFTA countries, the European Union received applications to join from other countries in Europe. The longest standing application to join the European Union is that made by Turkey.  In 1989 the Commission opinion on Turkey's application recommended that for economic and political reasons the time was not ripe to begin accession negotiations.  Since then, the European Union and Turkey have been deepening their relations within the framework of the association agreements. Switzerland's application to join was put on hold following the rejection of the EEA Agreement in December 1992.  At the European Council in Corfu last June it was agreed that the next phase of enlargement will involve Cyprus and Malta.  The Commission <Col N="656" /> opinion on the applications to join the European Union made by Cyprus and Malta recommended that negotiations could commence once certain political developments in Cyprus and economic developments in Malta were achieved.</P>
    <P>The countries of central and eastern Europe will be the focus of much attention within the European Union in the years to come.  To date, two of the countries of central and eastern Europe, Poland and Hungary, have already made applications to join the European Union.  Applications from other central and eastern European states are expected.  The applications both received and pending to join the European Union pose a variety of challenges to the Union.  Through the negotiation of Association Agreements the European Union has responded positively to the desire of the central and eastern European countries for closer integration with the European Union. These agreements aim to establish close and lasting relations between the parties. The European agreements which have now been negotiated with Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania and Bulgaria recognise the aspiration of these countries to membership of the European Union.  It is expected that Europe agreements will be negotiated in the near future with the Baltic States and with Slovenia.</P>
    <P>These Europe agreements are wide ranging.  However, the central and east European states have argued that they are not sufficient in themselves to meet their desire for integration with the European Union.  In recognition of this, the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 and Corfu European Council Conclusions last June developed and added to the provisions of these agreements. In Copenhagen, the European Council established that countries could become members of the European Union as soon as they were able to fulfil the relevant obligations.</P>
    <P>In Corfu, the European Council asked the Presidency and the Commission to report to the Essen European <Col N="657" /> Council in December on the strategy to be followed with a view to preparing for accession.  It was expected in Corfu that the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference would create the institutional conditions required for future enlargement to the East.  In the meantime, the European Union is preparing its approach to the future accession of the associated countries. Discussion on this issue is expected to be a major issue at the European Council in Essen next month.</P>
    <P>Among the issues under discussion is the way the countries of central and eastern Europe can be associated more closely with all three pillars of the Union's activity.  Such association includes the holding of advisory meetings between the Council of Ministers of the countries of central and eastern Europe on matters of common interest. Agreement has been reached to associate the countries of central and eastern Europe with the common foreign and security policy and consultations are taking place to work out the modalities to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The first multilateral meeting of European Union Foreign Ministers, the Commission and their counterparts from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia took place on the occasion of the General Affairs Council of 31 October 1994, which was, of course, a bank holiday in Ireland.  The meeting took place within the framework of a structured dialogue with the countries of central and eastern Europe and included joint discussions of a number of common, foreign and security policy topics. In addition, Justice and Home Affairs Ministers from the two sides have met informally in Berlin in September and discussed increased co-operation in combating drugs and organised crime in Europe.  Further consideration is to be given to co-operation in the areas identified at the Berlin meeting.  Ministers for Finance, the Internal Market and Environment have also met recently. The preparation of central and eastern European countries for accession will be one of the principal external issues facing <Col N="658" /> the European Union for the remainder of the decade.</P>
    <P>The approach Ireland has taken to such developments is to welcome the openness to enlargement reflected in the Conclusions of the Copenhagen and Corfu European Councils.  We have recognised that the prosperity and the stability of Europe as a whole would be influenced by the progress made towards political and economic reform in central and eastern Europe.  In our view, it is right that these countries should have confidence in the European Union and in our willingness to support the political and economic reform process.</P>
    <P>Enlargement to the East is a challenge to Ireland and the European Union.  The policy implications of the eastern enlargement will be assessed in the context of preparation for the Government White Paper on foreign policy and the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  The parameters within which we will continue to examine the issues will be the need to maintain both the character of the Union and a Union which operates effectively.  We must, therefore, proceed at a realistic pace.  A balance must be struck between the interests of the applicants and the need for a functioning and effective Union.</P>
    <P>At the same time as the Union is developing its relations with countries to the East, new opportunities for Ireland will be created which will allow us to develop our bilateral relations with these countries.  These new opportunities can be explored and our existing relations can be developed even further.</P>
    <P>The report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs correctly draws attention to this major issue on the international agenda.  I will look forward to hearing in this debate the views of Senators on this important area which will be the focus of much attention within the Union and indeed, in Ireland, in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time I would like to express the thanks of my party and all the Members of this House to the <Col N="659" /> Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs who published the report on <i>The Enlargement of the European Union.</i>  It is comprehensive and informative and is presented in a manner which enables the reader to obtain points of particular importance.  All the Members of the committee, together with those who assisted in the preparation of this report and the people who attended the deliberations of the committee and made contributions, deserve the thanks of this House.  It is a pleasure to obtain such an important document with an excellent index attached.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of Irish people will go along with the view expressed in this report that the joint committee believes that the increase of the European Union from 12 to 16 members will be of great benefit to Europe.  In fact, I believe Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will add to the strength of the economic, social and cultural life of the European Union.</P>
      <P>In the past, Ireland has favoured a united approach to Europe and has been to the forefront in supporting the ideal of European union.  Our approach to having a fully united Europe as distinct from a two-speed policy Europe has been the correct one.  A two-speed policy would be divisive and particularly unhelpful to small member states such as our own.</P>
      <P>Thinking in government circles in France and Germany appears to favour different levels of participation in some European structures.  In fact, in September this year a grouping of the Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union in Germany advocated a new treaty.  Such a proposal would allow some countries to proceed towards monetary union while others may or may not be included.  At the time this proposal was made, the French Prime Minister spoke of the creation of a three-speed Europe with France and Germany being alone in the fast lane. This would be unhelpful and totally unsatisfactory for countries like Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> The fact that the British Prime Minister has rejected such calls and has clearly stated that a two-tier Europe is both unacceptable and out of the question is a welcome development.  Ireland must be careful that a European fast lane including Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain does not develop.</P>
    <P>Since the passing of the Single European Act and the establishment of the Delors Committee on Economic and Monetary Union, it is regrettable that there has not been a more positive movement towards a single European currency.  The turmoil in European Union currencies that ended in the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism created tensions and fears which still exist among many member states.  The general public is also worried about interest rates rising to levels at which people are unable to cope with repayments.  A single currency would obviously create tight discipline as regards the monetary policy of all governments.  Doubtless, it would create an enormous challenge for small countries, especially Ireland &mdash; an island member state on the edge of Europe. Nevertheless the advantages of a single European currency would appear to far outweigh the disadvantages.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the present enlargement with the accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden, it will be essential to take stock of exactly where Europe is heading. Turkey applied for membership as far back as April 1987.  Cyprus and Malta both applied for membership in July 1990 while Hungary and Poland applied in April 1994.  In a report entitled <i>The European Community: The Challenge of Enlargement</i>, published in 1992, Dr. Wallace H. Malisky stated categorically that the European Community was going to be enlarged.  Quite a number of other East European nations are also anxious to join the European Union. The proposed extension to 16 members will take a lengthy period of time to cope with both in administrative and legal terms.  As many as nine or ten <Col N="661" /> extra countries are seeking to join the EU.</P>
    <P>The report before the House welcomes the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway.  The joint committee supports the continuation of the enlargement process, and I go along with this approach.  It is important for the EU to take stock at this time.  The appointment of the new President of the European Commission, following the completion of Jacques Delors' term of office, led to a considerable amount of public dissatisfaction.  This is a key position and the existing method of appointment leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the allocation of portfolios by the President of the Commission is unsatisfactory.  While the European Parliament has the right to vote on the Commission, its vote is nevertheless confined to either acceptance or rejection of the Commission as a whole.  In the event of the European Parliament being unhappy about the appointment of one Commissioner, it is faced with the prospect of rejecting the entire Commission or accepting an individual Commissioner about whom it may be unhappy.</P>
    <P>Members of this Commission will make key policy decisions relating to employment and tax policy, transport policy throughout Europe and energy and conservation policy.  Members of the European Parliament who may object to an individual Commissioner will be unable to express their democratic right to vote against that Commissioner without rejecting the full Commission as recommended by the President.  This matter must be addressed in the public interest at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The report deals with the enlargement of the European Union.  At present with 12 member states the level of bureaucracy has grown; it has continued to mushroom and expand.  It is essential that such bureaucracy is controlled. We have seen the dismantling of barriers and the clearing of customs controls at points of entry to countries. <Col N="662" /> However, the laws of the EU and its day to day interference in the lives of citizens must be curtailed and remedied. Standardisation and compartmentalisation appear to be the order of the day in the EU.  The outflow of laws and regulations emanating from the EU seem to be increasing.  That is something which must be looked at.</P>
    <P>A worrying aspect of the EU as it exists at present is its failure to tackle serious environmental issues which arise.  While the environment, the necessity for a clean water supply and clean air to ensure the good health of the citizens of the EU may be addressed in some fashion, it is not sufficiently addressed and requires a greater degree of urgency than is apparent at present.</P>
    <P>Approximately 18 million people are unemployed in the EU.  Can jobs be found for some of these people?  Can that huge number be provided with worthwhile employment?  Will the number remain static or is it likely to increase?  This is a startling figure and it is alarming to see so many people unable to obtain employment.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we are witnessing increasing depopulation in rural areas and in small villages and towns.  The situation is similar in France, Spain, Italy and other countries with large agricultural bases.  Rural depopulation is not attracting sufficient urgent attention and the remedies it requires.  If this trend continues, it bodes ill for the future of those living in such countries. Ireland is an agricultural country and a primary producer of agricultural produce.  Existing trends in agriculture are a cause of concern for people in Ireland.  I hope the new Parliament will seek answers to this continuing problem.</P>
    <P>I agree with most of what is in the report.  The Minister spoke about the accession of Malta and Cyprus which is being examined at this time.  Will he tell us what is the situation in regard to Turkey and some of the eastern European countries?</P>
    <P>I support the report and the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Col N="663" />
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with two items &mdash; the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs: <i>The Enlargement of the European</i> Union and the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1994, a technical Bill which makes legal provisions for the accession of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. I am pleased that the Bill is before the House today.  I am pleased also that we are to debate the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs regarding enlargement of the European Union.  That report represents another major step in providing information about the ramifications of enlargement, about the problems and benefits that can accrue from the accession of the four EFTA States and, subsequently, the possibility of the accession of the increasing number of other states which are attempting to join the EU.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I would like to pay tribute in this House to Professor Brigid Laffan from UCD who did a tremendous amount of work on behalf of the committee.  I compliment her on the research and deliberation she put into her draft report and on the quality of the material she presented to the committee which was of excellent value. I also wish to compliment Mr. Barrington and Mr. Fahey, Assistant Secretaries at the Department of Foreign Affairs, who took part in the deliberations when we had briefings and submissions. The Institute of European Affairs played a major part in the report as did the ambassadors of States wishing to become members of the EU.  Apart from the ambassadors, parliamentary delegations participated and their input into this report was of inestimable value.</P>
      <P>An enlarged EU will create its own problems but the four countries joining now will create less of a problem than many others.  They are expected to be net contributors to the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the relevant referenda in both Austria and Finland have taken place and produced a positive <Col N="664" /> result.  It is important that one country from the centre of Europe and another from the periphery of Europe have voted to accede to the European Union. This gives a balance as to the opinions of people in those two countries as to where we are or the direction in which they believe Europe should go.  I sincerely hope that within the next few weeks Sweden and Norway will also agree to accede to the European Union. In the case of Norway the decision is expected to be very close.</P>
    <P>It is important that of the four countries which are in the process of joining the European Union, three have neutrality policies similar to, but not the same as ours.  It is important to realise that, with further accessions, more countries which are not involved in NATO will be involved in the EU.  The question of involvement with NATO or with Western European Union will be of major importance in the debate that will take place between now and 1996 because we will have to analyse what we mean by a defence policy, what we mean by neutrality and what we desire from the European Union in these areas.  As a result of the advertisements in the papers seeking submissions on the White Paper on foreign policy, a broadly based group of suggestions will be obtained from outside the Oireachtas, including those from groups and individuals who are interested in the evolution of European and foreign policy over the next decade.  This is the first opportunity people will have to give their opinions as to what they consider should be out foreign policy, particularly with regard to the problems which could arise in relation to neutrality and defence within the European framework.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting a short time ago of the Western European Union as an observer.  It was the first occasion on which Ireland had observers at a Western European Union meeting since we obtained observer status following the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. There are huge conflicts of opinion and a profundity of confusion within the <Col N="665" /> existing membership of the Western European Union as to what the organisation is about, what the nature of the relationship between the Western European Union and NATO is or should be, and how this problem should be addressed.  The meeting was attended by many countries seeking membership of the EU and there were large delegations from Russia and other countries of the former USSR.</P>
    <P>The debate on neutrality and defence will be of major importance over the next few years.  The result of the debate is uncertain, but I appeal to anybody who has an interest in our foreign policy to make a submission, either verbally or in writing, and give the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Government the benefit of their opinions.  It is public opinion, which is afterwards expressed through legislation, that will materially change the situation, both within the country and with regard to foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>The four states who are seeking membership of the EU at present, two of which have already held referenda, are probably easy for us to accept in that they will be net contributors.  There are and will be other applicants which will not be net contributors and this is the crux of the matter.  Are we prepared to enlarge the EU for the benefit of countries which would not be net contributors given that, at present, we ourselves are not net contributors?  It would mean that the input from the EU to us would be diminished.  Is our economy strong enough to accept this and to take it into account when we decide on the inclusion of any applicant country to the EU?</P>
    <P>Turkey's membership of the EU has not yet been accepted, although its application was submitted in 1987.  Turkey is a country of major importance in Europe, and being on the periphery of Europe and the Near East, its application must be considered carefully.  It has been suggested in the past that because of the problems of civil and social rights in Turkey it may not be a country which could be accepted into <Col N="666" /> the EU.  It is very easy to say that Turkey is the only one with civil rights problems.  However, we must look at Turkey in particular as it has always been a major power in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the successful outcome of the negotiations with the four EFTA countries, the sensitive issues were ones which were also important to us &mdash; agriculture, peripherality of certain areas, regional policy and the institutions of government.  I accept what Senator Enright said, that we do not want a build up of institutions which do not work.  There is no doubt that we have been more successful in Europe in creating unemployment than anything else.  I do not like saying that but it is a fact.  Unemployment is the biggest growth industry in Europe which results in another great growth industry &mdash; the support system for those who are unemployed. We must address unemployment and the elimination of the support system.  The only way to eliminate the support system, which is costing Europe so much, is to create employment.  The main debate has to be about the provision of acceptable jobs for people within the EU.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that these four countries will strengthen the trading element of the EU.  That is of extreme importance in our search for a European economic area which is self sustaining and expansionary in terms of the creation of jobs and an ambience where people can live in an environmentally friendly situation.  These four potential accession countries have a much better record in environmental matters than some of the countries which have applied to join.  We have to be as sensitive in the environmental area as in the employment area.</P>
    <P>There are no real adjustment problems at present with these four countries. They have a reasonable similarity of views in terms of social, trading and foreign policies.  Generally speaking, they would be acceptable as members of any club within Europe.</P>
    <P>We also have the problem of the accession of the former Communist <Col N="667" /> states.  If we are to have an integrated Europe we must take all these states into account.  Enormous economic and environmental problems were created in those countries by running down agriculture, industry and so on.  The cost of bringing them up to even minimal levels of economic, social or environmental viability would be enormous.</P>
    <P>The joint committee welcomed the decision of the European Council in Corfu to have a report drafted on how the Union can work with the countries of central and eastern Europe to prepare a strategy.  The strategy for accession of these countries will be an area of tremendous problems and will take much longer to achieve than that of Austria, Finland and Norway.</P>
    <P>The criteria for membership are: appropriate and compatible political systems, functioning market economy and an acceptance of the acquis.  We will have to have to determine where we stand on the acquis between now and 1996, which is not too far away.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the committee on the social dimension of the EU are of paramount importance.  It recommends that in any future enlargement there must be insistence on complete adherence by the applicant states to the provisions of the Social Chapter of the Treaty on European Union.  My difficulty with that is that certain member states, in particular Great Britain, do not adhere to that chapter.  If the Union includes a very important member state which does not adhere to the provisions of the Social Chapter, how can we then insist, as suggested, that applicant states must adhere to them?  There is a dichotomy of opinion.  Why should somebody who does not adhere to something suggest that somebody else must adhere to it?  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The debate on foreign policy and enlargement will be a developing one.  It is important that more and more debates on foreign policy matters should come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Seanad spent an admirable amount of time over the years since <Col N="668" /> the time of the joint committee on secondary legislation in debating at least the results of all the committee's decisions and reports.  We are now discussing the enlargement of the EU.</P>
    <P>It is the first time that a committee report went before the Dáil before it came to the Seanad.  I am not saying whether that is good or bad but, up to now, it generally came to the Seanad first and in many cases these reports were not even addressed in the Dáil.  I hope that the Dáil and Seanad will in future give as much time as possible to the reports of the committees.  Otherwise, these reports can be shelved or left in libraries.  They will be used by academics but if they are not debated they will not be much use in informing the public about what is happening.</P>
    <P>The institutional issues to which Senator Enright referred are important if we are to have a coherent EU which will give the people what they demand. It is not doing that at present.  They say that macro economically we are doing well but I cannot tell that to someone in Kilkenny, Laois or elsewhere who has no job.  We say to them that we are supporting them with the social welfare system but 99 per cent of people receiving social welfare would rather have a job. If we are going to have a strong Europe we must ensure that those who want to work &mdash; the majority of people &mdash; can get work which is not of a &ldquo;make work&rdquo; nature but genuine work from which they can get satisfaction.  That would be of fantastic benefit, not alone to Ireland but to the European Union.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a major part to play in the evolution of the European Union.  Even though we are a very small nation, we have played an important part in the evolution of many of the objectives of the United Nations and international policy.  We are listened to because we have not been part of any major power block which has tried to impose its wishes on others.  We have played our part in the international community and have been important in highlighting problems.  This is an important part of the debate on the European Union.  I <Col N="669" /> reiterate that there is now an opportunity for people to address themselves to Irish foreign policy decision making by sending recommendations to the Foreign Affairs Committee.  These will be addressed in the White Paper which will be presented within the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not help smiling when listening to Senator Lanigan.  I agree virtually entirely with what he said but I was thinking of the response in Mayfield or Gurranebraher this week to the canvasser's assurance that, macro-economically, we are doing very well.  I cannot see many votes being won by that.  I agree with the Senator's use of that concept to indicate how distant from reality are many of the spokespersons and much of the rhetoric at European Union level and perhaps at home.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste played his cards close to his chest which is perfectly reasonable in current circumstances.  I agree with Senators Enright and Lanigan that this is an excellent report.  It bears the impress of the clarity and coherence one has come to expect from Professor Brigid Laffan.  I was glad to hear the tribute paid to her role in formulating the report.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report partly because the conclusions on the whole are very balanced.  It is stated that:</P>
      <P>It is in the Union's interest that the transition process in the east is successful. The common objective must be to integrate the former communist states into a continental wide system that ensures stability and security.</P>
      <P>I am sure nobody would take exception to that but I would add that it should happen reasonably rapidly.  There is uncertainty about the time scale.  That is what will determine how genuine the Union is about the rhetoric of integration which, of course, nobody opposes in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little worried about paragraph 10.4.  I do not know who can explain the thinking behind this paragraph because <Col N="670" /> it does not come from anything in the report.  It is one of the few <i>non sequiturs.</i> It states:</P>
    <P>in any future enlargement, there must be insistence on complete adherence by the applicant States to the provisions of the Social Chapter of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to that and drew attention to Britain's opting out.  I am a strong supporter of the Social Chapter.  I believe that Britain's opting out and noises in that direction by some of our own employers are misguided and short sighted.</P>
    <P>I am not challenging the ethos of the Social Chapter or the thinking behind it. However, if the very weak economies of eastern Europe are to be asked immediately to accept or adopt complete adherence to the provisions of the Social Chapter I can see grave difficulties arising in terms of their budgets and public finances.  I would like to hear some teasing out of the thinking behind that paragraph from a competent person who can provide an explanation of what the committee has in mind.</P>
    <P>This point is not, to the best of my recollection, discussed anywhere else in the report, nor does it arise from a discussion or analysis in the report of the likely socio-economic consequences of membership of the eastern states.  I could visualise a situation where there would be a graduated integration by the eastern European states into the Social Chapter as their economies strengthened. However, as it stands it is a very bald statement and I would like to know exactly the thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the last paragraph of the report on page 70 which states:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee recommends that the Government should deepen political and economic ties with Central and Eastern Europe and should take specific measures to alert Government agencies and the private sector of the mutually beneficial economic opportunities...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> I would not want it to stop there.  We have a major opportunity to establish close and constructive ties with all the eastern European states.</P>
    <P>We enjoy an extraordinary high standing among these States.  This is partly because they admire our political success in having established political democracy in this country while they, for the most part, failed to do, having achieved their independence at about the same time.  We take this achievement for granted but they know from sad experience that it is difficult to achieve.  In my view we do not adequately value our achievement.</P>
    <P>While we may criticise individual politicians &mdash; no doubt justifiably at times &mdash; the success of the political process in this country in sustaining parliamentary democracy is something they value very highly.  They are anxious to know how we did it.  As we do not reflect very much on such issues we may actually have to think systematically about how we did it in order to be of assistance to them.</P>
    <P>They regard us as being a little more economically successful than is objectively the case but we will not haggle over that at the moment.  One of my few criticisms of the report is that it lacks a recognition of the importance of cultural factors.  I hope I will not sound excessively esoteric in talking about cultural factors.  They are quite relevant to politics and to the development of fruitful relations between ourselves and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>In a range of areas we have an opportunity to make an impact on the thinking of eastern Europeans, not least through their admiration for our cultural achievements and specifically in terms of relationships between educational institutions at all levels in this country and eastern Europe.  Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien &mdash; whose name is likely to be invoked elsewhere in the course of the day &mdash; among her many other contributions to Irish public life wrote excellent reports on the TEMPUS exchange scheme and on the <Col N="672" /> possibilities for closer contact between educational institutions.  I do not believe we have acted on those reports which were published a few years ago.</P>
    <P>There is scope for closer cohesion between Government thinking, public policy thinking in this country and educational institutions in advancing general Irish interest in countries such as these.  We should identify young students in Ireland to travel to eastern Europe and others to travel here in an effort to build up the latent fund of goodwill among future leaders in these countries.</P>
    <P>Almost all young eastern European people who come to Ireland like it very much.  They might not like it quite as much if they had to live here all the time but that is a different matter.  They go back with a very positive attitude towards Ireland.  Instead of adopting a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude to such matters, as we do at present, there should be a greater attempt at the development of coherent relations, the identification of people whom we would like to invite to Ireland and the fostering of closer contacts among the emerging leadership cadre in these countries.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons Hungary looks so positively on Ireland, for instance, is that the last Hungarian Ambassador is now in charge of Hungary's application to enter the EU and he returned to Hungary with a very positive attitude towards Ireland.  There are many opportunities which of course include political and economic aspects but they should not be confined to those areas because they all overlap.  I would like to see a little more thinking about the cultural dimension of our relation with eastern Europe as a mutually beneficial contribution towards the idea of European integration.</P>
    <P>The report, in paragraph 10.8, refers to the role of small states and the importance for Ireland to associate with other small states to ensure that the general role of small states in the EU is not damaged by the division that appears to be emerging to some extent between smaller and larger states and the pressures <Col N="673" /> that may emerge for institutional adaptation which would could reduce the role of small states in the institutions. The report states:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee recommends that Ireland should play a leading role in elaborating and ensuring the adoption of appropriate and effective mechanisms to protect the unique contribution of small member states.</P>
    <P>What is the unique contribution of small member states?  If I were German or French and did not want to be persuaded about the beautiful blue eyes of small member states, it would take more than a simple statement about our unique contribution to persuade me to continue to part with my tax money to sustain what the more ungenerous Germans or French might see as the welfare spongers in the European Union.  I do not see small states in that light but one hears such phrases used in parts of Germany by those who are querying more closely than heretofore what they are putting into the EU, what they are receiving and why they should continue to subsidise people who do not appear to make the same contribution that the Germans, in their self image, are making to European integration.</P>
    <P>We require more than rhetoric.  In the short term, objectively, small member states may not have much to contribute towards European union in political and economic terms although, practically, I think Ireland has contributed in political terms.  This is not a criticism of Ireland <i>qua</i> Ireland, it is a question of how we position ourselves in the general context of small states to impress bigger states with the value of our contribution.  This brings me back to culture.  Helmut Schmidt once said of us to Garret FitzGerald, when discussing what Ireland contributes and what it has done for the EU, that we could not expect to contribute anything economically, we cannot contribute much politically and we contribute nothing militarily; however, he said that the EU expected at least ideas from us and some sense of cultural style. <Col N="674" /> That is not an unreasonable expectation and we have the capacity to contribute both.</P>
    <P>I will not use this occasion to talk about the importance of the Irish language. Nílim ag trácht anois ar sheasamh na teanga ná ar a hionad sa tsochaí seo againne.  Táim ag déanamh trácht ar cheist i bhfad níos leithne, a bhaineann ní amháin le féiniúlacht na hÉireann, ach le féiniúlacht na hEorpa.  If there is not a European identity over and above the identity of the individual states it is very difficult to see why larger states, concerned solely with their material interests, should wish to make any sacrifices or what they perceive as sacrifices for smaller states.</P>
    <P>What if they were to adopt the attitude or mentality behind some of the phraseology in this report?  &ldquo;Small states must be compensated for their size as the larger states exercise more power in the system&rdquo;.  Why must small states be compensated for their size? We have moved from being compensated for peripherality to being compensated for size.  There is not much left for which we can be compensated.  I dislike the language of compensation.  It is far better to use positive language about contributions than negative language about compensation.</P>
    <P>By and large, the rhetoric in the report is positive: &ldquo;Ireland should take a leading role in identifying areas of common interest with the acceding countries...&rdquo; etc.  We have the potential to do that.  The more we think positively of ourselves and of what we can contribute rather than thinking defensively of what we can get out of it, the more we are likely to get out of it from now on. That is being opportunistic and utilitarian about the issue as well as feeling good about it; it is nice to be able to combine the two from time to time. There is scope to be more constructive and positive rather than falling back on what compensation we can get for the designs of the Almighty when He defined our borders &mdash; unless Hy Brassil or Atlantis rises in the Atlantic and we can suddenly become a large state in <Col N="675" /> which case, no doubt, we will seek compensation for something else.  The balance of the report is positive but there is an opportunity to make it more positive.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some general points in the report.  The report rejects the idea of fast lanes, slow lanes, two tiers and so forth.  I am not bothered about lanes. However, I am bothered about which lane we will be in if it comes to that. With an expanding union I do not think one can always go at the pace of the slowest member or even at the pace of those who would constitute 23 or 27 blocking votes.  It is up to ourselves to ensure that if lanes emerge &mdash; and there is sufficient indication of subterranean thinking in Germany in particular and quite close to the centres of Government to suggest that this item will return on the agenda if they are not satisfied with the way things progress over the next few years &mdash; we must have our house in order.  I deplore the contributions of Mr. Tietmeyer which are unhelpful to Ireland, to Europe and, indeed, to Germany.</P>
    <P>The report refers to a democratic deficit in the European Parliament.  Of course there is a democratic deficit in the European Parliament.  However, putting our hands on our hearts, would we say that the democratic deficit in the European Parliament is much greater than the democratic deficit in our own Parliament?</P>

      <P>How far have the Houses of the Oireachtas significantly influenced legislation in the last two or 20 or 70 years?  I am not suggesting the abolition of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They play an indispensible role in legitimising decisions taken, for the most part, elsewhere.  However, when we talk about democratic deficits let us not confine ourselves solely to deficits in Europe.  If we are genuine we might look a little closer to home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sentence in the report welcomes the accession of the Nordic countries <Col N="676" /> because of the openness and transparency of their governmental system.  I have complete confidence in the capacity of our institutions to resist any threat from that quarter.  The stamina that will be shown in sustaining our honourable traditions will see that threat off the playing field very quickly.</P>
    <P>Having expressed such slightly sceptical views, I welcome this report.  The positive attitude displayed towards how we ought to, as far as we can, take charge of our own destiny and the consideration of our potential contribution to Europe as distinct from what we can get out of it, are commendable changes in rhetoric.  Change in rhetoric is the beginning of change in perspective, if one says something often enough one might begin to believe it.</P>
    <P>There are threats, and we are all aware of them, to legitimate sectoral interests in the expansion to the east. However, there are also enormous opportunities.  We have the political skill to seize those opportunities.  We should never underrate our political skills in a European or other context.  However, if we also have the intellect, the imagination and the courage to reinforce those skills we could be entering very exciting decades in terms of Ireland's role in Europe.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  I welcome the report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Having taught history and geography in post-primary schools for a number of years any debate on the EU and Europe in general is of great interest to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A massive transformation in the geography of Europe has taken place since the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in the early 1950s, which was the forerunner to the present EU.  If we think of Europe stretching from the Arctic in the north to the Mediterranean in the south, from the Atlantic in the west and the Urals in the east, there have been some fantastic <Col N="677" /> changes since the establishment of that Community, one of which is the ending of the Cold War.  This leads to the point where Austria and Finland were positioned during that time.</P>
    <P>These two countries, which voted on 12 June and 16 October to join the EU, were buffer states.  Quite rightly, they had to be well maintained to avoid being swamped.  This could have happened in the 1950s, but definitely in the 1940s, if they had not been supported by the West, and particularly America.  It is a change to find that these countries can now independently join the European Union.</P>
    <P>Norway and Sweden, which go to the polls on 13 November and 28 November, may also join the EU, enlarging it to 16 members.  Originally, there were six members and three countries joined in 1973.  This is a second bite of the cherry for Norway because it voted against joining the EEC in 1973.  I welcome these countries into the EU because their cultures are similar to that of Ireland.  They have well developed economies and they stand out in terms of democratic principles.  They have great regard for civil and human rights.</P>
    <P>The lack of a single European currency is one of the biggest hindrances to and the source of the greatest division in the EU at present.  If one goes to Britain or the northern part of this country, one loses both ways in terms of money.  Previously, if one went from one to the other, one gained but now one loses both ways.  Thankfully, petrol stations and shops near the Border accept both currencies; this is a great way around the problem.  However, in overall terms and particularly for eastern European countries who seek to join the EU, the lack of a single European currency is a major hindrance. Currencies will continue to float up and down and this will cause great difficulties for economic development.</P>
    <P>Europe has always been a continent of many small countries.  There were some large countries &mdash; France, Italy and Spain &mdash; but it consisted mostly of <Col N="678" /> small countries, such as Liechtenstein, about which we may only hear when there is a World Cup game, San Marino, Andorra, Monaco, etc.  It makes it much easier for the people of Europe to have a regulated life if more borders are eliminated and there is free movement of people, goods and money from one area to another.  Countries would not be left adrift if there was a united states of Europe &mdash; perhaps modelled on the present day USA &mdash; rather than a situation where one small country has a tax code and people try to skip to another country to lodge money or whatever.</P>
    <P>If the four current applications are successful, a huge market of 369 million people will be created.  This poses great challenges for Irish businesses but no doubt there will be pitfalls.  There is the Norwegian fishing industry and we know what happened when the Spaniards were fishing in our waters.  The Norwegians will not be as covetous or as daring as the Spaniards but this issue must be properly negotiated.  Austria is an inland country which has a well developed winter tourism industry in terms of skiing and winter holidays. Ireland has not entered this market and should have done so.  We should not try to sell Ireland as a country with sunshine because we cannot compare with the Mediterranean areas when it comes to holiday in the sun.  We must adopt a different approach and Austria could be a major competitor as regards developing tourism in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am glad Cyprus, Malta, Turkey and Switzerland have applied to join the EU.  The sooner all the countries of Europe, from the Urals to the Atlantic, are part of the Union the better.  With EU expansion there will be movement of people all the time.  In the past many Irish people were forced to emigrate to America, Britain and other countries but now they are going to Europe.  They are a great loss to us.</P>
    <P>I must also mention the movement of people to Ireland.  There is a problem in west Cork at present with new age travellers coming from Britain.  I fear the movement of these people into <Col N="679" /> remoter parts of our country will cause a major strain on our social services.</P>

      <P>It is reality.  If the system in Ireland was geared in the past towards our people leaving the country, we do not have a system in place at present to cater for mass movement inwards.  Our people left the country to genuinely seek work.  Many fell by the wayside abroad but many more worked hard in countries to which they moved. They settled there and are doing well for themselves.  In addition, the country to which they moved did not bear the cost of rearing or educating them. People are coming to Ireland to avail of our social services.  Given the new law in Britain, which is due for royal assent, what are the implications for Ireland if people who stayed on the side of the road, wandered around and trespassed, can get the boat to Ireland and move into a nice, clean and friendly environment in west Cork?</P>

If such a yardstick had been applied to the hundreds of thousands of Irish people who emigrated over the generations they would be in a sorry state.  I would not like to think that Ireland as a host country would treat people in other than a humane and civilised way, and that we would show generosity of spirit regardless of the circumstances in which those people come into the country.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Seanad is discussing this report because one of its recommendations was that it should be debated in the Seanad and in the Dáil. It is good that the Seanad has taken the lead in discussing the report in conjunction with the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which amends the legislation of 1972 and 1993 to allow for the accession of Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway.</P>
      <P>I compliment Professor Brigid Laffan for her research in compiling this report. Her depth and range of knowledge and expertise are considerable and impressive. She had much to contribute in her submissions and at meetings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  This report is in no small way due to Professor Laffan's work and she deserves full commendation for her work.</P>
      <P>We are confined to 15 minutes and I will confine my contribution to the recommendations of the report as it is not possible to deal with all aspects in the time available.  The report makes specific recommendations arrived at after a lot of discussion and visits from ambassadors from existing member states, prospective members states &mdash; including the four members of EFTA who will accede shortly &mdash; and from a number of the eastern European countries, in particular, Hungary and Poland. We were in a position to question the ambassadors and other representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lee referred to the role of the small member states.  Paragraph 10.8 on page 69 states that: &ldquo;...Ireland should play a leading role in elaborating and ensuring the adoption of appropriate and effective mechanisms to protect the unique contribution of small member states.&rdquo;  Senator Lee asked what was their unique contribution.  As the <Col N="682" /> EU has evolved there has been a fundamental principle &mdash; which we believe should remain in place &mdash; that small states should have a disproportionate presence in the institutional system.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the danger that may arise &mdash; particularly coming toward the intergovernmental conference of 1996 &mdash; that the position of small member states may be threatened. Their position must be protected and, while they may have greater political representation in proportion to their population, it is important that they be there for their political input.  A number of the states which are about to accede are neutral, as is Ireland, and we could develop communication, contact and a common stand.  There is an opportunity for small member states to establish contact at that level.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee was critical that the report does not deal with the cultural aspects of enlargement.  Since Ireland entered Europe our intellectual skills and our ability to deal with issues and to find remedies to problems have been highly respected.  We can contribute in a substantial way via these skills.  In the discussions that have taken place in Brussels to secure various benefits for Ireland, the benefits have been obtained due to the wit, humour and ability to negotiate of our representatives there and our officials here.</P>
    <P>We have managed to establish and maintain good contacts in Brussels.  We are respected for our intellectual capacities, our humour, our ability to enjoy ourselves and our cultural contribution. Such capacities are invaluable: their value may not be economic or monetary but one has to put a value on finer things, and these are our strengths. We should develop and strengthen those aspects of our contribution to Europe in the future.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs also recommended that countries gaining accession in the future should adhere to the Social Chapter of the Treaty on European Union.  The thinking behind this is that while we have adopted the Maastricht Treaty in <Col N="683" /> its entirety, our neighbour, Britain, has adopted the treaty minus the Social Chapter.  It was felt that we could be disadvantaged by such a situation and we have seen examples of this over the past year where, to our loss, industry has gone from this country to Britain.  We cannot afford to allow that to continue. Everything must be done to redress this situation; in future negotiations the onus should be put on Britain to adopt the Social Chapter.</P>
    <P>If we are to be in an EU with equality, a union of integration and common policy, it is important that such situations do not arise in the future. That was the thinking behind the recommendation and it must be adhered to in the future.  I would ask the Government if possible, to get existing member states, Britain in particular, to accept the Social Chapter.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10.3 of the report states that: &ldquo;The Joint Committee endorses the broad criteria for membership agreed at the Copenhagen European Council...&rdquo; and lists three criteria. However, the committee also recommended that a further criterion must be respect for human rights.  It is important that the human rights issue be included in future discussions.</P>
    <P>In the east European countries previously under Communist regimes the respect for human rights often left much to be desired.  Any agreements these countries now sign should include provisions for the respect and maintenance of human rights.  This is a fundamental issue which should not be ignored.  This report recommends this move and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>We are all delighted about the accession of the four EFTA countries, Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. It will be more difficult when the applicants from eastern Europe join.  The joint committee states that the policy implications of an eastward enlargement should be fully assessed in preparation for the Government White Paper on Foreign Policy and the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> The eastern European countries are important to European unity but they used to have a much different political, social and economic structure.  They are now attempting to become democratic states and develop market economies. Needless to say, they are experiencing difficulties.  Germany and Austria are concerned to have political stability in the eastern countries and the position should be addressed sensibly in a coordinated and directed manner.  If we do that, then when these countries do acquire membership, which may happen as early as 1999, they will be in a similar position to the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>There is a huge debate about institutions because the current EU institutional structures have been in place since its foundation.  They are almost 50 years old and date from a time when there were only six member states.  The current institutions will not work in an EU with up to 30 member states.  There is a real need to address this issue and arrive at a specific view.  The Foreign Affairs Committee recommends that the implications for Irish policy of the evolutionary and federal constitutional models be thoroughly examined and debated.  I hope the Government does that before it presents its White Paper.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends that Ireland deepen its political and economic ties with central and eastern Europe.  There are great opportunities for semi-State bodies such as the ESB and Telecom Éireann to be involved in those countries.  The Ministers responsible should direct those organisations to do so, and also encourage the private sector to set up more joint ventures in those countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee referred to the cultural and educational aspects of EU enlargement. There is great potential for the Minister for Education to establish liaisons between educational institutions here and in eastern Europe.  That could have considerable long term benefits and it is important to understand the thinking, the culture and the background of our new neighbours, who will <Col N="685" /> be part of the EU before the turn of the century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having called many times for this House to debate EU enlargement, I welcome the opportunity we are now afforded by the presentation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs' report on the subject.  Enlargement is probably the most important issue facing the EU.  It is largely welcomed but many people feel the process is moving slightly too quickly and that insufficient thought has been given to the implications of enlargement.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year Members of the European Parliament turned out in force to give a warm welcome to the applicant member states.  They voted overwhelmingly in favour of the accession to the EU of Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland.  Malta, Cyprus and Turkey have applied for membership and other countries such as Switzerland, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are discussing joining.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee mentioned that the former Hungarian Ambassador to Ireland, Dr. Istevan Pataki, is now in charge of Hungary's accession negotiations and left Ireland with the impression that Hungary would receive considerable support from this country.  He and his former second in command, Dr. Gabor Foldvari, were good ambassadors for that country and did much to establish good relations between Hungary and Ireland.</P>
      <P>When I thought of Europe when I was young, I imagined the centre of Europe as being in Switzerland or Austria. In recent times the centre seems to have shifted towards the west, but Europe is larger than we sometimes recognise.  Romania, Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia, the Ukraine, Georgia, Belorussia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are all European countries, as is Russia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That mighty nation, Turkey, is also European.  Its application to join the EU has been put on hold.  That must be for economic and political rather than geographical reasons, for surely Turkey is <Col N="686" /> attached to Europe rather than Asia and is clearly separated from the Levant. It is interesting to note that when the old USSR was a force in world politics Turkey, as a member of NATO, served as a bulwark against Soviet repression and aggression.</P>
    <P>I hope this friend in need will not be now conveniently forgotten when it seeks to join the enlarged Union.  Turkey, because of its history, location and dynamism, can form a bridge between east and west, between Muslim and Christian.  Istanbul may once again adopt the central role it played in the governance of Europe.  It is not for nothing that Constantine chose that city as his capital.</P>
    <P>The EU is committed to the creation of economic and monetary as well as political union.  Despite the problems inherent in adding to the complexity of working within a community of 12 nations, it is becoming clearer by the day that the destiny of the EU cannot be defined by the present boundaries. The members of the EU will gradually rise from 12 to 16 and eventually perhaps to over 20.  In addition to most of the present EFTA states, there will be countries from central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region.</P>
    <P>Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome states: &ldquo;Any European State can apply to become a member of the European Economic Community&rdquo;.  It does not define the geographical limits of Europe and, as I said earlier, the limits can be widely interpreted.  Russia merges at some point with Asia, but it is essentially and intimately a European nation.</P>
    <P>However, irrespective of where the applicant country is located it must meet certain criteria, namely, that it must be democratic; capable of fitting into the EU in economic, political and institutional terms; and that it is prepared to accept the <i>acquis communautaire</i>&mdash; that is, it must accept the full <i>corpus</i> of European Community and European Union law and policy put into place since 1957.  Current applications have met these criteria and no doubt those applicant countries which at a future <Col N="687" /> date successfully negotiate membership will also have to meet these criteria.</P>
    <P>Even where the criteria are met there are still issues and challenges which must be tackled.  One such issue for Ireland is the development of a common foreign and security policy and the implications of that for our neutrality. Austria, Sweden and Finland have policies of neutrality.  Austrian neutrality is based on its federal constitution law of 26 October 1955, in which is enshrined non-membership of military alliances, a ban on foreign bases and permanent neutrality.  Sweden has a law enjoining its non-participation in military alliances in a time of peace to allow neutrality in time of war.  Finland has a 1948 friendship treaty with the USSR.  It has an agreement not to place its territory at the disposal of a foreign power and there are no threats to the former USSR from Finnish soil.</P>
    <P>Article J of Title V &mdash; Provisions on a Common Foreign and Security Policy &mdash; of the Treaty on European Union states that &ldquo;A common foreign and security policy is hereby established which shall be governed by the following provisions.&rdquo;  Article J.1.4 states that:</P>
    <P>The Member States shall support the Union's external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity. They shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations.  The Council shall ensure that these principles are complied with.</P>
    <P>Although we are traditionally neutral, it is surely not unreasonable to expect that we should, if required in future, come to the defence of the Union.</P>
    <P>There are other special economic issues for Ireland, notably concerning the impact of enlargement &mdash; for example, the demands of the less developed applicants for Structural Funds.  These will give rise to major calculations for Ireland and, not least, the <Col N="688" /> future of the EU Budget.  I have no doubt these issues will be ably dealt with by our Government representatives, whoever they will be at the time.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for a wide-ranging public debate on what it means to be a new European.  We need to address the information deficit but we also need to recognise that historical attitudes will have to be reassessed.  Our commitment as a nation to a European ideal must be examined on a continual basis.</P>
    <P>The philosophical underpinning of social policy must be particularly examined. I am glad to say that we have in place Protocol 17 to protect Article 40.3.3 of the Irish Constitution which prohibits abortion.  This will hopefully protect the unborn in this country and not allow abortion to become a service, as it is in many of the other European Union countries.</P>
    <P>We have to ask questions as to who directs the overall development of the Union.  We must be careful about the leaders of the Union and see that the Commission and the other organisations that run the Union are well balanced and that we do not end up with a fascist or a totally socialist Union but with a balanced one which will help all people. Does Ireland stand to gain more from the policy line of the Commission and the Parliament or from working largely at the level of the Council of Ministers and the European Council?  We should not fear enlargement.  We need to be constantly reminded that the whole basis for forming a Union is to pursue a process of peace to preserve life rather than destroy it.</P>
    <P>I do not see the difficulty in the future as one of reaching agreement on major issues but I see us, as other Senators have mentioned, dividing on small issues which will be important at the time but not so in the overall scheme of things &mdash; for example, the languages we will use, moving the Parliament from one place to another at absolutely needless expense, representation at Commission and other levels, voting procedures and so on.  We need to keep in mind the ultimate objective, which is to <Col N="689" /> foster harmonious relationships between the people of this Continent.</P>
    <P>We will never forget the First and Second World Wars.  Over 40 million people were killed and 135 million injured and displaced during the Second World War.  No matter how large the Union gets, it will help our aspiration to foster harmonious relations between its nations.  We must at all times be steady in that resolve and never falter in it.  I welcome this report because it will in some way contribute to the debate on enlargement and help us come to terms with it.  We must keep in mind why we have a Union, which is that we never again want a war on the European continent and want to see the peoples of Europe living together in peace and harmony.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one negative point to make about the Bill but I want to begin by drawing attention to it. Because of the geography of Europe, any extension and enlargement of the Union must be towards the east or the south.  This puts us in a more peripheral position on each occasion.  I am concerned that with the huge opportunities being created by an enlarged Europe through a hugely enlarged market, we will fail to reap that potential because of transportation difficulties.  I wish to raise again an issue which I have raised on a number of occasions since joining this House in 1987.  This relates to the peripherality of Ireland.  Brussels is effectively the capital of Europe.  I know there can be a major row between Members of the Union about this, but in order to do business Brussels is the capital.  If I decided to go to there by plane tomorrow morning, the cost of the flight would be about £700 or £800.  I know there are all sorts of deals available but if I decide now that I want to do business there in the morning this will be the cost of the flight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true: perhaps the way forward is to make the Government jet available to other people.  We need to look closely at the impact this is having on bargain making, market making, seeking new arrangements and so on in Europe.  I am speaking of one flight, the same applies to many others. We need to see how we can subsidise the air corridor between ourselves and the main capitals of Europe, particularly Brussels, Paris and Frankfurt.  There should be support from Europe for the subsidisation of these flights.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the cock up on top of cock up we have seen with regard to the Channel Tunnel, in the early days of the proposals for a new rail system for Europe a 56 mile rail link under the Irish Sea was envisaged.  This has fallen from the agenda because of costs and other factors and would be very low down the priorities of European proposals. It is no longer included in any of the proposals or prognoses for the development of European rail.  This impacts on us very negatively.  When the hiccups in relation to the tunnel are sorted out, business people will be able to travel from central London to central Paris by train in under three hours, in a slightly less time to Brussels and in a similar time to other major European capitals.  This puts us at a major disadvantage. We should look at this very seriously.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the comments of previous speakers on culture and neutrality.  I was appalled at the comments made by Senator Calnan.  No more than what I said earlier today about ethics in Government, he probably did not realise the import of what he said, but if he were to make that speech in a European context with European representatives present, this country would be seriously embarrassed. His party should talk to him about this.  His contribution was negative and worrying.</P>

      <P>I recollect you intervening to ask him to keep to the substance of the debate and I appreciated that. This leads us clearly into the great attraction of European enlargement, which is cultural diversity.  The differences and tensions of different cultures and learning about them can bring us forward to a greater understanding of each other.</P>

      <P>Free movement was the beginning of the Treaty of Rome and we can do nothing to stop it and should not want to.  I was recently in the Czech Republic.  There is a view there that its Bohemian influence on Europe will be a good softening influence on the more puritan approach to life of our colleagues and friends in the Nordic countries. The great differences, to which the French always referred, will be important to us in the future.  As regards our Irishness, nothing has protected, developed and enhanced our cultural identity as much as joining Europe. Where are all the pessimists who said many years ago that culturally we would be swallowed, flooded and overrun? The reality is that Irish culture has blossomed in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It also raises an issue we must address.  The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, and I share, the same views on independence and neutrality. However, I recognise that the strong views I held for many years must change.  I have searched for a definition of neutrality through world history but I failed to find it.  Three of the four countries which are joining the EU &mdash; Finland, Sweden and Austria in particular &mdash; have had similar difficulties in approaching and dealing with the <Col N="692" /> thorny question of neutrality.  They dealt with it while being sandwiched on both sides of the great political divide for many years &mdash; Finland shares a border with Russia and Austria shares a border with the eastern bloc.  For many years I admired the way they did this and it would be good for us if they joined Europe.</P>
      <P>It is important to reassess our position on this issue.  We need a lively debate about what neutrality, independence, nationalism, being a republic and being European means.  There must not be a diminution of neutrality as a result of a decision that we protect ourselves.  No one would argue against this.  It has always been one of the great contradictions on the left of Irish politics that the same people who put their lives, limbs, families and jobs at risk in the 1930s to fight on the right side in the Spanish Civil War, were the same people who, when they came back, said we should wash our hands of the problems of the globe.  We cannot tell our grandchildren that we were the people who stood around while Pol Pot massacred a generation or while other massacres were taking place, no more than our parents can explain to us how great it was to stand back and watch Belgium being overrun by the Nazi war machine.  This difficult question must be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to joining the Western European Union and NATO but I would support being part of a defensive pact because it is our duty to defend our colleagues and other people in Europe in an acceptable way.  That acceptable way, in global terms, should be a strengthened and restructured UN, but that is a debate for another day.  We should consider this matter carefully. We now have a great opportunity to do so with at least four non-aligned countries in the enlarged European Union. We should debate this issue.  The Government should grasp the nettle. This discussion must take place.  If we see wrong being done to our colleagues in Europe through the aggression of <Col N="693" /> people from outside Europe, we must ask the people where our duty lies.</P>
    <P>Another question which bothers me is the tendency in Europe towards the dissolution of republics and the impact this would have on an enlarged Union. For example, if the Czech Republic joins, as it probably will, an enlarged European Union in the future, and if the Czech Republic is subdivided into Bohemia and Moravia, what impact would that have?  Do the people and the land join the Union or is it the state as recognised by the UN?  I suspect the same rules which the United Nations uses to define what is a state would apply.  If a state subdivided, would there be two more members in the Union?  I would appreciate an answer to that question because the legislation does not help me in this regard.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made about opening up the markets because the possibility of doing further business in Europe would be great for our growing economy.  Recently, I met people who work in eastern Europe: one young man is working on the development of Slovenia. I sometimes fool myself by thinking I am a reasonably informed person, but I could not remember the name of its capital.  This shows how uninformed I am about developments in eastern Europe.  When he told me the name of the capital city, I could remember it and a lot more.  Irish people are now developing infrastructures in those countries and we have a lot to give them, both in services and markets.  The Irish services industry also has a great opportunity to develop the infrastructure of these new countries.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said in this House that we share with the accession countries &ldquo;a similarity of outlook on a range of international issues&rdquo;.  He should spell out those issues, although neutrality is one of them.  That should be dealt with up front and we should have a discussion on it.  He mentioned that the accession of these four countries will lead to a population increase of 25 million in the <Col N="694" /> enlarged Union, which gives an average population size of five to six million; that means there will be more countries our size.  That is good for the internal dynamics of Europe and is an important aspect which will help our cause in Europe and help us to make a stronger contribution.  In enlarging the Union we should now seek to develop the best of those countries culturally, economically and infrastructurally and try to spread through Europe a different type of cohesion policy, a conversion policy, where we would take the best from each country.</P>
    <P>One of the things we lack at present is greater interaction.  There is a need for movement between the population of this island and the rest of Europe.  At the outset I mentioned the impact this could have on business but it is more than that.  We must start somewhere if we are to ensure that the next generation understands the cultural values of the gypsies and bohemians of Europe and can accept a people and modify their social behaviour if it is unacceptable.  That is important because a welcome does not mean they can tear down our houses but rather that they must conform to our social norms.  Until we reach that position of strength and confidence, we will have failed in Europe.  We need interaction to do this and the process must start early.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions I sent proposals to Brussels which suggested that I would be more comfortable if teachers in primary and post primary schools had experience of teacher and pupil exchanges.  It would not matter if these exchanges took place between Belfast and Dublin or Dunquin and Paris.  It is only when people meet and realise there is no great difference between them that they can move forward.</P>
    <P>We should develop our links with Europe in terms of transport and also in technology and communications so that people can communicate with each other; they do not always need a common language.  Children of four years of <Col N="695" /> age in different European countries can communicate by drawing on a screen and talking about themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a great future in an enlarged Europe.  It is an exciting time to be a part of European politics and I hope we will live to see us play our role in it. With the acceptance of these countries and with our great economic growth, it will mean that in some stage in the future we will no longer be takers from Europe but will also be able to give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I thank the members of the joint committee for the contribution they made to our consideration and the report they have presented to us.  I would especially like to thank and commend its chairman, our good friend Deputy Lenihan, and to wish him a speedy return to full health.  He has been a totally committed European in every sense of the word, in terms of its culture, roots and future for as long as I have known him and as long as he has been involved in active political life.</P>
      <P>This Bill is of considerable significance. Similar Bills are being passed through other parliaments in Europe. The Europe we are now looking at, as a consequence of this Bill when passed, is a far cry from that of the six members in the Treaty of Rome and indeed it is even further from the Coal and Steel Community, which originally started among the Benelux countries.  Ironically, the purpose of that was to develop an internal cohesion and independence, economically and otherwise, to cope with the possible consequences of domination from the European Communist countries.  That is what gave the original Benelux, the Coal and Steel Community and the Common Market its particular <i>raison dêtre</i> at the time.  Now that things have changed dramatically, we obviously have to renew the direction, dynamism and vitality of Europe during those years, even up to and including our own accession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The six original members became nine when we joined in 1973.  The Union <Col N="696" /> subsequently increased to 12 and is now made up of 16 members.  Significantly, when we joined &mdash; I recall this because it was the first time I was involved in Government &mdash; the condition for our membership was that we had to be economically ready to take on the responsibilities of membership.  That was adjusted somewhat later when the other three applicant member states, Greece, Spain and Portugal, joined. This was proper because then the European Community saw it as being essential to underpin these newly emerging democracies after periods of either dictatorship or military rule.  It succeeded very well and demonstrated that the European Union has always been capable of adapting to the reality of change around it, of embracing that change and not being negative and defensive.  I hope that will remain our approach, because the Europe and the world in which we live is changing every day.</P>
    <P>There were many institutional reforms considered to deal with that change from time to time &mdash; I want to focus on a few of them because I was involved as Commissioner when some of these were presented &mdash; to ensure it would not creak under the weight of new members and that the administration could be effective and efficient. These reforms included the orderly reform, <i>Le Troissage</i> or the three Wise Men, the Manscholt reform and so on. The libraries of the Commission are piled high with these reforms or proposals for these reforms.  Each one of them in respect of the Commission has one thing in common: they recommended that there should be one Commissioner per member state.  I was there when our Commissioner and the Three Wise Men recommended that and it is a consistent theme in all of those proposals.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am surprised and apprehensive that we are now hearing suggestions that instead of following the reform proposals that were never implemented, because it did not suit the larger powers, some are now suggesting &mdash; I think this should be nipped in the <Col N="697" /> bud &mdash; that perhaps some of the small member states might only have a Commissioner in alternate periods.  This would run completely contrary to the whole direction and ethos of the European Union.  There are suggestions too that the Presidency might not be applied according to the normal rota, in alphabetical order for every six months.  That too flies in the face of the contributions the smaller member states have made to the European Union.  The Presidencies of those smaller states, be it Belgium, Luxembourg or Ireland, have done a good job by achieving objective consensus throughout the European Union.  It is acknowledged, for instance, that the Irish Presidency has made significant contributions to the efficient functioning of the Union.</P>
    <P>Without being big headed in any sense or overstating our role, our unique role as an independent country in terms of foreign policy was able to bring about new and healthy relationships with many member states of other European countries, especially in the field of external relations.  Here I am referring to the Lomé Conventions, which are of great importance to the Union.  Significantly, with the exception of the last time, each of them was negotiated and concluded during an Irish Presidency.  The first convention took place under the Presidency of Garrett FitzGerald, my predecessor, the second under my own Presidency and the third under the Presidency of Deputy Peter Barry.  It was no accident that the ACP countries wanted to do business with a small country such as Ireland which had an experience that would be more sensitive to their problems.  Therefore, it is important that we remind those colleagues, if they are of that view, that the Presidency should not alternate.  This would even run contrary to the interests of those large member states.</P>
    <P>There are also the practical problems of enlargement which simply have to be faced.  We made a concession when we joined that we would not insist that Irish would be a working EU language. Almost every other member state at the <Col N="698" /> moment insists on its language being a working language.  I want to make an open confession, a Chathaoirligh.  It is sometimes thought that when those poor Agriculture Ministers, for instance, spend days and nights negotiating around the table of the Council of Ministers, they are engaged all of the time in fighting the cause of their home country in holding firm against the demands of the Commission or the Presidency, that that is what keeps them there for all of this time.  The reality is very different. The reason the nonsense of late night, all night and three night negotiations at the Council of Agriculture and many other councils goes on and on is because each of the documents has to be translated into all of the official languages of the European Union.  I sat waiting for four to five hours to get documents in Spanish on the latest proposal from the Presidency of the Commission.  That issue has to be looked at in terms of whether this system will be maintained efficiently.</P>
    <P>If the current practices are to be continued within an enlarged Union, I can tell the House that from my experience in the council over the years since 1972 &mdash; I was also on the Commission for one and a half years &mdash; that it will literally collapse from the burden of its own frustrations in terms of the official languages and matters of that sort.  Cost alone is a major factor.  I was responsible for personnel and administration in the Commission.  It is a fact that over 60 per cent of the personnel in the Commission during the period 1981-82 were engaged in language translation in one way or another, were interpreting or were experts in jurisprudence, linguistics or whatever.  How can any institution survive with that undue burden based on language?  While I respect the difference of languages, we have to make it clear that even the existing working languages need to be reviewed, much less taking into account the working languages of the member states that are about to join us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> In relation to the Presidency of the Commission, I am going to say something that I refrained from saying some months back because of my experience with a Luxembourg Presidency.  I had grave apprehensions about the prospects of another Luxembourg Presidency and saw it as risking the kind of compromise that would suit the major powers while ensuring that there would not be a strong, independent President of the Commission.  I refrained from saying that at the time because I felt it would be inappropriate in view of the Government's position.  Having experienced the compromising attitude under a Luxembourg Presidency, the weakness of a Commission that accommodated demands from a British Prime Minister even in the allocation of portfolios, as well as demands, insistence and directions from the French and Germans, I want to put on record now that I hope Jacques Santer will be more resolute and determined in insisting upon the independence of the Commission, which is crucial to the functioning of the European Union, than the last Luxembourg President was.  I will leave the rest to the kindness of history. If he is not, then we and other smaller member states will pay a huge price.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by the resolute position taken by the new President in allocating Commission portfolios, but both the President and the Commission will come under severe pressure.  I hope that those of us who are representing the overall interests of Europe will support the independence of the Commission because that pressure is bound to arise. I say that, having regard in particular to the achievement of Jacques Delors and the weakness of a Commission of which I was a part.  The record will show that almost all the policy positions implemented by Jacques Delors and his Commission were all proposed by the previous Commission, of which I was privileged to be a member, in the famous <Col N="700" /> Mandate Range of policies.  While we proposed them, we did not have the political muscle to implement them.  I hope we are not going to see a standstill again now.  We should be vigilant.</P>
    <P>The collapse of Communism has brought about major changes.  The <i>raison d'étre</i> of the European Union has totally changed because it was formed to protect itself against Communism and the forces of totalitarianism.  Understandably on the part of our German partners, that collapse has placed a new focus on Eastern Europe, and trade between the former Comecon countries and the European Union is growing apace every day.  Exports from the former Comecon countries, which are now the newly emerging democracies of eastern Europe, to the EU are growing. But let us not delude ourselves that from the point of view of Germany, for instance, the market outlets of eastern Europe are part of history; they are contiguous. We will constantly have to adjust our trade patterns because the German interest will tend more towards strengthening the developments with Eastern Europe rather than looking north and west towards the periphery, or south towards Spain, Greece and Portugal.  Given the new enlargement of the EU, we will have to bear these realities in mind over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The longest standing applicant for membership of the European Union is Turkey, and I entirely support what Senator Lydon said in this connection. Turkey has had an association agreement with the European Union since 1963.  It applied for membership a number of years ago and was put on hold. As President of the Council of Ministers, I attended a meeting in Ankara in 1979 where detailed discussions were held on Turkey's association agreement with the then EC, on the understanding that Turkey would submit an application which the EC would seriously consider.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> I know that, as has been suggested, there may have been reservations in respect of previous political conditions in Turkey, in addition to the human rights position sometime before that. All that has changed, however, and it is time that we looked at the reality of what Turkey can contribute to the EU. Its long-standing economic and cultural ties with all the newly emerging democracies of the former Soviet Union are of great potential for all of us.  As nothing has stood still in the past, so nothing will stand still in the future.  We should look at Turkey's application in a much more positive way.  Having had discussions with Turkey's partners then, and with representatives of trading interests more recently, I see this as a matter of huge potential for Ireland.  We would do well to establish a new understanding with Turkey on joint ventures as well as helping, advising and sponsoring, if possible, that country's accession to the EU.</P>
    <P>The budgetary consequences of the new EU members are properly referred to by the joint committee.  In the short term we will have a net gain of 6,500 million ECU from 1995 to 1999, but that must be viewed in the context of a 1994 budget amounting to 70,000 million ECU.  The issue is not about money alone but about culture and independence in foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The view was expressed that we should be careful about the wrong done to our partners in Europe by those outside, that we must defend our partners in Europe against outside aggression. Perhaps, however, we should be more vigorous in protesting against the wrong being done by our partners in Europe to innocent people outside.  Maybe we would be truly independent if we protested against our partners' armaments industries which, ruthlessly and in a totally amoral way, caused suffering during the Iran-Iraq war, all over Africa and in other areas.  Instead of reacting against a potential external attack on Europe which now seems unlikely, we could express our independence and neutrality by reminding all our partners on <Col N="702" /> the inside that that is not the type of neutrality and independence we want to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Minister Browne who has just joined us in the House.  We are asked to consider two matters, one of which is the referral of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  There is no problem about that, but I hope that in its deliberations on the Bill the joint committee will take into account the remarks that have been made in this debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It is one of the better reports which have been brought to our attention in recent years.  It is clear and concise and whoever is responsible is to be congratulated.  I suspect one of the people responsible for that clarity is Professor Laffan who has already been praised by several speakers.  She brings a quality to these discussions which is unusual and her contribution is significant.</P>
      <P>I welcome the enlargement of the EU but not without some reservations.  My reservations relate to the deepening of the Union compared to its enlargement. This is matter which is addressed in the report, although I do not believe it has been addressed conclusively.  It was said that the two points are not inconsistent and I would agree with that to an extent. As the EU enlarges, particularly if it does so at a rapid pace, there will be a difficulty about the deepening of the Union and about keeping the train on the track which has been quite successful over the years when we consider the achievement of the Single Market, the Maastricht Treaty and the momentum for a single currency.  Enlargement may put a single currency further down the track than where I would like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of debate about the institutional balance in the EU and there will be genuine difficulties.  I endorse what Senator O'Kennedy said about the Commission and the fact that <Col N="703" /> each country should have a Commissioner and that the Presidency should rotate sequentially from one state to the next.  However, that contradicts the remarks he made about the Luxembourg Presidency because one cannot make that argument and then make such remarks.  I have a good deal confidence in the Luxembourg Presidency.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy also mentioned the all night sittings where deals are hammered out which we are accustomed to seeing on television and which he experienced as a Minister.  He suggested that part of the reason for this was that people had to wait around for translations of the various languages, but I am not sure about that.  I believe it was Bismarck who remarked, some time predating the EU, that the best way to reach agreement was to put people into a room and leave them there until they reached one because nothing concentrated the mind quite like that.</P>
    <P>The EU has achieved an enormous amount.  In respect of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation I believe there are cogent lessons to be learned from our experiences in the EU and the way it was built.  I thought it was significant that the only person to allude to that in Dublin Castle was Mr. John Hume who could draw on his experience as European parliamentarian and on his experience of building Europe to show what we could achieve if we referred to that experience.  In that respect what Senator O'Toole said was important.  He spoke about the need for young people and the population as a whole to experience what is happening in Europe, to see at first hand the cultural diversity and what has been created from such appalling ruin in a single generation.  Although we cannot send every school going child on a trip to Europe, I wonder about that and whether it might be a better use of money to send young people on educational trips to Europe rather than on some of the training courses they are sent on at present.  It is questionable <Col N="704" /> which would be more useful.  Certainly young people need to be trained and skilled, but exposure to the wider European community of peoples would be as beneficial and, in some cases, more beneficial. All of us who have travelled throughout Europe have benefited from that experience.</P>
    <P>The report points out that three essential qualities are required when one considers enlargement, first, European identity through geographical, historical and cultural identity.  Senator Lydon dealt with the geographical aspect of the matter at some length.  I would draw the map widely on that and I would include what was said about Turkey.  Second, there is the question of a functional democracy.  That is one of the essentials which applicants should bring to bear.  We should ask if we have a functional democracy.  That was dealt with by a few speakers.  Do we have a truly democratic society in terms of parliamentary democracy where Government is ultimately answerable to parliament? Third, there is respect for human rights.  When it comes to the Nordic countries and Austria, none of those essentials poses a difficulty.</P>
    <P>There are, however, difficulties in relation to the question of the <i>acquis communataire</i>&mdash; I get tired of this European jargon which is pedalled about Seanad committees.  It is totally foreign to us.  Perhaps it is to make everything impenetrable so that people cannot understand it and we surround ourselves with an aura of invincibility.</P>
    <P>The question of the <i>acquis communataire</i>&mdash; in other words, countries must be able to take laws on board, implement and enforce them &mdash; is a more serious difficulty, particularly for eastern European countries.  It was easy in the case of EFTA countries where there was the European economic area but if we are serious about bringing eastern European countries like Hungary and Poland into the EU we should introduce an institutional framework which brings them into a family where the association becomes closer and closer over time until eventually there <Col N="705" /> are no difficulties about joining the Union.</P>
    <P>Something the Seanad should do before the end of the year is to express our gratitude to Jacques Delors for the contribution he made to the EU during his period in Brussels.  At least he had that vision of what the Union was about and he drove towards it.  I hope we do not go back to the old &ldquo;Euro sclerosis&rdquo; where everything stopped or, as I said, the train stopped on the tracks.</P>
    <P>A fortnight ago on the Order of Business I welcomed the decision of Finland to join the EU, and I do so again.  I also welcome the decision of Austria in that regard.  A useful contribution was made last week by the Finnish Ambassador, Ulf-Erik Slotte at the Irish Council of the European Movement.  He outlined the reasons Finland had joined and the fact that it had voted in favour by a 57 per cent to 43 per cent margin, a convincing one.  However, he expressed disappointment at the turn out in the referendum which was 74 per cent, much lower than that for general elections.  If asked the same question I believe we would be pleased with such a turn out, although it was significant when we decided to join the EU.</P>
    <P>Another important point is that this was only a consultative referendum in Finland, parliament must decide by a two-thirds majority to enter the EU.  On a lighter note, the Finnish Ambassador said that Finland only had one referendum in 1932.  That was a significant referendum about whether alcohol should be legalised.  Obviously, joining the Union was a matter of equal importance which had to be put to the people. Agriculture was a difficulty for Finland but their reasons were different to ours. Agriculture has been very heavily supported by the Finnish Government above levels at which it would be supported by the EU and obviously, there was far less enthusiasm for European union in the farming community.</P>
    <P>There are lessons for us in the Nordic experience.  The most important lesson is to do with neutrality.  I know that Austria, Sweden and Finland are looking <Col N="706" /> at their policy of neutrality and it is important to say that there is a huge qualitative difference between their policy of neutrality and our policy of neutrality. They have a policy of neutrality which they have been prepared to defend by force of arms, and they have done so, particularly in the case of Finland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I said Finland.  The ambassador made the point, which I endorsed, that the stability which they generated as a result of their policy of neutrality has benefited all of Europe. There is an identity of interests there. He said that it is a policy of military non-alliance with a credible independent defence, and that is different from what we perceive our policy of neutrality to be.  They are observers of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council and they are members of the Partnership for Peace.  They have, as we know, a huge emphasis on peacekeeping as we have ourselves.  That is another area of identity of interests.</P>
      <P>They can bring a perspective to bear on the European Union which will be very beneficial and which will be of assistance to us in arguing our case. They are very strong on environmental issues.  They are very strong on women's rights.  The question of openness has been considered and they do have a policy of openness.  I would submit in support of some of the speakers, particularly Senator Lee, that we do not have a policy of openness here.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the question of the widening and deepening of the Community. The report says, on page 66, that the choice between deepening and widening no longer holds.  It states elsewhere in the report that the Union has no clear cut choice.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of enlargement is often posited in terms of deepening or widening of the EU.  In fact the Union <Col N="707" /> has no such clear cut choice.  Both deepening and widening will feature in EU politics in the 1990's.  The Union must deepen if it is to widen successfully.  It cannot restrict its membership in the long term.</P>
    <P>The Community must surely deepen if it is to widen successfully, but there is a difficulty in doing the two at the sort of rate that might be hoped for: so the question arises of whether we can deepen the Community while widening it at the same time.  The question of a so-called multi-speed Europe has arisen. Will we all be in different lanes? Senator Lee said he was not concerned about that provided we knew which lane we were in.  I would be very concerned about that, because if we get into a two-speed Europe where some nations progress at one speed and others are left behind, there is potential for genuine major political division within the Union.  The achievement of the Community has been to get rid of some of those divisions.  I would see some of those old wounds reopening if we do not make sure that there is a single speed.  I made the point earlier that we could learn from the experiences of the European Community.</P>
    <P>My final point is to do with Northern Ireland and what we hope to achieve in terms of peace and reconciliation.  There are so many models to look at in the European context which can be of benefit: the achievement of Schumann, Spaak and Monnet and that what they did arose out of a determination that what had happened in two world wars could never happen again.  That is the magnitude of the achievement of the European Union and there is a lesson for us there.  If people who slaughtered one another, not just in thousands but in millions, could sit down to construct a peace that they were determined they would survive and that they were determined they would never allow those things happen again, why can we not do the same on this island?</P>
    <Col N="708" />
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the orthodoxy which seems to exist in the House, this support for the idea of continuous expansion of the European Community. Like Senator Dardis, I do not believe that it is possible to have continuous expansion and deepening of the Community. On 9 May 1950 Schumann, in his own words, &ldquo;dropped a bombshell&rdquo; in the Quai d'Orsay, when he announced the functional integration of the Steel Community and the Coal Community of Germany and France and those other nations that wanted to join up.  The activity that was put in train and the idealism that was unleashed at that stage stand a very real chance of coming to a grinding bureaucratic halt unless somebody says stop and re-examines where we are in Europe and what Europe is all about.</P>
      <P>I accept, and the point was made very well by Senator Dardis, that there are extraordinary lessons, not just for this nation but for the whole of humankind, from the achievements in Europe.  It is extraordinary to think that literally in a matter of hours in the beginning of May 1950, an experiment which was quite unprecedented in terms of world affairs could be put together by idealists in France, Germany and in four other member states who shared a number of common views.  People like Schumann, Monnet, Adenauer, De Gasperi and Spaak had a very clear idea of what Europe was about.  They all had a very clear central thesis.  This was to integrate the people of Europe, particularly and specifically the people of western Europe, and to make war unthinkable and unwageable.  That was the simple yet complex group of objectives which they set for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Europe has become a tower of Babel. Senator O'Kennedy illustrated this well. It has become an extraordinary bureaucracy, self-perpetuating, cynical in its observation of its own self-interest. It has become a pastiche of what was originally intended, feeding on itself, a huge, bloated bureaucratic organisation which has long since lost sight of the objectives and of the idealism which <Col N="709" /> underpinned the foundation of what we now call the European Union.  This is not a terribly fashionable view because there are so many people on the gravy train, but the reality is that those people, who have fed so high off the hog of the gravy train, undermine with their cynicism the idealism on which the extraordinary success in Europe has been based.</P>
    <P>I accept that we have no problem with the accession of the new member states we are talking about &mdash; Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway.  We in Ireland have a particular reason for welcoming their arrival into the European family.  As has been said, Austria, Finland and Sweden have different views of neutrality, but their neutrality is the one feature they have in common with us. Finland waged a war with Fascism and subsequently effectively a war with Communism to protect her neutrality. In Austria, neutrality was the product of war and it was put in place because of the treaty of 1956.  In the case of Sweden, their neutrality was tested and found wanting; but that is in the past, it is history.  The reality is that they have very solid views about neutrality and about military alliances which are broadly speaking in line with our views. For that, I welcome their membership.  I welcome their membership also because they are developed democratic states with very fine traditions of human rights observation.  I welcome them because they will help to re-establish a north-south balance within the Union.</P>
    <P>I have been an interested and enthusiastic observer and participant in the European experiment.  However, I would be less than honest if I did not say that I have a much more jaundiced view of expansion to the east and what it entails.  I do not accept &mdash; Senator Dardis made specific reference to this &mdash; the validity of the report we are discussing. I do not accept that it is possible to broaden the European Union at the same time as it is being deepened.  It is manifestly not possible to do that because the new member states to the east that we would be talking about taking <Col N="710" /> on have vastly different traditions to our own.  In many cases there has been a deficiency of democracy.  That is not to say we should abandon them.  In Senator Dardis' closing comments he made a point that I was going to make myself.  Some form of association to support them, to help them to grow to democracy, is the responsibility of western Europe; but to take them fully on board in the foreseeable future would set the whole process of European integration backwards.</P>
    <P>Untrammelled expansion would not be in Ireland's selfish interest, which it is not fashionable to speak about.  Indeed, one Senator suggested that the bohemians should be on board, perhaps because their baritone voices would add a little to the glee club.  However, that is not reality.  The reality is that we joined Europe for very specific objectives.  We do not want all of the mumbo jumbo jargon which has grown up around Europe, the kind of jargon which has been developed by rather well-heeled diplomatic gentlemen and ladies who have gone to Brussels.</P>
    <P>We should not let this cloud the reality, which is that we had fairly selfish objectives in going in to Europe.  So too did the other member states who formed the European Community.  The six who originally formed the Community had one overriding selfish objective. They wished to establish an alliance so close that they could never war between themselves again and they therefore dismantled their coal and steel industries. The Belgians closed down their coal mines and became dependent on coal from the Ruhr.  The French and Germans married their steel mills and the Italians came on board also, because they had to depend on the new arrangement for raw materials.</P>
    <P>The objectives of these countries were not a product purely of starry eyed idealism; they were selfish.  First of all, they wanted to create a Europe where war would not be fought, an objective which any European would have held at that time.  Second, they wanted to regrow their economies.  A previous <Col N="711" /> Senator made reference to the growth of the European movement.  It is very interesting.  If you look at Europe and see how and why it developed, you will see that self-interest was strongly to the fore.  It was always couched in other terminologies, because it is not fashionable to speak about self-interest; but Europe grew because people were sufficiently clear headed about what they wanted to do with Europe and what they wanted to get out of Europe.</P>
    <P>What we have now is a muddle, a total confusion.  Nobody quite knows what we want out of Europe.  People speak of first rate nations or nations in the fast lane, nations in the slow lane and nations which are undoubtedly consigned to the lay-by.  That is not what European integration should be about. The more we broaden Europe and the more diversity we bring into it, the harder it will be to achieve any progress at all.  This is something which should be recognised and said.</P>
    <P>When the Greeks visited this country in regard to the extension of Europe, I recall, as an official in the Department of Finance at the time, being unfashionable and talking with starry eyed individuals about balance &mdash; for example, the balance in temperate agriculture, an issue which Senator Dardis has referred to, not only in the House but in writings elsewhere.  I recall being concerned that the balance was being lost in that particular expansion, and I am pleased that the north south balance is being reintroduced to a degree by the next expansion. However, the expansions which are envisaged beyond that will totally destroy that balance.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the institutions of the EU will be able to cope with a community of 23 or 24.  Senator O'Kennedy, with his extraordinary experience, as a Minister and as a person involved at the Council of Ministers and Commission level, must be listened to when he speaks on this issue, because he knows what he is talking about.  He is not like another Senator, who suggested that we should expand and bring a couple <Col N="712" /> of bohemians on board because it would soften us at the edges.  By contrast. Senator O'Kennedy spoke with realism.  He pointed out that these EU institutions have become so massive that they are finding it impossible to work.  For example, at one stage 65 per cent of officials were involved in building a linguistic jungle in Europe.  That is a farce and a nonsense.  So many people with so much talent are simply polishing words as opposed to producing ideas and strategies.  If we expand further and go on the same route as we have gone now, that nonsense will become deeper and the possibility of progress will lessen.</P>
    <P>I would be deeply concerned for another reason.  The western European nations who are currently member states of the EU share some common experiences which, unfortunately, we do not share with many of those countries which constituted what used be the command economies of eastern Europe. Senator Lydon touched on this, and I think he was right.  We share common recent experiences in democracy which many of those nations do not have.  I know we have a responsibility to support them as their infant democracies grow into full-fledged democracies &mdash; and I take the point: who are we to start lecturing or hectoring anybody about the level of democracy?</P>
    <P>Although he was criticised, there is validity in the point Senator Lydon made to the House that we should try to start evolving some idea of where the boundaries of Europe lie.  There is a valid rationale in this suggestion.  It is no mistake, for instance, that the original six shared some extraordinary common experiences, out of which grew European integration.  It is unfashionable, for example, to speak of the religious background of those six, but in those days this was an issue of some significance.  I recall reading a Fabianist document produced in Great Britain, and a document produced in 1973 in the North of Ireland, arguing that Europe was a Vatican conspiracy and advising people to keep out of it.  This religious background <Col N="713" /> was a common feature of the original six member states.  The leaders of these states had been the products of wartime opposition to fascism, they had all been people with fairly common experiences and backgrounds and they had one other common feature in that they were fearful of an external threat. This made it possible for them to discuss adventurous and far sighted institutional arrangements.</P>
    <P>The institutional arrangements which were put in train at that stage only succeeded because of the common experience and common background of the six member states.  I make no apologies for putting the point that General de Gaulle was correct, in that when the six was opened to the nine &mdash; and one of the nine was the UK with a very different attitude towards European integration &mdash; the whole process started to slow down.  Senator O'Kennedy referred to that period of sclerosis which attacked Europe before there was a revision under Jacques Delors, a man of some vision.</P>
    <P>I share Senator O'Kennedy's view that the Commission will now simply become another bureaucratic organ, expanding and expanding, rather than focusing on the challenge of deeper integration.  We have to remind ourselves that in the Treaty of Rome there was a passage which clearly delineated a course indicating where we were then and where we should be now.  The original customs union idea was achieved ahead of target, because the six were cohesive and formed a relatively small group of nations.  The next step was the move towards economic cohesion and economic and monetary union.  We are aware of how far we have to go before that level is reached.</P>
    <P>There is another stage beyond that which we are supposed to attain &mdash; political co-operation, closer political integration and common citizenship &mdash; before we would have a European political, economic and monetary union. We know today how far we are from that objective.  The more people and diversity we bring into Europe, the less <Col N="714" /> likely we are ever to reach the final objectives which were implicit in the Treaty which was first launched in May 1950 and subsequently effectively rewritten in the Treaty of Rome.  The kind of Europe we aimed to join in 1973 will never be achieved unless there is more realism in the debate about expansion than there has been to date.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank all who contributed to the debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1994. Enlargement of the European Union will be one of the major challenges which the Union will have to face in the years to come.  The debate here today on the European Communities Bill and on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the enlargement of the Union was timely.  It has allowed this House to focus on what will continue to be a major preoccupation of our time. It has also allowed the many complex and interrelated issues which will face the European Union to be discussed in a constructive manner.</P>
      <P>It is clear that this current round of enlargement to include Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway poses few major challenges for the European Union in general, and Ireland in particular. Indeed, it has been argued that this round of enlargement has opened up a range of new opportunities for us all.  Future enlargements may not be so easy however.  The implications both for the European Union and for Ireland are wide ranging.  Nonetheless, it is clear from the quality of the interventions in this debate that Members of this House have given considerable time and thought to the challenges which will face the Union, and Ireland as a member of that Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs report on <i>The Enlargement of the European</i><Col N="715" /><i>Union</i>, which was published at the end of last month, has had a positive impact on the thinking in the House on the issues associated with the enlargement of the Union.  The committee is to be congratulated on this report which sets out very clearly the major issues which will face the EU.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright outlined some of the issues which will need to be addressed by the European Union in the coming years.  For example, he mentioned the concern of many for the environment and the continuing problem of unemployment. These are ongoing concerns which the EU will continue to address.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright also asked about the Union's relations with Turkey, Cyprus, Malta and the eastern European countries. Turkey has the longest standing application to join the EU.  In 1989 the Commission's opinion on Turkey's application recommended that for economic and political reasons the time was not right to begin accession negotiations. The Union's relations with Turkey are being strengthened throughout the long standing association agreement.</P>
    <P>On the application of Cyprus and Malta, the Commission recommended that negotiations could start once certain political developments in Cyprus and economic developments in Malta were achieved.  The Commission's opinion also highlighted the challenge faced by the Union as a result of the institutional implications of membership due to their small size.  At the European Council in Corfu last June it was agreed that Cyprus and Malta would be involved in the next round of enlargement.</P>
    <P>Ireland is committed to developing its political and economic relations with the countries of central and eastern Europe and fully supports the position set out in Copenhagen and Corfu with regard to future membership of the European Union by these countries. Together with our partners in the European Union we are currently engaged in a strategy designed to prepare the countries <Col N="716" /> of central and eastern Europe for accession to the Union.  One of the principal tasks of the pre-accession strategy will, of course, be the creation of an appropriate environment for economic development and integration and the preparation of the economies of the associated countries for the challenges of membership.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been through this process of preparation.  The success of our efforts was the logical outcome and result of the economic and political policy choices pursued by successive Governments in the years prior to our accession.  These were directed at <i>inter alia</i> modernising the Irish economy, accelerating our growth rate and raising our standard of living.  The policies and processes of structural and sectoral adaptation were far reaching and, at times, difficult.  However, without this effort the fulfilment of Ireland's European vocation and our ability to play a full and active part in the process of European construction would have remained a distant and, perhaps, even unattainable dream.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing the associated states of central and eastern Europe in pursuit of our shared goal of greater European integration is certainly no less significant today than it was for Ireland three decades ago.  The specific problems and issues arising in modernisation and adaptation may involve a different perspective.  However, the essential truth remains.  Prospective members of the Union need to be helped to put in place an economic, legislative and regulatory environment and to effect structural changes and adaptations, all of which must be compatible with the membership of the Union.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are anxious and ready to play a full and active part with our European partners in assisting the associated countries along the road to Union membership.  We are also ready to share our experience with them in any area or on any topic where this may be considered useful and relevant.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made today to the importance of what may be <Col N="717" /> described in a shorthand fashion as the human dimension.  By this I mean culture, education and youth affairs and the need to enhance our co-operation with the associated states of central and eastern Europe in these fields.  I can agree with this.  During the dark years of the Cold War it was frequently the efforts of artists and intellectuals which helped to serve as a bridge between the sundered halves of Europe.  Today, the importance of enhanced co-operation in the area of cultural affairs, education and youth is recognised in the EU and in the central and eastern European states.  Ireland intends to play its part in developing such co-operation between the EU and associated countries with full respect for regional and national diversity and priorities.</P>
    <P>Some questions were raised during the debate which I hope to clarify. Senator Dardis raised the question of simultaneous deepening and widening of the Union.  There is no question of an enlargement of the Union to the east in advance of the conclusion of the next intergovernmental conference.  As Senators will be aware, the function of the Intergovernmental Conference is to undertake a wide ranging and fundamental Treaty review and to ensure that the Union and its structures are fully capable of meeting the challenges of the future.  In a nutshell, deepening must precede widening.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked what would happen if a new member state divided after it had become a member.  There are no provisions in the existing treaties governing the EU which take account of such an eventuality.  I have no doubt, however, that if such an eventuality were to occur the EU would deal with it in a manner which would respect the wishes of the people concerned, as expressed democratically.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their valued contributions.  As Senator Roche said, many Senators from the different parties and Independents made strong contributions, and also a former Commissioner, Senator O'Kennedy.  All of <Col N="718" /> those views are very relevant and will be passed on to the Minister.</P>

      <P>My main reason for proposing this motion is the belief that the present situation is nothing short of a national scandal which brings our Constitution into disrepute and, by extension, brings this House into disrepute.  Colleagues will be aware, but the public may not be fully aware, that the Constitution was amended in 1979 on this very issue.  The Constitution as originally enacted by the Irish people in 1937 reflected the university situation as it was and did not envisage any future changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution originally provided for six university seats, divided equally between the University of Dublin and the National University of Ireland. There was an important signal in that division of seats because in 1937 one of those universities.  Trinity College, was <Col N="720" /> an almost totally Protestant university while the National University of Ireland was an almost totally Catholic institution. The farmers of the 1937 Constitution were making a point when they proposed equal representation for Protestant and Catholic graduates even though the numbers involved were not equal.  This was a laudable approach in the circumstances of the 1930s.  The generosity of spirit behind it would commend itself to the present generation as we approach discussions on the constitutional framework for the future of this island.</P>
    <P>As far the university franchise is concerned, things have moved a long way since 1937 and have changed dramatically and irreversibly.  This is why we are discussing this motion.  In 1979 an amendment to the Constitution was passed by the people of Ireland which provided for a more flexible approach to the election of university Members.  This was precipitated by the expectation that the NUI colleges would eventually become individual universities in their own right.  In that situation the electoral structure as envisaged by the Constitution would not fit in with the reality.  A constitutional amendment was proposed and enacted by the people in 1979.</P>
    <P>The amended Constitution is the framework within which we now have to work.  In effect, the amended Constitution now says that out of the 49 elected members of the Seanad, the number of University Senators will remain at six.  The total number of University Senators is not, therefore, for discussion under the existing Constitution and neither is it an issue.  The Constitution, as amended, provides for total flexibility as to how the six university seats are to be elected.</P>
    <P>The Constitution states that provision may be made by law for the election of Senators representing not only the National University of Ireland and Trinity College but also &mdash; to quote Article 18.4.2ºi &mdash;&ldquo;any other institutions of higher education in the State.&rdquo;  The Constitution leaves as a matter for legislation <Col N="721" /> how exactly the seats could be divided between all these institutions. This was a wise move since it avoids the rigidity of the original proposal.</P>
    <P>I apologise for subjecting the House to this historical review but it is necessary in the context of what I am about to say.  I want everybody to be fully aware that I know the background of the original constitutional provision and the 1979 amendment.</P>
    <P>If we stand back and look at our Constitution, I contend that Article 18.4 is sending a clear message.  It envisages that the university seats will be representative of all graduates of higher education institutions in the State and not just the two originally mentioned. Our Constitution clearly says that the issue is representation for graduates, not the representation of a particular subgroup of graduates.</P>
    <P>I am proud of our Constitution.  There are clearly some fundamental problems which history has now caught up with. However, it is a broadly based, largely liberal Constitution and in many ways a farseeing document that is highly regarded among international students of constitutional law.  It is in short something of which we can rightly be proud.</P>
    <P>I personally challenged the constitutionality of a provision in Article 44. This Article provides that we may not pass any law which discriminates on the grounds of religion.  I challenged that and won a case in 1970.  That particular Article is one which is highly valued by many constitutional lawyers around the world.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Constitution does not intend any old fashioned inequality.  On the contrary, to the layman's eye, it seems to be encouraging the legislators to be even handed in our approach to the enfranchisement of graduates.  I am not, however, as pleased with what we have actually done with the Constitution because we have done nothing.</P>
    <P>The original break up of the NUI did not take place as envisaged in 1979. However, something of equal significance did take place.  Within the last <Col N="722" /> decade this State created two entirely new universities: the University of Limerick and Dublin City University.  I mention them in that order because we, in Dublin tend to put Dublin first all the time which we should not do.</P>
    <P>These two universities are a fine addition to our national educational heritage.  In the academic world, there is no question of them being other than first class.  In the academic marketplace, the names of the University of Limerick and Dublin City University are every bit as revered, valued and prized as those of the older universities.  Nobody in his or her right mind could possibly argue that they are not at least on a par, yet our present law discriminates against our graduates by disenfranchising them in elections to Seanad Éireann.  That, as I stated baldly at the outset, is nothing short of a national scandal.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal not least because there are no good excuses for it.  We cannot hide behind the Constitution.  It not only permits what I suggest, it also provides the strongest possible hint that we should do it.  We cannot hide behind practicalities either.  Of course there would be difficulties in finding a formula to enfranchise all the graduates and, no doubt, we will hear more about those difficulties tonight.  The size of the constituencies, which have already grown to an extent that is increasingly unmanageable for candidates and is therefore possibly discriminatory, is just one of the difficulties.  These difficulties, however, are there to be overcome and they are not insuperable if a modicum of goodwill is brought to the discussion. They are certainly not a good reason for leaving in place the discriminatory and indefensible <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>The motion mentions only the new universities.  However, what about graduates of the regional technical colleges? They should be included too; indeed some of those graduates are already enfranchised because their degrees are awarded by one or other of the present enfranchised universities. Trinity College has awarded about 4,000 degrees to graduates from Bolton <Col N="723" /> Street, Kevin Street, Sion Hill and to other Dublin Institute of Technology graduates.</P>
    <P>We should aim to be totally inclusive. We should seek to include all graduates rather than simply broadening the list of institutions.  Ideally, we should be talking about enfranchising the universities in Northern Ireland also.  Unfortunately, however, that is not permitted under the Constitution.  I hope that before very long, in a wider context, we will have a new Constitution that will permit representation from Northern Ireland universities.</P>
    <P>I doubt that anybody who accepts the idea of university representation can make a good case against ending the present discrimination in the electoral system.  I realise that many people have reservations about the concept of separate representation for graduates.  Opposition to change will come from that quarter.  I ask them to look at the Seanad as it exists and to look at the history of university Senators &mdash; I exclude myself from this &mdash; and see the fine work that has been done by them.</P>
    <P>The Seanad now is very different from the corporate structure that reflected fashionable thinking in the 1930s.  I have no problem with that because I believe in the evolution of our institutions.  I have no problem with the fact that this House is overwhelmingly political in the narrow sense of the definition.  However, this House and the Oireachtas has greatly benefited and continues to benefit from the different perspective contributed by University Senators.</P>
    <P>What we bring to the party, to coin a phrase, is very precious.  Let us remove the discrimination and clean up our act. Even more importantly, let us say to the generation of graduates emerging from the new institutions that we recognise their degrees, their qualifications and their education and that they are every bit as good as those received from the other fine institutions which just happen to have been in existence a little longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to second the motion.  This issue has been supported by every University Senator, to my knowledge, since I was first elected to this House in 1987. It is important to put that fact on the record because there are views in the other parties that that might not be the case.  This is an issue I have featured prominently on my election literature since 1981.  I raised this issue during discussion on the two Bills &mdash; particularly the second one &mdash; which were passed to establish the new universities.  This point was put very strongly by Members of the university group.</P>
      <P>There is no case for not extending the franchise.  That is why there is no discussion against the point of view put forward by Senator Quinn.  A clear position is outlined in the Constitution by the amendment of 1979.  The people have spoken on this matter.  When they were asked they gave their view.  The Constitution clearly gives a huge level of responsibility to the Legislature and to the Executive to implement the will of the people in this matter.  The Constitution, for that reason, does not outline how Senators should be elected.  In the case under discussion, it is clear that the Constitution envisages, with the people's agreement, that all third level graduates should participate in Seanad elections.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the Seanad is undemocratically elected, is unrepresentative and deserves to have the universal franchise.  Our proposal shows our commitment to that ideal by at least pushing back the boundaries in the context of the six seats for University Senators.  Such change will not be without worry for Members who have been elected under the old system.  However, we must move forward and look beyond such considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 19 of the Constitution deals with the other 43 Seanad seats.  It is clear that provision may be made for direct election of Senators by any vocational group to any of the panels.  It has been my position during every discussion on reform of the Seanad &mdash; we <Col N="725" /> had long debates on the matter during the terms of the last two Seanad &mdash; that there should be universal franchise. Farmers should vote on the Agricultural Panel, trade unionists should vote on the Labour Panel, industrialists should vote on the Industrial Panel and so forth; inside and outside those panels should be restricted.  I value the input of local authority representatives and I have often disagreed with my colleagues in that regard.  However, it is right that they should elect a certain number of Senators.  They should elect the inside panel and the outside panel should be elected by members of the vocational groups.</P>
    <P>Tonight we are saying that we are prepared to open our panel to every graduate from third level education.  It is not our job to make the case for the extraordinary, exclusive panel which we represent.  We recognise that we are in a privileged position to have one tenth of the House elected by those who are lucky enough to survive, exploit and come through third level education.  In as much as it represents one-tenth of the population, it is a fair enough reflection on the structure of the House.  I do not have a problem with that nor do I have a problem with voting rights for members of local authorities and the various panels.  However, the franchise should be broadened.</P>
    <P>There is now no justifiable reason for restricting the vote in Seanad elections to the traditional universities, the NUI and Trinity College.  The process of electing our graduates to Seanad Éireann is outdated, undemocratic and must be changed.  Recently, I wrote to the heads of the regional technical colleges advising them that this is an issue they should take up with the Minister for Education &mdash; who I understand has an involvement in this issue &mdash; and the Minister for the Environment.  I have already compiled amendments to the legislation which would achieve this change.  They are easy to compile and they could be drafted in a day.  The constitutional changes have already been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> Participation is the cornerstone of democracy.  The restriction on the right to vote in Seanad elections is demeaning and diminishing.  It reflects another time and age and should be challenged and changed.  When Members of this House knock on doors in Cork in the forthcoming weeks, when all the politicians are doing so before the next general election, or when we will be canvassing the graduates of NUI and Trinity College for the next Seanad election, one issue will confront us &mdash; the total sense of isolation from the political process emanating in waves from young people. They have the idea that they cannot be involved in change or participate in the system to any positive effect.  We are giving sustenance to that sense of isolation by not involving people in the participatory process of democracy.</P>
    <P>A democracy is as strong as the people involved.  Democracies that fail either remove themselves from the people or the people are isolated from them.  This is a classic example for which there is universal support to enfranchise a whole group of people.  We should grasp this opportunity.  I recognise, value and praise the position of Government in not opposing the motion.  This is heartening and encouraging and we appreciate that support.  We ask the Minister to take the next step, to move forward and ensure that all graduates get their opportunity to participate in the Seanad election thereby giving more participation to themselves, more involvement to the population and more relevance to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless my hearing is failing, the Senator made the same contribution and argument this evening. Perhaps I am again picking him up wrong on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The issue of the Seanad and Seanad elections is broad.  The motion covers one aspect, elections to the University Panels.  Some Members of this House advocate the dissolution of the Seanad, although they sit in it, and that in itself is a contradiction.  While acknowledging the contribution of the University Senators, people wonder why a second parliamentary vote should be given to a person who has had the good fortune and the intellect to attend a third level institution.  People also question another aspect, which is part of the argument put forward this evening, as to why one university should have three Senators but another university, with perhaps four or five times the electorate, should have only three Senators.</P>
      <P>There are many contradictions but I agree with Senator Quinn and Senator O'Toole that the franchise should be extended to other areas, such as the regional technical colleges or open universities. However, what about Irish citizens who got their degrees in universities outside the country?  There are many areas that could be discussed, such as whether immigrants could be represented in the Seanad.  This matter was discussed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in the narrow sense of the University Panels.  The point was made as to whether true representation, as Senator O'Toole said, should emerge through, for example, farmers voting directly for those on the nominating bodies or local authority or county borough members only voting for those nominated by the Oireachtas. The system that exists is most democratic in that area because local authority members, county councillors and members of county boroughs, are directly elected by the people in their <Col N="728" /> area.  There is no question about that and they are close to the situation on the ground.  One gets a true reflection of opinion in an area when four or five candidates emerge and are elected in an electoral area of perhaps 5,000 or 6,000 votes.  This is true representation of an area.</P>
      <P>The matter of University Panels goes back to a time when there was an effort to take on southern unionist opinion to some extent by allowing Trinity College to have the same number of Senators as the National University.  I have no doubt that this was the case but I do not know who represents that opinion today.  It is difficult to say; if another Member of the House was here I might attribute it to him.  However, I will not do so in his absence.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn and his colleagues have opened up this debate; it will not be confined to this particular aspect but rather the whole question of Seanad reform.  Looking back at reports of various commissions, the point made by Senator O'Toole that the nominating bodies should be elected directly from different organisations was put forward as a recommendation in 1959.  I read some of the debates that took place in the House about the Seanad electoral commission around 1960 but there was no great enthusiasm among Senators to take that change on board.</P>
      <P>Enthusiasm is not widespread today either, but I commend Senator Quinn and his colleagues for bringing forward this motion.  They are facing up to the reality of the situation in Ireland in that many more people are graduating from other universities and higher education institutions, such as regional technical colleges.  It could be said they are entitled to a say in the election of Senators.  A constitutional wish of the Irish people has not as yet been implemented because in 1979, the people voted in favour of an amendment which was similar to the terms of the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this group, I support the intent and terms of <Col N="729" /> the motion.  I compliment Senator Quinn, Senator O'Toole and the Independent Group for bringing it forward.</P>
      <P>This matter was discussed previously and it is no harm to put it back on the agenda.  To be fair to the Independent Senators, if this motion is accepted and acted upon, they are probably making more work for themselves and increasing competition for their seats but in their inimitable style, no doubt they will respond to that challenge.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the University Senators, past and present.  The House has been well served by them.  They have advantages and disadvantages which the rest of us do not have.  For example they can pursue an independent line which may not necessarily only represent graduates by whom they are elected but also various other strands in society.  Members have come from the academic life, business and other professions. Those of us who form part of the party system have to live with that but, by and large, the mixture here has benefited the Seanad.  We get expertise and different points of view that do not necessarily come from the party system.</P>
      <P>Some graduates should not get priority over others &mdash; all graduates should be able to fully participate. Whether we talk about the present universities or other colleges or institutions which have not got a vote, the matter has to be examined.  We are well represented by learning institutions, be they the older universities or colleges such as the regional technical colleges, DCU and the University of Limerick.  I was in Cork last week canvassing near the university and I was amazed at the growth of the college.  They are looking to expand the campus but they do not want to go into west Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that these matters be looked at.  As Senator Quinn said, we must have a more flexible approach.  We must look at what has gone before.  It may be that the concept of three Senators for one university and three for a much larger one will have to be examined.  Somebody in Trinity might not go along with that and I do not <Col N="730" /> mean my colleague Senator Henry as I am sure she is working assiduously to be re-elected; hopefully the next Seanad election will not be too soon.</P>
    <P>If we are to include other colleges, we may have to consider introducing a regional system.  Those of us who are elected on the panels &mdash; especially if we had to travel from one end of Senator McGowan's county to the other late at night &mdash; might support regionalisation in some form.  I received a letter from the students' union in DCU which supports this measure, as I am sure do many students in the other colleges.  It is clear that there is a need for reform whether we look at the whole system or extend the franchise to other universities. It would not be easy to come up with an exact or fair formula.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole talked about many of our young people who are not part of the system or who look with a certain cynicism at the political system.  We can give many reasons for that but some of it must be due to pettiness and bickering. Less of that takes place in this House than in the other House but there is room for improvement all round.  There is no harm in questioning the existing institutions of Government. We have been far too slow in the past to be self critical and to examine the system.</P>
    <P>It is important that we move on from this motion and see what suggestions can be taken on board.  Some graduates should not be discriminated against; I would hate to see comparisons being made.  In the good days of colours matches, it was in good sport that one university side would call the other rejects.  We must ensure that all graduates are represented in the election of the University Senators.  I do not know how one would go about achieving that but the graduates of the colleges not at present represented should be given the vote at an early stage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should look at the voting system for the University Senators.  I understand 40 to 50 per cent of the graduates cast their vote.  I have heard of ballot papers going to the last listed <Col N="731" /> address which might be ten or 20 years out of date.  The updating and upkeep of the register should also be looked at. We support the motion and ask the Minister to respond positively.  It shows the maturity of the House that we can discuss the matter without a division being necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Senator Quinn and his colleagues from the Independent group for opening the debate in calling for legislation to extend to graduates of the new universities the right to vote at Seanad elections already enjoyed by their colleagues from the older universities.</P>
      <P>Within the present context I have no difficulty with the principle of what is proposed and I do not propose to advocate rejection of the motion or substantive amendment of it.  Clearly it is appropriate that all graduates, whether of new or old universities, should be treated equally in this regard.  However, it is my belief that the Oireachtas could be criticised if it were to deal with this particular anomaly in isolation without addressing the wider issues and the more serious apparent anomalies associated with university representation in the Seanad.  I am anxious to hear the views of Senators on these issues so that they can be taken into account in the development of policy in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 18.4.1º of the Constitution provides that the National University of Ireland and the University of Dublin should each elect three members to the Seanad.  The Seventh Amendment of the Constitution, approved in a referendum in 1979, amended Article 18 by the insertion of new subsections which allow provision to be made by law for the distribution of the six university seats among the named universities and any other institutions of higher education in the State.  The purpose of the change in the Constitution in 1979 was to remove an obstacle in the way of legislation to deal with university reorganisation. <Col N="732" /> At that time it was proposed to abolish the NUI and establish its constituent colleges as separate universities. In order to do this it was necessary to amend the Constitution so that it would be possible to make alternative arrangements in relation to the Seanad seats allocated to the universities.</P>
    <P>Since 1979 there have been dramatic developments in relation to the third level educational structures.  The proposed abolition of the NUI, which was central to the constitutional change in 1979, has not been proceeded with.  The University of Limerick and Dublin City University have been established by statute as separate universities.  A new statutory base as been provided for the Dublin Institute of Technology and for the regional technical colleges.  The intervening years have also seen the emergence or development of a number of independent third level colleges.  In effect, there has been a proliferation of institutions, public and private, providing third level courses up to and including degree level.</P>
    <P>In reacting to these developments, it is important to take account of the total picture and not just selective elements. Simply to extend the Seanad vote to graduates of the two new universities could be criticised on the grounds that it sets up a new inequality and does not really address the lack of even handedness implicit in the present situation.  I am sure this would not be the intention of the proposers of the motion as Senator Quinn indicated.</P>
    <P>It seems to me any extension of the franchise would have to encompass not only graduates of the new universities but also graduates whose degrees are conferred by the National Council for Educational Awards.  It could also be argued that consideration should be given to degrees awarded by the Open University and similar institutions which have special relevance for second chance students.  Further, could we ignore the increasing number of students who graduate from third level institutions outside the State?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> Any review of university representation could hardly avoid a review of the logic involved in differentiating between the different kinds of third level educational awards, especially when the imperatives of our day tend to accentuate the value of technological education and training as compared with more purely academic achievement.  It would seem difficult to maintain the intrinsic difference between, for example, a degree and a diploma is such as to warrant extending the vote to the holder of one and withholding it from the holder of the other.  If we are to widen the Seanad University franchise, would we not be obliged to think in terms of all graduates of third level institutions, whether the final parchment is described as a degree, a diploma or a national certificate and whether the awarding authority is located in this country or elsewhere?</P>
    <P>Extending the franchise would inevitably have implications for the allocation of the existing six seats.  The Constitution envisages Senators being elected for universities or other institutions; extending the vote to graduates other than those of Dublin University and the NUI must involve altering the existing constituencies in some way.  If this question were to be opened up the question of introducing a more equitable ratio between the number of seats and the number of graduates could hardly be avoided.  One solution might be to include all graduates in a single constituency to fill the six seats.</P>
    <P>Over and above all this is the fundamental matter of the principle of university representation.  Put bluntly, what can now be the democratic justification for awarding a second parliamentary vote to a citizen who has had the good fortune as well as the intellectual capacity to achieve a university degree? It is universally acknowledged that University Senators have in general proved to be excellent legislators.  Many University Senators have provided an independent viewpoint which might not otherwise be expressed, or expressed so trenchantly, in Parliament.  Do these <Col N="734" /> factors provide sufficient justification for the present arrangements, or are there other considerations which should appropriately be included in the balance?</P>
    <P>Any review must also have regard to other proposals for restructuring of Seanad representation.  I am thinking in particular of the Fine Gael proposal that emigrant representation should be arranged via the Seanad.  This and other possibilities are being examined on foot of the Government's commitment to resolve the emigrant voting issue but no decisions have yet been taken.</P>
    <P>University representation in Parliament is of considerable antiquity.  Dublin University was represented in the old Irish Parliament.  Following the Act of Union the University returned one member to the United Kingdom Parliament and this was increased to two under the Reform Act, 1832.  In 1918 both the NUI and Queen's University, Belfast, were given representation at Westminster.  This was of course a short lived arrangement which was quickly overtaken by more momentous events. It is interesting to recall that the first and, I believe, the only holder of the NUI Westminster seat was Professor Eoin MacNeill.  In Britain university representation in the House of Commons continued up to 1948 when it was finally abolished.  University representation in Stormont survived until 1968, almost as long as the institution itself.</P>
    <P>Following independence here it was at first proposed that the two then existing universities should be represented in the new Senate.  It was however ultimately decided that there should be representation in the Dáil.  It is relevant to note that under this arrangement each elector had only one parliamentary vote which could be exercised either in the university constituency or the constituency of residence.  Representation for university graduates in the Dáil on this basis was suspended following the enactment of the new Constitution, which provides the basis for the existing position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> I have no difficulty with Seanad University representation.  However, from time to time people ask me why a person should be given the privilege of a Seanad vote simply on account of attending university, when less fortunate people cannot have that vote.  We may not necessarily agree with this, but it is a valid view.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the proposal in the motion is entirely unexceptionable in the existing context.  Nonetheless, the wider issues touched on must be addressed in one way or another.  At present I have no fixed views on where solutions may lie and the matter has not been considered by the Minister or the Government in recent times.  I am pleased to see the questions debated, particularly by the Members of this House to whom they are of most immediate relevance.  The present motion provides a useful opportunity for the commencement of the debate.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am looking forward to hearing Senators' views in the remainder of the debate.  The motion in the names of Senator Quinn and others will open up the debate and there will be numerous discussions on this issue in the months ahead.</P>

It was put to me that we are like a group of turkeys voting for Christmas, but I will outline the system I have devised whereby we can <Col N="736" /> involve the other university graduates without becoming sitting ducks.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn and myself hope for a long and happy life here and have no intention of going to the Dáil, so no Senator need consider us a threat in a Dáil constituency.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right to say we are privileged.  We are trebly privileged in that most of us are university graduates, we are elected by graduates and we belong to a privileged assembly.  To those who have been given a great deal one should expect a greater contribution, so one could say that is asked of us.  Garvin in his book on the Seanad said the University Senators contributed a disproportionate amount to debates and only the party leaders had more influence.  From the way he wrote that, I am not sure whether he thought that a good or bad thing; but from the election of the first University Senators in 1938 they have never been afraid of putting forward unpopular views and initiating controversial debates, which would have been extremely difficult for Members from political parties.</P>
      <P>I feel proud to say one of the first Senators elected from Dublin University, Professor Robert Rowlette, was a cousin of my father.  He was much involved in the early Seanad debates on controversial and liberal issues.  To this end it is important that these Senators should maintain their independence, because most graduates on the electoral roll feel this is an important part of the University franchise.</P>
      <P>Many of the previous University Senators were involved in bringing forward social change, but many Members of the current Seanad are not dissimilar from us University Senators and would support many of our views.  Many are graduates and members of professional bodies.  While they are elected on vocational panels, they have responsibilities and constraints we from the universities do not have.  This freedom is of great benefit to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> Because the franchise has been extended to graduates of the Dublin Institute of Technology with Trinity degrees, my constituents have a far wider range of interests and views than was the case when the Dublin University electoral register was confined to Trinity College graduates.  I welcome that.  If it was extended to people from Dublin City University we would give the franchise to many people skilled in computers, or if extended to Limerick University I could draw on the expertise of a constituent with expertise in equestrian matters when participating in a debate on that industry.  The broader range of view represented in the House the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that seats for universities in the House of Commons and Stormont were abolished a long time ago.  This should be a lesson for us all. We should look at what has happened in both institutions.  I think we are in a superior situation to them.  This is a point in favour of retaining the University seats.</P>
    <P>Various methods have been suggested by which new graduates could be brought onto the Seanad registers &mdash; for example, Dublin City University could join with Dublin University because over half the electorate of Dublin University is from County Dublin.  The myth that they are all in Botswana, Yemen or elsewhere is not true.  Limerick University should join with the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>However, I have a much simpler solution. Dublin City University and Limerick University could organise their own electoral roles.  When they elect their graduates the next time round, the Taoiseach should concede two of his nominations to these newly elected people.  This Government will run and run and continue to have the huge majority it has at present.  While the Taoiseach always appoints very distinctive people to the nominated seats &mdash; although some distinguished people have not always been as vocal as one would wish they would have been &mdash; I <Col N="738" /> could assure him that his nominees from those two universities would be as vocal as the present University Senators.  In 1991, in the last debate this House had on Seanad reform, Senator Manning said that while he felt that the University Senators had justified their existence, he would like to see a little democratic humility from us from time to time. Whatever these new Senators might be like, I am sure they would at least give a greater diversity of opinion than is always represented in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to support this motion by the University Senators.  I am also pleased that the Minister has accepted its concept in principle, but I hope he will do more than this.  I accept the Minister's point that there are wider issues to be addressed, but I hope that this will not take too long and that these issues will not mean too much of a delay in implementing the intent of this proposal. Other speakers have said that the intent is not simply to widen the electorate to the University of Limerick and Dublin City University but also to include the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges and I support this.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Senator Henry talk about being a turkey waiting for Christmas or a sitting duck.  I am not sure what kind of birds the University Senators are, but I agree that they do not sit on the fence.  They have certainly proved themselves.  This applies not only to the present incumbents but also to those who took those positions in the past.  They have made a fine contribution to the Seanad in the context of what it is intended to be &mdash; a House of expertise which brings a refinement to legislation which might not necessarily have been provided in the Dáil.  I am not suggesting that the Dáil would not be able to refine legislation but there is a role for the Seanad in examining in detail aspects of legislation.  Perhaps the Dáil is more confrontational.  I may be digging a hole which I should get out of at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> There is no doubt that what Senator O'Toole said is true, that it would be almost impossible to argue against this motion.  It is perfectly logical and democratic that the new universities should not be left out of the franchise which is available to the older universities.  The Seanad is not elected by universal franchise and there is a logic in having people selected to it.  Those of us who were elected on the panels were effectively selected in that we have a general vote like everyone else but also, as members of councils, we have a vote for candidates from the Seanad panels.  In this sense we have a double franchise.</P>
    <P>Legislation following the amendment to the Constitution in 1979 provides that the Minister for the Environment can introduce legislation to allow for alternative methods of election to those in Article 18.4.1º of the Constitution, which is the original Article under which University Senators are elected. Within the constitutional framework it is already possible to implement this desire.</P>
    <P>Because of the CAO, the CAS and the points system, there is a great deal of mobility among undergraduates, graduates and staff of universities. There is definitely a parity between people who enter the system, irrespective of what institution they attend.  As well as the degree courses, which are mainly studied for through universities &mdash; some of them are provided by the regional technical colleges &mdash; diploma courses have proved themselves as well and there is a great deal of expertise among graduates with diplomas.</P>
    <P>I looked for figures on graduates and undergraduates of the new universities. The figures given in the Higher Education Authority report, which was published last month, only relate to March 1992.  The report indicates that there were over 7,000 undergraduates in Limerick University and DCU.  I know this has risen considerably since then.  We are talking about a very sizeable sector of the third-level population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Both these universities, in particular, and also regional technical colleges have shown a great deal of innovation. Senator Henry referred to courses such as equine studies.  One could also mention courses like European studies, public administration, communications studies and many others which would contribute a great deal to the debates on various aspects of legislation which we deal with here.  The new universities have responded particularly well to the changing world outside and the evolution within the third-level sector.  They have been very much tuned in to our membership of the EU and have used programmes like Erasmus, Comet, Lingua and many others in a very effective way.  Because they are new, it has been easier for them to be more flexible than the older universities were able to be.  I know from my experience of the University of Limerick that they have used those programmes extensively and have a great deal of interaction with universities in other European countries and outside Europe &mdash; for example, in Japan.  They have something to offer which might not be as well developed in the older universities.  I know more about the University of Limerick than about the others.  In that institution there has been a very innovative approach and its graduates would be very familiar with changes in public administration, modern law, European institutions and so on and would have a great deal to contribute.  Regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and other providers of third-level courses also have a right to a franchise.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Cosgrave refer to the importance of helping young people to relate to the political system.  It is a privileged group of young people who are able to study in a third-level institution.  It would be a start if they were encouraged to be part of the political system in this way, but I hope it would spread further.  There is a strong onus on all of us as public representatives to do whatever we can to make the political system more meaningful <Col N="741" /> for young people, particularly in the context of high levels of unemployment and youth emigration.  It is good if University Senators can contribute to this.</P>
    <P>I admire our present University Senators for being willing to trudge their way further around the country extending their number of voters.  I and most other Senators have travelled the highways and byways in search of county councillors and I would not like to travel further.  The Members are courageous to do that.  I support the motion and I hope it will be possible to implement it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this motion.  This subject is worth discussing and I am sure we could have a longer debate on another day.  This motion is restrictive.  It should have included all third level institutions on the island if we believe in equal rights and equal opportunities.  Our situation is changing.  When our Constitution was drafted we could not have envisaged the present circumstances in relation to Europe and our relationship with the people in the North.  There are people from Belfast in the universities in Dublin and many people from Donegal and the Border counties attend the University of Ulster.</P>
      <P>We do not have a proper Seanad voting register.  People are sometimes confused about voting in Seanad elections and papers are often sent to people who are dead or living abroad.  I do not support the principle of registering on the day a university graduate leaves college. He or she will then have a vote in all Seanad elections although they live in other countries.  This is a loose arrangement which could be improved.  I would like to see those who attend and represent universities being the first to suggest proposals to improve the franchise for those involved.  I would like this opportunity to be given to graduates of the University of Ulster and I believe it would be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> I value the wisdom of the Taoiseach of the day in selecting Members of the House.  Senator Wilson is a great example of someone who has made a major contribution to this House and who adds flavour to current affairs.  We all value the contribution he makes. This is an opportunity to allow the University of Ulster to nominate people to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Any review of this matter must consider every aspect.  I believe every third level institution in Ireland should be treated equally.  I am sure the Minister is concerned about this.  One cannot give the franchise to those in privileged universities without looking at all third level institutions.  Any review should also welcome the opportunity to have consultations with the University of Ulster where there are substantial numbers involved in student exchange programmes. This could be an important approach.  I would welcome another opportunity to discuss and exchange views on this issue with the University of Ulster.  Perhaps today's discussion will initiate a further in-depth study.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we should extend the vote to graduates of Dublin City University and the University of Limerick.  I listened carefully to the points raised in the debate this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must consider the election panels for the Seanad and ask oneself if those elected reflect the graduates and if we need another body of people to elect graduates to represent them or to represent people.  I do not know the answer to these questions, but we must extend the debate to the universities.  Perhaps we should ask the presidents of the universities, the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges and any other private institution which is trying to reach university status to make a submission and then we could have a long debate.  We must be careful about graduates.  Many private institutions now have degree courses which are not necessarily valid.  Are the students who attend these colleges official graduates? <Col N="743" /> Many questions have been asked about some of these private institutions and the courses they offer.</P>
    <P>We must extend the franchise but we cannot do that without looking at the composition of the Seanad.  At present, 60 Senators are elected on five panels, of which six are university graduates. We must look at the number of young people at colleges.  At least 75 per cent of every leaving certificate class will attend a third level college.  The leaving certificate is the passport to third level education and everyone is moving in this direction.  Because soon at least 75 per cent of our population will have third level education, everyone in the country will have two votes, a third level college vote and a citizen's vote.  We must look at this issue in this context. Should this be the case or should everyone only have one vote and leave the composition of the Seanad as it stands with local authorities and Members of the Oireachtas as the main electorate for the panels?</P>
    <P>I do not have answers to these questions because I was more interested in opening up the discussion.  The more people who contributed to the debate, the more confused I became because more questions were being raised.  We should consult with the universities, the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges, the University of Ulster at Coleraine and the private institutions because many of these are now linked with Trinity College, Glamorgan University and other colleges in Wales.  We must be careful about who we describe as a graduate.  The number of students graduating with third level qualifications and the number of courses coming on stream mean we must ask what we mean by a graduate and we must increase the number of university seats. This will change the composition of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate.  If one is a graduate one is entitled to a vote as things stand at present.  However, this issue is deeper than that and I would like to have another debate on it and <Col N="744" /> get each faculty of every university to make a contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  It is appropriate that we, in the Upper House, should reflect on whether we embrace all the elements in society which were originally intended to be represented in the Seanad when the Constitution was enacted in 1937.</P>
      <P>In respect of university representation, I had the privilege of being here in 1965.  Nobody appreciates more than I the independent, vigorous questioning voice of the University Senators.  I say this without any reflection on my colleagues in the National Universities because I am one of those who has two votes at each Seanad election.  I am privileged in that sense.  The views of the Trinity College representatives, from the late Senator Sheehy-Skeffington to his distinguished successors today, are something I greatly respect but with which I seldom agree.  That, perhaps, is the greatest vindication of that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I would not want anything I say to be taken as a criticism of those who represented the universities in this House over the years &mdash; their contributions speak for themselves &mdash; but rather in terms of what has been emerging and evolving in Irish society since this panel system was created.  I was privileged to be a junior Minister in the Department of Education when we launched the first institutes of education, as they were then called, which included the Limerick Institute of Higher Education.  We had a goal, a design, a dream and a purpose, that it would be relevant not only to today and tomorrow as distinct from being conventional and having all the traditional faculties &mdash; medicine, architecture, law and so on.  We resisted views that suggested they should be conventional universities. Limerick pressed for this at the time because it wanted the status of a university city of the old Oxbridge type.  We put in place &mdash; I am privileged to have been involved in it &mdash; what was <Col N="745" /> then an institute relevant to the new Ireland, and what a success it has been. The whole complex was linked to the third level colleges of technology which have been a feature of development and which have made a major contribution to our economy and to the capacity of our young people.  That must be recognised by this generation.</P>
    <P>Nobody, whether they be a Trinity College or a National University of Ireland graduate or someone who did not graduate from either institution, could suggest for a moment that these people, be they from Dublin City University or the University of Limerick, should be deprived of the right to be represented in this House.  They would contribute a great deal of dynamism and new thinking to our debates and would provide the independence that is so obviously needed in any political system, particularly ours.</P>
    <P>The longer I am involved in politics the more I respect that independent and questioning voice.  However, I want to see this reflected in a much broader way.  The 1937 Constitution deliberately and positively discriminated in favour of Trinity College for a good reason; it did this to favour the Protestant minority. When I attended the National University of Ireland in the early to mid-1950s, it was still that way to a certain extent. Indeed, we had some fun with our Trinity colleagues.  However, all that has changed.  Irish society has changed, everything has changed.  I do not think any of the Trinity representatives, for instance, would now see themselves as representing only a separate, small, Protestant minority.  They would see that their representation as no more privileged than anybody else.</P>
    <P>If we are to change, and there is a great need for change within the university structure, I hope it will not be at the expense of that independent voice which I sometimes envy.  However, I have enjoyed the opportunity to express my independent views in this House.  I would not normally have been able to do this in the Dáil.  I hope we will not <Col N="746" /> do anything to undermine that independence.</P>
    <P>The Ireland of the future will be different from the Ireland of yesterday, much less of today.  I was greatly impressed by the suggestion that we could use the university representation to do what has been done in terms of getting distinguished people like Senator Wilson into this House.  Do we not want to hear the voices of the new University of Ulster and Queens University here?  This would be the real and authentic voice of Ireland.  Different traditions and political allegiances may be involved but we could at least hold open that prospect, although it might be rejected.</P>
    <P>We cannot just look at reforming the university panel system.  If we are looking for a change that will make the Seanad more reflective, we cannot confine it to the university panels.  If we are to have a referendum, which would be required to do this, we will have to look at the panel system at large.  If we do, we should ask ourselves if it is intended to be a vocational system where all voices would be heard representing all interests, acknowledging of course, that there is a political reality, or is it a system that can, and has been, used effectively for many years by people who hardly ever speak here but who know how to appeal and guarantee each vote on their electoral college?  That is hardly the purpose de Valera or the constitutional framers had in mind when they introduced this system.  We must look at this objectively and we should consider and make proposals that would give us a more representative, and hopefully, more dynamic Seanad.</P>

      <P>I have a few random thoughts on this issue, but I felt that since my colleagues have put this motion down and generously invited me to sign it, it behoves me to say a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives me particular pleasure to agree with my distinguished colleague, Senator O'Kennedy especially since I had forgotten he was actually one of my <Col N="747" /> constituents.  It is always nice to be able to agree with a constituent who wields a vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I regret to say that this is an occasion on which I find myself in unusual agreement with Senator O'Kennedy.</P>
      <P>This matter really needs to be considered in the overall light of a general review of Seanad Éireann, particularly the way people are elected to it.  I say this with no disrespect to Members who are elected on what I would see as the less democratic method of the other panels.  There is no doubt whatever that it is less democratic.  I recall the last Seanad where all the named officers had stood for at least one election and had been rejected by the Irish people.  The Cathaoirleach had stood in the general election and the European election and had been convincingly rebuffed in both. The Leas-Chathaoirleach, who I will of course not name, stood at the general election and was not elected, and the Leader of the House had actually stood for the Seanad on the panel system and had been rejected, but he was nominated to continue as Leader.  Then we were treated to a certain amount of instruction in the process of democracy from various sides of the House, but principally from the Government side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious point because attempts are sometimes made to diminish not just Seanad Éireann <i>in toto,</i> which regrettably does sometimes happen, but especially the Seanad representation which comes from the universities. I was involved with the first Peace Train that went to Belfast.  When we came back we were met by an emotional crowd.  Some of us were interviewed on the news for RTE television.  I used a formulation of words, when I was asked about what we were doing, saying that &ldquo;As an elected representative...&rdquo;. Vincent Browne of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> took me to task over this and wrote an <Col N="748" /> excoriating piece saying that we were the least democratically elected element of any national parliament and so forth. I wrote a detailed rebuttal which I sent through the post, faxed, hand delivered and sent by courier, but, needless to say, it never appeared in the paper.  So much for Vincent Browne's much vaunted right of reply, on which I heard him discoursing on the radio recently.</P>
    <P>It is important to say that we have real constituencies: in the University of Dublin it is about 25,000 graduates and in the National University of Ireland it is nearly 90,000 graduates.  There is no question of doubt that there is a disparity and there are historical reasons for that which have been amply explained. For a variety of reasons, partly because of the disparate nature of the electorate in the NUI and the difficulty of keeping up to date records and addresses, the voting record in the University of Dublin is about 66 per cent, while it is somewhere between 30 and 40 per cent for the National University of Ireland.  So, there is not quite the same discrepancy in the numbers actually participating in the election.</P>
    <P>The historical background was referred to by my distinguished colleague, Senator Quinn.  It is, of course, true that one of the reasons for establishing the Senate in 1922 and the Seanad in 1937 was to assuage the fears of the Protestant minority.  Senator O'Kennedy is quite right; I do not seek to represent any small, sectarian element in this country.  I have repeatedly told university graduates that one of the things that gives me the greatest pleasure is to see the way in which Trinity has become relevant to Ireland and to Dublin.  This can be seen physically in the bursting open of that gate which reaches out and draws people from Nassau Street into the University at the centre of our capital city.  Since the dropping of the ban Trinity has become overwhelmingly Roman Catholic in its undergraduate population.  It is also overwhelmingly a Dublin university, now drawing its student group largely from the northside of the city, so it is <Col N="749" /> representative.  It is a curious quirk that at the last election the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic electorate elected three members of the Church of Ireland to represent Dublin University.  This is an important indicator to people in the North of Ireland that we are not sectarian down here and that people are elected, I hope, on merit.  The fact that they are members of the Church of Ireland simply does not arise, but it is something that will be seen in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would advise caution in tinkering with the university seats and any proposal to reduce the representation of Trinity.  The universities &mdash; particularly Trinity which I know most about &mdash; contain in their electorate graduates of the Dublin Institute of Technology, so we have already reached out.  Speaking on the Bill which created the University of Limerick and Dublin City University, I said that their graduates must become voters, and I still support that position. Since Trinity has developed organically as a geographical constituency located in Dublin, it seems to me logical and reasonable that &mdash; at least as a first stage &mdash; the graduates of Dublin City University should come into the constituency of Dublin University while the graduates of Limerick University should go into the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to denigrate the other panels at all.  Very fine contributing parliamentarians have emerged through this system, although I do have doubts about it.  The phrase has been used by myself and others that it was a nursing home or rest home for retired politicians. That is part of the public perception.</P>
    <P>Confirming something that Senator O'Kennedy said very honestly, I remember at the last election the president of the Royal Irish Academy &mdash; one of the principal nominating bodies &mdash; put his name on the ballot paper but did not receive one vote.  Surely there is something odd where the president of a nominating body can go forward for election and not receive a single vote. <Col N="750" /> We should look at the possibility of strengthening representation in the way that university representation has been strengthened; that is, by giving some degree of enfranchisement to ordinary members of the different nominating bodies.  In other words, the motor industry, trade unions and professions should not just have the impotent glory of power of nomination, but should have some right to participate in the actual electoral process.  That might also do away with the nonsense whereby people get elected with 66 votes which have to be multiplied by 1.5 million to make it look credible and realistic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle enshrined in the motion.  It is a difficult matter to address and I will not go into the history of it.  I am sorry that I was not here earlier for the full debate to hear what the proposers of the motion had to say.  This issue has been the subject of discussion for quite a considerable length of time both publicly and indeed within the Fine Gael Party.  Since 1979, with the development of Limerick University, Dublin City University, the Dublin Institute of Technology and all the regional technical colleges, a situation has developed where many university graduates are not in a position to vote for candidates on the university panels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was hoping to hear very firm proposals from Senator Norris as to how he would address this issue and I was disappointed that he did not go into the specifics of it.  I would not like to discriminate in any way against anybody or any grouping, but there is no proportionality at the moment and neither is there equality in so far as some graduates are not being given the opportunity to vote.  The Minister highlighted in his <Col N="751" /> speech all the difficulties of addressing the issue.  The issue was partly dealt with by having a constitutional amendment in 1979 but the realities are that nothing has been done to regularise the situation by introducing legislation in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I wonder if at this stage we have not gone long beyond the NUI and Dublin University panels, because we have a variety of third level educational establishments. The Minister mentioned the difference between a diploma and a degree; quite frankly, I think that somebody who has only got a diploma should not necessarily have a vote for the University panel.  We should accept that the fundamental basis for a vote is a degree, so that graduates of colleges that grant degrees should be entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>I just wonder if the whole idea of NUI and Dublin University should not be abolished in favour of having six University seats and letting all university graduates vote for those six seats.  The point that Senator Norris raised is an important one; the fact that so many graduates from Trinity would be more or less the current electorate.  However, it would not discriminate against people of quality such as the three university Senators who represent Trinity in this House at the moment.  People like Senators Henry, Norris and Ross, because of their profile and ability, would still get elected on the wider panel I outlined.</P>
    <P>That is one way in which the matter could be addressed.  That may not satisfy the various interests of the universities who may have other angles and hidden agendas, but it is a simple matter at this stage.  We have to come out of our historical position.  We are moving a long way now; history is part of what we are but we also have to progress towards the 21st century.  It is important to look at it this way.  Perhaps this is a simplistic approach.</P>
    <P>In principle, I support the motion and compliment the Independent Senators on tabling it.  I am sorry that I was not here to hear the various views put forward, <Col N="752" /> except those of Senator Norris in his usual eloquent style.  I was hoping to hear something specific from him, but nevertheless the issue deserves serious consideration.  I am confident that the three current Senators from Trinity or the three NUI Senators would not be hostile to an open forum.  People such as they would get elected without any difficulty.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to sum up.  The intention of tonight's debate was to open up the discussion. The Minister has referred to the fact that that is exactly what it has done and I appreciate his view.  I thank the Minister for not opposing this because it has given us an opportunity to have that open debate without confrontation.</P>
      <P>I wish to answer a couple of points that were raised.  One of those was the number of electors for the university seats.  At the moment NUI has an electorate of 87,000 while Trinity College has 25,000.  As Senator Norris explained, there is a higher proportion of voting in Trinity, so the gap is not as large as that.</P>
      <P>There is no need for a change in the Constitution, as Senator O'Kennedy thought.  That change took place in 1979 and, therefore, there is no need to change it in order to do what we propose, that is, change the arrangements. A change in the Constitution would be needed if, as Senator McGowan suggested, we were to include the University of Ulster, because the words in the Constitution as it stands after the 1979 amendment refer to institutes of higher education in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased with what Senator Finneran and Senator Cosgrave said about emigrants, because the only way emigrants may vote is through the six university seats.  Any graduates of the NUI or TCD who have emigrated have a right to vote, and many do so.  I was pleased with Senator Norris's reference to advise caution as regards Trinity College. The objective in 1937 has been achieved to a large extent and it would be a shame to tinker with it without a <Col N="753" /> great deal of caution.  I was impressed by Senator Henry's suggestion of an alternative whereby the Taoiseach would generously allocate two of the 11 seats to the new universities.  I am sure that will be taken up with great enthusiasm by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>There were hints about it being undemocratic.  I believe the US Senate is not democratic, but it is regarded as a fair and capable way of running a nation and of having a Constitution. I appreciate this evening's debate.  Senator O'Toole referred to the fact that no sustainable argument was made against this concept.  I, too, believe no sustainable argument has been made against it.</P>
      <P>Another point I would like to make reminds me of the time I was taught to play rugby by Fr. Hegarty in Newbridge College, although Senator Dardis is not here to confirm that I ever played there. When training us Fr. Hegarty spoke about the defending team and the attacking team.  I asked him what he meant by this.  Did it mean where the ball or the team was?  He said no, the attacking team is the team in possession of the ball, even on its own line.  We now have an opportunity to have the ball in our hands, although we have failed to do anything with it since 1979.  I propose, encourage and urge the Government to grab hold of this opportunity because it has the ball in its possession. If it is going to score the goals which can be scored, which will bring democracy to all graduates, it should do so.  I urge the Minister to take that into account in discussions at Government level.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne, for taking the time to listen to what I have to say.  I am aware that his senior colleague is busy filling cross-Border roads today in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention a request, of which his Department is aware, made in 1987 for the provision of a taxi rank in Navan.  Work, reports and letters were forthcoming from the different Ministers in the Department over the years and in 1990 some were concerned that the Garda might have a role to play in the issue. The Assistant Commissioner replied to representations by saying that:</P>
      <P>Section 84 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, confers power on the Commissioner, with the consent and signature of the Minister for the Environment, to make bye-laws in relation to stands for street service vehicles. Draft bye-laws for the town of Navan were forwarded to the Department of the Environment on 15th of January 1990.</P>
      <P>In early 1991 further representations were made to the Minister's Department. The following response was given by the then Minister, Pádraig Flynn.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Review Committee to consider the legal structure applying to the operation of small public service vehicles generally.</P>
      <P>The Committee are affording an opportunity to people to make their views known and will accept written submissions up to 28 June, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of areas such as Navan, in so far as the availability of a taxi service is concerned, will <Col N="755" /> be a matter of priority to the Committee.</P>
    <P>It was a matter of priority to the committee in 1991 and people had until the end of June to make submissions.  That letter from the Department was dated 25 June 1991.  Six months later, on 8 January 1992, a letter from a new Minister for the Environment, Deputy O'Hanlon, stated:</P>
    <P>As you are aware an Inter-Departmental Committee was established earlier this year [he should have said earlier the previous one because he was a year behind what was happening] to review the laws relating to the operation of small public service vehicles generally.  The Committee submitted interim recommendations in September 1991 and Regulations were made on 24th October last to give effect to those interim recommendations. [Such ranks were for the original towns.]</P>
    <P>Among other features these Regulations applied taximeter status to twelve cities and towns where public hire vehicles already operate.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the position in Navan and in many other major urban areas where public hire services do not exist at present.  I expect that this particular issue will be addressed in the Inter-Departmental Committee's final report which I expect to receive in March next.</P>
    <P>This particular report was to be made available in March 1992.  We now move on to April of that year.  I refer to a letter from 22 April 1992 from the Minister's present boss, Deputy Smith, or the third Minister &mdash; I am getting confused with all the Ministers involved in this issue &mdash; which states:</P>
    <P>You will be aware that a comprehensive review of the laws applying to the operation of small public service vehicles generally is being carried out at the present.  [It should have been finished seven months previously] The examination of the respective <Col N="756" /> roles of hackneys and taxis will be a key factor in this review.  An interdepartmental committee has been established to carry out the review and it is expected that their final report will be submitted to me in the near future.</P>
    <P>A year later further representations were made to the Minister.  He replied:</P>
    <P>The position is that I am at present finalising my consideration of the report of interdepartmental committee established to review the law applying to the operation of taxis and hackneys and reaction to that report from many interested parties and individuals.  A central theme of the report is the acknowledgement that many of the decisions in relation to taxis and hackneys should be taken at local level as opposed to central level. The question of the introduction of taxi service to individual urban areas is one of the areas where local authorities could be more directly involved.  I hope to be in a position in the near future to take decisions on a range of issues.</P>
    <P>That letter was dated 28 June 1993.  The words &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo; were used a lot in 1992 and again in 1993.  In October 1993 a senior civil servant in the Department replies to a further query.  That letter states: &ldquo;At present the Minister is considering the report of the interdepartmental committee to which you made a submission requesting taximeters.&rdquo; Lo and behold, it is still considering the report.  In May 1994, in reply to a Deputy looking for the same type of status for other areas, the Minister replied: &ldquo;The preparation of regulations to implement a number of changes to the system governing the operation of small public service vehicles is at present at an advanced stage.&rdquo;  After five years we have reached &ldquo;an advanced stage&rdquo;, a prolonged pregnancy, without any real result.  On 8 September 1994 a letter was sent by the office of the Minister.  This letter states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> The introduction of a taxi service in areas such as Navan is one of a range of issues which I have targeted for a decision as soon as possible in the context of the adoption of new structures for the licensing and operation of small public service vehicles.  The report of the interdepartmental group which reviewed the existing structures recommended that the function of declaring an area to be a taximeter area should be vested in local authorities.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that people see us as being ineffective in dealing with problems as they should be dealt with?  I hope the Minister will take this opportunity to announce the creation of these taximeter areas so that people who are in this business for the last number of years are given status and credibility and they can pull up in areas that are earmarked for them.  They are providing a badly needed service.  If Navan had a taxi rank the general public would know where to contact a taxi and we would not be leaving ourselves open to all the abuse that goes in politics today.</P>
    <P>We have been asked to do a particular job and it is now seven years from the date the first letter was written in connection with this issue.  I am raising this matter because I have an interest in the affairs of the town of Navan. However, there are many other towns that are looking for the same status. How long must we examine the report produced two years ago without making a decision on it?  What is the delay?  I ask the Minister to announce a positive result for those people who have been hounding his officials for the last seven years.  This would reduce an enormous amount of the cost involved in producing these replies from public representatives who are contacted by various parties on a continuous basis in every town which is looking for this status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Senator Farrelly for raising this issue and for giving me an <Col N="758" /> opportunity to outline the measures which have been taken to secure changes to the system of licensing taxis and hackneys &mdash; including action being proposed to facilitate the smooth introduction of full taxi services to towns such as Navan.  Before doing so, I would like to clarify one specific point.  It has been suggested that the needs of towns such as Navan can be met by the provision of taxi ranks to be used by the existing private hire or hackney operators who work in the area.  This, however, is not legally permissible under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>Taxi ranks can only be provided in taximeter areas in accordance with bylaws made by the Garda Commissioner. At present, there are 16 taximeter areas in the country.  As Navan is not one of these, taxis are not licensed to operate there and taxi ranks cannot legally be provided.  Before such ranks can be made available, it will be necessary to create a taximeter area for the town and to arrange for the grant of taxi licences in the area.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive regulations under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, governing the licensing of taxis and hackneys have been in force since 1963 and significant changes to the licensing system were made in 1978.  Towards the end of the 1980s, it became clear that further changes were required and in 1991 the then Minister set up an interdepartmental committee to carry out an in-depth examination governing the operation of taxis and hackneys.</P>
      <P>Prior to the commencement of that review, there was widespread demand for new initiatives, including demands for full taxi services to be provided in towns such as Navan.  It was decided at the time to defer such action pending completion of the review and the possible introduction of changes to the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the committee which carried out the review was published in July 1992 and is available in the Oireachtas Library.  It contains a total of 64 recommendations.  One of these was that decisions to apply taximeter area <Col N="759" /> status to particular urban areas should be devolved entirely to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Because of the extent of the changes recommended and the high level of interest in the matter, it was decided at that time to allow a period for interested persons and bodies to consider the issues and to make submissions. The Minister said that the report's recommendations did not necessarily represent the only way forward and that he would be looking at all the options, taking account of any views which interested persons or bodies might wish to offer.  As part of the consultation process, the Department received written submissions from many interested persons and bodies and the Minister personally held meetings with all the main interest groups.</P>
    <P>The review and consultation process is now completed and regulations will be made in the very near future to introduce a number of fundamental changes to the system of licensing taxis and hackneys.  These regulations will include a new and improved mechanism for the introduction of taxi services to towns like Navan.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism that interim action has not been taken to introduce full taxi services into Navan.  Such interim action was deliberately deferred because the mechanism in existing regulations for creating taximeter areas is <Col N="760" /> unsatisfactory.  It is not simply a matter of converting existing hackney licences into taxi licences.  The existing legal mechanism would require the Garda Commissioner to grant a taxi licence to every applicant who meets the criteria. This could result in an over-supply of taxis in an area and would not be in the interests of the people of Navan or the existing operators who provide hackney services.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the demand for a full taxi service in Navan.  Requests for action have been received from the hackney operators and correspondence has also been received from the urban council seeking the early introduction of a full taxi service.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House and Senator Farrelly that the Minister expects to be in a position very shortly to reply positively to the council and to supply details of new measures being introduced to facilitate the smooth introduction of a full taxi service in the town.</P>
