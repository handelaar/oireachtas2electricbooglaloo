      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide grant assistance from the national lottery towards the cost of the construction of a clubhouse for Cabinteely GAA Club.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Cosgrave as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that many papers dealing with European affairs were laid before the Seanad on both yesterday's and today's Order Papers, some of which are of considerable importance. I felt for a long time that the way in which this and the other House &mdash; this House has a better track record in this regard &mdash; debates European matters of importance leaves a great deal to be desired.  Once again I wish to raise my party's proposal that Members of the European Parliament &mdash; it may not be appropriate at the moment &mdash; would have the right of audience in this House.  We could then discuss some of the important matters referred to in the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>I also noticed on the Order Paper yesterday, and I thought it would have been raised by the parties on the opposite side, under the heading &ldquo;Papers Laid before the Seanad&rdquo;, the filling of a casual vacancy in the European Parliament.  I am surprised at the silence from the Government benches on this matter and, lest their silence is misconstrued, may my party offer our commiserations to Ms Bernie Malone on her election to the European Parliament?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly like to back up Senator Manning's point.  Even on today's Order Paper, two of those papers are of extreme interest.  One concerns the disposal of State lands and property by the Department of Finance. That report hides a multitude of matters every year.  It is involved in various practices such as the disposal of old Garda stations and residences, national schools and other property in which the State has huge investments.  One often sees in that report large properties changing hands for sums as small as £5 or £10 and I wish to draw the attention of the House to it. I am also intrigued by the Resolution on conscientious objection in the member states of the European Union.  Perhaps the Leader could explain the details of this paper to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader consider having a full discussion on the Programme for Competitiveness and Work?  The development and negotiation of that programme <Col N="539" /> involved the elected democratic representatives of the State.  Although&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the farmers think they are the only ones who can negotiate with the Government, in these talks the Government negotiated with all the social partners.  This has created problems for some Members of the House. However, I would like to knock on the head the notion that democracy was not represented.  These talks were organised by, and with, the Government and all decision-making in which it was involved took place in the same way.  It is important to have a discussion on the outcome of those negotiations as soon as possible because there is much uninformed and misinformed comment in the media on the negotiations and the outcome and it is time to correct that.</P>
      <P>On a related matter I ask the Leader of the House for a full debate in this House on the public service.  It is time that people recognised the value for money the public service and elected public representatives give at all levels.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, Item 5 on the Order Paper.  I suspect it might originally have been called the programme for work and competitiveness until some bright spark discovered the initials would be PWC and decided to change it.</P>

      <P>Is Senator O'Toole seriously suggesting that our elected representatives should not have a say in how this programme might be perceived or an <Col N="541" /> input to it?  Of course they should.  If we are to be consistent with the spirit of open government professed by the Government side it is important to discuss the programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Time should also be made available for a discussion on the draft final report of the DTI which is widely available and clearly indicates there has been some extraordinary rifling of the Structural <Col N="543" /> Funds by a number of State bodies with a view to looking after their particular activities.</P>

It is important to debate this matter at the earliest opportunity as it affects so many people.  In my constituency a number of people are concerned about their jobs and in my neighbouring constituency of Tipperary it is far more worrying for the people concerned.</P>

I am sure the Whips will be able to accommodate a debate on the ESRI report, the same applies to the DTI report.

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 20, to delete &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to reduce the penalty for common assault in the District Court from 12 months to three months.  A common assault may be a gesture, a slap or punch, or any action which results in actual bodily harm.  An assault which occasions actual bodily harm may consist of an action resulting in a bruise, a cut, an abrasion or something of that kind.  By definition it is a minor matter.  An assault which does not inflict any bodily harm does not merit sending someone to prison for six to 12 months.  We consider it to be a minor offence because it is dealt with in the District Court.  It could be dealt with in the Circuit Court if a greater penalty is necessary for common assault.</P>
      <P>We are looking at this in the context of over-crowded prisons.  In most cases it is accepted that when someone is put in prison another prisoner must be released. The substitution of three months for 12 months would be more than adequate when dealing with a minor offence.</P>

      <P>In relation to this amendment, the judge may use his discretion to impose a fine of £1,000 or a 12 months prison sentence.  However, he cannot impose a fine in excess of £1,000 or a sentence longer than 12 months. Common assault varies and the judge may decide its definition.  Three months might be fairer.</P>

      <P>I have difficulty with this amendment because the sole purpose of the section is to increase the penalty for common assault.  The penalty under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, is six months. In the light of the representations made to me by the prosecution authorities to <Col N="547" /> the effect that the existing penalty is insufficient to deal with the more serious offences under this heading, I propose to increase the sentence to 12 months.  I also agree with Senator Enright that the judge has the discretion to either apply the full 12 month period or something less.  The amendment would reduce what is in the Bill now to three months.  This is in opposition to what I feel and to what has been represented to me as being necessary at this time.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

It is a local court which saves enormous expense and inconvenience to members of the public, whichever side they are on.  People can go the District Court in their local area and have their case dealt with there.  It is the appropriate court to use and a 12 month sentence is the maximum which can be imposed.  We are aware of cases which have been by district judges.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment regardless of Senator Honan's pleadings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;Where the court is satisfied that parents of juvenile offenders should be asked to account for their role in controlling their child or children, such parents may be required by the court to give account to the court for their role and the court may, if the court deems fit, direct such parents to be at home or such place of domestic residence as the court directs with their child or children at such times or part of such times and in such circumstances as the court directs the child or children to be at home or such other place of domestic residence as the court directs.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Over the last number of years problems have arisen concerning juvenile offenders whose parents, regrettably, have separated.  In addition, some juvenile offenders come from single parent families and homes where there are many problems.  There is nobody to take control of children and parents should have direct responsibility.  While the situation varies, judges occasionally try to make parents responsible for a juvenile convicted of a crime and there should be a provision in this section to give a judge power to use his discretion in making parents or guardians responsible for the actions of their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People may say it is impossible for parents to be responsible for their children when they are out at night.  Everybody should be aware of the fact, however, that if young people are committing offences there is a responsibility on the parent or guardian to know where they are.  This would give the courts an opportunity to make parents responsible for the actions of their children.  It would also make certain that in future a judge could impose a sentence while making it clear to parents that they will have to be <Col N="549" /> responsible for their children.  It is a type of probation which could be of help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some concerns about this amendment.  First, what is the definition of a juvenile offender?  Is it somebody under 14, 16 or 18?  By not including an age it is open to interpretation. Second, even though we all know parents have a duty and responsibility for their children, is that duty endless in all circumstances?  Do you force parents to place the child under house arrest?  That would take responsibility from the legal authorities whose duty it is to prosecute crimes and mete the punishment required.  I understand what Senator Enright is trying to achieve but the biggest problem with juvenile crime is drug abuse of some form or another. When it gets to that level parents have no control over it.  What is needed is rehabilitation in a totally different environment from that of a prison.  This amendment will not achieve what it seeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy for what Senator Enright is trying to achieve in this amendment but I have a number of difficulties with it. The amendment does not have a penalty provision so, if it were to be accepted and inserted in the Bill, what would happen if the parents chose to ignore it?  Second, a curfew is suggested but who would enforce it?  Third, are we not entering dangerous territory if we make people who have not committed an offence responsible unless we intend to manufacture an offence of not controlling one's children?  Those are the problems I would have to overcome if I accepted the amendment.  I am against inserting a provision in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993, which deals with parental responsibility because a comprehensive juvenile justice Bill with over 150 sections is currently being drafted by the Department of Justice.  We are working in close co-operation with the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, and her officials because obviously the Department of Education has a central <Col N="550" /> role to play in any decisions the Government makes in relation to juvenile justice.</P>
      <P>There are huge constitutional issues involved and it is a very emotive issue. We are dealing with a number of sets of parents, first those who are good and loving and give everything to their children. They are there all the time encouraging them but, despite all their efforts, one child goes wrong.  I do not think you can blame those parents for something that happens to their children which is very much outside their control.</P>
      <P>Second, there are parents with poor parenting skills, perhaps because of the lack of social support in their community. We are taught to be all types of things but we are not taught to be parents, something often learned by trial and error.  We are not trying to deal with that type of parent in the Bill because we need to give them the support and help they need.  That is where a number of other agencies come into play.</P>
      <P>Third, there is a core of parents that are really the subject of Senator Enright's comments; they know their children are involved in crime yet do not control them or make any effort to find out where they are.  Even worse, they actively encourage their children to engage in crime, using them, for instance, as look-outs or couriers if they are involved in abuse of drugs. It is a huge area.  A couple of months ago I attended a seminar on this issue with social workers, child psychologists, health board officials, teachers and other educationalists.  They were of the opinion that legislation must be comprehensive as well as taking into account the fact that other agencies are involved apart from the agencies of the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take care to ensure that whatever legislation emerges will withstand any constitutional challenge and will be implementable.  That is what I am actively pursuing and I have been working hard with the Minister for Education on this.  Most people agree that a Bill with over 150 sections is comprehensive legislation and not something we can treat lightly.  In light of the fact that it is <Col N="551" /> being pushed strongly, that it is a priority in my Department and will be coming forward this year, I do not want to preempt it in any way by inserting a section in this Bill which does not look at all the areas and issues involved in parental responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on a juvenile justice Bill and the fact that she is working in close co-operation with the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach.  Such a Bill is necessary and I agree with the Minister's analysis of the various types of parents. We should support parents with poor parenting skills.  The Minister also spoke about parents who accept their responsibilities and seem to be doing everything they should, yet have problem children.</P>
      <P>Recently, I spoke to the Garda in my area about the case of a juvenile who admitted committing a number of robberies and was questioned.  At the end of the questioning session the boy's father was asked if he had anything to say, his only comment was that the child should not have admitted the robberies.  The Garda said there was no point in bringing the child to court because they did not feel any punishment would be meted out. Obviously, having a parent with that attitude, the child would continue to commit crimes.  The mother in the case was very concerned but terrified of the father so she needed support and help because if anybody would do something about it she would.  I am glad that the Minister, in bringing forward this comprehensive legislation with 150 sections, will try to deal with this type of thing.</P>
      <P>Parents must accept responsibility for their children.  We should try to help people who do not accept it and teach them parenting skills.  We must let it be known that it is not acceptable for parents to believe that they have no responsibility for their children's actions.</P>

They are convicted and are thus offenders.</P>

      <P>I am referring to young people from about 13 years of age.  In this amendment I am seeking that such parents should be asked to account, that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; be required to do so.  I am not asking that they &ldquo;should&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be required but that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; be required by the court to give account to the court for their role.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there is no method whereby a judge can compel parents to keep an eye on their children.  In many instances when the judge gives the offender probation or adjourns the case for six or 12 months the child continues to commit crimes.  That is a tragedy.  If a judge is interested in the cases that come before him or her, he or she may take time with such cases and put the offenders on probation.  I have seen young offenders, particularly boys, who, when a judge establishes good communication with them, stay away from crime with the proper probation service. It is hard to see that happening in Dublin where there are so many cases before the court that a judge does not have the time for such an approach.  In rural areas, however, young offenders can benefit when judges take an interest and are anxious to see them being rehabilitated.</P>
      <P>I believe it was Spencer Tracy who, in the film &ldquo;Boys' Town&rdquo;, said there is no such thing as a bad boy.  That should probably be &ldquo;a bad person&rdquo; in the new vernacular.  There are many areas where a judge can oversee the comings and goings of young people on probation.  I have seen instances where judges, without the benefit of this legislation, have instructed parents to supervise their children with regard to what time they must be home each day and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No penalties are imposed in this amendment.  It seeks to give the court <Col N="553" /> some authority over parents who are careless and pay no attention to the conduct of their children.  The wording is &ldquo;may&rdquo; not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; so that the court is afforded the opportunity to put a juvenile on probation and, in the course of that probation, it can adjourn the case indefinitely on foot of reports and before a final sentence is imposed.</P>

      <P>It might be helpful if I explain the background to section 11 and section 13 which is related to it.  In section 11 it is a key consideration that the person must enter or intend to enter as a trespasser.  Under the amendment trains, buses and so forth would be included.  These are vehicles to which members of the public have access and the question of entering as a trespasser would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where somebody has entered a building as a trespasser &mdash; in other words the person is somewhere he or she should not be &mdash; it is easy to imagine circumstances where a reasonable inference can be drawn that the trespass was with intent to commit an offence.  However, where a person enters, for example, a bus to which members of the public generally <Col N="554" /> have access, how in practical terms could it be proved that this was with intent to commit an offence unless an offence was committed or attempted?  In either case existing law in relation to the offence would cover the situation.  One possibility might be if somebody entered a bus in possession of an offensive weapon with intent to assault the driver.  Again it is hard to see how that could be proved unless there was an assault or an attempted assault.  In any event, the law already prescribes penalties for possession of unlawful and offensive weapons.</P>

      <P>In our discussions on Report Stage in the Dáil the view was expressed that the definition of a public place was too narrow in the sense that it might not cover, for example, people entering a derelict building and behaving in a manner which causes difficulties for nearby residents.  I undertook to look again at the definition of public place in that context.</P>
      <P>We had lengthy discussions with the draftsman but we keep encountering the difficulty that any attempt to widen the definition further would carry a danger that it would cover too wide a range and that virtually everywhere would become a public place.  However, the difficulty with derelict buildings referred to in the Dáil should be met to a considerable extent by section 13 and this amendment to it.  Under section 13 it will be an offence for a person to trespass on any building or its surroundings in such a manner that causes or is likely to cause fear in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 18 is to give the Garda similar powers to those available in section 8 where they suspect a person is behaving contrary to section 13.  Where, for example, a gang of youths <Col N="556" /> is congregated in a derelict building in a manner that caused fear in local residents the gardaí would have the power to direct the gang to leave and it would be an offence to refuse to comply with that direction.  In many cases this would be a practical approach to the problem and I hope the amendment is acceptable to the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 is one of a series of amendments which the Progressive Democrats have proposed seeking to reduce the penalties for particular offences under the Bill.  This is against the general trend in the Dáil and similar amendments there did not meet with much success.  It is not unreasonable, particularly where an offender has a history of this type of offence, for the courts to be in a position to impose a maximum penalty of 12 months.  In the circumstances, I am not disposed to accept amendment No. 19.</P>

A group of young people may be acting in a particular manner but it is not specified how long they have to leave.  They must &ldquo;leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned.&rdquo;  I see the point the Minister makes when a group of youths is causing problems and I accept that should not be allowed.</P>

The Minister is aware of different people's viewpoints and some people would react to a minor, trivial matter by feeling that they are being threatened which might not be the case.

I am concerned about the wording &ldquo;use or threaten to use&rdquo; and that they can be fined or given 12 months' imprisonment or, on conviction on indictment, five years' imprisonment.  A term of five years is a serious punishment for threatening to use violence.  The scope with regard to affray is too broad in section 16.</P>

      <P>This is one of the amendments that I will not put to a vote but I will be calling a vote on Report Stage.  However, I put it to the Minister now for consideration. This section deals with blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces. Section 17 (1) states: &ldquo;It shall be an offence for any person who, with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another, makes any unwarranted demand with menaces.&rdquo;  I agree with that.  Section 17 (2) states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a demand with menaces shall be unwarranted unless the person making it does so in the belief&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that he has reasonable grounds for making the demand, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  that the use of the menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great threat in this section with the use of the words &ldquo;the use of menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand.&rdquo;  If somebody owes money I agree they can be brought to court, prosecuted and may be liable for costs.  I agree that if the debt is not paid a judgment will be obtained.  I agree with the names being published in Stubb's Gazette and that judgments may be recorded against debtors and charges registered on their <Col N="560" /> property.  I also agree with the State giving a sheriff power to seize goods.</P>
    <P>This section implies that the use of menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand.  There is a problem in Dublin with regard to moneylending where people use threats of violence to collect debts owed to them.  Could a moneylender use threats to reinforce his demand to collect a debt?  Allowing menaces as a proper means for reinforcing a debt due is a matter of great concern. Often property has been damaged and destroyed by people collecting debts. That is wrong.  There are methods of debt collection which have become established in Ireland.  In former days debts were collected forcibly and unlawful means were used to collect them.  This section poses a real danger and causes great concern.</P>

      <P>An amendment with similar wording to this was discussed in the Dáil and in the Select Committee.  I have had a lengthy opportunity to examine it, from Select Committee to Report Stage in the Dáil until now.  While I accept that in the everyday use of language the wording of section 17 (2) (a) (ii) may appear strange, I am advised there are sound legal reasons for the inclusion of this provision in the Bill. For example, the use of a solicitor's letter threatening legal action could be regarded as the use of menaces to reinforce a demand for payment of a debt.  Where a debt was legitimately owed this would obviously be a proper procedure to follow.  However, if this paragraph was deleted there would not be a defence available to someone who sends such a letter in good faith.</P>
      <P>As I said, I have had a long time to consider this matter.  There is no point in Senator Enright holding out for a change on Report Stage because I have had ample opportunity to consider the amendment and the section.  I will not accept the amendment and I can see no possibility of changing my mind between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Some years ago &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; presented a programme on the powers of the Revenue.  One of the last items left in a house visited by the sheriff was a bottle of stout, which was broken by those seizing the goods.  The sheriff had seized all the family's goods and damaged much of their property.  This section as it stands gives <i>carte blanche</i> to someone using physical force to collect debts. No one should be able to physically threaten anyone else.  The use of menaces goes beyond the use of force in intimidating another.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, is introducing legislation to protect people from moneylenders, their power and conduct. Other legislation is also being introduced. The Minister will have seen where big corporations would almost go so far as to use a battering ram to collect debts. That is not right and is intolerable in a democratic society.  The Minister said a solicitor's letter might be called a menace.  Such letters no longer carry much threat.</P>

      <P>There is a danger there. I am not getting my point across as well as I would have hoped.  No one should be entitled to use menaces to reinforce a demand for a debt due.  There are proper, normal legal channels available.  One can be committed to prison for failure to pay a debt.  We will not change that this morning but we have a duty to ensure no one can use menaces, meaning a physical threat to another person.  That will be copperfastened by this legislation, although the Minister does not intend that.</P>

      <Col N="562" /> After this Bill is passed there may be a menacing, physical threat to someone of advanced years with high blood pressure. That person may get a heart attack which brings on death.  Those are the circumstances that concern me.  No one should be able to reinforce demands with menaces.  Other sections of this Bill seek to protect law-abiding citizens at home. Thousands of such citizens are in debt and their number is rising.  They should not live with the fear that someone could use menaces to reinforce a demand for collection of that debt.</P>

Nevertheless one could not rule out the possibility that in rare cases such offences would properly be within the scope of the District Court and could be tried summarily.

      <P>In page 9, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>18.  (1)  It shall be an offence for any person to have in his possession or under his control any thing or recorded information, in circumstances which give rise to the reasonable inference, that such possession or control was for the purpose of the commission of a serious offence.</P>
      <P>(2)  In this section, &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; means any offence which is punishable on indictment by a term of five years imprisonment or any greater punishment.</P>
      <P>(3)  In a prosecution for an offence under this section, it shall not be necessary for the complaint, charge or verdict to specify any serious offence, where the court or jury trying the offence is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the possession or control was for the purpose of committing any one or more of a number of serious offences.</P>
      <P>(4)  A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a term of 3 years imprisonment or a fine of £50,000, or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, if somebody is found, for instance, with documents noting the daily routes of the Taoiseach or the Minister, or with a plan of their house or apartment, he or she cannot be charged with anything unless it can be shown that they were conspiring with somebody else, or if it can be shown what exactly they intended to do with the documentation. If somebody is found with a map of one's house or if they have drawings of the various rooms or circuits of one's alarm system, the Garda cannot do anything about it unless it can be shown that the <Col N="564" /> person was conspiring with somebody else, or it can be shown exactly what they intended to do.  If this section was inserted, it would enable the Garda to nip many things in the bud because they would not have to wait for something to happen before somebody could be charged.  There is precedent for the term &ldquo;...in circumstances which give rise to the reasonable inference...&rdquo;, under the Firearms Act and in other statutes.</P>

      <P>I have much sympathy with the amendment.  I am sure Senator Honan appreciates that the issues raised by the amendment, impinging as they do on the law generally in relation to attempt, conspiracy, etc., are extremely complex.  I am reluctant to proceed with an amendment along the proposed lines without having had the benefit of a detailed review of issues in this area generally.  As I indicated in the other House, I am undertaking such a review in the context of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is being prepared in my Department at present.  As part of that review, I assure the Senator I have directed that an assessment be undertaken with the Garda Síochána regarding any deficiencies in the existing law in this area which may be hampering the fight against crime.  I am confident that in the proposed Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill we will be able to meet the type of concerns expressed by Senator Honan.  I hope she will understand that although I am not in a position to accept the amendment today, in the absence of having completed the detailed review to which I referred, it does not mean that I am in anyway unsympathetic to her point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I go along with the general thrust of what the Minister is doing in this section.  The part which deals with the obstruction or assault of a peace officer in the execution of their duties is fine.  However, the Minister is extensively extending it in that &ldquo;peace officer&rdquo; means a member of the Garda Síochána, a prison officer or a member of the Defence Forces.  I understand that situations may arise where such a provision would be necessary.  However, we are in peace time and the Army is used to back up the civilian force.  The existence of such a provision in peace time is giving the Army a new role.  I would like to know how the Minister sees this in practice.  Is a member of the Army now to be given further powers?  I am interested in the Minister's comments because we have an excellent Garda force in this country and the Army is only used for support when it is called upon to assist.  This provision may be a wide extension of the Army's powers and I am concerned about that. Are we talking about a situation where money is delivered to a bank and the Garda and Army are there?  Is it still the case that the Garda Síochána must direct the Army to get involved?  What is the position?  It would be different if there was civil strife but in peace time this extension concerns me.  What role for the Army does the Minister envisage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, this section does not confer any additional powers on anybody.  We are not saying that the role of the Defence Forces will be changed: we are reinforcing the fact that their role is always in support of the civil power.  We are providing additional <Col N="566" /> protections.  For example, if a member of the Defence Forces and a member of the Garda Síochána, in whatever circumstances, are involved in defusing a riot or whatever and both are assaulted, I do not think there would be any case for saying that the garda should have additional protection to the member of the Defence Forces because the member of the Defence Forces was only there at the request of the Garda.  It is only providing additional protection and is not giving any additional powers to anybody.</P>
      <P>Second, when the Bill was originally introduced in the other House, I had included traffic wardens as peace officers. I received strong representations from all sides, including my own side, that they should not be included, for one reason or other, as peace officers.  I received equally strong representations, particularly from the Senator's party, in relation to including fisheries officers.  At that time, the Senator will recall, there were a number of fairly high profile incidents in the midlands, in the Senator's area, where fisheries officers had been assaulted.  I also received representations that officers of the Revenue Commissioners and customs officers should be included.  I took the view that I would reduce rather than expand what was already in the provision.  Therefore, we are left with the Garda Síochána, prison officers and a member of the Defence Forces.  I honestly believe that the member of the Defence Forces, in support of the civil power, is entitled to the same protection as a member of the Garda if they are assaulted at the same time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the peace officer will be required to be in uniform?  The Army are called in to aid the civil force and I accept that fully. They are always in uniform but does it apply to somebody who is not in uniform? Regarding prison officers, I understand that an offence could be committed against an officer in a prison or even within the immediate vicinity of the prison.  If a prison officer is assaulted, the officer must have a right to protect <Col N="567" /> himself and the law would be available to do that.  How far does it extend with regard to members of the prison service and members of the Army who are in civilian clothes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator agreed, members of the Defence Forces would always be in uniform. Therefore, we are talking primarily about gardaí.  It would be grossly unfair to make a distinction between the duties of the various gardaí &mdash; for instance, detectives, who do not wear uniform &mdash; and members of the special police squads, who are dealing effectively with matters in the Senator's own area at present.</P>
      <P>It would be unacceptable to have a situation where the man or woman in uniform would have greater protection than the person in plain clothes doing an equally and sometimes more dangerous job.  Equally, prison officers do not confine themselves to the prison or the immediate surrounds of the prison.  For example, prison officers travel and to and from our courts almost every day of the week with prisoners and they also accompany prisoners who are being transferred from one custodial place to another.  This would have to be taken into account; one could not simply confine it to the confines or the immediate surrounds of the prisons themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 6 and 7.</P>
      <P>A lot of this section is worthy of merit.  It is correct that this amendment be made to this section, which states:</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall be an offence for any person who, with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another, makes any unwarranted demand with menaces.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a demand with menaces shall be unwarranted unless the person making it does so in the belief&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that he has reasonable grounds for making the demand, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  that the use of the menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand;</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the normal procedures which are available.  If a debt is due, the person concerned should be asked to pay the amount within a certain number of days.  If the money is not repaid the person owed the money should go to a solicitor, who will then write to the person concerned stating that a debt is due and that court proceedings will be issued.  This is sensible in a democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a debt remains unpaid a judgment will be registered against the person concerned and an execution order lodged with the sheriff for collection.  However, he may be unable to collect if there are no assets.  Often a charge is registered on such a property.  Meanwhile, interest on the debt will continue to grow.  I support these procedures.  However, I would be wary of this subsection in circumstances <Col N="569" /> where an individual is unable to repay a debt because it will allow people to use a heavy-handed tactics to collect that debt.</P>
    <P>We are introducing legislation to try to control moneylenders.  Their conduct and the way they collect debts in places such as Dublin, Limerick and elsewhere is scurrilous.  They intimidate, attack and threaten defenceless and vulnerable people.  This section will allow people such as moneylenders to use unwarranted menaces to collect money.  If we allow this subsection to be included in the Bill it will give these people a blank cheque to use whatever methods they wish.</P>
    <P>I saw the conduct of those collecting debts and the physical damage done to property when debts were being collected. I believe the Minister will say that when a debt is due the Garda Síochána will evict someone from a house or they will use force to enter a house or property to take goods to repay the debt.  These are heavy handed tactics.  The danger is that people will not avail of the services of the Garda Síochána to help them collect debts.  They will use their own menaces to collect the debts that are due.  This is a wide and dangerous area.  It is not right that people, irrespective of who they are, should be entitled to use menaces, particularly towards people more vulnerable and weaker than themselves.  The Bill is providing this entitlement.</P>

      <P>I oppose it.  I will not delay you, a Chathaoirligh, as I have already said most of what I have to say.  One would imagine from the statement by Senator Enright that we are abolishing all protections and offences by proposing this section.  We are not doing this.  We are creating a further offence.  It does not <Col N="570" /> affect any existing offences.  As the Senator well knows, if somebody goes on another person's property to collect a debt and damages the property, or its owner, and uses violence in any way, whether physical or otherwise, there is existing law to deal with this situation. This provision is similar to a provision in the UK Theft Act, 1968.  There has not been the kind of repercussions in the UK which the Senator is afraid we might have here.  We are not abolishing offences.  We are creating a new offence and better protection under the law.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister outlined her views on the amendment.  My point is that people who are well educated are aware of their rights.  The vulnerable in society will be exposed to problems as a result of this subsection.  They would not be aware of their rights.  The danger is that unscrupulous people will avail of this section to use improper and unlawful tactics to collect debts.  The Minister stated that there are remedies under the law.  Most vulnerable people would not have much recourse to law.  They are not the kind of people who would go to a solicitor's office or a Garda station.  They are defenceless in most instances and rarely if ever use the law to protect themselves. They should, but they do not.  The conduct of those who use menaces and threats must be deplored and condemned. We must ensure there is no legislation available which they can use as a defence if they are charged and taken to task for carrying out these threats and menances.  This is why I feel these lines should be deleted.</P>

This Bill protects the rights of the individual and the rights in their homes, town or locality.  The emphasis is at last being put on these rights.  Previously, we protected other people's rights to the nth degree and neglected to protect genuine law abiding citizens.  This Bill is a testament to the Minister's reforming zeal in the criminal law area.  As one can see, some laws which stretched back to the 1800s have now been updated and reformed in this Bill.  In a new and changing Irish society, this is to be welcomed.

      <P>I also congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  As one of the supporting acts, I am glad to have heard the Minister frequently put emphasis on non-custodial sentences.  It must be hard for the Minister to continue with this line when there is such a clamour for additional prison places and more custodial sentences, but I hope she keeps to it.  The prison population has increased by nearly 100 per cent since 1980 and no one could say that the crime level has gone down because of that increase.  I sincerely hope the Minister keeps to that line and I congratulate her again on the Bill.</P>

        <i>Donegal South-West</i>): Cuireann <Col N="574" /> sé an-lúcháir orm an deis seo a fháil chun labhairt thar ceann an Rialtais sa tSeanad inniú maidir leis an tuarascáil dheiridh ón eagraíocht Developing the West Together.  Mar Theachta Dála ón iar-thuaisceart agus mar Aire Stáit a bhfuil freagracht speisialta orm i leith na Gaeltachta, is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé d'údarás agam a rá go bhfuil tuiscint maith agam ar na fadhbanna atá idir chaibidil sa tuarascáil sin.  Beidh focal ar leith le rá agam faoin Ghaeltacht ar ball.</P>
      <P>I commend all those who have shown initiative and perseverance over a long period in compiling this comprehensive analysis of socio-economic conditions in the west of Ireland and the expertise demonstrated in bringing forward policy recommendations to improve this most peripheral area of Europe.</P>
      <P>The analysis and recommendations for policy are important in that they represent the various perspectives and key development priorities of the people living in the west.  As we know, Developing the West Together is an organisation established by the Catholic bishops of Connacht and Donegal to spearhead the efforts of people living in the west to achieve greater development of the resources of the region.  The report represents consensus views of a number of core groups who have identified the potential of the area and recommended strategic approaches to exploit that potential.</P>
      <P>This report merits a positive response. The various recommendations will receive detailed consideration in the relevant Departments.  The integrated nature of the recommendations, however, required an integrated response from the Government.  The report calls for the appointment of a Minister for the west but in view of the functional rather than geographic basis for ministerial responsibility, this is not a feasible option.  The Government has, however, decided to establish a high level task force to be chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach to examine and advise on the recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> The task force will have specific terms of reference.  First, to assess the recommendations of the report and bring forward proposals to Government as to the actions to be taken and, second, to make recommendations to Government on the most appropriate institutional response. This task force will comprise representatives from a number of relevant Departments, including the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, from local bodies in the region and the steering group of Developing the West Together. The task force is being asked to complete its work and report to the Government within two months.  The first function of the task force will be to consider the recommendations in the report in the context of current policy initiatives, in particular those detailed in the Programme for Government, the National Development Plan and most recently in the new Programme for Competitiveness and Work which was agreed with the social partners.</P>
    <P>At the recent launch of the report, <i>A Crusade for Survival</i>, the Taoiseach spoke of the key priorities for the west as outlined in the report.  These are job creation, combating unemployment, promoting economic activity based on natural resources, improving the transport infrastructure and encouraging tourism and, of course, local development initiatives. The Government has set out the same key priorities in the National Development Plan to be pursued with the assistance of Structural Funds over the period 1994-99.  We now have a unique opportunity to achieve these objectives.  The social and economic measures announced in the budget are designed to complement the measures in the plan so as to form a cohesive framework for development.</P>
    <P>One of the recurring themes in <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> is the need to bring a local dimension to the strategic planning for the western region.  I am pleased to say that both the European Union and the Government recognise and concur with this philosophy.  The process of devolving decision making to a more <Col N="576" /> local level has already begun.  The Leader programme is a major Community initiative in empowering local communities to initiate economic activity in their areas.  I am glad to say that a number of groups in the west have demonstrated the potential of this initiative.  While details of the new Community initiatives are still under negotiation, it is the Government's intention that the Leader programme will be repeated and greatly expanded.</P>
    <P>The Government, for its part, prompted by the success of the area based response to long-term unemployment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, has developed a local development programme as a key element in the national plan.  The programme through its various elements gives the opportunity to all communities, including those in west and Donegal, to exploit the natural resources and competitive advantages of their areas through support for new economic activities.</P>
    <P>The working and living conditions of the people of the areas will be improved through programmes for education, training, work experience and community and environmental developments. These are being promoted through country enterprise boards and in designated disadvantaged areas through area partnerships.  The Government has recently designated the disadvantaged areas for this purpose, including significant parts of the region covered by the report which we are currently discussing. These new structures will operate in tandem with Departments and State agencies to maximise the impact of the plan measures in the relevant areas.  The recommendations in <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> will form an important policy input in this process.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a luaigh mé cheana, tá freagracht speisialta i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta orm mar Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta. Níl amhras ach go bhfuil na fadhbanna céanna á bhfulaingt ag an Ghaeltacht is atá ag an iarthar trí chéile agus tá aitheantas tugtha ag an Rialtas do na fadhbanna sin tríd an soláthar atá i gceist a chur ar <Col N="577" /> fáil don Ghaeltacht faoin bPlean Forbartha Náisiunta 1994-1997.</P>
    <P>Tá suim £77milliúin sonraithe faoin bplean, mar fho-chlár den chlár tionscail, lena chaitheamh d'fhonn forbairt tionscail a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht.  Measann Údarás na Gaeltachta go gcruthófar 3,600 post nua lánaimseartha ar a laghad le linn tréimshe an phlean &mdash; meán de 600 post in aghaidh na bliana &mdash; gan trácht ar mhéadú cuimsitheach ar líon na bpost lánaimseartha agus páirtaimseartha séasúracha.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, tá obair nach beag á déanamh ag an Údarás cheana féin le tacaíocht an Rialtais chun deiseanna fostaíochta breise a chruthú do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Cruthaíodh 879 bpost nua lánaimseartha ar an bhfód i 1993 agus, tar éis caillteanais a chur san áireamh, bhí méadú glan de 204 phost sa bhliain sin.  Ba é sin an méadú glan ba mhó le ceithre bhliain anuas agus an 12ú bhliain i ndiaidh a chéile ina raibh glanmhéadú san fhostaíocht i dtionscail faoi scáth na heagraíochta, sin Údarás na Gaeltachta: tá ardmholadh tuillte ag an Údarás da bharr.  Chomh maith leis sin, tháinig méadú de 330 ar líon na bpost shéasúracha sa Ghaeltacht le linn 1993 &mdash; ó 2,580 duine i 1992 go dtí buaicphointe 2,910 duine i 1993.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua chomh maith go bhfuil suim speisialta £8 milliúin sonraithe laistigh de chlár iascaireachta den Phlean Forbartha Náisiúnta chun feabhas a chur ar shaoráidí calaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá i gceist díriú ach go háirithe ar shaoráidí lena mbaineann tábhacht ar leith do na hoileáin amach ón gcósta.  Ar ndóigh, cabhróidh na hoibreacha a dheanfar le forbairt na h-iascaireachta chomh maith le cúrsaí farantóireachta.  Is cúis sásaimh ar leith domsa go bhfuil soláthar déanta sa chlár oibre sin do thógáil saoráidí oiriúnacha calaíochta ar Thoraigh.</P>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte gur chun tairbhe na Gaeltachta agus a muintire a rachaidh an soláthar iomlán £85 milliúin atá i gceist ag an Rialtas a chur ar fáil don Ghaeltacht faoin bPlean Forbartha Náisiúnta 1994-1997.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> The problems in the west and, indeed, other disadvantaged areas around the country &mdash; including the Gaeltacht &mdash; do not have immediate solutions.  Progress however, will be achieved through a planned, sustained and integrated approach involving a partnership of Government, State agencies, the social partners and local communities.  The process has begun in the west and the Government for their part are committed to slowing the downward spiral of economic activity, emigration and unemployment in the region.</P>
    <P>The task force which has been established will ensure that the many detailed recommendations in this report, <i>A Crusade for Survival</i>, are fully considered and that action will be taken, as indeed it is being taken across the full range of relevant policy issues.  This is a far more effective approach than designating a Minister which, apart from being at variance with the basis on which Ministers are appointed, would give no guarantee of effective action in all the Departments and agencies involved.  The establishment of this task force will also enable the Government to give detailed consideration to alternative institutional arrangements which would be an appropriate and effective means of underpinning development in the region as part of our national approach to development.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol do Sheanadóirí, tá ráite go soiléir ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil an Rialtas réidh chun a chuid a dhéanamh sa chomhpháirtíocht ar mhaithe leis an iarthair agus Dún na nGall atá iarrtha sa tuarascáil atá á plé anseo inniu.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil céim atá stuama agus éifeachtach á glacadh ag an Rialtas anois chun na críche sin tríd an mheitheal oibre ard leibhéil a bhunú agus táim cinnte go mbeidh tacaíocht dá réir le fáil ón Seanad.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As he is from the west, I am sure that he will do all in his power to see that the report on the survival of the west is put in place and that some sort of development board will be set up there <Col N="579" /> in the near future, because if he intends to go for greener pastures I am sure that people will reward him for such action.  I have no doubt at all in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sad state of affairs when I have to stand up here and speak about the survival of the west.  The west is the most disadvantaged area in the European Union.  This country would not have received the £8 billion we have been allocated were it not for this region.  This country is getting this large amount of money on the backs of the people of the west.  That is why I have to stand here today and defend those people.  Sadly, this Government is presiding over the demise of the west and that is why we are all speaking here today.</P>
      <P>
        <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> is a positive document.  It deserves a positive response from the Government.  One of the main proposals is the call for a western development board which would have responsibility for planning and overseeing the development of the region.  It is not an outrageous demand.  The regional boards are nothing new.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company has been operating in the midwest region for many years and has done much good work there.  Jobs have been created and infrastructure built up.  The region was thriving until the Government made the disastrous decision in relation to the transatlantic flights.  The concept of regional boards is not unknown in Europe, which is far more advanced than the west of Ireland.  Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, all have regional development boards.  Even that great bastion of centralised government, Britain, has established regional development boards, so why do we not do so here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big problem here, probably the only problem about setting up a regional development board, is that Fine Gael has already proposed it and is fully committed <Col N="580" /> to setting up a regional board. Fine Gael sees great merit in setting up this board.  We see it as a necessity for the survival of the west.  This Government and the last Government have stolen many fine Fine Gael proposals and I call on the Taoiseach and this Government to implement the Fine Gael policy here and set up a western development board.  In doing so the Government will give a clear indication that it does care about the west and its development.</P>
    <P>The west is in a state of crisis and immediate Government action is needed. The &ldquo;Developing the West Together&rdquo; report describes the west as facing real threats to its future and uses population figures and trends to underpin the extent of the difficulties which the people of the region have to confront.  The latest projections arising from the study of Connacht and Donegal are based on information from the 1991 census which indicates that the situation is set for disaster. It is now estimated that by the year 2011 the total population of the west which is 551,000, will fall by a further 110,000 people.  That is approximately 20 per cent.  Based on past experiences it is likely that a large number of these will be young people.</P>
    <P>The study sets the agenda for Government action by demanding that it declare its active support for the process of regeneration of the west and to formally recognise the need for the highest priorities to be given to the development of the region in order to create circumstances which will arrest the decline in population and improve the standard of living.  It also requests the Government to prepare immediately a Green Paper setting out its policy priorities for the west and specify the level of financial resources to be devoted to its development under operational programmes of the National Development Plan 1994-1999.  This should take full account of the financial consequences of this report and should not be bound by levels of funding set out in the plan published last year.</P>
    <P>When we talk about depopulation we are not only talking about an unacceptable decline in numbers, but about a <Col N="581" /> threat to a particular way of life.  Rather than talking about abandoned homes and deserted villages, I prefer to say there are positive features of our western life which deserve to survive.  These features include a full family and communal life which has been slowly sucked dry by emigration; an essential balance between young and old and a normal pattern of marriage and birth which a dying community cannot supply; a literary, musical and cultural inheritance which is still part of an ongoing tradition and which deserves a better future than being on records or tapes; and the Gaelic conscience of that inheritance, invaluable in itself and in its cultural ramifications, which has an active life in the western region and which has not been seen elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Apart from depopulation, another compelling reason for developing the west is that the region is seriously disadvantaged, in spite of inherited advantages such as scenery, the environment and an existing industrial base.  I am talking about poor roads, lost railways, extra costs to bring goods to the markets, high unemployment, low incomes, persistent poverty and rampant emigration.  Only 36 per cent of the land and region can be classed as good agricultural land, compared to 50 per cent of the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>Family farm incomes bear no comparison with the east of the country. According to a Teagasc survey in 1991, the average family farm income in the west is less than £4,000 and represents only 43 per cent of income in the east. The average household income, as distinct from farm income, is 10 to 11 per cent below the national average.  There is a perception that poverty and unemployment are more prevalent in the inner cities, but this is not the case.  Rural poverty and unemployment are destructive realities.  Since 1980 long-term unemployment has been approximately 4 per cent higher in Connacht and County Donegal than in the entire State.</P>
    <P>A great challenge faces the west, but not only in relation to the mass exodus of young people from its shores.  People <Col N="582" /> believe it is an impossible task to maintain the level of population under the present economic climate.  <i>The Western People</i> stated that the number of people remaining in the west is as plentiful as good potatoes during the famine.  The famine of opportunity and employment is destroying the crop of young people. Those who leave have no other choice and they take with them the west's means of survival.  The youth of the west are under threat because the small industrial and manufacturing base in the west cannot offer realistic employment.  It is sad to read the headlines in the western provincial newspapers: &ldquo;Nothing To Keep Young People At Home&rdquo;; &ldquo;Where Am I Going?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Lawyers And Doctors Are More Fashionable Than Farmers&rdquo;; &ldquo;What Is There To Come Back To?&rdquo;; and &ldquo;As Bad As The 1950s&rdquo;.  Mass exodus of young people must be stemmed when the age pyramid points to a slow death.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the bishops and groups for bringing <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> to a conclusion.  They have mobilised public opinion and created public awareness of the problems we face in the west.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to appoint a Minister and a Department for western development which could be based in the west.  The main objectives in the report are to focus attention on the depopulation, poverty and unemployment problems in the west and it suggests realistic strategies for tackling them.  It also calls for policies to help the underprivileged and the long-term unemployed and it has a set of recommendations for those facing emigration and for the urban and rural poor.  The Government must recognise the urgency of the crisis in the west and give the highest priority to the development of the region in order to provide the jobs which are needed to arrest the population decline, to eliminate poverty and to raise living standards.</P>
    <P>The study urges local people to participate fully and to take responsibility for planning and implementing policies which are needed to regenerate the west. It recommends the development of a <Col N="583" /> series of urban centres with the potential for job creation around which growth should be concentrated.  This would benefit rural areas through population retention and increased spending power.  The report also calls for the establishment of a pig development programme, soft loans for grants, the transfer of milk quotas and livestock premiums and the mobilisation of local and overseas financial support for development.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the west should be a tax free zone and special concessions should be given to the west.  The Government must seriously consider what has been said by public representatives, the bishops, the communities, the media and <i>A Crusade For Survival.</i>  There is an onus on the Government to give the same commitment to the west as it is giving to the east.  As I have said before, the money is being given to Ireland because the west is so disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I could not let this opportunity pass without drawing attention to the regional technical college for County Mayo.  Conflicting views have been expressed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education about what third level courses will be provided in County Mayo.  I ask the Minister to clarify this with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Gallagher to the House.  He has a basic sound knowledge of how important it is to develop plans for the west, north-west and the Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the bishops' <i>Crusade for Survival</i> and, as one who has attended most of the meetings, including the launch of the report in Castlebar on 3 February, I have followed the progress of the bishops' initiative.  I would like to put on the record of this House that while I strongly commend and welcome the initiative taken by the bishops, credit must be given to the late Monsignor Horan who laid the foundations for developing the west, because he did not preach to others what <Col N="584" /> they should do.  He built an airport in the west where it was needed.  Those of us who showed an interest at the time realised the major task which Monsignor Horan undertook.  This was a foundation stone of great importance.  We followed the campaign which the late Monsignor Horan embarked upon to get funding to complete the airport at Knock, County Mayo.  He has left a monument to his good work in the west.</P>
    <P>On 3 February, I attended the conference to launch this report in Castlebar and listened carefully to the speeches made by Archbishop Cassidy and the Taoiseach who was positive in his approach.  Minister Gallagher was also present.  He is aware of the commitment given by the Taoiseach.  Aid and support from whatever source is not regionally designated, it is project-led.  Nobody in rural Ireland can expect to get funding for a specific region or area, it has to be based on projects.</P>
    <P>There are enough agencies, including the county enterprise boards.  The latter have been described as bottom-up operations to which communities submit proposals for small projects; anything from making curtains to collecting and processing seaweed.  There is a very big provision to cover every kind of project you could mention in the west.  The challenge goes back to the people living there.  We must do more than cry and complain about depopulation.  I have serious reservations about that because it is counter-productive to talk about the population of a county being halved in 35 years.  An industrialist has to be tough and must take care in setting up an enterprise.  It must be economically viable and be based in an area where it will be supported.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the references in the Archibishop's speech of 3 February that one can cry to the point where nobody listens.  You can criticise your area but who are you blaming at the end of the day?  Opposition Senators have blamed everybody.  It is easy to do that when you are not expected to deliver.  It is easy to say you had a plan which the Government is implementing.  The Opposition can be extravagant and expound as much as they <Col N="585" /> like but the average little fellow has enough time and patience to assess that there is no magic miracle button.  I was closely involved and watched the proposals and submissions for the study being put together in the crusade to save the west.</P>
    <P>In County Donegal, between cross-Border reports and the Sligo-Leitrim reports, we have had five studies costing in excess of £1 million in seven years.  It is important to make a submission, record your plans and put them formally before the Government and the EU for support. We went down that road as far as was humanly possible, recognising the problems on the ground and how to create jobs.  It is counter-productive to keep saying that we are so remote, have no third level college, that people want to leave and when they are educated in another centre they never return.  We have to look at this cooly and calmly and ask ourselves, if we had an opportunity to set up a small industry, would it be in Cricklewood in London or in Castlebar. All things being equal, the beauty and tranquility of the west &mdash; of counties Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon in particular &mdash; and the standard of living and quality of life there, is far superior to elsewhere in Europe.  We have undersold ourselves down the years. Only the large companies setting up pharmaceutical industries recognise the benefit of being based in a rural part of Europe where there is no air pollution. They have all the advantages including electricity and a trained labour force which they do not have in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I support the initiative by the bishops. It is in keeping with initiatives taken in other parts of the west, including my county.  I hope that people who live there &mdash; the business and young educated people &mdash; will not see this document as being for public representatives and Government Ministers.  In fact, this document is for consumption in the west.  The people there will have to recognise that this initiative points to them and to the start-up ability they have to have in providing jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> If anybody thinks that this document is for Government consideration and the EU will recognise our need and produce a cheque, they are wrong because that is not going to happen.  It is folly to mislead people and say we have been trying to do something for years.  The youth and future generations in the west will not thank us for misleading them and trying to make political capital out of something that is real problem.  There is enough understanding at Government level, and support from the Taoiseach down, to offer maximum assistance and get maximum support from the EU for developing the west together.  When I say the west I mean the north-west.  I am pleased that at the launch of the document <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> in Castlebar, our bishop from Donegal, Bishop Seamus Hegarty, was invited to join the platform party.  That was important because Donegal considers itself part of the west and part of the area that has to be developed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has been able to attend this debate today.  No Senator has to preach to him about having a better understanding of the situation. The Minister is from the west, from Dungloe in County Donegal.  It is fair to commend the people of that district on their initiative in setting up small industries.  Whether it is gathering seaweed, fishing, making garments, or tourism, Donegal people have given a lead that others should follow.</P>
    <P>There is no easy way to achieve success and create jobs.  It must be done by the people on the ground and there never was a more opportune time.  The incentives and supports present this generation with a opportunity.  We must encourage those responsible to take off their coats and get involved in creating jobs.  It is not big industrialists from outside who are going to solve our problems, whether it is Digital in Galway that creates 500 or 600 jobs and goes in a few years after the tax concessions run out, or others.  The small industry that employs four or five people must be nurtured and supported. That opportunity exists but it will not last.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> This initiative encourages us to believe in ourselves, and I welcome it.  We should stop criticising the Government and the public representatives because at the end of the day the people themselves must deliver support.  There has been criticism of elected representatives who are expected to deliver the support.  That is an inconsistency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the launch of &ldquo;Developing the West Together&rdquo;.  Donegal is part of the west and the county welcomes this report.  We will be there with our coats off ready to help the bishops in any initiative undertaken in the west of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome this debate because it is an opportunity to highlight the problem to which I drew attention when I spoke on the national plan some months ago.</P>
      <P>There is a danger, which this report graphically documents, that the west will lose critical mass.  If that happens the region will decline even more rapidly than heretofore.  Until now there has been a relatively slow shift in the country's centre of gravity.  It is a shift from the west of the country towards the east and unless we act quickly we will see an acceleration of that trend.  The west will decline in a vicious spiral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A symptom of this trend is the behaviour of the foreign manufacturing companies which the IDA attracts to this country.  Most of the companies which come to Ireland do not want to cross the Shannon, not even to look at prospective locations.  Some months ago I attended the opening of the Heinz factory in Dundalk. The factory produces frozen pizzas and the reason Dundalk was chosen as its location was due to its proximity to the export ports of Lame and Dublin. There is a considerable advantage for somebody who is producing a fresh food product to locate on the east coast rather than placing themselves at a disadvantage on the west coast.  Even in those instances when companies can be enticed to the west, they seldom want to consider <Col N="588" /> locations outside the major centres of Galway and Shannon.</P>
    <P>We would be very foolish to believe that we could bribe companies to locate in the west by offering them even greater incentives.  That will not work anymore. Last month in America I met an American industrialist who told me that he sits on the boards of a number of companies. On hearing that I was from Ireland he told me what a wonderful country it was for a holiday.  However, he told me that he has committed himself to recommending to each of the boards on which he sits that the companies do not open factories in Ireland which employ people. That gave me a jolt.  When I pressed him for more information he told me that his companies had opened factories in Ireland but they had found it too difficult to close those factories when the market went against them.  It was too difficult to disemploy people.  It is a jolt for us when we are trying to encourage industry in Ireland, to find that, we cannot easily bribe people to locate here if they do not really want to do so.  That is only a short term solution.  We must get the infrastructure right if we are to succeed.</P>
    <P>Bribery is, at best, only a short term solution.  If a location does not make good commercial sense it must be faced that, sooner or later, it will no longer exist.  The answer is not to look for more of the medicine that has not worked before.  The answer is to look for new solutions that are firmly based on the new realities.  The central new reality is that the eastern side of the country has progressively become much more attractive as a location for manufacturing.  As time passes it will become even more attractive.</P>
    <P>Instead of trying to hold back the tide like King Canute, we should look at how we can develop the west in a way that builds on its strengths.  Tourism is one of those strengths.  We should blatantly favour the west in developing tourism and recognise that its potential is perhaps the greatest factor in the creation of wealth in the west.  As a symbol of that we should relocate the headquarters of Bord Fáilte to the west.  I suggested that <Col N="589" /> last week and I notice that it is now being considered as an option.</P>
    <P>Second, services which can be delivered through telecommunications are not disadvantaged as a result of distance. Commercially it does not matter where they are located, so the west can compete on equal terms for those services.  From a national point of view we should direct the bulk of Ireland's activity in that sector to the west of Ireland.  We should virtually reserve those activities for the west.  We should do that by agressively locating Government services on the other side of the Shannon.  We should locate, in addition to Bord Fáilte, the meteorological office there.  We should also consider locating the new aviation authority there.  If we make a national decision to balance the industrial losses by building up the west's portfolio of services, there is much we can do very quickly.  It is under our control.  The decentralisation that has taken place thus far has been giving lip service to an idea that could be a major part of our national strategy.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is a strength that must not be allowed to die.  I suggest that we encourage farmers in the west of Ireland to specialise in labour intensive, high value production, such as organic farming. It is not a huge market sector, but it is a fine niche market.  People in Europe who are interested in organic farming value the image we have created &mdash; an image that is deserved in the west of Ireland.  There is a growing market for that produce and the west could make that market its niche.</P>
    <P>We must look for ways to address the problem.  I do not have much faith in the value of appointing a Minister for the west.  It is interesting to hear the Minister disagree with the suggestion.  That would be a way of sweeping the problem under a Kildare Street carpet.  However, I see a place for an active action group that is independent of Government and which can act as a permanent voice in that region.  I am delighted that the Minister has talked about a task force.  If this problem is to be addressed, let alone solved, it will be as a result of what the people of <Col N="590" /> the west do by working together.  This document is an example of that.  If that happens, they will have to include all the western seaboard.  This report omits County Clare, which is a critical area of the western synergy.</P>
    <P>Let us not let this report gather dust on a library shelf.  I was delighted to hear Senator McGowan refer to that danger. He talked of five studies having been conducted in the past which cost over £1 million.  Let us ensure that this document does not gather dust.  Even if we do not decide to implement its specific recommendations, let us accept its diagnosis and determine to do something about it. If we do not take action now, the next time the country focuses on this problem could be many years away and the problems could be many times worse.  Let us do something now rather than just talk about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the western bishops on bringing forward this document which I hope will lead to some action to deal with the problems facing the west and its people.  I want to get one thing straight and I will be blunt about it. The bishops stated in the briefing document, and I quote:</P>
      <P>In the past, successive Governments have recognised the specific needs of the west and have actively adopted policies in favour of the region in agriculture, tourism, industrial policy and infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with this.  It is untrue.  This document should have attacked this Government and previous Governments for never recognising the specific needs of the west.  Previous Governments have implemented policies in favour of disadvantaged areas in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner but these have never been exclusively applied to the west.  Central Government <Col N="591" /> in Dublin has failed the people of the west and I make no bones about it.  From the foundation of the State they have failed to develop coherent policies to tackle the disadvantages suffered by those living west of the Shannon.  All Governments have failed and all political parties have failed.</P>
    <P>This problem does not relate just to jobs.  I listened to the last speaker talking about how to get jobs into the west and what we should and should not do.  This is about isolation; for example, not being able to get to the local doctor in times of emergency.  This is an everyday fact and is the result of many problems combined that make it impossible for people to live outside of towns.  It is a serious problem and warrants discussion.</P>
    <P>Eamon de Valera spoke of maidens dancing at the crossroads in rural Ireland. What did he expect those maidens to live on?  Fresh air, or should I say hot air?  As a maiden from the west I wish to outline to town and city colleagues here and to those in the Cabinet some of the disadvantages suffered by virtue of my birthplace. I was born and raised in Kinlough, a village in north County Leitrim, the second of seven children.  It could be said that my parents did their best to increase the population in that county.</P>
    <P>As a four-year old I remember taking the school bus to the national school three miles away &mdash; a frightening experience. As children we never got home for lunch because we lived in the country. As junior infants we did not get home early as we had to wait until after school finished and then we went home with the other children.  While at secondary school we had to wait for a half hour every evening for the school bus to complete one run before returning to pick us up and zigzag its way home along a circuitous route.  In other words, it took us an hour to travel the three mile journey home, and children in the town had had their dinner and settled into their homework long before we reached our front door.</P>
    <P>I am not being petty.  The reality is that living in the country is difficult because <Col N="592" /> one cannot avail of the same services that exist in towns and cities.  This places one at a disadvantage in terms of education, socialising, work, etc.  If one lives in the town and finds that one has run out of milk it is not a big problem because one can go out to the local shop.  It is a problem or a complication in the country because one has to get into the car &mdash; if one has a car &mdash; and go to town for the milk.  Everything is more difficult and that is the point I am trying to make today.</P>
    <P>At 17 years of age I started my third level education in Trinity College, Dublin.  Dublin based students have no difficulty in adjusting to college life.  It just means a different bus route.  For me and many others it meant leaving home for the first time, finding a flat and dealing with unscrupulous landlords; finding one's way around, learning about the bus routes, doing the shopping, washing and cleaning.  After all that, college was just a minute detail.  This places students who come from the country at a disadvantage. Our time was spent adjusting to city life while city students got on with their studies. Perhaps it did not do me any harm but many of my fellow students and friends did not manage so well and that should be remembered.</P>
    <P>Think of those left at home.  My parents raised seven children so one can imagine how busy the household was. We all had to leave home at an early age to be educated.  Only my parents remain at home now.  Of those who went to primary school with me I doubt if more than two of them live in the same village. When one is from the west one is generally forced to leave home to go to college. Unless one lives along a bus route to the regional technical colleges in Galway, Sligo or Letterkenny or one lives close to University College Galway it is not possible to stay at home.</P>
    <P>Aside from education one must leave home to get work.  Unless one works in a job in a nearby town one must travel elsewhere.  That is why every New Year's Day I witness the heartbreaking scenes in town centres where parents bring their children to wait for buses to take them to <Col N="593" /> work in the cities, or to the airport, that will take our young people away for yet another year &mdash; mothers crying, fathers clapping their children on the back and wishing them well and young children looking bewildered.  The grief that causes to families in the west is immeasurable.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution proclaims the rights and virtues of the family yet all Governments have sat back and allowed families in the west to be torn asunder.  I ask all politicians to sit in the town squares of Charlestown, County Mayo, Ballyshannon, County Donegal, Ballinasloe, County Galway or Manorhamilton, County Leitrim and witness the frightening exodus.  Then, and only then, will politicians get their act together and develop coherent and comprehensive policies geared specifically for those in the west.  That is not asking too much. We in the west suffer enough disadvantage and hardship.</P>
    <P>My family now lives outside Tobercurry, County Sligo.  There is no bus service from there to Dublin and, therefore, my brothers and sisters must be driven to Charlestown, ten miles away, to get a bus to take them there.  Transport is a constant problem.  I would not say that it is a problem exclusive to the west, but it is worse there because we are forced to travel further and more often than those living elsewhere to get essential services.  I know of people living in Leitrim who depend on kidney dialysis and who have to travel the four hour trip to Dublin for that service and then back again.  Think of the strain that places on those people and their families.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about roads, contrary to what Senator Norris may wish us to do. In the western region we lack sufficient rail links and, therefore, we depend all the more on roads to link us with each other and with the larger centres.  Money is badly needed for our county roads. Have our rural MEPs not made clear that this is where we want the money to go? This is essential.  We need better roads to allow us better access to essential services, to doctors in emergencies, to shops and schools etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> Rural Ireland is dying.  Many houses dotted around the country lie empty. Many townlands in the west failed to make a return in the last census.  How long can this decline continue?  Are we all to be forced into towns and cities in order to have access to these services? What the bishops propose is worth considering Certainly, the members of the Government must at this late stage put their heads together and develop comprehensive policies to tackle the many problems faced by people in the west.  I am pleased to report that the Parliamentary Labour Party has already formed a committee for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I also urge the Government to take heed of the recommendations in the report on women and rural development recently published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights. This report highlighted the isolation of women who live in the countryside and called for funding of local centres which would provide information for women in relation to health and social welfare issues.  It also called for the provision of creche facilities to allow the women a little free time or time to do their shopping, and to give them a place where they could meet each other over a cup of coffee.  I do not think that is asking for too much.  I call on the Government and on the Minister for State here today to provide funding for such centres in villages in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious that villages and small towns in rural Ireland be given every chance for survival. Therefore, I am pleased to say that the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, has reversed a previous trend of amalgamating schools.  I know from experience that the local school is a vital component in the make up of a rural community.  A young couple will not build a house in an area which does not have a local school; business will not be attracted into an area where young families do not live because they, naturally, require to be near their market and the workforce.  Therefore, Government assistance is required to maintain small <Col N="595" /> schools in rural areas which will halt the domino effect of rural decline.</P>
    <P>Third, we need to assist family businesses. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, provided an assistance package for small businesses in the budget, the best effort ever made by any Government.  I hope there is more to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The bishops' report makes many recommendation, including the provision of assistance to farmers to facilitate the transfer of milk quotas while keeping quota and other premium requirements in a specific region.  This is a worthy recommendation as it would assist farmers anxious to maintain viable holdings.</P>
      <P>The report also suggests ways for power to be given to local communities, a radical and badly needed move.  The west is in decline because of the absence of democracy.  We have a central Government with centralist policies.  This creates a dependency under which people from the west have come to expect, hope and pray for handouts, and then count their blessings.  There will be no maidens dancing at any crossroads in rural areas unless and until they form local community councils and obtain direct funding from the Government or Europe to allow them to cut out bureaucracy and red tape.  That will allow them to provide the necessary services in their community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Cromwellian times the west has got a raw deal and been given the leftovers. The phrase &ldquo;To Hell or to Connacht&rdquo; still rings true.  Direct funding from Brussels in vital to counteract centuries of decline.  Article 30a of the Maastricht Treaty refers to rural areas.  The regional committee of the European Parliament will address the common problem of rural decline which should force changes in policies here.  However, there seems to be a reluctance in these Houses to face the problems of people in the west with sufficient seriousness.  We must seek direct funding from the EU to plug the <Col N="596" /> holes draining the life blood from communities west of the Shannon.  Urgent action is needed.</P>
    <P>I am serious about what I have discussed today.  I want my brothers and sisters to be able to find work at home and to have access to services others take for granted.  The Government must coordinate policies to help the west.</P>
    <P>More importantly, those who live in that region must be given the opportunity to address their problems.  Local democracy is necessary to allow young people to have a say in providing for their future. This democracy must involve women who up to now have stayed at home or been involved in local charity fundraising, etc.  Those people should be given the chance to determine their own future so that we no longer depend on the whims of faraway politicians and leftovers from central coffers.  Action is needed now.</P>

      <P>I welcome <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> and I wish the bishops of the western seaboard well in this endeavour. I also congratulate the previous speaker. If there were more like her there would be no fears for the west.</P>
      <P>The policies followed over the past two decades have produced two rural Irelands.  One is doing relatively well; the other suffers from poverty, unemployment, expulsion and terminal decline.  A long-term approach is needed if rural development policies are to be effective.</P>
      <P>Investment in rural development does not yield quick returns.  Those who invest in development know there is a long haul. A major incentive to such development is the assurance that supporting socioeconomic structures are also reliable for the long term.  In the past we have seen the closure of rural schools, Garda stations and post offices, a threat to district and general hospitals and the curtailment of services.  Those who live and intend to live in rural areas, whose families want to pursue that way of life, should not be forced to live in a hostile environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> Being a small nation on the periphery of Europe has its disadvantages; being on the periphery of a peripheral nation poses further problems.  The people of the western seaboard have much in common with those from my side of the country, along the south-western seaboard. I shall speak for people from the north, the west and the south-west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Dardis) Acting Chairman (Mr. Dardis)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Dardis)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you will not speak for too many regions, Senator, because we are running out of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCashin" hpid="Mr. Cashin Mr. Cashin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as I can. One threat has been to the maintenance of the regional hospital in Mallow, County Cork, which serves a vast rural area.  We had to fight to retain that, the ambulance services pertaining to it and to maintain rural post offices.  If the post office in the village of Meelin in my constituency was closed, £7,000 a week would be lost to the village.  Meelin would die and in time the adjoining town would follow.  This is what we must fight to protect.</P>
      <P>All is not lost.  There are many ways in which we can preserve rural life, such as through Leader funding under which at present some £21 million is available. Afforestation has shown an increase from £37,000 to £57,000, allowing small farmers to obtain part-time work while staying on the land.  Small industries, rural resettlement in County Clare and fishing are other areas which can help.</P>
      <P>Fishing is close to the Cathaoirleach's heart.  We have seen the conflict between farm fishing and white trout of late, both of which bring revenue to the country. One of those pursuits appears to be killing the other.  In Kerry, where 60 people are employed in the cages, £2 million was lost in tourism last year, the equivalent of 104 jobs.  They should be working hand in hand in an area where jobs are hard to come by and in a country where we want to keep all the jobs we can and reduce the numbers out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter must be grasped by the Government.  We must be serious about the matter.  We can no longer just talk <Col N="598" /> about rural decay, we must do something for ourselves.  Ireland is seen as the garden country of western Europe.  That being the case we must get funding for farm guest houses, scenic walks, parks and, not least, our county and minor roads.  If we leave the highways to see the hidden Ireland we must get the structures to do so.  The western idea of progress is an empty countryside, with crowded, polluted and violent cities.  Do we have to follow suit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The west, like the rest of this great country, has a chequered history and is often featured in Irish history for the wrong reasons.  In the days of Cromwell the expression was: &ldquo;To Hell or to Connacht&rdquo;.  In recent times, if one had a close affiliation to the west, one would be inclined to say: &ldquo;To Hell with Connacht&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A serious effort is now afoot to address the problem and many agencies, including the Government, are being called on to strike a blow for Connacht and the west.  It is a beautiful area, famed in song and story.  It is the area where Pádraig Ó Conaire wrote of his little black donkey, <i>M'asal Beag Dubh:</i>&ldquo;I gCinn Bhara a bhíos nuair a churas aithne ar m'asal beag dubh i dtosach.&rdquo;  It is also the land of Yeats's <i>The Wild Swans of Coole.</i>  There are also the immortal lines of Pearse about children playing in the streets of little towns in Connacht, a land of peace and rugged beauty.</P>
      <P>Regretfully, the number of children playing in the streets of little towns in Connacht is getting fewer and fewer as the years pass.  This is not a land of milk and honey where everything in the garden is rosy.  The west is presented in history and literature as the home of a vibrant rural way of life which is central to Ireland's cultural heritage.  A century ago the region boasted a population of 910,000, but by 1991 this figure had fallen dramatically to 510,000.  It faces the prospect of a further decline of 110,000 by 2011.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the west we are witnessing the death of large parts of our national heritage. Neglect and national apathy have persisted <Col N="599" /> over many years.  This is manifest in the strong preference for the east in EU assisted infrastructure projects.  Since 1984 farming has been faced with quota limits on milk production.  Ceilings on livestock premia have also been set in the reformed CAP.  Much of the land in Connacht and Donegal is of poor quality. More than 20 per cent consists of bog, marsh, bare mountain, water and roads, compared to less than 30 per cent for the State as a whole.  A total of 22 per cent is used for rough grazing, while the national average is 15 per cent, and only 36 per cent of land in Connacht is classed as good agricultural land.  There is a large number of small farm holdings, with 56 per cent less than 30 acres, while the national average is 45 per cent, and just 20 per cent are in excess of 50 acres. Many small landowners in the west have almost withdrawn from farming and are largely dependent on income maintenance supports such as old age pensions and smallholders ssistance on land letting, and on  and low intensity agricultural production.</P>
    <P>This beautiful region on the periphery of Europe has major problems.  The number of children playing on the streets of Connacht has dropped dramatically. The population of the archdiocese of Tuam has dropped by 100,000 in 100 years and the process has accelerated in recent times.  The Gaelic Athletic Association is deeply rooted on the western seaboard but in recent years many clubs are finding it more and more difficult to field teams in various grades.  My own parish club of Turloughmore in County Galway won six county championships in a row in the 1960s.  It took the club almost 20 years to win another championship and this was mainly due to the exodus of players from the club.  In the 1980s Turloughmore had its own hurling team in Boston and many people felt that it could have been superior to the team at home.  The exodus of people from the west in recent times is frightening. However, it is not all doom and gloom. The country's future will be built on its young people, our most prized possession, <Col N="600" /> despite the endemic drain of young people from the west.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me as a western public representative not to pay tribute to the western bishops for their initiative in bringing forward this report on the problems of the west and their solutions. Over 100 recommendations have been made by the bishops in their crusade to develop a survival package for the region. However, this will come to nothing if millions of pounds are not pumped into Connacht and Donegal each year and if the Government is not prepared to respond in a positive manner to this report.</P>
    <P>The study makes a variety of recommendations in a number of areas as to how the serious threat to the west's future can be arrested.  These areas include rural and industrial development, tourism, services, infrastructure, financial strategies, framework for western development, the costs of development and non-development and the organisation of western development.  I join in calling on the Government to support the actions requested in the crusade document.  The Government has been asked to immediately declare its active support for the process of regenerating the west and to prepare a Green Paper setting out its policy and priorities for the region.  It has also been asked to establish an independent and adequately resourced western development board which would have responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of policy there.  In addition, it would be responsible for the presentation of a five year rolling development plan in consultation with interests in the west.  This should be presented to the Government not later than the end of October 1994 and it should now be setting in train the Green Paper proposal, as requested.</P>
    <P>Support for tourism nationally must take into account the special contribution the west can make.  Its tourism resources &mdash; especially rural tourism &mdash; are greatly underdeveloped.  It is obvious that transport infrastructure should take priority in the tourism development plan.  The N63 is one of the key roads, leading in and <Col N="601" /> out of County Galway and County Roscommon which links up ultimately with Northern Ireland and Belfast.  This is a vital link but it is in a state of disrepair at the moment.  Unless something is done about it in the near future, tourism cannot be adequately promoted in the region.  There is a strong request from the west, particularly from County Galway and County Roscommon, for this road to be upgraded from a national secondary to a national primary route.  I was recently asked by a number of concerned mothers if Galway County Council would level the brink of this road so that they could walk safely along it.  This is a sad situation and gives an idea of the deplorable state of some of the main routes in the west.  Something must be done about this road in particular.  I intend to raise the request to have this road upgraded from national secondary standard to national primary with the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister and the Government take cognisance of a detailed report commissioned and produced by the western railways inter-county committee which called for the reopening of the line from Sligo to Claremorris?  Ultimately, this could link up with Rosslare and lead to continental Europe.  This route has vast tourism potential, and at a time when we talk of tourism as a vital matter for the west, it could become the vital organ to bring revitalisation to the arteries and veins of this peripheral region.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the problems facing landowners in the region when tourists enter their land.  Under existing legislation, landowners are responsible for accidents on their land.  This is leading to restrictions on entering land with consequential adverse effects on the development of tourism products.  This problem must be addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>Local community development groups or boards must be established in every parish, with the bottom up approach becoming the norm.  The Government must ensure that these groups are backed up with financial and expert support.  I call on the Government to supply every existing local community development <Col N="602" /> board with an enterprise worker who would co-ordinate and promote the interests of the local groups which are endeavouring to create opportunities within their village or parish.  We see many people with ideas every year on the special &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; production. They produce new concepts which will ultimately lead to new products.  They should be encouraged in every way possible. It is also vitally important that householders, who try to supplement their income through the development of tourism on their farms or the creation of bed and breakfast facilities within their homes, should be encouraged and financially assisted.</P>
    <P>I support the call by Senator Quinn that the headquarters of Bord Fáilte should be reallocated in the west and in this respect I include many other Government services.  For example, my party requested that the Irish Aviation Authority be based in the Shannon region, but, regrettably, it was ignored.</P>
    <P>The west should be designated as a pilot area for social employment schemes whereby eligible workers are allowed to continue on schemes when the mandatory one year period has elapsed.  There should be continuity of work, as tasks need to be undertaken.  Workers on these schemes should be allowed to retain their entitlements, including medical cards, and there should be reassessment for dole on completion of these schemes.  In addition, the unions will have to be more flexible in their approach to work, taking into consideration the problems of the region, and the county councils should be appointed as the main agents to promote many of these major schemes as they have the expertise and back up services already in place.</P>
    <P>It is well known that major industries can never be established in certain areas in the west because of their remoteness. In these areas, social employment schemes are the main hope for the future and I hope that flexibility will be the norm.</P>
    <P>Many people trying to supplement their incomes through setting up fish farms are, unfortunately, outside the <Col N="603" /> Oireachtas today demanding help from the Government.  They should be given every consideration and help and, again, flexibility should be the norm.</P>
    <P>As a Fine Gael Party spokesperson on western development, I believe there is a resilience in the west that refuses to accept defeat.  However, there must also be resilience on the part of the Government to help it.  I repeat the call of my party in requesting the Government to appoint a Minister with special responsibility for the west who could liaise with the proposed western development board which should now be established with the assistance of the Government. Such a Minister should spearhead the crusade for survival of the region and the proposed western development board should be answerable to him or her.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Government will not respond in a positive manner to the request of the bishops and the people of the west for the appointment of such a Minister.  Will we &mdash; and the bishops &mdash; be left, like John the Baptist, crying in the wilderness?  It is incumbent on the Government to immediately declare its active support for the process of regeneration of the west and to prepare a Green Paper setting out its policies and priorities for the region.</P>
    <P>To date, the Government's response has been disappointing.  Senator McGowan remarked that the Government is supportive.  If so, why set up another task force, another talking shop? The bishops' report is excellent and tells us what is required.  Why set up another body to examine the problems in the west?  Why delay the action?  My party eagerly awaits the response of this task force and its recommendations, or is it possible that the recommendations and the findings of the task force will be deferred or postponed until after the European elections?</P>
    <P>The people of the west have the will and the initiative to go forward and rekindle a growing and successful spirit on the western seaboard.  The bishops have taken their initiative in the production of this report and it is now firmly <Col N="604" /> in the lap of the Government.  We want to continue to see our children play on the streets of vibrant small towns in Connacht. I hope the Government will help the people of the west to realise and fulfil this dream.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. It is appropriate that within two weeks of the launching of the report A Crusade for Survival: Developing the West Together, the Upper House is debating it.  It is an indication of the seriousness with which it is taken.</P>
      <P>I compliment the bishops &mdash; and all those who supported them in compiling this report &mdash; on their initiative.  They have acted as a catalyst in opening a debate on the west.  It is not, as some believe, a bishops' report.  To some extent the bishops' merely presided over the opportunity to bring forward a report.  Many people, and many politicians in all parties, from the west contributed to the compilation of the report and attended many of the meetings held throughout the region when the report was being considered.</P>
      <P>The report identifies and details the problems of the west and attempts, to some extent, to provide solutions. However, solutions cannot be provided by a report itself; they can only be provided by Government and by Government agencies working with local development groups and agencies for the betterment of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fortunate that the Taoiseach was born in the west, and it did not go without notice that he attended the launching of this report.  He has an interest in the west, having been reared in County Roscommon, although he has now been adopted by County Longford.  He also has an understanding of the problems of the west and I was heartened by his statement the day the report was launched that his Department would analyse the report and that he would have a personal involvement.  In addition, I note that the Taoiseach announced the establishment of a task force under the auspices of his Department to investigate the recommendations of the report and <Col N="605" /> report to him with its findings.  Therefore, he has already taken a positive step in response to this report.  This debate is another positive step even though the report was only launched in the last two weeks.</P>
    <P>While there are many problems in the west, it is important to appreciate the situation in the region hitherto.  In this respect I was taken aback by the approach of one Opposition Senator who attacked the abandonment of the west by the Government.  What was the response of the Senator's party while in Government from 1982 to 1987?  That Government stopped the decentralisation programme that had been initiated.  To date, the Government has brought decentralisation to places like Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar, Ballina and Galway.  It is also proposed to decentralise to Roscommon.  While this will not solve the problems in the region, it is an indication of the commitment of the Government to decentralisation to regions outside Dublin.  It is important that the Government continues this policy.</P>
    <P>During that period a major proposal for the development of an indigenous resource, a peat briquette factory on the Galway border at Ballyforan, was shelved. This factory would have provided considerable employment opportunities. Attacking the Government on the basis of this report is not the best way to proceed. We must ask what the future holds for the west.  What can we do to influence a policy which will respond to the needs of the west?</P>
    <P>The development of indigenous resources such as peat and timber is vitally important.  The Government can play a major role in this area.  I am perturbed by recent statements that it is again proposed to build a milled peat station in the midlands or near Dublin. Given the situation in the west, the Government could develop indigenous resources, process them on site and create added value.  To harvest milled peat in west and transport it by train to the east is not in the best interests of developing the west.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> The Government has a responsibility to those in the west in regard to peat resources.  There is now an opportunity to enhance the standard of living of poor families and, perhaps, bring back family members who left by providing a peat generating capacity in the west.  If the Government is serious about responding to this report, it should ensure that part of our energy generating capacity is located in that area.  This would provide much needed jobs, added value in development and additional jobs in service and ancillary industries.  By developing this indigenous resource and by processing it on site, sustainable jobs could be provided which would keep families in this area, allow them to build their own houses and provide them with a future over the next 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's policy on forestry.  It supported the industry nationally and it obtained EU support for a national forestry development programme. Timber must be processed in this country.  The recent attempt by Louisiana Pacific to locate on the south-east coast is unacceptable.  Further timber processing should not be located on the east or south coast.  This is another opportunity for Government to respond to the needs of the west.  In ten years time, most timber will be produced in the west and north-west.  The Government should decide to locate the next mill, pulp or timber processing outlet in that area.  By doing so, it would show its commitment. If this indigenous resource is processed on site, much needed jobs could be provided. These are two opportunities for the Government to devise coherent policies to develop indigenous resources in the west and north-west.</P>
    <P>The Government could respond to many other areas in the west.  We are in danger of being overloaded with committees and other bodies and, consequently, we may not fully understand what is happening.  The County Enterprise Partnership Boards should be the vehicle for activity at local level.  These boards should co-ordinate local and statutory bodies to enable them to liaise with Government Departments.  It not in our <Col N="607" /> interest to have five bodies doing the same job without knowing what the other is doing.  It is only when a project is being wound up that people realise they have being working towards the same end, but have not worked together along the way. That is a waste of resources which often results in the loss of projects.  The coordination of activities between local and statutory bodies is important.  Government Departments, the Taioseach and this task force should co-ordinate their efforts to devise a clear policy on developments.</P>
    <P>The bottom up approach is important because people must take the initiative and agencies must respond to that.  If a number of agencies respond in an uncoordinated way, enthusiasm is lost and a viable project may fall by the wayside. This is important at this time because funds will become available under the second Leader programme.  While the first Leader programme has been successful, the second programme could greatly enhance the west.  If the second programme is run on a county basis the county enterprise partnership boards can provide opportunities for tourism, agriculture and the marine.  The second Leader programme can provide vital funds and opportunities for development in the west.</P>
    <P>We must also be conscious of family farms and small businesses.  As another Senator said, for too long families in the west have been split by migration and emigration.  This is the year of the family. The west has suffered more than any other region from the splitting of families. We now have an opportunity, if we are serious about the west, to redress that imbalance.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Quinn, who said that no major manufacturing industry will come to the west.  This is incorrect. I only have to point to the Elan Corporation Ltd. which has provided 600 jobs for the people of Roscommon and, to some extent, Athlone and other parts of Westmeath.  If it can set up a major industry in Roscommon, which started small and developed over ten years to its <Col N="608" /> present capacity, there is no reason other industrialists should not come to the west.  Do they not want to come, as Senator Quinn said, or are the gurus in the industrial promotion agencies not identifying sites in the west?  Is it in their interests that sites are developed on the east and south coasts?  What is the real intent of those who are promoting industry? I am sure Elan is no different from other corporations around the world. They are happy in Athlone.  We must make sure that those who are promoting industry are promoting the whole country and not just sections of it.</P>
    <P>This debate will be brought back to the villages, towns and townlands of the west.  Not everything on paper will resolve the problems of the west.  The people themselves will encourage new thinking and encourage the Government to do what is necessary.  The Government must respond to the will of the people. This region is entitled to the same benefits and opportunities as any other.  The west has been left aside for too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the western bishops for encouraging the people of the west and north-west to take stock of the socio-economic decline of the region.  Speakers have adopted a unified approach, regardless of the political parties to which they belong.  I found Senator Gallagher's contribution interesting.  She is learning a good political lesson quickly. She was critical of the Government and its lack of incentives.  Maybe her party colleague who is here will talk to her and the Government will take on board and implement some of her proposals.  I hope her contribution shows the clear thinking and intentions of the Government.  I could say the same about Senator Finneran. We are largely in agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people say there is not a great deal of difference between political parties. In a pub in Sligo recently a man told me that there is one great difference, the parties in Government control the purse strings and the others cannot do much except shout and roar and do not control very much.  I hope the people controlling <Col N="609" /> the purse strings will open them and quickly send funds to the west.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment by the Government of a task force.  I hope this is not seen as another layer of bureaucracy. The reports of many other task forces have not been implemented but left on the shelf to gather dust.  The bishops' report is as good as a task force.  It has outlined the major problems facing the region and its people.  Its recommendations will not be any different from those which will be suggested by the task force.  What is needed is Government action and a response to this document, which has been put together not just by the bishops but by the people of the area.</P>
    <P>The bottom up approach, about which Senator Finneran spoke, is very evident in the way this document has been prepared. Every person in every townland and parish in the west and north-west has been involved.  I do not know what additional benefits a task force will provide. The people are looking for a commitment that the Government will provide the necessary funding and encouragement so that we in the west can attain a future for ourselves and future generations.</P>
    <P>The report recommends the establishment of a western development board.  A large problem faced not just by the west but by all regions is the total centralisation of Government.  We must seriously consider decentralisation and local autonomy and the giving to local councils the power to pursue policies and create incentives to encourage people to move to their areas.  We are the most centralised democracy in Europe.  There has been no great move towards local government reform.  I am sure this is close to the Minister's heart.  Local government has a very important role in development.  This is not an easy task but many Governments have been very inactive.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the need for regions to look after themselves, we must give them autonomy and the ability to raise finance and make decisions on their own rather than having to go to central Government, which in turn looks to <Col N="610" /> Europe.  This line of bureaucracy has not worked in the past and clearly is not working now.  We must be radical.  I support the establishment of a western development board.</P>
    <P>The report also deals with farming and agriculture.  Many speakers have pointed out that over the last number of years there has been a great decline in the number of family farms which, unfortunately, is continuing.  The Acting Chairman may not agree but many of the farmers in my area are totally dependent on the cheque in the post syndrome. Nowadays one would need a degree to get a cheque in the post as there is a plethora of application forms to be filled in when applying for headage and beef premiums.  The farmers are confused and the public representatives are overworked and confused because this is a bureaucratic nightmare.  The best example of this is the maps which are needed for headage.  The Minister said he would only accept Ordnance Survey maps and then he said he would accept Land Registry maps for a period.  He has now changed his mind and will only accept Land Registry maps.</P>
    <P>The confusion in the western farming communities is appalling.  They find it difficult to survive solely on agriculture because their land is marginal and their holdings are small.  Now, instead of giving them an incentive to stay on the farm, they are being swamped by bureaucracy. Young people who might otherwise consider continuing as full time farmers are discouraged.  This is another area to which we will have to give great consideration.</P>
    <P>The problems in County Leitrim are a microcosm of those of the west.  In 1895, Leitrim had a population of 150,000; today it is 24,000.  I am one of the younger Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and there were 33 boys in my class at national school, two of whom live in County Leitrim today.  The rest have either migrated or emigrated.  That is the stark reality which faces the west but it has already happened in County Leitrim. If governments and agencies do not decide to tackle this problem now this <Col N="611" /> will happen in all the counties along the western seaboard in the next 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected, the Seanad and Dáil have requested that tax incentives be given to rural areas which would create employment and attract industrialists. There are special tax incentives in Gaeltacht areas and urban renewal programmes in many of the larger provincial towns and cities which have been very successful in upgrading the rundown areas of those towns and cities.  I believe a rural renewal scheme is needed because all of County Leitrim and parts of Counties Sligo, Mayo and Roscommon need special attention and tax incentives to create employment, attract industry, maintain small businesses and retain the population.</P>
    <P>In County Leitrim there are six IDA factories which have been vacant for the last ten years.  A colleague who was in college with me wanted to set up an industry and was willing to do it in County Leitrim.  However, he received better tax incentives and a better deal to set up in Dublin.  His transport and other costs were lower.  In economic terms it paid him to set up the industry in Dublin and he has been very successful, which I hope will continue.  He had his heart set on coming to Leitrim but the resources were not available.</P>
    <P>Leitrim is the only county without an American based manufacturing industry. We have appealed on numerous occasions to different Ministers and agencies to give consideration to this.  Even 50 or 100 jobs would be very welcome because they would keep a community alive.  Leitrim is the only county which has not been promised a decentralised office, another area we wish to highlight. I hope the Government will continue its decentralisation policy and name Carrick-on-Shannon as one of the centres for decentralisation in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran made numerous references to family farms and businesses.  I was at a meeting a couple of weeks ago where we discussed the budget, the incentives for business and so on.  A man <Col N="612" /> who has been in business for 45 or 50 years employing 25 people said that every businessman in this country is thinking of ways to get people out of work rather than creating jobs because there is no incentive to create employment but rather to get rid of jobs.  This Government has failed to take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>The area of forestry was raised.  There are great incentives for afforestation.  It is the only area which is substantially grant aided.  Successive governments promised to provide a timber processing plant in the west.  Last year a timber processing plant was announced and, like the Golden Vale, the west has increased in geographic stature to include Waterford, or perhaps there are members of the Government who are not aware of the borders of the west.  There are people who are willing to stay on the family farm but they are not able to compete with private forestation because of the huge grant aid and initiatives it receives.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government task force will report quickly because action is required urgently.  I believe that if the recommendations in the programme published by the western bishops were implemented urgently, many of our problems would be solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> and I compliment the bishops.  However, I am concerned about where the west begins and ends.  Does it include the entire western seaboard?  I live in Kerry, which I think is in the west and is far more deprived than many of the other counties on the western coast. Every county is screaming for some type of development.  This crusade could begin in Donegal and finish in west Cork. That is the west of Ireland as far as I am concerned.  I see the same problems all along the western seaboard.  I am a little surprised that the Munster bishops did not become involved with their Connacht and County Donegal counterparts when they were putting this report together. Our people have to live in the west too. If people do not stay in the west there will be a population imbalance.  Numerous <Col N="613" /> campaigns are taking place in the west to try to get people to move out of cities like Dublin and live and work in rural areas.  There are opportunities there for them, but the Government will have to grasp the nettle and give financial resources to the west.</P>
      <P>I live on the Shannon estuary, which has one of the greatest potentials for development here.  It is the best seaport in the west and has been recognised as such for many years.  However, little money has been invested and no development has taken place in the estuary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter of deep concern to Cabinteely GAA club, a prospering club.  Coming from a prominent GAA county, I am sure the Minister of State is only too well aware that developing clubs should be given every assistance.  Dublin County Council has provided this club with primitive facilities which have no electricity, heat or running water.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that in this day and age such primitive facilities are not good enough.  I thought the days of changing by the edge of the pitch had ended, but it appears that is not the case in a part of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This club has not been given much assistance.  As the Minister for Finance gave a deserved £5 million towards the development of Croke Park, I hope there will be a balanced approach and grants will be allocated to developing clubs, many of whom have to organise fund-raising events to keep going.  The Cabinteely <Col N="614" /> club caters for 11 teams, ranging from 9 years of age to adults.  It plays both football and hurling and is hoping to establish a camogie team.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to assist it.  I have no doubt the Minister for Education will be interested in this matter. Perhaps both of them could secure a modest sum of money for this club.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 200 players involved in Cabinteely GAA Club and it is well supported in the area.  The club should be helped provide proper changing facilities.  It is not good enough that teams should have to change in a prefabricated building without basic shower facilities.  The club wants to build a clubhouse with dressing rooms, showers and a function room and are prepared to make a contribution to the costs.  Small clubs like these should be supported because they are developing gaelic games in an area where such games are not traditional.</P>
    <P>Given the Minister's background in County Kilkenny, I acknowledge his commitment to the GAA.  I do not think the Dublin hurling team will threaten his county for another year, and his county footballers will not worry our football selection either.  However, the Leas-Chathaoirleach's county football team may provide a sterner test for us in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will examine the request and give a commitment to respond with some good news.  The club contacted the Minister's office approximately five months ago.  The players, many of them young people, need a decent start and should have basic changing facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising this matter. I have been aware of this application for some time.  Some of my neighbours from that great hurling county Senator Cosgrave referred to have settled in that area and have also contacted me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Adjournment debate provides me with the opportunity to outline to Seanad Éireann details of the scheme the Department <Col N="615" /> of Education operates in assisting local clubs, organisations and community groups in providing sport and physical recreation facilities around the country. In addition to the scheme to provide major national and regional sports facilities, the Department operates the recreational facilities scheme, which is aimed at local developments such as the improvement of playing pitches, provision of sports facilities, clubhouses and so on.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education placed advertisements in the national daily newspapers last week, inviting applications from voluntary community organisations and sports clubs who wish to apply for assistance under the recreational facilities scheme.  The closing date for the receipt of completed application forms is 4 March 1994.  Because of that, I am constrained from giving any information as to who might be grantaided. Cabinteely GAA Club sent the completed application form to the Department and its request for assistance will be considered with the other applications when the closing date has passed.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Government gave a great boost to sport by providing an additional £3 million for the recreational facilities scheme.  The Senator will be aware that this is the first year for the past four that a figure of this nature has been provided.  I admit it was badly needed and I have been making representations about it for some time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> This extra funding will be of tremendous benefit to local clubs and organisations throughout the country.  We have many hundreds of applications for funding on hand and as a result of last week's newspaper advertisement, many more requests are coming in.  To date, we have received well in excess of 1,000 extra applications in the Department since last Friday, which shows the number of interested voluntary groups.  In the Department, we will examine and consider the applications strictly on the basis of the following criteria; the priority of the proposed improvement or facility in relation to the organisation's existing facilities, the ability of the organisation to undertake the project and claim the grant in 1994, the amount of local funds available, the availability of other facilities in the area and the requirement to achieve an equitable geographic spread of funds on which I have personally insisted in the scheme.  The Senator will appreciate that Cabinteely GAA club fulfils all the criteria in this regard.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I assure him that the club's application will be given careful consideration in the allocation of grants under the scheme this year.  As I said I am personally aware of the great work carried out by this club and I certainly will look favourably at their application at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 23 February 1994.</P>
