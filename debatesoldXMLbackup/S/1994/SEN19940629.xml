      <P>I have notice from Senator Sherlock that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the retention of a remedial teacher to facilitate slow learning children in Cloyne national school, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to outline the present position in relation to Kilrush community school, where staff and pupils have been operating from three separate sites since September 1992; when the negotiations for the purchase of the site for the new community school will be finalised; and when building will commence.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville and Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to support Resolution 47/19 of the United Nations General Assembly, entitled Necessity of ending economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the application for citizenship of a person of Irish extraction form South Africa (details supplied) and that the review be carried out with a view to issuing the applicant with an Irish passport.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Sherlock's and Senator Taylor-Quinn's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Neville, Kelly and Cotter may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I give the Order of Business, I am sure that the House would want me to recognise the fantastic result last night and to congratulate the Irish team, management and supporters for all they have given to this country.  It is a great morale boost for the country. They have been fantastic international ambassadors, both on and off the field.  I am sure that we all wish them well in their high noon match in Orlando next Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's Order of Business is Items 1, 2, 3 and 42.  We will deal with Item 1, Report and Final Stages of the National Monuments Amendment) Bill, 1993, and Item 2 between now and 1 p.m.  It is intended to take a sos at the conclusion of Item 2.  We will begin Item 3, Second Stage of the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill, 1994, at 2 p.m. and I suggest 30 minutes per spokesperson and 15 minutes thereafter.  Item 42 will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.  We will return to the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill, 1994, at <Col N="1627" /> 8 p.m., if necessary, to conclude Second Stage.  The Adjournment will be at the conclusion of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the House in expressing the pride which we all feel in the success to date of the Irish team.  As the Leader said, they are great ambassadors and they have had a great unifying effect on the country.  On that subject, I also wish to pay tribute to the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; especially Mr. Tom Brady, our consul in Orlando &mdash; for looking after people who found themselves, through no fault of their own, in difficulties.  There were universal feelings of satisfaction with the way Mr. Brady did his best to sort out a very difficult problem.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, can the Leader of the House indicate today what other legislation he intends bringing into the House between now and the end of the session and when he thinks the end of the session will be?  Could he &mdash; and this is something which has been supported by all sides of the House &mdash; provide time for a debate on Northern Ireland between now and the end of the session?  All parties in the House very much want to have a debate on that subject.</P>
      <P>May I draw the attention of Members to the very fine speech made recently by Uachtar·n na h…ireann in Poland on the role of the universities?  It is one of the finest speeches I have read.  Is there any provision whereby the full text of speeches made by An tUachtar·n can be made available to Members of either House?  It could form the subject of a very useful debate in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the compliments to the Irish team and fans.  It was not as spectacular a result as may have been suggested; a draw never can be. However, it has had the effect of getting us through to the next round which is very satisfactory.  We have appropriately complimented the fans.  I have work being done in my house today and I was amazed when the workmen turned up at <Col N="1628" /> 8.30 this morning.  It is a great tribute to the Irish workforce that they are able to celebrate and enjoy themselves and still turn up for work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach mentioned the amendments to the Bill.  The House will be pleased that the amendment to the Health Insurance Bill passed here was approved by the D·il.  This is very significant.  I am sorry that once again not one element of the broadcast or print media took the slightest notice of this.</P>
      <P>I recall working on a similarly technical Bill, the Child Care Bill.  A group of us succeeded in amending the Bill, including an entire section and the Minister unusually referred the entire Bill back to the D·il.  On that day the Order of Business was reported but there was no mention anywhere of that Bill.  Within a couple of weeks some of us were being chastised for looking for headlines on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Since we are in a congratulatory mood &mdash; I do not mean this frivolously &mdash; I would refer to the fact that, most unusually, an entire page of <i>The Irish Times</i> was taken out by an international agency to pay a compliment to the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, for the crucial role they played at the international whaling commission. When a marginal vote was taking place, they operated in a decisive way to ensure the survival of this species.  We can all be proud that an international agency took a one page advertisement in our national press to compliment the Prime Minister and a Minister of State.  I am sure this House would also wish to be associated with those congratulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what Senator Manning said about a debate on the North of Ireland. I also ask for information about the end of term which we all anticipate with relish.  I support Senator Manning's request for some information on the legislation to be dealt with by this House before the recess.  I hope it will not be <Col N="1629" /> done in too much of a rush.  I particularly have in mind the Refugee Protection Bill which the Government promised before the D·il adjourned.  The time scale is getting tight on that and Members from all sides have played a role in urging this measure.  We would all like to hear when the Refugee Protection Bill will be scheduled for debate in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the remarks of the Leader about the success of the Irish soccer team and the conduct of the fans and everybody associated with the team in America.  We derive great national pride from the manner in which they all have conducted themselves.  However, this World Cup will always, in my mind, be associated with the dreadful incident in Loughinisland.  Once again I join with others in asking for a debate on Northern Ireland.  If there has been one consistent theme since we resumed this session, it is the wish to debate Northern Ireland in the restrained and moderate way in which we have debated it in the past.  I am asking for that on the assumption that the T·naiste will not be otherwise engaged next week in Orlando.</P>

      <P>With regard to the ordering of business between now and the end of the session, the Leader is to be congratulated on the careful way in which he has ordered the time.  I appeal to him to continue to order the business as he did today between now and the end of the session.  I also ask him to ensure that we will not be faced with a succession of guillotines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating the players and managers, particularly Jack Charlton, and the fans whose enthusiastic support meant so much to the team yesterday.  Nothing has given more pleasure to the Irish people at home and abroad than the performance of our team in the World Cup.  However, I hope our fans will never again suffer the same treatment that was endured by a large <Col N="1630" /> contingent of fans from Cork city and county.  The story was reported to us by <i>The Cork Examiner</i> which handled the situation very well on behalf of the disappointed fans.</P>

      <P>I join in congratulating the team.  I will be somewhat partisan in doing so because I must congratulate Packie Bonner on his wonderful game.</P>
      <P>In addition I thank the country's employers who were more than helpful in giving people time off last night to watch the match.  Senator Magner should also be complimented for making arrangements for staff and Members to watch the match.</P>
      <P>I welcome the women from Letterkenny who are in the Visitors' Gallery today.</P>

We were promised, following the introduction by Fine Gael of a Private Members' Bill, that a refugee protection Bill would be introduced before last Christmas; then it was promised that it would be introduced before the end of this session.  Will the Leader of the House confirm that the Bill will be introduced by the end of this session?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We will endeavour to ensure that the Order of Business in the House during the next couple of weeks will be similar to <Col N="1631" /> today's so that we can clear our legislative programme.  Members asked about certain Bills.  Tomorrow morning I will confirm what Bills will be dealt with in the House before the recess.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D·il.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D·il and this is looked upon as the report of the D·il amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the D·il.</P>

      <P>T· ·thas orm bheith anseo.  Baineann na leasaithe, mar a d˙irt t˙ fhÈin, le leasaithe a deanadh sa D·il ar Bille a tÛgadh sa Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 12 amendments in my name which are discussed together.  It would be <Col N="1632" /> easier to group these amendments because some of them are related.  Therefore, I will take amendments Nos. 1, 9, 10 and 11.</P>
    <P>As regards detection devices, amendment No. 1 extends the seizure provisions of section 7 of the Bill to sites recorded under section 12 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 10 extends the prohibition of the possession of detection devices contained in section 2 of the National Monuments Act, 1987, to sites so recorded.  With these added precautions, I am sufficiently reassured to delete the presumption of guilt provisions of section 2 (6) of the 1987 Act.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 11.  As a consequence of amendments Nos. 1, 10 and 11, there is no longer any need for section 12 (5) of the Bill.  Therefore, amendment No. 9 in my name deletes this provision.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6 are related and deal with section 7 (b) and section 7 (4) and (7).  These amendments deal with seizure of equipment found being used at an archaeological site, where such site is on the seabed or on land covered by water.  Section 7 (b) of the Bill currently provides that gardaÌ be empowered to seize diving equipment where the Garda SÌoch·na believes that such equipment will be or has been used in an area covered by an underwater heritage order.  The effect of these three amendments will be to delete the specific references to diving equipment, to clarify more precisely the exact circumstances in which the Garda SÌoch·na may seize equipment, in terms of time, and to expand while still carefully delineating the types of location which are to be afforded such protection.  Amendment No. 2 provides that the seizure of equipment will only arise where any type of equipment, including diving equipment, is found, in the course of being used, to tamper with, damage or survey with a view to recovering archaeological objects or wrecks from the seabed or from land covered by water, where such equipment is found being used in or on identified types of sites.</P>
    <P>Many representations have been received from the diving community and <Col N="1633" /> from Members of the Oireachtas that the provision, as it stood, targeted divers unfairly and that it was draconian in its scope in so far as the Garda SÌoch·na was being empowered to seize diving equipment before an offence had been committed. I emphasise it was never my intention to make any such assumption, but in order to take on board points made, I make this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is not accepted that the current provision targeted divers <i>per se</i>.  The limitation of seizure to instances where the equipment is about to be used is intended only to pre-empt the imminent and immediate prospect of damage to a site. Nonetheless I accepted that the provision could be, and maybe has been, perceived as overly protective.  In this context, I consider that suitable changes to the wording could usefully match the provision more closely to the intention, while at the same time not diminish the effective degrees of protection felt to be necessary.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 6, which introduces a new subsection to section 7 as part of the process of re-examining the scope of the proposed new provision, it has been felt necessary to extend its application in terms of place to sites on the seabed or on land covered by water located where such sites are located within confines of certain easily established and specified types of monument or monument area.</P>
    <P>Apart from underwater heritage areas cited in the current provision, water situated areas contained in any national monuments sites, whether in State or private care, in archaeological areas registered in the register kept by the Office of Public Works or situated within sites noted in records of SMRs, sites and monument records &mdash; the originals of SMRs are held in the Office of Public Works while copies are kept in every planning authority &mdash; are now included.</P>
    <P>The purpose of extending the scope of the provision in terms of place is to give greater effective protection to the many diverse types of water based sites situated inland, for example, an ancient fording area on a river in respect of which an <Col N="1634" /> underwater heritage order would not be the most obvious or appropriate means of protection.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 deleting the word &ldquo;diving&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;other&rdquo; are consequential technical amendments arising from substantive changes to section 7 (b).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 deals with the return of equipment which has been seized.  It is a matter of general law that anything seized by the Garda SÌoch·na should be returned to its rightful owner in the event that it is decided that a prosecution will not proceed.  I indicated that I had some sympathy with the view that an express provision of this nature might strengthen the provision, although it is clear from the provisions of section 7 that the courts will decide whether equipment seized under this provision is to be forfeited permanently.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 is designed to expressly clarify that items seized under section 7 are to be treated the same way as other items seized by or which come into the possession of gardaÌ in the course of their duties and must be returned if a prosecution does not take place.  The Police Property Act, 1897, provides <i>inter alia</i> that a person may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for the return of property which has come into the possession of the police.  Section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, provides that an order under the Police Property Act, 1897, can be sought by the Garda SÌoch·na in respect of the disposal of equipment which has come in their possession, although no person has been charged with an offence in conjunction with it.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 deals with powers of acquisition of the Office of Public Works and constraints in the provision of facilities deemed appropriate by the Minister.  Concern has been expressed about the nature of facilities which might be provided under this provision.  People were worried that ice cream parlours and even dance halls might be provided by the Commissioners of Public Works in the vicinity of national monuments. Amendment No. 7 is designed to address this point in that land in the vicinity of a national monument can only be acquired <Col N="1635" /> for the provision of facilities deemed appropriate by me as Minister.</P>
    <P>It is worth reflecting for a moment on the safeguards now built into this provision. Land for the provision of facilities can only be acquired with my consent and that of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance and I are accountable to the Oireachtas for our actions in the exercise of these powers.  In addition, only facilities deemed appropriate by me can be provided.  It is implicit that my consent to any acquisition will only be forthcoming when I am satisfied that the facilities proposed are appropriate ones. If a landowner objects to the acquisition of land, say, by the Office of Public Works, my consent and the consent of the Minister for Finance must be obtained for the compulsory purchase.  In addition, any facilities which the Office of Public Works proposes to provide will require planning permission.  There are now adequate safeguards and this should allay all reasonable fears which might be held by the public.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 deals with the making, keeping and maintenance of a register of recorded monuments by the Office of Public Works as a mandatory requirement.  The purpose of this amendment is to make the keeping and maintenance of the register of recorded monuments under section 12 a mandatory provision.  As the Office of Public Works will be primarily responsible for the work involved in compiling and publicising the register, the most practical approach is to place the statutory obligation for the register on the Office of Public Works.  While I comment on these amendments I have to restrain myself. The Office of Public Works has, as we know, done wonderful work.  If they are acquiring the data for the register it is most appropriate that they carry the responsibility.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 deals with compulsory purchase procedures.  This amendment deletes the provision indicating that Ministers must give their consent to a compulsory purchase once the procedural steps for the making of that <Col N="1636" /> compulsory purchase have been complied with.  It was not the intention that the Minister should have no effective discretion to refuse a compulsory purchase application by the Office of Public Works.  A provision which positively affirms that the Minister does have discretion to grant or refuse consent to compulsory acquisition within four months of the date of the application by the Office of Public Works to the Minister has now been substituted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments proposed by the Minister are reasonable and sensible and have the full support of this side of the House.  The amendments tie in to a commonsense Bill which we look forward to seeing enacted.  The amendments strengthen this Bill which we have discussed in the Seanad already and which has been passed by the D·il.</P>
      <P>The amendments dealing with detection devices and the amendments as passed by the D·il which we are discussing are sensible, particularly those which amend section 7 of the Bill.  In regard to the amendments dealing with equipment being used in the vicinity of a wreck or any archaeological object found in water or under the sea bed or on land covered by water, officers of the Office of Public Works or the Garda would have up to now confronted a genuine problem where equipment would have been used for illegal purposes but which up to now would not have been covered by this legislation.  This extends the powers that are essential to safeguard these wrecks and archaeological items.  They are to be welcomed and supported.  They extend the necessary powers which will be granted to the Garda.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the presumption of guilt has been changed by the Minister. A much safer provision has been made in this instance.  A number of people had made representations to me concerning the seizure of equipment, in particular diving equipment.  The Minister felt that divers might be unfairly targeted and the amendment he has proposed to try to resolve that problem is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> The Minister comes from an area where many people are involved in diving.  In my area of the midlands we have Clonmacnoise beside the Shannon River and I am certain that, on occasion, people have been diving to find treasure throve or valuable items of one sort or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That was when they were making hay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>On occasion, because of the flooding, it was as hard to make hay as it was to find a treasure trove.  However, some people went diving to find items of value.  There are a number of sub-aqua clubs which, overall, do valuable work on behalf of the State by assisting and cooperating with the Garda SÌoch·na when people have fallen into the water or have drowned.  It is heartening that the Minister has made a specific effort to ensure that divers are not unfairly targeted but rather that they are supported.  A great debt of gratitude is owed to members of sub-aqua clubs around the country.  In this instance the Minister is trying to strike a balance.</P>
      <P>When items have been seized and there is no sustainable case it is important that the items be returned.  As the Minister is aware, the garda has to go to court if equipment has been seized and interested parties would have to make their case as to why the State should not retain possession of that equipment.  I am pleased that this facility has been extended in this case.</P>
      <P>This Bill and the 1987 legislation are part of an ongoing process.  I understand the Minister has two further Bills in preparation and we look forward to them.  I wish the Minister well in his task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for the way he has handled the process of this Bill through the Houses.  Having read the Official Reports I empathise with the way he has listened to all the views expressed and, in particular, those relating to divers and members of diving clubs.  They asked us to put their case to the Minister so that <Col N="1638" /> he would realise how important it was that the Garda would allow members of diving clubs to enjoy their leisure activities without feeling that they were under suspicion if they were diving near a national monument.  I compliment the Minister for listening carefully to those views and for taking them into account.</P>
      <P>I will widen the debate a little by referring to a small aspect of the Bill, amendment No. 7, which deals with powers of acquisition.  It concerns commercial activities that may come about because some people might see the existence of a national monument in the area as a quick way of making a profit.  They may open an ice cream parlour, for example.  That would take from the idea that the national monuments are for the public, not for commercial activities.</P>
      <P>From reading through the Bill &mdash; perhaps I have not read it carefully enough &mdash; we need to further tidy up the lines between the planning department and the planning authority.  The planning department plays a big role in ensuring that any commercial activity has to be monitored through the Office of Public Works.  I ask the Minister to reinforce that point.  There are some developers who will try to avoid going through this process.  Can the Minister ensure that this legislation is as tight as possible?  A commercial activity is about to be set up at Rathfarnham Castle and we are watching it closely.  Indeed, much of our time as councillors is being taken up to ensure this does not happen.  The legislation should be kept as simple as possible so that both the councillors and those people reflecting the views of the public do not have to proceed through the legislation in a roundabout way.  When this Bill becomes law it should be made public to show the people that it is not that easy to set up a commercial activity around a national monument area.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the other aspects of the Bill.  The Minister has satisfactorily dealt with them.  I am happy that all of these amendments to the Bill are in order.  We regard them on this side of the House as being required.</P>

      <P>These amendments have improved the legislation.  They are to be welcomed and I will not oppose them. However, I wish to refer to some important points that have not been dealt with to a degree.</P>
      <P>When the Committee Stage of this Bill was debated one of my concerns was that landowners whose property was entered onto by the Director of the National Museum &mdash; for instance, if a certain artefact was found on valuable pasture land or land under crops &mdash; there was no provision in the Bill to compensate people in the event of the land not being acquired. There are provisions for payment to people whose land was acquired. However, there was no provision in the legislation for compensation for damage that might have been done to the property when entry was effected to recover a certain article.  I regarded that as a serious defect at the time and I still feel that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to a statement made at that time by the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Gallagher <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>&mdash; indeed, that Minister has recently gone on to greater things.  During that debate that Minister said he would put an amendment on Report Stage that would allay my fears.  However, it was never put.  Are we to take it that statements of that nature will not be honoured and is there not a serious obligation on Ministers to honour them?  In my view they should be honoured, and I am sure the Minister would agree with that.  When we came to Report Stage, Senator Enright put down a similar amendment to mine and it was not accepted.  That is regrettable. The Minister gave certain vague assurances that people would be looked after and that there would not be unilateral entry without taking the views of landowners into account.  However, that is not the point; there should be a provision in the legislation to allay those fears.  It is a deficiency in the Bill.  At this stage not much can be done on this matter, but it is something which must be addressed.  Perhaps the Department, the <Col N="1640" /> Minister and his officials could consider it at a later stage?  It would appear that they are about to advise the House that this matter was addressed, but from the record before me this does not appear to be the case.  I apologise to the Minister for causing chaos on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be proven wrong and I thank the Minister.  It is important to clarify the issue as it has caused confusion.  Regarding the erection of facilities subject to the proviso that the Minister deems them to be appropriate, I have no serious objection to the Minister having this role.  However, not everybody is blessed by the Minister's taste and sense of aesthetics.  In addition, the Minister will agree that it is possible in politics that a situation may arise where the Minister of the day may be a philistine.  The provision gives the Minister of the day a wide scope to determine on the desirability or otherwise of a facility.  While presumably he would be guided by the Department officials, it is nevertheless a cause for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the commissioners may decide themselves as to what is good or bad in terms of taste. Whereas all others have an obligation to consult, the commissioners do not have this obligation.  When the Bill was passing through the House my party recommended the National Heritage Council as an example of a body which could be consulted by the Office of Public Works when projects were being undertaken. Indeed, since then legislation is now being introduced to put the National Heritage Council on a statutory footing. In the course of debate on the Bill it was suggested that as the National Heritage Council was not on a statutory footing it should not be involved in such a consultation process.  However, the fact that it is now to be put on a statutory footing <Col N="1641" /> would allow this process to take place. Perhaps therefore the impending legislation on the National Heritage Council will give it certain functions regarding this matter.  Will the Minister give some consideration to this?</P>
    <P>Regarding diving equipment and material under water, when Senator Enright was speaking I had visions of meadows on the Shannon which for several months of the years are under water. Doubtless, a Chathaoirligh, you can readily identify with this.  I can imagine somebody with a silage harvester with a metal detector on it finding themselves in court and having their equipment returned to them.</P>
    <P>The amendments made to the Bill will improve the legislation and they are not opposed from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is largely accepted that the Minister is very suited to the portfolio he holds.  He has demonstrated to the public that he is not a fanatic, that he is genuinely concerned and that he is doing an excellent job.  I compliment him on his excellent work.  In order to attend this House in his present position, the Minister had to be elected by the public and nominated to this post.  I commend the Minister on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On issues of concern covering a wide area, whether it is valuable monuments on land or water, it is fashionable to organise a protest, lobby group, campaign or whatever.  But are the qualifications of those who organise such campaigns to stop research and development requested at any stage?  It is important because a wide range of organisations are involved, including the National Heritage Council, the Office of Public Works and An Taisce.  My question arises from the fact that we have an everincreasing focus on An Taisce, which is made up of various people, including one who describes himself as an environmentalist with some qualifications. However, to my personal knowledge that person was in England on the dole for about 30 years and took up the new cause when he came back.  That is bad for the <Col N="1642" /> whole area as well as the plan of work that the Minister intends to carry out with the support of the general public.  Would the Minister agree that it is necessary to question the qualifications of those who enter a public campaign and to ask who is leading them and what is behind it? Are any other causes behind it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <P>The qualifications of politicians are tested occasionally, and the Senator should know that from a recent outing.  I would like to ask the Minister another question relating to valuable wrecks under the sea.  Has the Minister taken precautions to ensure that explosives will not be used without a licence and that, if they are used under the sea, it will be done under supervision? Can the Minister confirm that the legislation will cover the supervision and use of explosives if they have to be used in connection with the research, examination or development of artefacts found under the sea?  Off County Donegal recently we had a very valuable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your assistance.  I am putting the question to the Minister because of the experience that we have had off the County Donegal coast where valuable equipment was found on wrecks.  If explosives were used by vandals or people anxious to make a quick pound, then great damage would be caused.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister if he is satisfied beyond doubt that the legislation will prevent any such vandalism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of county councils have national monument sub-committees, which are effective and dedicated bodies.  In County Galway we have a national monuments committee which is one of the most progressive and knowledgeable committees that it has been my privilege to serve on, as vice-chairman. The chairman of that committee happens to be a member of the Heritage Council and the secretary, as the Minister will know, is one of the most knowledgeable men in the field, Mr. Paul Gosling of University College, Galway. We move around the county but not excessively in that there are just a few meetings a year.  The last one was held in my parish, in the lackagh Museum and Heritage Centre.  This is a new project in Galway and it is a most beautiful and delightful attraction.  I hope the Cathaoirleach and many others will visit it during a break from the Galway races later in the summer.  However, the committees, which operate under the jurisdiction of councils, should be given more power because, in effect, they are toothless bodies.  Decisions they make are referred back to county councils and these can be lost along the way due to bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are ten statutory members of the National Monuments Committee and as many honorary members as are desired. It would be due recognition for outstanding work by people, particularly those who served since the formation of sub-committees of the national monuments committee, if the Minister increased the number of statutory positions. If it is within his remit, I suggest that he increase this number from ten to 12.  If it not within his remit, perhaps he could suggest it to the Minister who holds the portfolio.  Many people who work in an honorary capacity on these committees <Col N="1644" /> are most knowledgeable and dedicated.  They give marvellous service, often far beyond the call of duty.</P>
    <P>It is possible that my final point does not come within the Minister's remit but there is close liaison between the Government partners.  Thatched houses and cottages are important and plans are afoot that there should be a thatched cottage heritage centre or museum in every parish.  The current position is that a person who thatches the house in which they live can receive a grant of £2,000. However, heritage groups, such as the Lackagh Museum to which I referred earlier, do not receive anything.  I know this matter comes within the remit of the Minister for the Environment but Minister Higgins has a great interest in monuments, heritage and culture, for which I commend him.</P>
    <P>I ask him to suggest that a grant be made available to bodies around the country which would prefer to thatch old houses.  Such houses are, in a sense, ancient monuments, although that is not always recognised.  If a group or body within a parish gets a building, renovates it and is prepared to have the roof thatched, it should receive some type of grant as recognition of its work.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the amendments made to the Bill in the D·il.  The amendments have mollified the concerns of divers who were afraid that their innocent activities could be misconstrued and they could find themselves in deep trouble with the law.  I also welcome that some of the amendments broaden the range of the Bill in certain areas, as the Minister outlined.  This includes old fording points, which were not covered by the Bill heretofore but which are now covered as a result of the amendments made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> May I have the indulgence of the Chair to stray, as other Members have done, by saying that we very much need a policy of public awareness of our vast range of archaeological wealth?  There is a tendency for people to think that archaeology relates to things which are hundreds of years old.  As Senator McDonagh pointed out, thatched cottages which are currently being lived in are as much part of our heritage and culture as perhaps ruined castles which are 300, 400 or 500 years old.  When speaking to people like the Director of the National Museum one gets the feeling that a great deal is being destroyed under our noses and that we are probably ignorant of the value of some of the things we are currently knocking down, renovating or destroying out of all existence.  Some of these articles, such as old milestones, can easily be destroyed but are an important feature of what our countryside looked liked in the past.  We need public awareness and education on what is to be preserved.  We may be able to elaborate on this idea much more when we discuss the Heritage Council legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister and compliment him and his officials on producing good legislation which is likely to be effective.  He referred to amendment No. 7 to section 11, which deals with the powers of acquisition.  This section is most important.  There are problems throughout the country in relation to access to monuments.  Strong tourist areas get priority status with regard to developments of this nature whereas areas like Monaghan and Cavan, which are not reckoned to be attractive for tourism and receive the lowest earnings in the country from tourism, are forgotten.  Even though I welcome the legislation, I question its usefulness to where I live.  Giving the Office of Public Works wide powers of acquisition and the authority to set up a registrar of recorded monuments is fine, but unless they have the money to do something on the ground there will be continued disappointment. When monuments are in private hands, the owners are forever perturbed about <Col N="1646" /> people using their land to gain access to these monuments.  They are worried that there will be huge insurance claims against them at some stage and that they will be put out of business.  We talk about this on a regular basis.  It is important that the Office of Public Works not only have the power to gain access but also the money to do so.</P>
      <P>My own area and others are more or less forgotten from the point of view of the development and protection of our archaeological sites and heritage.  Maghernacloy Castle is outside Carrickmacross. It has a history dating back to the Middle Ages.  It was lived in continuously from the 15th century until seven or eight years ago.  I have been making strenuous efforts for a number of years to interest the Office of Public Works in this castle.  I am having some success in that certain people are looking at it now.  I ask the Minister to take an interest in this.  It is not a castle, as its name would suggest, but is a fortified dwelling.  It is of immense importance to people not only in Monaghan but throughout the nation.  It must be preserved. Its floors are collapsing and in another four of five years the building itself will collapse and we will have another archaeological site.  We have a site called Manann Castle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am illustrating amendment No. 7.  Manann Castle site is of enormous archaeological interest but the building is entirely gone.  Over the past 50 or 60 years the remaining pieces of it were removed for various reasons.  The legislation is not meaningful to us and I would like the Minister to take an interest in Maghernacloy Castle; it is still there at the moment but there is a danger that within a decade it will just be a site.  I ask him to use his influence to get the Office of Public Works to examine the possibility of taking ownership of it from the family which owns it at present.  The local authority are anxious to do something about it.  I will give the Minister details <Col N="1647" /> of it later today.  I compliment the Minister on producing this excellent legislation and I look forward to its implementation.</P>

I thank Senators for the deep interest they displayed in this legislation from the time I first brought it into the House.  Senator Enright welcomed the amendments which had been made in the D·il, particularly in relation to detection. There was never any intention to single out divers but the perception of legislation, particularly Bills like this one, is as important as its substance.  It is better to have the matter completely resolved and the changes are welcome.  He also spoke about the general law relating to the return of equipment.  I believed that seized equipment was covered by this, but once again it is no harm to make this explicit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senator pointed out that this Bill should be seen as part of a package of legislation which I am introducing. The Heritage Council legislation has already been printed and will be followed by legislation dealing with museums and libraries.  These should be taken together.  The intention is to put a package of legislation in place, which will integrate issues of protection with those of public awareness and institutional management.  I am pursuing this integration. Senator Ormonde also referred to divers and the powers of acquisition provided for in amendment No. 7.  Under the new legislation the Heritage Council will liaise with the planning authorities and there will be a mechanism for its opinion to be expressed.  Any reasonable comments and observations it makes cannot be disposed of without being refuted.  It will, therefore, have a role in the planning sense.  The Heritage Council legislation will provide for a policy role <Col N="1648" /> which will interact with the requirements of good planning.</P>
    <P>I wish to correct myself lest I be anything other than fair in relation to Senator Dardis's contribution, which was thoughtful and detailed.  It was wrong only in the sense that the amendment promised by the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has been pursued.  As I said, I am not suggesting that Senator Dardis's concerns have been fully met but the issue has been addressed, particularly in relation to the amendment to section 8.</P>
    <P>We made an amendment to section 8 confining the Director's right of entry to cases where there is an immediate threat to the site of the find.  The word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; dealt with some of the question of where crop cultivation and so forth had gone on.  For the purposes of teasing out the role of the Director, people conjured up, particularly in the other House, vistas of the Director of the National Museum arriving with an army.  The Director or the nominated person will, of course, identify themselves and seek to sensitively execute their duties.</P>
    <P>This matter runs right through the Bill and it is no harm to try to clearly establish what my intention was in this regard.  We want to protect the heritage of all of the people, not only of those who are alive now but of generations to come.  But we have to try to do that in a way which does not cancel any individual liberties. However, there is no doubt that if we pursued the path of individual liberty absolutely, we could not protect heritage. One has to try to protect heritage in a way which strikes a balance.  This leads to a specific challenge in which one has to balance private rights with the new stated public right of all of the people of Ireland to their heritage.</P>
    <P>Where this legislation goes on to implement part of the Finlay judgement in the case of Webb <i>v</i>.  Ireland represents for me the heart of the Bill.  That is, that the protection is based on a fundamental statement that the heritage of Ireland is the property of all of the people of Ireland.  The authority for that is that at the moment of the declaration of independence, <Col N="1649" /> the people declared themselves entitled to their heritage as an aspect of their independence and sovereignty. That is at the heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a very important fundamental right which has to be protected beyond any individual inconvenience. That is not to say that one should choose to inconvenience anybody. However, it is a very powerful pillar which stands at the other side of the extreme assertion of individual rights. The amendment which was made to section 8 will be of help in relation to the construction of the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;. Obviously, the procedures can be kept under review.</P>
    <P>I would also say to Senator Dardis that in regard to where the Bill refers to the Minister of the day, I know how temporary all of our existences are. However, I want to assure Senators that in addition to Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht of the day, there will also be roles for the Minister for Finance, the planning authority and, when the necessary legislation comes in, the Heritage Council.  It seems that there are many different filters through which this word &ldquo;appropriate facilities&rdquo; can come. It will not be capricious, as it has to be initiated by the body responsible to the two Ministers &mdash; the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who is responsible for policy in the Office of Public Works, and the Minister for Finance. There are also the county councils and the opinion of the Heritage Council to be considered.  There is a considerable mechanism for assuring matters.</P>
    <P>I think that Senator McGowan was unduly worried about An Taisce.  I believe that its work around the country has been of immense value in helping local authorities by supplying lists, even when local authorities did not have the capacity or, sometimes, the energy to put supplements to their plans.  The lists which were prepared by An Taisce were invaluable.  I was a member of a local authority which was continually indebted to it for its good work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> Words can confuse, assist and wound. However, I think that if anybody, irrespective of their qualification or education, who expresses through ecological responsibility a wish for the environment wants to call themselves an environmentalist, so be it and may good fortune attend their efforts.  Qualification does not really enter in there.  There was a time when sociologists were fashionable and people assumed that they had a higher level of knowledge.  They had a technical knowledge but they had no absolute knowledge &mdash; none of us does. At the end of the day it is the combination of one's heart and head and where one's intentions lie which are important.  The more ecological responsibility there is the better.</P>
    <P>The question of explosives is already covered.  There is a general order in relation to the use of explosives and procedures are laid down.  However, let me make it clear that the position is that the use of such explosives in the vicinity of a wreck which is over 100 years old is forbidden, except under licence.  We will have a considerable protection there.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh's points were in relation to the question of the representation of the National Monuments Committees at the different county councils. He will be aware that the committee to which he referred recently wrote to me seeking a meeting.  They are arranging to meet me in the next few weeks.  I offered to meet them last week, but I was precipitate. However, I am very aware of the good work being done by the Galway committee.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether a thatched cottage in every parish is the way to go about it &mdash; it seems a little too contrived.  There are places where there would be three or four and others where there might not be any.  I will convey the Senator's views to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, in relation to the restriction. I have had communications from interested individuals and some very brilliant experts in relation to vernacular architecture.  I have asked the Heritage Council to look at that general area, which I feel is the way to approach it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1651" /> An interesting dimension, to which I appreciate that the Seanad is very sensitive, is that in the end we do things in regard to heritage for ourselves in order to become interesting people who live in interesting places of which we are proud and to which we welcome visitors.  We are not beginning at the other end.  In other words, we are not saying that we are doing this because it will attract visitors and that we will happen to understand it afterwards; that would be putting the cart before the horse.  We are doing it initially for ourselves as part of ourselves and it happens to have an immense economic benefit.  These are very interesting ideas.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly welcomed the amendments which were made.  I assure her and other Senators that they were made to meet the genuine views which had been expressed in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I agree with her and I hope that by combining this legislation with museums and libraries legislation we will address the issue of public awareness.  In many ways we should have co-operation from the teaching unions and those involved in education to enable a wider understanding of heritage.  Senator Cotter raised a number of points.  He has communicated with me about the medieval fortified house he mentioned.  I will refer it to the appropriate section to ascertain the position on it.  He also drew attention to powers of acquisition.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points in this Bill which are important to me.  The first is the assertion that the Irish heritage is the property of the people of Ireland and should be protected adequately.  There is an intersection between the private citizen and the State where the latter acts as the agency of the people of Ireland. There has to be a balance which takes account of those rights that are beyond private rights but still respects private rights.</P>
    <P>This not a question of compensating people for something of which they have a temporary ownership but of rewarding good citizenship.  Good citizenship is <Col N="1652" /> built on awareness of the importance of our heritage and monuments.  I express my deep gratitude for the contributions, interest and the work which the Seanad has done which has improved the legislation. T· mÈ buÌoch don Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> The Environmental Protection Agency (Extension of Powers) Order, 1994, laid in draft before this House, is designed to extend to the agency, in relation to licensed activities, a number of the enforcement powers already available to local authorities under air and water pollution legislation.  I am delighted to have this opportunity, in seeking your approval to the draft order, to report to the Seanad on the progress made in establishing the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>Senators may recall that the Environmental Protection Agency Bill was first debated in the Seanad and such was the interest in this subject that over 60 per cent of Senators contributed to the Second Stage debate.  The quality of that and subsequent debates was also noteworthy and matched the high level of participation by Senators.  Much progress has been made since then and I would like to elaborate on some of the more important developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency was formally established on 26 July 1993 and has concentrated on preparing its organisational and administrative capacities and structures to take on the wide range of regulatory and promotional functions envisaged under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  The agency's temporary headquarters has been set up at Ardcavan, just outside Wexford, pending the provision of permanent accommodation in or around Wexford town.  At present a <Col N="1654" /> total of 102 staff are located in Wexford, Dublin and other regional centres.</P>
    <P>My Department is providing a grant of £4.4 million in 1994 towards the expenditure of the agency which is expected to be £5.2 million for the year.  The balance of the agency's income will come from licence fees and local authorities in respect of laboratory services provided by the agency.</P>
    <P>While the primary function of the agency is the operation of an integrated licensing system, there is a substantial body of work under way in the four divisions of the organisation.  In addition to the range of functions previously undertaken by the Environmental Research Unit, the agency has, for example, commenced preparation of a state of the environment report with a view to publication of a full report next year.  Draft guidelines on the contents of environmental impact statements are being finalised prior to publication for public comment.</P>
    <P>The agency has also advanced preparation of national hydrometric and environmental monitoring programmes and of guidelines for local authorities in relation to sewage treatment and landfill sites.  Data have already been published in respect of drinking water and river water quality.  With the commencement of licensing, the development of monitoring systems and advisory services, its liaison with the newly established European Environmental Agency and its obligations to provide public access to environmental information, the agency will now be placing particular emphasis on establishment of environmental data bases.</P>
    <P>Integrated licensing is the principal means by which the agency will prevent or control emissions from those activities with the greatest potential for significant impact on the environment.  Integrated licensing is a new concept in environmental management in this country and, indeed, in most other European countries. It goes beyond the traditional framework of pollution control by providing for one licence to cover air, water, waste and noise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> Recognising the interdependence of environmental media, integrated licensing seeks to prevent or solve pollution problems without transferring them from one medium to another.  In carrying out its licensing and other functions the agency must have regard to the need to promote sustainable and environmentally sound development, the need for precaution in relation to the potentially harmful effects of emissions, the polluter pays principle and the balance to be achieved between environmental protection and economic and social development.</P>
    <P>The licensing system formally came into operation on 16 May 1994 as a result of regulations which I made in April under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  The licensing regulations provide that new activities in eight of the 13 classes of activity scheduled in the Environmental Protection Agency Act require integrated licences from the agency on or after 16 May 1994.  Classes of new activity for which integrated licences are now required include chemicals, minerals, energy, food and drink, waste, wood, paper, textiles and leather.</P>
    <P>I have also decided that the large scale manufacture of pesticides, pharmaceutical or veterinary products and the incineration of hazardous waste are the first of the established activities to be subject to Environmental Protection Agency control and I have fixed 1 September 1994 for this purpose.  I intend that new activities in the remaining classes scheduled in the Act, and existing activities in all classes, will be phased into the Environmental Protection Agency licensing system on a progressive basis. A small number of licence applications which had been with local authorities at the commencement date of 16 May have now been transferred to the agency which has had pre-application discussions with 19 companies.</P>
    <P>In the initial phases of licensing, I am satisfied that a focused approach is the right one, so that the anticipated level of activity matches the build up of Environmental Protection Agency competences <Col N="1656" /> in this complex area and that there will be no delays in processing new licence applications.  I am keeping progress in the processing of licence applications under close review with the intention of bringing further categories of activity into the licensing system as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Substantial work has been undertaken by the agency to facilitate a smooth transition to the new regulatory framework. The agency will licence activities on the basis that the best available technology not entailing excessive cost &mdash; BATNEEC &mdash; will be used to prevent or eliminate or, where this is not practicable, limit, abate or reduce emissions. In defining BATNEEC, pollution prevention techniques, including cleaner technologies and waste minimisation, are emphasised rather than the end of pipe treatment.</P>
    <P>While ultimately it is a matter for the operator to decide on what is BATNEEC for his particular circumstances, the parameters or the limits on emissions will have been set by the agency.  An important feature of the preparations for the new system is the publication by the agency of BATNEEC notes to provide guidance to licence applicants and other interested parties.  Draft notes for the chemical, waste and energy sectors have already been widely circulated by the agency for comment.  A guide to the implementation and enforcement of IPC licensing has been published and the agency is now holding regional seminars at five locations to promote a clear understanding and appreciation of its licensing function.  This series of initiatives is to be welcomed and is entirely in keeping with the spirit of openness which is expected of the agency.</P>
    <P>Once a licence is granted by the agency the conditions of the licence are fully enforceable by the agency.  Senators will be aware that the Act grants very extensive discretion to the agency in regard to the conditions which may be attached to a licence and that failure to comply with any condition is an offence under the Act. The legal processes already available to the agency under the Act to pursue non-compliance include summary prosecution <Col N="1657" /> or indictment; conviction on indictment carries heavy penalties &mdash; a fine of up to £10 million or imprisonment for up to ten years or both fine and imprisonment. The agency has made clear that a strong and active policy will be adopted in relation to enforcement of licence conditions, with pursuit of legal processes where clear breaches occur.</P>
    <P>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, enforcement action by the agency relies solely on prosecution, convictions for which can attract severe penalties.  In the absence of the order for which I am now seeking approval, the agency would not have available to it the wider range of enforcement powers which are available to local authorities. This gap has already been filled for the transitional cases.  For the purposes of ensuring that existing licence or permit conditions are met in the transitional period between the application for and the granting of an IPC licence, relevant enforcement provisions of air, water and waste legislation were already extended to the agency under the licensing regulations.</P>
    <P>I now propose to introduce similar arrangements for activities which have been licensed by the agency.  The powers being extended to the agency in the draft order before you include application to the High Court for an order requiring the prohibition, termination or reduction of a discharge or emission and in the event of non-compliance, the agency may undertake the actions specified in the court order and recover its costs from the offender; the service of notices specifying the measures and the periods within which they shall be undertaken necessary to prevent air or water pollution; prosecution of offences under general prohibitions on air and water pollution &mdash; that is, from emissions or circumstances not dealt with in the integrated licence; entry, inspection, monitoring, the gathering of information and prosecutions for the purposes of the proposed extended powers; the recovery of the agency's costs of taking proceedings and the payment of fines to the agency in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> Concerns were expressed in the D·il on the need to avoid the possibility of the agency overlapping with local authority functions.  I assure the House that in drafting the order I was conscious of the danger of introducing any element of confusion.  You will note that the proposed arrangements provide for the performance of the itemised statutory provisions by the agency in respect of licensed activities in lieu of the local authority. All other existing functions of local authorities will continue unaltered.  You will agree that the proposed order makes a clear distinction between the agency's and the local authority's role in individual cases.  As there will be a couple of months before the first integrated licence is granted by the agency and as the numbers of such licences will gradually increase, local authorities concerned and the agency will have plenty of time to liaise and adjust to the new situation.</P>
    <P>This proposed comprehensive package of enforcement powers, together with the substantial powers and penalties already contained in the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, will complete the process in providing the agency with the teeth necessary to carry out its functions effectively under any circumstances. I strongly commend the resolution approving the draft order to this House.</P>

      <P>Cuirim f·ilte roimh an Aire.  The Environmental Protection Agency was established by the Government to provide a central organisation based in Wexford to oversee environmental activities in the State.  This was a welcome innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has an onerous task.  Its main duties are to prevent and control serious pollution by licensing certain industries or activities which have a high capacity to cause pollution. The specific categories concerned are listed in the legislation.  The licence is an integrated licence dealing with air and water pollution and other relevant matters.  The local authority will continue to be responsible for activities other than those for which the Environmental Protection <Col N="1659" /> Agency has responsibility. Hence, there is a great onus on the local authority to continue to act in this important area.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency will be responsible for ensuring that local authorities adequately discharge their obligations with regard to licensing and monitoring.  It will provide a central source of environmental information and will carry out investigations and research on a national basis into the many aspects of pollution control.  The environmental research unit and the regional laboratories, such as Castlebar regional laboratory which is financed by Galway, Mayo and Sligo County Councils, have been subsumed into the Environmental Protection Agency and their staff are now employed by that agency.  The Environmental Protection Agency is a formidable organisation and, now that it has been properly structured, it is vital that it be properly funded.  It is responsible for one of the most important aspects of our daily lives &mdash; the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>Professor Convery, the new chairman of An Taisce, issued a statement at the weekend.  He said that he hopes to encourage a number of environmental themes in forthcoming months.  They include rewarding companies with antipollution policies and raising aesthetic standards in new housing estates.  This man is enthusiastic about the environment and he promises more than just concern for pollution and development. It is good to see a person of such calibre involved in this area.  I agree with the professor that one of our present problems is the fact that too many people are doing too many different jobs in this area. We spend a lot of money on environmental matters and I share the professor's worry that in five years' time not much will have been accomplished unless we act now.  There must be a clearer definition of our objectives.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for the introduction by the agency on a phased basis of a system of integrated pollution prevention and control licensing for certain <Col N="1660" /> activities and for adjustment to the planning Acts and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  Measures which are necessary to give continued effect to the environmental impact assessment directive are also provided for.  Separate regulations will shortly be made to provide for the payment of fees to the agency in respect of licences and reviews of licences.  It is important that these matters are dealt with in law.  Part 5 of the licensing regulations provides for processing of objections against decisions of the agency and licence applications or review.</P>
    <P>Although the agency will not be a party to a planning objection, local authorities may participate fully in the process.  It should be noted that article 36 of the licensing regulations empowers the agency to require an employee of the planning authority to attend an oral hearing and to produce any documents and other particulars in its custody or control. This is an important provision.</P>
    <P>Section 92 of the Act deals with another important area and might require tightening in the future.  Although this section does not require any action by local authorities, it is an important provision which should be carefully noted. In the case of an established activity where, to date, a licence is required, as specified, or where a revised licence is in force or is required, this section provides that the person in charge of an activity must notify the Environmental Protection Agency in writing if he intends to carry out any alteration or reconstruction which would materially change or increase emissions from the activity.  The agency will then decide to review the existing licence or, where there is no existing licence, it will require the person in charge to apply for one.  The co-operation of local authorities is vital to inform the people concerned about the requirements of section 92 whenever such opportunities arise during the day to day business of the Authority.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with an important aspect of our daily lives.  It is vital to have liaison and contact between the Environmental Protection Agency and the local <Col N="1661" /> authority at all times because this is fundamental to the success of our fight against pollution.  It is important for the Government to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authority are properly funded to carry out their duties in this important aspect of our lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the extension of powers to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, which this House passed in 1992.  This is a natural progression to the full implementation of this Act and it is necessary to introduce those provisions which the Minister was meant to implement at that time.  He is doing his duty by bringing the extension of those powers back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I welcome the revisions of the Bill.  I spoke extensively on the Bill when it passed through the House in 1992.  At that time, many fears were expressed about the Bill and its implementation and how it would interact with the other agencies in this country, which have dealt with the protection of the environment to date.  At that time, many Members of this House expressed concern about the possible overlap of responsibility, the duplication of activity and the waste of resources and manpower.  I hold the view, as I did then, that this Bill is necessary and that the powers therein and the extension of powers are necessary to protect our clean environment, which is the most valuable asset we have.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Environmental Protection Agency (Extension of Powers) Order, 1994, which implements sections of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and gives those powers to the Environmental Protection Agency.  I have no doubt there will be liaison with other authorities, particularly local authorities. In discussions with the General Council of County Councils and my own local authority, I found that a combined approach to the protection of our environment is the most acceptable one.  This is an important development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> There are now greater dangers to the environment than ever before.  For example, an all-Ireland fishing competition was supposed to be held on the River Lung in the north of my county last week.  However, it was cancelled because the river was polluted.  This has caused major problems in the town of Ballaghaderreen in the north-west of the county and it has also killed the opportunity to create employment, to commercialise tourism and to develop rural areas.  I do not know if the Minister is in a position to respond, but perhaps he could tell me if the Environmental Protection Agency is investigating the cause of the pollution, if they will report on the matter and if appropriate action will be taken.  I hope he will respond positively.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Environmental Protection Agency (Extension of Powers) Order, 1994, but I have one serious complaint. One of the largest commercial semi-State bodies in this country is Bord na MÛna.  However, my understanding is that these powers do not apply to Bord na MÛna.  The list of bodies which will come under the control of the agency for licensing purposes include the chemical industry, minerals, energy, food and drink, waste, wood, paper, textiles and leather.  Yet, one of the largest commercial semi-State bodies which extracts, harvests and processes peat does not come under the regulations.  It is not liable to apply for a licence.  This is a mistake because Bord na MÛna contributes to the pollution of our rivers as the dust from harvesting and milling peat finds its way into our streams, rivers and lakes.  This causes discoloration and people cannot bathe in them.</P>
    <P>Bord na MÛna may not kill the wildlife and fish in those rivers but it kills the wildlife in the bogs.  Has any Member heard the call of a grouse across the bogs of the west and midlands in the last ten years?  I have not, but some years ago I could do so by walking a couple of hundred yards into any bog.  However, that is no longer the case.  Many of our rivers and lakes, particularly the River Shannon and its tributary, the River Suck, are <Col N="1663" /> seriously polluted with silt as a result of harvesting by Bord na MÛna.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the development of our bogs and the employment opportunities it creates, I question why the Minister does not bring Bord na MÛna into a licensing system where proper controls, laid down by the agency, would have to be adhered to, instead of controls laid down by Bord na MÛna which allows it to establish silt ponds and to act as the only expert in this field.  I do not agree that Bord na MÛna should be its own police force.  The policing of Bord na MÛna operations should be given to the Environmental Protection Agency.  It would be in the best interest of the proper development of our bogs and the protection of our environment in the midlands if Bord na MÛna was responsible to the agency.  This would mean that wildlife in the rivers and lakes could be protected.</P>
    <P>All bogs should not be harvested, some sections should be left as a natural habitat for wildlife and for tourism purposes. Tourism is a vital industry and the extension of powers to the Environmental Protection Agency is part and parcel of the development, protection and enhancement of that industry.  The Minister should look again at that area to see if the special status which applies to Bord na MÛna is in the best interest of the nation and the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>As regards the chemical industry, we must be extremely vigilant because a small spill could destroy a river.  The chemical industry is developing in this country.  In the past, people worried about fires, etc., but now the protection of the environment is of vital importance. When discussing this I find people are not worried about what they can see but what they cannot see.  There may be a knock-on effect from emissions from one chemical factory combined with another. This agency and the Air Pollution Act should be vigilant in regard to this industry.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to the people. We need only look across the water at <Col N="1664" /> Sellafield-THORP, a monstrosity which may affect western Europe and the western world.  It is a time bomb endangering Ireland.  England and western Europe. While everyone is fearful of what may happen, we do not know what damage has been done to date to present and future generations.  The chemical industry is important to this country, we seem to attract it.  While the industry is welcome and contributes to the national coffers, to local development and provides employment opportunities, we have a responsibility to the people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of powers to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Minister moved swiftly and has brought an order extending the powers of the agency before the House within a short time of the Environmental Protection Agency Act being passed and has set down necessary precautions which will protect the environment for this and future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Senator for their contributions. It is clear that there is whole hearted support on all sides for the successful implementation of the functions of the agency.  There is a general agreement that there is a need to ensure the agency has the necessary powers to fully carry out its operations and tasks.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh referred to the funding of the agency.  As I said earlier, £4.4 million has been made available to the agency from the Department this year.  This will be complemented by approximately £0.6 million from local authorities for services provided by the agency.  We hope to see an annual income of £2 million from licensing fees, which were recently authorised.  Overall the agency will receive approximately £7 million to £8 million per annum for running costs.  We are confident that will be sufficient but, if further funds are required, they will be made available by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McDonagh also referred to An Taisce and the appointment of Professor Frank Convery as its chief.  I congratulate <Col N="1665" /> Professor Convery on his appointment and wish him well in the future.  I had many dealings with him and found him to be concerned and caring about the environment.  It is good that a person of that calibre is in such a high profile position.  The idea of rewarding companies for good environmental practices is one which should be recommended. I agree with Professor Convery in this regard.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with Forbairt, we have operated an environmental awards system for industry.  A recent winner went on to gain recognition in Europe and was highly commended and rewarded for its efforts in the environmental area.  Now that these awards exist and companies are participating in them, others will follow because it would be important and prestigious to receive such a reward.  In a reward system like that, there are no losers because everyone is striving to receive the ultimate award &mdash; all those who participate are winners.  It is important that companies participate in voluntary schemes such as ECO Audit and Environmental Management ISO 310 in the future.  I encourage as many companies as possible to seek to achieve high standards.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran referred to the River Lung.  The fish kill in that river occurred last Wednesday, it was reported last Thursday and we immediately asked the Environmental Protection Agency to become involved.  Since then it has been fully involved and has carried out full investigations.  I understand those investigations are complete and the agency will make a full report early next week. We expect the agency will publish its report, make it available to all concerned and make recommendations on what action should be taken.  As an independent body, it is important that this agency carries out its functions in an independent manner and makes the necessary recommendations.  We will keep Senators informed.</P>
    <P>It is of concern that such a large fish kill should occur.  As Senator Finneran pointed out, that river is important to the economy of the locality and the region. <Col N="1666" /> However, there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of fish kills in the past three or four years and this is only right.  I call on industry, the farming community and the community at large to ensure this serious reduction in fish kills continues.  One should be concerned about what happened in the River Lung. It is important at this time of the year when water levels are low that communities are vigilant in ensuring that such pollution problems do not arise.</P>
    <P>The farming community and industry have acted in a responsible manner over the past four or five years when dealing with pollution control, silage control and other possible pollution problems.  Farming organisations continually call on farmers to be extremely careful in examining causes of pollution.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran also raised the issue of Bord na MÛna being excluded from the schedule of activity licensing by the agency.  The extraction of peat where the area exceeds 50 hectares is a licensable activity and the production of energy in a combustion plant exceeding 50 megawatts is licensable.  Bord na MÛna should be involved in any power plant because that is also licensable.</P>
    <P>I take on board the issues raised by Senator Finneran in relation to possible causes of pollution by the ESB, by the removal of peat and the problems of wildlife. We will have discussions with Bord na MÛna to see what problems may arise or how we can deal with such problems for the future.  Generally Bord na MÛna is regarded as a very responsible company in carrying out its functions.  We will make the concerns of Senators known to Bord na MÛna and see what extra care they can take in that whole area, particularly in the issues that have been raised.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and welcome the new powers being extended to the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is good that in extending the powers of this agency we have to come to both Houses of the Oireachtas and have a discussion on them.  The Department of the Environment does not have a monopoly on the protection of the <Col N="1667" /> environment; neither does the Environmental Protection Agency.  All the different sections of the community will have to become involved if we are to really enhance and protect the environment. The fact that the Minister has to come back to the Oireachtas gives us the opportunity to look at the progress the Environmental Protection Agency is making and to have an exchange of views that can only be beneficial to the country generally as we go about our business protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>We all want to see the Environmental Protection Agency as the real protector of the environment.  It is set up as an independent body with a role to play in ensuring that our environment is protected. There is no doubt that as the agency becomes more involved in that area we will see it carrying out the duties the Oireachtas expected of it when it was set up originally.</P>
    <P>I thank all Members for their contributions. As we extend the powers further in the future I am sure I will be back here to discuss it further.</P>

    <Title>Irish Horseracing Industry Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be in the Seanad for the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill, 1994, which is important and, indeed, critical to the industry of horse breeding and racing.  The time and effort put into this Bill by the Government and I and all the constituent parts of the industry is indicative of its importance. It is also indicative of the level of commitment to Irish racing and a recognition of the success and potential of the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1668" /> We have only to look at other sports to see that when, as a nation, we become committed to something and work together supporting it we can overcome obstacles and compete with the best on the world stage.  On that note I would like to express my congratulations on the performance of the Irish team, the management and the fans.</P>
    <P>It is the international reputation we have always had for our thoroughbred horse breeding and racing that gives me the confidence to predict a bright future for this industry.  However, our international reputation, no matter how good, will quickly fade if we do not work continuously at maintaining it.  That means continuing to produce a good quality racing horse and maintaining a well organised, strong racing industry.</P>
    <P>The home industry will provide training and experience for the horses, entertainment of the highest quality for the Irish public and the tourist, betting opportunities for the punter and employment for about 25,000 people.  It helps a lot in maintaining a lively interest in a sport which contributes substantially to Exchequer revenues from taxes on off-course betting and provides a shop window for our exports of Irish thoroughbreds which are valued at about £50 million annually.</P>
    <P>We have a long and well established tradition in breeding thoroughbred horses for racing or export and they contribute substantially to the economy all over the country as there are a number of small breeders scattered throughout the country.  We can also be proud of the organisation and structure of our racing industry which are already at a level of development which surpass many of our counterparts abroad.</P>
    <P>Latest figures for output of the horse industry indicate an annual value of over £60 million.  In 1993, for example, there were over 226 race fixtures held at 26 racecourses which were attended by over one million people.  Total betting turnover at these fixtures exceeded £89 million yielding between £3 million and £4 million in revenue to the industry.  Off-course betting turnover reached £350 <Col N="1669" /> million which brought in revenue to the Exchequer of £35 million.  These are substantial figures but they can be substantially improved.  I anticipate that under the provisions of this Bill facilities will be put in place to increase the turnover in betting on-course and off-course and improve the entertainment value of the new facilities.</P>
    <P>In New South Wales in Australia, for example, which has a population of 6 million &mdash; which is not that much greater than that of the island of Ireland &mdash; the total betting by bookies is over £1 billion annually.  One can imagine if we could scale up our betting and our facilities the amount of money that would be available for reinvestment for the development of the industry and the additional moneys for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that despite its relative strength this industry has not escaped the recession which has hit the sector worldwide in recent years.  The position of the race horse owner has become particularly critical.  The costs associated with keeping a horse in training have increased more rapidly than prize money. This in turn has caused problems for some trainers who are finding it increasingly difficult to retain their patrons or to find new ones.</P>
    <P>On-course betting turnover, which generates the main source of income for the Racing Board, has been in decline in recent years.  Bookmaker on-course betting turnover fell from £104 million in 1990 to just over £70 million last year with a resultant decline in levy income from £5.2 million to £3.5 million over that period.  As a consequence, the level of funds available to the industry as a whole has been contracting and there have been insufficient moneys available for development of racecourse facilities. This is most unfortunate at a time when horse racing has to compete with an ever growing list of leisure activities.  Despite these difficulties the industry remains important and recent international trends suggest that the time is ripe to embark on a new development stage in this industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1670" /> Unless the facilities available at racecourses are continually improved there is a danger that the industry could get caught in a downward spiral of falling attendances, lower levels of betting and consequent reductions in income accruing to the racing industry with falling levels of prize money and little or no money available for capital development.</P>
    <P>The situation would have been much worse but for the action taken by the Government to introduce a grant-in-aid for the Racing Board in 1989 and since then £13 million has been put into the industry by the taxpayers.  Of this figure £7.5 million was used to supplement prize money at the lower levels and about £4 million to develop racecourse facilities. The balance was allocated to promotion and advertising of the sport, marketing of horses and the provision of infra-structural services.  With regard to the marketing and promotion of horses I want to pay tribute to the Irish thoroughbred marketing group which has done a brilliant job in its area of activity.</P>
    <P>These measures have brought about a significant degree of improvement.  I think most people in the industry would agree that with an improved organisational structure and greater resources the horseracing industry has considerable potential for growth leading to increased income for the economy generally and, in particular, to additional employment in the sector.  The racing industry is a labour intensive one and expansion is directly reflected in higher employment. A figure of 25,000 earning a livelihood from a sector of the industry in Ireland is important.</P>
    <P>Apart from the worldwide recession which the industry has experienced in recent years, the problems of the industry in Ireland can be traced to a shortage of funds and the lack of a coherent approach to its development.  Having two separate bodies was not of any help.  I do not want to be critical of the governing bodies &mdash; the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee &mdash; which have done valuable work in administering Irish racing for over two centuries.  Their guardianship of the rules of racing and <Col N="1671" /> of its integrity is recognised domestically and internationally as being first class.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment in 1945 the Racing Board for its part has performed an excellent role in the financing and development of the industry within the terms of its remit.  All of those who accepted appointment to the Racing Board and the members of the governing bodies served in a voluntary capacity and all are entitled to our thanks for their valuable contributions.</P>
    <P>None of that takes from the fact that, in the present circumstances, the absence of a single body to provide the focus for direction and funding is a serious impediment to its development.  That is why we are now proposing in this legislation the establishment of a new horseracing authority to provide that focus for the future. The new Bill, as well as proposing a new organisational structure, will provide a comprehensive legislative framework for the industry.  We are providing in this legislation for the development of the industry well into the next century.</P>
    <P>Our guiding principle and our only motivation in all of this is to put in place arrangements and legislation that will enable the industry to realise its full potential.  I am glad to be able to point out that it was the industry itself that recognised the difficulties it was facing and it was its decision to do something about it that eventually lead to my proposals for the restructuring of the industry which I announced in October 1992; I am referring to the joint working group set up by the Racing Board and the governing bodies in 1991 under the chairmanship of Dr. Paddy Moriarty.  That group examined the key areas in the industry which most needed to be addressed. A large degree of consensus was reached at that time on what needed to be done.</P>
    <P>I subsequently established another committee with wider industry representation which was chaired by Michael Dowling, Secretary of my Department. The valuable work done by the Moriarity Committee formed a basis for the work of the Dowling Committee.  This committee <Col N="1672" /> reached agreement on the outline of a draft Bill to establish the new structure. Some changes to that agreement became necessary in the course of the formal drafting process to conform with legal requirements and to ensure that the precise meaning of all its provisions could be clearly understood.  During this process, and indeed after the Bill was published, I continued to receive further representations from various interests in the industry on various aspects.  I accepted some of the points made and put forward some amendments on Committee Stage in the D·il to accommodate those concerns, which I felt were legitimate.  On Report Stage, I also accepted the broad thrust of some amendments which were put forward by Opposition Deputies on Committee Stage.  The result of this is the Bill now before the House.  It is now in a form which is generally acceptable to the industry and its various provisions represent a good balance for the overall industry.</P>
    <P>I was anxious from the outset that the Authority should be a representative one covering all the main sectors in the industry. I recently announced that the Government had decided on the 16 people to be invited to act as members of the new Authority.  I have asked those selected to act in an interim capacity, pending the finalisation of this legislation and the making of an order formally establishing the new Authority.  I felt that this was desirable so that preliminary arrangements on structures, staffing and other matters could be put in place as soon as possible.  It is essential that this job be done carefully and well and that the time and energies of the new Authority be devoted almost exclusively to it for the immediate future.  I will, therefore, after the enactment of this Bill, postpone for some time the signing of the commencement order of the Authority to give it the opportunity to complete this work.  In the meantime the Racing Board will continue with the necessary day-to-day business of the industry.</P>
    <P>The question of the membership of the new Authority was repeatedly raised in the D·il.  We need the number proposed <Col N="1673" /> to create sufficient balance on the Authority. What is important first is the quality of the membership.  We have put in place a high quality Authority well capable of giving a strong lead to the industry.  The second important element is how the Authority works.  It is critical that members see themselves not primarily as sectoral representatives, but as a board of directors for the industry.  They must work cohesively to promote and develop the industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>This is a major national task and I am confident the Authority we have put in place is capable of undertaking it.  We intend to let it get on with the job without interference.  It represents the industry and it will be its responsibility to work out and implement what is best for its overall development.  We will, of course, give all the assistance necessary to ensure that it can work effectively.</P>
    <P>The new Authority has an important role to play in ensuring the Irish horseracing industry is developed to its full potential and that it will lead to the further development of the industry, which will continue to enhance our international reputation of having a high standard and ensure our horseracing and breeding industry is in the first division of that industry worldwide.  Having got broad consensus on how we should develop this legislation to secure the future of the industry and appointed a broadly representative board, it is essential that sectoral, petty and narrow interests be put aside and that the new Authority will work in a coherent way to serve the industry well and in the best interests of those working in it.  I should say at this point that I was conscious in proposing the new structure of the necessity of preserving the strengths of the present regime.  In particular, I was careful to provide for the independence of the governing bodies as the institution responsible for the rules of racing and the integrity services.  It is also important to ensure the efficient administration provided by the registry office would continue to be available to the industry.</P>
    <P>The governing bodies have, as the Members know, successfully administered <Col N="1674" /> Irish racing for over 200 years. Without their contribution racing could not have developed.  The two bodies have carried out their functions professionally and have regulated racing with impartiality. They have also invested their own funds, which they earned outside their formal role in the sector, back into the industry for the benefit of all when such investment was badly needed.  Irish racing certainly would not have flourished but for the major contributions of the governing bodies over the last two centuries.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I propose to give legislative backing to those functions of the bodies which all sections of the industry agree they should continue to perform.  Section 39 of the Bill, for example, provides for their continued regulation of horse racing, the making and enforcement of the rules of racing and the provision of the integrity services. They have, of course, also been given formal and substantive recognition by being given the right to nominate three stewards directly onto the Authority.  A fourth member will be representative of National Hunt interests and will be appointed on the nomination of the racing regulatory body.  The Turf Club and National Hunt steeplechase committee will be the new racing regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions in Part 3 of the Bill giving the racing regulatory body the statutory right to make charges for its services and guaranteeing to it the costs of its integrity services.  I am satisfied the position of the governing bodies is given fair treatment in this Bill and is in fact being strengthened by the new legislation.  They have a major role to play in the new structure.  Therefore, it is correct they should get statutory recognition. I would like to make it clear that any activities of the racing regulatory body or of its constituent bodies other than those outlined in the Bill are not affected by this legislation.</P>
    <P>A major issue for the industry is its financing.  Apart from the need for a new Authority to rationalise the way in which the industry was organised, it has suffered <Col N="1675" /> badly in modern times from a lack of adequate financial resources.  As I have already mentioned, the Government has provided over £13 million to the industry through the Racing Board over the past four years in recognition of this shortage of funds.  I have repeatedly stressed the Government's long term commitment on this question.</P>
    <P>I now want to place this matter in a broader context.  When formally established, the new Authority will, of course, have to set about devising strategies for the development and promotion of the industry on a multiannual basis.  This will involve virtually all the Authority's functions. It also requires a substantial degree of financial certainty.  To facilitate the Authority in this regard, I can confirm that it may plan for the future on the basis that the Exchequer contribution will be maintained at current levels.  I must emphasise that the contribution is considerable; this year it stands at £6.6 million. I also put £1 million into the old Racing Board and gave a substantial contribution to the Irish thoroughbred marketing organisation.  With regard to horseracing in other jurisdictions, this compares favourably with the contribution made by our taxpayers, is reasonable and adequately recognises the importance and potential of the industry.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, essential that the industry itself strengthens its financial base by increasing its revenue from other sources.  There is no point in squeezing the taxpayer for additional money if the industry itself does nothing.  An additional effort will have to be made to raise money for reinvestment if the industry is not producing the goods and earning adequate revenue.</P>
    <P>The Authority's promotional role is relevant in this regard.  It must look at how revenue from other sources can be tapped, especially through the development of new sources of betting revenue. An efficient tote system, for example, is required.  It will generate real revenue for reinvestment in the industry.  I have already given an example of one racing area in New South Wales and there are <Col N="1676" /> many others.  Some will say these areas have much larger populations, but a greater effort will have to be made.  I expect the new Authority to make a greater effort to substantially raise its own revenue.  If extending tote operations to off-course locations would be of help, we are prepared to facilitate this through an appropriate adjustment of the licence.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must emphasise that the new Authority, which is a commercial State company, is principally a promotional and development body rather than a trading one.  In recognition of the fact that any surplus it makes will be reinvested to promote and develop the industry, the Government is prepared to consider conferring tax exemption status on the Authority in the new Finance Act.  This gives an incentive.  Rather than having some of this money raised being siphoned off by the Revenue Commissioners, it will be available for reinvestment in the industry. It is a sufficient incentive for the new Authority to proceed to rationalise its activities at an early date and seek new sources of income.</P>
    <P>The new legislation opens up opportunities to increase the overall level of betting turnover and levy revenue which were not available under the old Racing Board regime.  I hope these opportunities will be grasped by the Authority in a way that will see revenue from this source greatly increased to the benefit of the industry as a whole.  In this regard I refer the House to section 54 of the Bill, which allows the Authority to apply a levy on all bets placed at a racecourse on horse races or any other events taking place elsewhere.  Heretofore these were regarded as off-course bets and were liable to the 10 per cent off-course betting tax.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1994 includes provision under section 89 to remove the 10 per cent tax on such bets.  In the Bill before the House the Authority is required to apply a rate of levy on those bets equivalent to the rate of tax applying to similar bets placed on the high street, which at present is 10 per cent.  The result will be that the revenue from levies on <Col N="1677" /> all bets placed at racecourses will go to the Authority for the benefit of the horse racing industry.  While the amount of betting at racecourses on off-course events is estimated to be quite small at present, under the new legislation there will be an incentive for the new Authority to develop this source of revenue and at the same time to encourage increased attendances at race meetings.</P>
    <P>Another new source of revenue for the industry is provided for in section 12 of the Bill, which empowers the Authority to make charges in respect of the carrying out of any of its functions or the provision of any of its services.  Under section 43 the Authority may require the racing regulatory body to collect fees, levies or charges on behalf of the Authority.  This is a new and flexible possible source of funding.  Charges could be set, amended or removed without the need to put elaborate arrangements in place.  It would in particular allow the Authority a greater flexibility in ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of the burden of the industry's costs.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a range of new controls in key areas.  Section 26 provides that the Authority must approve the amount and form of prize money offered in respect of all races.  This is not unreasonable, given that the Authority will be making a significant contribution to the prize money fund and will be, in effect, the guarantor of that fund.</P>
    <P>The allocation of fixtures and the setting of programmes are functions which were heretofore performed by the governing bodies but which are now being assigned to the Authority.  The Authority will have the principle role in regard to the development of Irish racing, especially in regard to its current funding. Fixtures are central to all of this and it is therefore logical that the fixtures committee be appointed by the Authority.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the fixtures list is, of course, a sensitive issue and it is important that there is careful balance in the composition of the committee charged with deciding on the fixtures.  We have provided for that balance in the legislation.  The programme committee is <Col N="1678" /> also, of course, important and requires the participation of quite a number of people with specialist knowledge and expertise.  It is sensible that it be left to the Authority to call on such expertise as is required without constraining its options in this regard through tight legislative provisions.  Regarding race programmes therefore, section 20 provides that the Authority establish that committee after consultation with the regulatory body.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the work of the Authority in this and in many other areas covers the industry in the whole of the island.  It is also important that the potential of the industry in the whole island is developed to the full.  I will be formally asking the Authority to have special regard in all of its activities to the development of the industry in Northern Ireland.  I will be especially asking it to ensure that such development is catered for in the terms of reference of the fixtures committee and the remit of the programmes committee.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Bill proposes to control starting price returns.  All who are familiar with the racing scene will appreciate the need to ensure that there is only one starting price determined and published for each horse in any race. These starting prices are used by off-course bookmakers in setting the odds at which bets are paid.  For this reason we must ensure that the integrity of the starting prices is maintained and section 33, as currently drafted, provides adequately for this.  It is not intended to interfere with arrangements whereby racecourses benefit from the revenue generated by starting price contracts, but simply to ensure that this essential element in the running of racing is adequately controlled and is independent from sectional interests.</P>
    <P>Section 53 deals with the regulation by the Authority of bookmakers on racecourses. The lifeblood of racing is the betting that takes place.  In order to make racing attractive we must have quality racing at venues with good ancillary services and betting facilities.  For example, I saw a new development at the Curragh <Col N="1679" /> racecourse over the weekend where a first class screen was installed across from the finishing line, courtesy of one of our electrical companies.  The screen was of a very high quality and was one of the best I have seen at any track internationally.  It would be nice for the ordinary punter, who cannot get into the boxes or the main stands, if they could see all of the race from the ground, with good quality facilities such as those introduced at the Curragh. This is only one example and I would like to see more facilities of this kind in many of the tracks around the country.</P>
    <P>One of the initiatives which is provided for under section 53 is the possible introduction of betting offices at racecourses. I realise that there are those who strongly believe that this would not be a positive move.  For anybody who knows anything about racing, one of these offices was installed at Leopardstown racecourse for some time and was discontinued.  I believe that this was a mistake and a disappointment to many people who attend race meetings at Leopardstown.  I would like to see that, not alone is it reinstated, but that a similar facility be provided at other race tracks throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the full range of betting services could be provided by an extension or development of the current system of on-course bookmaking at pitches. It may prove to be the case that in the long term a combination of pitches and betting offices would be the best method of providing the service which the punter wants.  In the final analysis this is something which will have to be decided by the Authority.  This Bill allows the greatest possible flexibility in that regard.  However, in making regulations under this section, the Authority may take into account agreements reached between the racecourses and bookmakers. In that context I will be asking the Authority to decide on this issue at an early date.</P>
    <P>In future, racecourses will be authorised by the Authority.  Previously the Racing Board had no legal function in <Col N="1680" /> this regard.  The new Authority must be in a position to ensure that all racecourses have appropriate facilities for all those involved in horse racing and are capable of providing a quality level of service to the racegoer.  For example, I attended a race meeting at one the country's tracks over the Christmas period.  Naturally, the weather was most inclement and very cold.  My family was with me and we searched for some place to have a cup of coffee.  We finally found a place, but it had no heating.  Eventually a SuperSer heater was provided, but unfortunately it did not contain a gas cylinder, resulting in a chilly experience by all when taking the coffee and a great deal of criticism, especially from the younger members of my family.</P>
    <P>This example illustrates the lack of facilities, and the lack of appreciation that there are other entertainments available on Saint Stephen's Day, a weekend or whatever.  Unless those in charge of racing and race tracks provide suitable accommodation and appropriate facilities, younger people especially, and those additional people apart from the hard core racing people, will not be attracted to the racecourse.</P>
    <P>The provision of section 59 will satisfy this need, and also the requirement that all racecourse authorisations have to be reviewed every five years.  I hope this will ensure the maintenance of high standards on an ongoing basis so that if management of racecourses become lax they will be subject to review every five years and kept up to date.</P>
    <P>Section 61 of the Bill deals with broadcasting and filming rights.  It allows the Authority some say in the transmission or relaying of any broadcast of any race fixture.  This is necessary in order to ensure that such broadcasting is always done in a way which is in the best interests of the industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to two or three other provisions in the Bill which, in due course, could prove to be significant.  Section 35 would allow a subsidiary of the Authority to apply for a bookmaker's licence.  Under section 36, however, it would need the consent of <Col N="1681" /> the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Finance before it could establish such a subsidiary.</P>
    <P>The operation of bookmaker offices by a subsidiary of the Authority could prove to be the vehicle by which a new range of betting services could be introduced. It could also be a revenue booster for the Authority.  However, the relevant provisions in the Bill are enabling ones and the whole area would require some detailed research and analysis before any Ministerial consent, as provided for, could be given.  I would also draw attention to the fact that joint ventures between subsidiaries of the Authority and other companies are provided for in section 36.  This could lead to some beneficial partnerships between State and industry.</P>
    <P>Part 9 of the Bill deals with the amendment of the Licensing Acts.  The area of liquor licences for racecourses has been restrictive up to now.  Sunday racing has added to these problems as occasional licences are not allowed for Sundays.  The changes proposed here for horseracing are similar to those that have applied to greyhound racing since 1962.  If it is to retain its customer support, racing must be in a position to provide a comprehensive entertainment and leisure service.</P>
    <P>Standard provisions for State boards in relation to a code of ethics for the Authority and its staff and for ministerial control on pay, superannuation and borrowing are included in Part 2 of the Bill. The dissolution of the Racing Board and the transfer of all its assets, liabilities and staff are provided for in part 10.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute once again to the Racing Board, the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt steeplechase committee for the magnificent contributions they have made to Irish racing down the years.  I would particularly like to thank all those involved in the various committees and working groups that helped us to bring forward this Bill.  I feel we are about to turn a corner and to witness the start of the next major phase <Col N="1682" /> in the development of the horseracing industry.  I refer in particular to the Moriarty working party, the Dowling committee and the Brosnan interim committee which worked on the financing and structures of the industry for a few months earlier this year, preparing the ground for the Authority.  All of the material prepared by the latter committee will now be examined by the recently appointed Authority acting in an interim capacity.</P>
    <P>Inevitably there were on occasions different perspectives within the various groups, but they all worked conscientiously to overcome these and in the end the whole process concluded with broad consensus.  This work was invaluable and I would wish to place on record our thanks to the chairman, Dr. Paddy Moriarty, Michael Dowling and Denis Brosnan and all the members of the groups for their unstinted efforts in sign-posting the way forward.</P>
    <P>To reiterate briefly, in this Bill we are establishing an overall Authority to manage, promote and develop Irish racing; we are putting in place an updated and comprehensive legal framework for the industry; and we are giving legal recognition to the work of the governing bodies in regard to the rules and integrity of racing.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on getting the Bill to this stage.  For many years people have sought this legislation and advised on its possible contents.  Like the Minister and others in the House, I have more than a passing interest in horseracing.  I know the Cathaoirleach is also interested in horses and other four-legged friends as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill comes before the House after long deliberation and many reports. While there are reservations in relation to some aspects of it, there are conflicting viewpoints which must be taken on board concerning such a widely based industry. Hopefully we are getting the balance right as regards where we are going and what we are going to do.  The racing <Col N="1683" /> industry is a broadly based one, employing between 25,000 and 30,000 people with many others receiving spin-offs from it.  People talk about Jack's Army bringing credit to the country, but the racing industry has for many years brought tremendous credit and publicity to the country.  We have only to think of the famous exploits of Irish horses, trainers and jockeys at Cheltenham and Epsom.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister had to go ahead and announce the interim Authority, even though it is unusual to do so prior to legislation being passed.  By and large, whether the Minister had announced the interim Authority before or after listening to me, many of its members would still be there.  I have some reservations, however, about whether the jockeys themselves should have been represented.  There have been complaints about having too unwieldly a board and some ends of it seem to be, if not over represented, then adequately represented.  With regard to the geographical spread, we might say that the Minister's colleague, Deputy McCreevy, has not done badly with about seven members of the board.  The fact that some may be members of certain comhairle ceantar is probably only coincidental. Some of them are very good people and no matter who was picking them &mdash; even Jack himself &mdash; they would merit a place on the team.</P>
    <P>One appointment which has caused difficulties and concern relates to the representative from Northern Ireland.  It is my understanding that the five areas there met and unanimously selected Jim Nicholson, who manages one of the tracks in the North.  Yet, another name was dragged out of the hat which many people with an interest in the sport had not heard of before.  I have nothing against the appointee, but the appointment has queered the pitch and perhaps soured certain relations.  I noticed a nice picture of the Minister with Mr. Nicholson, in happier times, in <i>The Irish Field</i> of Saturday, 25 June 1994.  I hope the fact that he was omitted is no reflection on Jim Nicholson's position.  As the sole weekly <Col N="1684" /> racing paper in the country, <i>The Irish Field</i> gave a lot of prominence to various viewpoints relating to the whole question. To be fair to Mr. Nicholson and to others, perhaps when the Minister is replying he could at least address that point.  Obviously, the Minister was trying to get the balance right in every sense. However, I notice in today's paper that one of the prominent commentators, Mr. Kidd, refers to the fact that if various organisations make a nomination their choice should have been accepted.</P>
    <P>Many members of the new Authority represent various areas and interests and have done a lot of good work.  When this Authority is judged in five or ten years' time, the proof of the pudding will be in what it has achieved.  That is what all of us with an interest in the improvement and development of racing want to see.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Racing Club of Ireland's nominee was put up by the Racing Club, if a choice was made or if a list of names was put forward.  It may not have been possible for the chairman, Kevin Smith, who has done a good job, or Ian Scott and others to act on the Authority, but at times one questions how some of these appointments were made.  If the people on the Authority get together and work together it will be worthwhile.  It is important to bury old differences of opinion and private feuds, of which the Minister is only too well aware.  If that happens then racing will be the winner.</P>
    <P>One can say many things about how racing should be developed.  It is a consumer based sport, there is a lot of money involved and it is important that we continue to attract good attendances at race meetings.</P>
    <P>There are various types of race meetings, those where pattern, group or classic races are held and festival meetings. Various other meetings have developed successfully, such as Kilbeggan, Roscommon and Wexford which have been greatly revived in recent times.  This has been mainly due to supporters' clubs securing local sponsorship.  I am sure the Minister would be the first to accept that much of what they have achieved has <Col N="1685" /> been without the help of the Minister or the board.  People saw a need, they saw benefit to a town and they got on with it.</P>
    <P>In the context of trying to achieve the correct balance, I said initially that I hoped we were not simply paying lip service to the northern aspects of this matter.  For many years, a strong northern racing contingent has existed.  Many from the south attend race meetings in the North for paltry prize money.  We hope and expect that people from the north will come to festival meetings in Galway, Listowel, Tralee, Killarney, etc. It is important that improvements are realised.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the financial and betting aspects of the industry and the operation of the tote are examined and revamped.  In England, on the track one can have a tote bet on a meeting at another venue but this is not possible in Ireland.  We introduced an expensive tote system but we are not getting the best from it.  The Minister will probably accept this point.  In Ireland, it is rare that two or three meetings are held on the same day.  This only happens on a certain number of days in the year, for example, when the Downroyal or Downpatrick meetings are held.  Does the Minister have proposals in relation to this point? Will it be possible under this Bill for the tote to operate in the North also?  There may be problems in terms of logistics in that regard but if we are discussing an expanded operation, everything should be considered.</P>
    <P>Attendances at meetings and how owners are doing in terms of their returns are further elements which must be examined.  Good handicap £5,000 races in Galway attract 24 or 25 runners.  Yet, as the Cathaoirleach is aware, at the Curragh last Sunday there was a total of seven runners in two group races &mdash; four horses in one, of which there were no Irish horses, and three in the other.  That is not what the public want.  If the Derby had not been on last Sunday, many people would not have attended the meeting.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned how television can promote racing but also act <Col N="1686" /> as a distraction or opponent to it.  On Saturdays, if the card is not good in a certain area, there might be five or six races on Channel 4, a few on the BBC and others, given the introduction of racing on Sky Television.  If this Authority does not get its act together, we will lose many people from meetings. We must examine how to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>There have also been changes in the area of horse ownership.  There are fewer wealthy individual owners, aside from the Arabs and the Aga Khan.  The future lies in syndicates.  For a relatively small outlay, a small group of people can gain quite an amount of enjoyment.  However, they must get or have the possibility of getting a return on their investment. There have been various syndicates made up of groups from a pub or members of a football club.  Some good syndicates have come together and, with a relatively small amount of money, have been very lucky.  They have provided encouragement for others to become involved in horse ownership because, by and large, single people in the middle income bracket could not afford to own horses.</P>
    <P>The question of how a racing authority looks at fixtures, how it plans and tries to raise the overall standard in terms of runners, decent fields and adequate prize money is important.  This must be examined because not every race is the Budweiser Derby.  It is important to attract people and to ensure a certain return.  We must also encourage breeding, especially those people who have a single mare in a field at home, and tell them how they can play their part.</P>
    <P>Much work has been done since the Racing Board was established in 1945. However, 50 years have passed and it is possible that more changes should have been introduced sooner in that time.  The Turf Club and the Racing Board have guided the racing industry for the past 200 years and although they are not faultless, in the main the sport has done very well but there is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>Another matter which must be examined is the improvement of some race courses.  The Minister said recently that <Col N="1687" /> matters were proceeding in relation to the Mallow track.  I have no doubt that it is quite close to the Minister's heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the position in Mallow?  Some of the talk about the possibility of developing a new race course is draft.  We should try to maintain and improve existing courses.  Are matters proceeding satisfactorily in relation to Mallow?</P>
      <P>There is obvious concern about sections of the Bill where the Authority has the power to remove some of the tracks.  While there may be question marks over some tracks at present, I hope they would be given a chance to improve and that they will also be given much needed funds.  Some tracks could learn from other tracks when it comes to carrying out improvements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the operation of the Authority, I hope various people on the board will not just be yes men or women when it comes to making decisions.  Ultimately, it is important that racing is the winner and that people on the board work to the benefit of the industry without trying to prove a point against others with whom they may have disagreed in the past.  I ask the Minister when replying or on Committee Stage to deal with the question of the executives, particularly with regard to administration, the tote, courses, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the betting chains and those who operate on the tracks, the extension of the tote, etc., must also be addressed.  Are vested interests preventing the introduction of things consumers want?  The Minister mentioned the betting shop at Leopardstown racetrack.  It was already fairly streamlined; one could not bet on Irish racing and it closed down. Like me, the Minister was a visitor to Leopardstown.  People there had a choice; there were three meetings on SIS; <Col N="1688" /> one could even bet on the dogs running at Harringay.  At times people did not want what was happening on the Leopardstown track.  They were not interested in races with five horses and a five to two favourite; they wanted a choice.  One was lucky to get such people there.  They would have preferred to stay at home or to go to their local betting shops.  To attract customers we must give them what they want.  Racing is competing with all sorts of other sports which provide corporate facilities where people can have meals and drinks.  People do not want to go to places with superser heaters and where the sandwiches were made last year.  Such places may be the exception. However, the Minister has been in some of them himself and standards must be improved.  Consumers pay at turnstiles for themselves and perhaps their spouses and families.</P>
    <P>We must also look at how these tracks are operated.  A track may need to be cared for 52 weeks of the year even if it holds only a few meetings.  There is also the question of whether some other use can be made of tracks on days on which meetings are not held.  This does not necessarily apply to all tracks but some tracks are only used on about 25 days and are like monuments for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I am sure we will discuss other matters relating to racing. Most of us support the thrust of the Bill. We want to see a good promotion of the racing industry.  We must cater for the wishes of consumers.  They are becoming more discerning and are in a more competitive business.  I have reservations about some sections but I hope that in the Bill we have got the balance right.  I have reservations about some aspects of the Authority, in particular the Northern Ireland appointment.  I intend no disrespect to the nominee from there, but it seems a little peculiar that when various regions met to decide on the appointment, this nominee was not acceptable. I hope there was not undue political consideration involved in the appointment.</P>
    <P>Some matters must be looked at by the Authority when it meets to discuss racing <Col N="1689" /> fixtures and planning.  Listowel racecourse recently applied to hold a two day meeting over the May bank holiday weekend.  A similar application from Limerick was accepted, but a success story like Listowel should be on the agenda for another bank holiday weekend. It would probably have to be a two day meeting, given the time it would take to travel there.  It takes some of us a long time to return from such festival meetings.  We must look at some of these meetings.  It may be difficult to hold meetings such as that held at Bellewstown at other times of the year.  We must make the best use of tracks for the industry. We have seen the success of Sunday meetings.  Many people want to go to meetings on Sundays as they may have other things to do on Saturdays.  In Wolverhampton there is floodlit racing.  This may not happen here for some time, but work and leisure patterns have changed and the Minister may be the person to turn on the floodlights somewhere for racing.</P>
    <P>We support much of the thrust behind the Bill.  However, we will table amendments on Committee Stage and will have more questions to which we will require answers.  Those of us who have more than a passing interest in the trade want the Bill to be successful.  We have seen the great benefits which have come about. Irish thoroughbred horses are revered and well known.  The successes we have seen in recent years &mdash; for example in Cheltenham &mdash; have partly come about because of the extra prize money being offered.  Horses such as Mary Gale and Vintage Crop are being kept here and I hope we will see further exploits.  We have seen vintage performances by Michael Kinane in Ascot and he has been a great ambassador for the country so many times.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that some of the money placed on bets will be given to tracks or to the Authority to put back into tracks.  In some tracks facilities are totally <i>cordon bleu</i> but in others there is room for improvements, for which money should be provided.  We will oppose the Bill on Second Stage and will <Col N="1690" /> be raising other matters on Committee Stage.  I trust the Minister will accept my points, which I hope were constructive, and that he will respond to them in time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which is very important for the Irish horseracing industry.  I compliment him on introducing it and know he has a keen interest in racing. Because of this interest I know he will ensure that any legislation he introduces will be for the improvement of this vital industry.  This Bill will provide a comprehensive legislative framework for the industry.  It will provide for the development of the industry well into the next century.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a well established tradition in breeding thoroughbred horses for racing and export.  Over the years we have seen the establishment of large studs which boost the morale of horsebreeding. However, it must be emphasised that the breeding of thoroughbreds has been and will continue to be a farm based activity, where farmers keep two or three brood mares in a mixed enterprise system.  I was delighted when a cousin of mine who has a few mares produced the winner of the English Grand National one year, which was great for the locality.  I am sure that there are many other such breeders with mixed farming enterprises who have bred good horses.  More than 7,000 thoroughbred foals are born annually.  Ireland has achieved an international reputation for producing quality horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this very important legislation which deals with an indigenous industry.  It is a wonderful tradition with great potential which is still not being realised.  However, I am sure that this <Col N="1691" /> legislation will help to achieve the full potential of the industry.  Our horses are the best in the world, which is a tribute to those involved in the industry over the years, including breeders, trainers and jockeys.  As was mentioned, the industry employs 25,000 to 30,000 people.  If a body or a board announced the creation of 25,000 jobs, it would be warmly welcomed. When an industry is going well there is a boom in employment and there is also spin off employment.</P>
    <P>Of the 7,000 horses which are born annually, approximately 4,700 appear on our race courses.  Of these, only 1,200 win races.  There are 1,800 races during the year involving £12 million in prize money, giving an average prize money of just below £7,000.  In Britain there are approximately 11,000 race horses in training which are involved in about 7,160 races.  The prize money is slightly in excess of £51 million, which again averages at a little over £7,000 per race. Therefore, there is a little or no difference between prize money here and in Britain, but we have a greater number of horses competing in races.  I suppose that we have too many horses.  We have 300 trainers whereas in Britain there are approximately 550 trainers.  It is nothing short of a miracle that we have so many.  I do not know how some survive.  It appears that they are all willing to take a chance and are prepared to battle on.  I wish them all well.</P>
    <P>Many trainers become involved in racing on leaving school and many remain in the industry for the rest of their lives.  A local example is Michael Hourigan, whose family had no background in horse racing.  He was apprenticed as a jockey and is now one of the most successful trainers in Ireland.  He is a neighbour of mine and I wish him well. It is great to see such people achieving success in the horseracing industry.</P>
    <P>While there are not many trainers in my county of Limerick and in the Minister's area, they have been successful. When I was young I used to go to Listowel for the holiday meeting and Martin <Col N="1692" /> Maloney was a champion jockey at that time.  He was from County Limerick and we were great followers of his.  We used to bet on him at Listowel, but unfortunately he let us down on a few occasions and we were poorer coming home. Unlike Senator Cosgrave, I have just a passing interest in horseracing.  When I go to races I think that I know a lot about horses, but before I go home I find out that I know very little.  It is a costly lesson, but that is all part of the sport.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a more professional approach to training.  We should study the structure of the industry.  Point to point racing is very popular in County Limerick and in the Minister's county of Cork.  I was at a point to point meeting in Kildorrery last year.  I do not have much time on Sundays to go racing, but on this day there was not any good hurling match or football game on.  I do not know whether the Minister went to Cork or the Curragh last Sunday.  I would definitely go to Cork, but I could not go there last Sunday because of other GAA commitments.  There were nearly 200 horses racing in Kildorrery that day and ten or 12 races, which is an indication of the popularity of point to point racing. The successful owners will go on to further success and race on the 26 race courses throughout the country and probably abroad.</P>
    <P>Credit is due to horse owners, who in many cases have little return for their major investment.  It is well known that the average training fee is approximately £150 to £200 per week, which does not include veterinary, travelling, entry and other fees.  A small owner might have one or two horses in national hunt racing only to find after four years that the animal will not appear in a race track, although the owner paid a large sum of money for a yearling and incurred various expenses in bringing it to the stage where it could race.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned syndicates and there is an increase in the number of people syndicating horses, which is very welcome.  My only hope of having an interest in a horse is to become involved in a syndicate because I doubt <Col N="1693" /> that I could afford to buy one myself. It is an economic way of becoming a racehorse owner.  The expenses are shared and it provides the same amount of enjoyment, although the return might not be as great.  There is great enjoyment in owning a horse and seeing it running and winning.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties involved and the Minister's success in providing additional funding this year.  I think he said that the Exchequer provided £6.6 million for racing, which is a large sum of money.  It is good that this legislation will provide the means for the industry to increase its funding from its own resources.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>There are 26 tracks in the country and I appeal to the Minister not to allow this new horse racing Authority or anybody else to close them down.  Mallow race track was mentioned and, as Senator Sherlock and the Minister would know, I live quite near to Mallow and I would like to see the facilities there being improved.  The Minister also mentioned facilities at race courses.  Some of the facilities are inadequate, particularly the betting facilities.  There is always a rush, particularly at tote offices, to place bets. We are living in an age when people want the best facilities.  In order to encourage people to go to race courses there will have to be proper facilities.  I am sure that this new board will ensure that facilities are improved.</P>
    <P>As I said, I have only a passing interest in horseracing.  I cannot go to Sunday races because of my interest in hurling and football games.  I can only go to holiday meetings, which are great occasions, especially the Listowel meeting, which is the west Limerick, north Kerry and Clare farmers' annual holiday meeting.  I wish the Minister success with this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this Bill.  For most of us racing is entertainment. However, it is a very important industry for a large number of people. The Minister is right to point out the number of people which it employs and that there is potential for employing a far greater number.  I will speak later about <Col N="1694" /> areas which are not often considered to be connected to racing but which I think are, such as the tourist industry.  It is very important, now that the breeding industry appears to be recovering, that we make a really big effort in the racing industry because it is essential that our horses have a showcase.  Unless we have adequate showcase meetings, we will not able to maintain the current interest in Irish horses.  As the Minister is aware, there is very good breeding in other countries. It is one thing to have our horses running abroad, but they must be seen running here as well.  If we do not have enough confidence to put domestic investment into our own industry, those abroad will have little sympathy for us if we are left with paddocks of brood mares.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated to hear the Minister and other Senators talk about the return one gets from the horse industry.  I do not know of any member of my family who has ever got a return from horses. However, it has not deterred them from being involved in every aspect of the industry.  I will presume that there are those who get a decent return from horses.  As Senator Kiely said, one would need to be running another few projects on the farm to be sure of being able to support the horses.</P>
      <P>The Minister is correct in stating that the facilities at various race tracks have to upgraded.  This is extremely important. When one sees the facilities in tracks abroad one can understand why it is difficult to attract people accustomed to sophisticated entertainment to tracks with inadequate conditions.  I have not been in Mallow for a few years, but the last time I was there the conditions were not satisfactory for someone spending the best part of a day at a race course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An investment must be made in this area.  I agree with Senator Cosgrave that rather than talking about opening other tracks, we would be better advised to concentrate on the existing ones.  I have not seen the course at the Curragh with the television where one can watch the whole race.  I have seen it at other courses and it is incredible.  It makes a huge difference to one's enjoyment, and, if one <Col N="1695" /> is fairly small, one no longer has to ask what happened at the end of a race.  I applaud the Minister's efforts in improving the facilities there.</P>
    <P>I have few comments to make on the betting aspect of the Bill because I really do not understand it.  It is a pity that the country seems to rely totally on betting &mdash; for example, through the Lotto &mdash; and now racing is to be totally supported by betting.  It is certainly more justified that the racing industry should rely so heavily on betting rather than that the health and education services have to rely on the Lotto.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave made several points with which I agree, particularly those concerning the cost of training and the worringly small number of horses in some races.  This is a problem, because training is appallingly expensive now.  Senator Kiely gave some figures which I am sure are correct, if not modest.  I do not know how this problem can be solved.  Syndicates have started, and this is totally different from having Lady Beaverbrook or some other rich person with a string of horses.  It would be sad if it got so out of hand that only a small number of horses was involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely mentioned the point to point meetings where there is a large number of horses involved.  The fields are so big in some of the point to point meetings now that it presents quite a problem.  I gather that efforts were made to lengthen the season, but this has not been possible.  The point to point meetings are an extremely large source of income, so the Minister might examine the possibility of lengthening the season. Farming has changed so much that the difficulties with starting the season before Christmas may no longer exist.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister and his Authority to examine the area.</P>
    <P>The joy of point to point meetings for local people and the pride they take in local events is often underestimated, as is the tourist potential.  I cannot be the only person who goes home for the local point to point.  Visitors come down to guest houses and so on if the meeting is <Col N="1696" /> well organised.  Despite the fact that much money is collected from point to point meetings, there is not a great deal of money ploughed back into them.  Perhaps the Authority could look at that.  I know the Turf Board give grants and so on, but I would like to think that could be improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite rightly praised the voluntary work of those in the Racing Board, the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt steeplechase committee and all those who sat on various committees over the last few years to examine this industry.  All of us who get enjoyment out of racing owe a great deal to the voluntary work put in by numerous people on committees all over the country who work in a voluntary capacity to keep fixtures going and organise race meetings.  They should be acknowledged today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are few activities or businesses in which Ireland has an outstanding reputation, tradition and standing but horse breeding and the racing industry is one of them.  Throughout the thoroughbred world the Irish horse and horseman is recognised as being right at the top.  The new Authority will help to maintain and improve an industry which offers young people an interesting, healthy and worthwhile occupation, particularly in these days of set aside.</P>
      <P>No amount of praise is sufficient for the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the officials in his Department and their persistence in bringing together the interest groups involved in racing and breeding, some of whom by all reports were reluctant to accept or participate in unification.  In thanking the Minister for being so single minded and persistent, we must consider the opportunities the new Authority will offer the racing and breeding enterprises operating in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before moving forward, the Authority must tidy up those aspects which need attention.  It is comparable to &ldquo;mucking out&rdquo; before exercise.  Having in this case inherited a mess, the Authority must rectify <Col N="1697" /> and rationalise before it proceeds to the next stage of obtaining new investment.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised that the tote has been a loss maker for years.  This haemorrhage must be stopped and no excuse for not doing so should be accepted.  Work practices and computer inadequacies have been suggested as reasons for the fact that the tote does not make a profit.  This allegations may be correct but, whatever the reason, this must be addressed immediately and the drain must be blocked.</P>
    <P>When one travels around Ireland one finds race courses which are in dire financial need.  This House should caution against the prospect of the Authority being seen as a form of rescue agency for inefficient or non-viable race courses, particularly if they are privately owned.</P>
    <P>It is often propounded that in some areas there is too much racing and consequently the attendance is insufficient to make meetings profitable.  If this is the case the number of meetings must be reduced immediately and perhaps the number of races on an individual day increased.  We must remember that a reduction in the number of days on which racing is held would add to the sense of occasion on the basis that what is seldom is wonderful.  Some 300 days racing with seven races per day is exactly the same as 210 days with ten races per day.  When we reach a stage where on Derby day at the Curragh there are three and four horse races, it is clear that, as the saying goes, something is rotten in the state of Denmark and it is time to examine the management and their so-called master plan.</P>
    <P>Racing is always referred to as the shop window of the industry.  The better the shop window the more likely it is that someone might wish to enter the shop and invest.  Those investments bring jobs in provincial and rural locations, all of which help to keep communities together and give young people hope.</P>
    <P>All over the world young Irish horsemen are sought after in stud farms and racing stables, and four of the top jockeys in the world today were born in Ireland. <Col N="1698" /> Racing has been good to them and it will be good to many more young people in the future.  The names of our trainers are known internationally, including people of the calibre of Vincent O'Brien, John Magner and John Mulhern.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House and in doing so caution this new Authority to avoid the wastage that has occurred to date in some areas.  I ask them to be prudent, frugal, inventive and, above all, to protect and build on the great tradition. I see this as a new beginning for Irish horse racing.  We are getting away from many of the old practices and old faces, such as captains and majors who got their commissions in the East Indian Rifles.  I see this as a new beginning, a new time for Ireland and horse racing.  I commend the Bill to the House and thank the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a new racing Authority is welcome.  The Irish horseracing industry must be placed on a sound financial footing in order to maximise its potential.  The industry must also reflect the attitude and interest of the participants.  The main difference between the new Authority and that which existed previously is the openness and transparency in the new Authority. I congratulate the Minister on his initiative in introducing this legislation.</P>
      <P>Looking at the horseracing industry in the same way as we would look at an industry in the industrial sector means posing the same basic question: how do we organise it in a way that will obtain top class international competitive performance? The Fine Gael spokesperson expressed her reservations in the D·il and spoke about the prospect &mdash; she almost said it was frightening &mdash; of Deputy Pat Rabbitte becoming chairman of the board.  It would be no bad thing, perhaps, if a person of his calibre was chairman.  In the past some people believed that because they had a tradition in the industry nobody else knew anything about racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish thoroughbred industry is a substantial indigenous enterprise employing 12,000 people and many thousands <Col N="1699" /> more are employed part-time and in ancillary businesses.  I am glad that section 23 of the Bill provides for the superannuation of employees of the board.  The enthusiasm of people engaged by trainers and others and the unsocial hours they work must also be recognised.  These people have a great interest and involvement in the industry. Their commitment is second to none and their diligence in the performance of their duties must not go unrecognised.</P>
    <P>Previously, it was very hard to get information about the industry.  Two or three years ago if I inquired about the prospects for Mallow racecourse &mdash; which I occasionally did &mdash; I would have received vague answers or no answers in some instances.  I congratulate the Minister on his initiative regarding Mallow racecourse.  The community was a little disappointed that the decision took longer than anticipated.  However, it is a great vote of confidence in the horseracing industry in Munster, and particularly in Mallow.  The community has been waiting for this development and is ready to play its part in developing the only track in Cork.  Perhaps the Minister would give an indication of what progress has been made regarding the track in Mallow.</P>
    <P>I have been following the establishment of the commission with interest. Senator Rory Kiely referred to his visit to the Kildorrery race meeting.  I went to a race meeting in Doneraile this year and it was 7 o'clock in the evening before the races were completed because the maiden race had to be divided three ways.  That is an indication of the enormous interest in the racing industry.  It is vitally important that the racing Authority be established.</P>
    <P>Lord Killanin said, in a letter sent to me and to the newspapers, that the Bill was flawed.  He referred in particular to the betting industry.  However, I do not have strong views on that issue.  It is a long time since I went to Greenpark on St. Stephen's Day.  On that day the person standing beside me had the winner of a particular race as a result of <Col N="1700" /> a tip &ldquo;from the horse's mouth&rdquo;.  I was never as enthusiastic about betting afterwards.</P>
    <P>Although little horse breeding is carried on in Counties Cork and Kerry the existence of race courses in those counties is very important for the tourist industry.  Perhaps racing could be better promoted as a tourist attraction through a promotion budget provided from the racing Authority's increased income. There should be greater emphasis on racing as a tourist attraction.  A number of Irish punters travel to Cheltenham each year to enjoy the atmosphere and the craic.  We could do the same in this country.</P>
    <P>The Irish horse industry can have a bright future.  The CAP reforms encouraged farmers to get involved in the horse industry.  After years of recession in that business sales are picking up.  Recently I met a number of people whose horses were taking part in a point-to-point meeting. They were confident about the future and said sales were picking up.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a new horseracing Authority will breathe new life into the industry and I am glad a Minister from County Cork has been instrumental in its establishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to call a vote on this matter.  It is only my regard for the Minister that prevents me from doing so.  Members from the Government side should be attending this debate.  On one famous occasion in the past we defeated the Government in this House when it had no representative to respond to a question put by the Chair.  However, I will not call for a quorum this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister to the House, I acknowledge his interest in this matter.  Being a keen and regular racegoer, he speaks with authority when commenting on the industry.  I also commend the Minister for amending the Bill in the Lower House.  Some provisions which I would have considered objectionable, particularly one regarding the rules of racing and who should regulate those rules, have been amended to a satisfactory degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> However, the Bill is still defective in several areas.  The Minister's assertions that the industry has potential, that it must be regulated, that legislation is required to do so and that some reorganisation is necessary are not at issue. The issue is whether this Bill is the best way to do it and in my view it is not.  It interferes to an unhealthy degree in a sport.  One can debate whether horse racing is an industry or a sport.  It is both and, as a general principle, it is wrong for politics and sport to mix.  In this legislation politics and sport mix to an unhealthy degree.  I do not deny that horse racing is an important industry which requires regulation.  Obviously, the regulation of the industry must receive attention.</P>
    <P>Even by the leisurely standards of equine gestation it has taken a long time to introduce this Bill.  Perhaps that indicates the debate which took place within the industry about the content of the Bill. The Minister has spoken about the value of the industry and I will not repeat his remarks.  However, there are some features he did not address which are worth considering.  The most recent report of the Turf Club was published in 1993. This set a headline for the Racing Board, which appears to be far more tardy in the production of figures, although it took the Turf Club 200 years to produce its first report.</P>
    <P>There are about 3,000 owners in the industry.  It is perceived that a small group of people control the industry, basically the sheikhs, the Aga Khan and Mr. Robert Sangster.  They may be dominant but there are 3,000 owners, many of whom are small owners.  That can be said with certainty because fewer than 6,800 horses are in training; the effective figure is lower than that because the average monthly number in training is 4,840. Given that there are 3,000 owners and 4,840 horses, it can be seen the average number of horses per owner is extremely small.</P>
    <P>I profess a vested interest in this matter because I am one of those unfortunate people who invested money in one of these four legged animals, which might <Col N="1702" /> more appropriately have been turned into dog food than being run on the race courses of Ireland.  We have been told about the marvellous fun we have and it is certainly enjoyable to go to Thurles, Wexford and Roscommon, especially to national hunt events.  However the fun is costly, as I believe the Minister knows to his detriment.  We are confronted with expensive training fees, but that is not to say horse trainers make a lot of money &mdash; the vast majority of them do not.  If there is to be a priority in the legislation and what the Minister hopes to do with the Bill, it must be to address the problems facing owners.  That means introducing small improvements.  For example, if a horse is entered in a race in Thurles worth £1,000, the owner should be able to park his car and get a cup of tea.  Having invested in the industry owners expect that much in return.  We are in it for the sport rather than the profit, but the industry has an obligation to the owners which is not being fulfilled to the extent it should.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the Minister about the need to promote and improve the industry but the question is whether the Bill does that to best effect.  In certain areas it does not because politics and sport do not mix.  There seems to be a wider agenda.  A small group of people believe they know what is best for the industry and regard people with years of experience in horse racing as not competent to have a view.  There has been a clash between the different elements which has not been healthy.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister has done his best to resolve the conflicts and one hopes he will continue to do so.  Those unhealthy divisions exist and the genesis of this Bill has been surrounded by some of this controversy.  As Senator McDonagh said, Lord Killanin made a statement which exhibited deep concern on the part of someone who had vast experience not just in the Irish racing industry but in sport worldwide.  Hopefully his reservations can be taken into account in the legislation and dealt with here.</P>
    <P>To what extent is it appropriate for the State to intervene in this industry? <Col N="1703" /> Private enterprise flourishes in this industry above all others and it is at the core of the horse racing business.  The Turf Club's 1992 report spoke about a joint racing authority, which is certainly not what has come to pass.  It is not joint in the sense of a partnership between the Turf Club and the Racing Board or its successor.</P>
    <P>Prize money is also essential to the success of the industry.  If it is lucky a horse can win a £1,000 or £1,500 race but it costs much more than that to participate in the sport, especially when one considers the initial cost of buying a horse.  The total prize money was £12.2 million last year and £12.91 million the previous year; this shows there has been a fall in the prize money and the number of race meetings has fallen also.</P>
    <P>Of the 1,696 races which took place in 1993, 700 had some form of sponsorship. There is a lesson to be learned there because, compared to other sports, the racing industry has been slow to realise the potential in sponsorship.  The Minister and I have attended race meetings where there was generous hospitality from sponsors but the industry and the race tracks have been slow to exploit this. In Britain it has been suggested that the jockey's colours could carry sponsorship as soccer players do at the World Cup. This is not bad if it brings money into the industry.  If there is corporate money to be captured for this flagship Irish industry let it be captured.</P>
    <P>The average prize money at races is £7,208 which suggests all is well. However, if group races, which account for £1.85 million of the total, are excluded, the average falls significantly. The prize money issue must be tackled because it is fundamental to a person's decision to buy and train a horse.</P>
    <P>The Minister made considerable play of the amount of money invested over the past few years and mentioned a figure of £13 million.  I refer him to the amount of money collected in on-course and off-course betting facilities.  A sum of £35 million in off-course betting levies goes to the Exchequer, which puts the level <Col N="1704" /> of Government funding into perspective. The Exchequer is a significant net beneficiary and the industry is suffering as a result.</P>
    <P>The funding provision is one of the big deficiencies of the Bill.  It is much to arbitrary and open to an individual Minister and to the Authority to determine the amount of money which will go into the industry.  I do not question the commitment of the present Minister to horse racing, nor do I question his knowledge, but what will happen when his successors have access to this legislation?  If they prove to be hostile to the industry, as some people are, what happens?</P>
    <P>One assertion which should be nailed for all time was that made by Senator Lydon.  He said the members of the Turf Club are retired colonels or members of the British Raj.  The honorary members of the governing body of the Turf Club include Mr. Liam Cosgrave and Mr. Charles J. Haughey, neither of whom, to my knowledge, is and ever has been such a person.</P>

      <P>Other members include Dr. A.J.F. O'Reilly, Mr. Michael Roarty, who people would have seen last Sunday on the television if they were watching the Irish Derby, His Royal Highness, the Aga Khan, Lord Killanin and Mr. Denis Brosnan, who the Minister knows and whose name appears on the new Authority.  We should nail the lie that members of the Turf Club are Colonel Blimps who have been around for the past 100 years and have no knowledge of or interest in racing.  That is not the case.  The Turf Club members are well qualified professional people.  It should not be suggested otherwise.  In fairness to the Minister, he would not suggest that.  Some of the complimentary things he said about the Turf Club do not square with the reality of some of the provisions in this Bill.  Someone in the <Col N="1705" /> other House described it as gelding the Turf Club.  I would not go that far, but I would say they are carrying a 12 stone penalty in a claiming race and they probably have blinkers as well.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the Curragh race course.  He makes the point that the governing bodies will continue to do the things they have previously done.  The Turf Club owns the Curragh racecourse.  Does that mean that relationship will continue or will it change when the new Authority is established?  I believe the answer is straightforward and I would like to hear it.</P>
      <P>Managements of racecourses must realise they are part of the entertainment business because they do not seem to acknowledge this fact.  I live within a short distance of the Curragh racecourse and several meetings have taken place there to discuss the falling attendances and how to attract people back to the racecourse.  The average attendance at Irish races in the past 12 months was 4,400 people, a small number.  The point was made that one million people attend races during the year.  However, the average attendance is 4,400.  There were 7,000 people at the Curragh for the 1,000 guineas race meeting.  The numbers are decreasing because the tracks are in competition with television and other forms of entertainment, which were not available when we were growing up.</P>
      <P>Why would someone pay to go to the Irish Derby last Sunday to see fields of three and four horses and only two races in a card which could be described as good fields &mdash; one was the Irish Derby and the other was the race in which &ldquo;Vintage Crop&rdquo; was running.  This aspect must be dealt with.  Is this happening because all the good horses have left the country or is it because the entry fees are too high for the ordinary owner I described earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do we contrast that with Punchestown, where the place is full during the festival?  What is it about the Punchestown management which makes it different from other managements around the country in terms of being able to promote a festival which brings visitors <Col N="1706" /> into the country and revenue into the area?  Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that national hunt racing is more attractive to the Irish person than flat racing and that the social ambience which goes with national hunt racing is more attractive to the Irish psyche than flat racing which has become elitist.  I visited one particular track where great play was made of the fact that the so-called reserved enclosure had been eliminated and the two tier layer of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As regards the investments which racecourses must make to improve their facilities and so on, Naas racecourse must sell land to finance its development.  Application was made to the Minister for Finance to have rollover relief for capital gains purposes.  My understanding is that this is not available in this instance.  Given the amount of the investment, it should be allowed if it is going back into the business.</P>
      <P>The other point concerns the five year licence.  If someone wants to develop a racecourse and invest a significant amount of capital, the licence should be for a longer period than five years.  How can one make strategic investment plans on the basis of five year licensing?</P>
      <P>I have reservations about certain aspects of this Bill which I could discuss in greater detail.  I await the Minister's reply with interest and we will table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The last time we discussed <Col N="1707" /> the horseracing industry was during the debate on the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 1993, when we talked about the need for capital to purchase a better class of stallion for the Irish thoroughbred breeder.  It is important to have a coherent plan for the Irish horseracing industry, which is recognised as valuable and there is potential for growth.  It has also been recognised that Irish horses have an international reputation and the skills of the people involved in the industry have been acknowledged worldwide.</P>
      <P>We must accept the fact that there has been a worldwide recession in the horseracing industry over the past number of years.  However, we also have domestic problems which this Bill will tackle.  For two centuries, two governing bodies have been responsible for the Irish horseracing industry.  They have performed their duties as admirably as they could within their brief.  However, it is now time for a coherent plan, as laid out in this Bill, to promote the industry and to encourage its growth and development.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest problems in the Irish horseracing industry is the lack of funds available to the National Stud. There seems to be a lack of available finance and the Minister must face this issue.  We must ensure that the stigma of betting on and off the courses is removed. For too long there was a stigma attached to people who went into a betting office to put money on a horse.  Betting is not an evil or a sinful pastime.  However, there is a difficulty in this area which must be overcome.</P>
      <P>As other Senators mentioned, the issue of prize money must be tackled because it is expensive to keep a racehorse in training and to provide proper facilities for it.  If we do not have proper prize money, the sport will become concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy people and it will be taken from those who founded the horse industry with one or two horses.  This must be considered by the new horseracing Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the availability of tax exemption status and the fact that any surplus will be reinvested to promote and <Col N="1708" /> develop the industry.  The Government is prepared to consider conferring tax exemption status on the horseracing Authority in the next Finance Bill.  We must acknowledge and welcome this.  The Minister has excellent knowledge of the industry and has prioritised it as an area for growth and development.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the remaining Stages of this Bill when I hope to contribute in more detail.  I have great faith in this Bill and I hope it achieves what it sets out to do.  I congratulate the Minister and the Department for bringing this issue to the fore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill to the House.  The new horseracing Authority is welcome.  All industries, especially the racing industry, need to be updated at certain times and there is no doubt that the horseracing industry needs to be updated.</P>
      <P>Horseracing provides potential for tourism with evening meetings during the summer.  I have attended such meetings to my cost, because a person must be prepared to lose the money in his pocket. In recent years people on touring holidays have attended evening race meetings. It is another asset which this country can offer the tourism industry.  Some of the money for the National Development Plan will be spent under the heading of tourist investments.  The Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Deputy McCreevy, who seems to be the authority on how this money will be spent in this area.</P>
      <P>Many years ago it was announced that Roscommon and Kilbeggan racecourses were to close because the day of the small racecourse was over and racecourses needed to be located near Dublin and other major cities to survive.  Like other predictions and plans relayed, the opposite happened.  At present racecourses like Roscommon and Kilbeggan are booming while Dublin tracks and those in the vicinity of the city are finding it difficult to survive because people are not attending meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> If one asks why people do they not go to Leopardstown or the Curragh, they will say they do not like flat racing because there are few runners, the same trainer wins all the time and the favourites are always odds on.  It is seldom that those who go into a betting shop bet on an Irish race.  I hope the Minister bears that in mind.</P>
    <P>Because it is expensive to keep a racehorse and it is difficult for trainers to survive, perhaps trainers and owners, because there is only limited prize money available, want to go for the big coup.  In order to set that up, horses are not given a full push on the way to that famous coup.  Perhaps the Chairman, Senator McDonagh, will enlighten us about that. We will not ask him about his expert knowledge on horseracing and how to train winners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that on course levy money will go directly to the horseracing Authority.  It is right that revenue raised at race tracks is directly fed back into the industry.  Some of the income from off-course betting should be ploughed back into the industry because many tracks need to be updated, although some have made efforts in recent years by providing restaurants, bars and stands.</P>
    <P>I refer to safety on race tracks, something of which Minister should be aware. I attended a race meeting where, at the first hurdle, a horse fell and the jockey was injured.  There was a mix up and by the time help and on-track facilities arrived, the horses had come around again.  That is something of which the new Authority must be aware.  Safety on some race tracks must be improved from the point of view of the jockeys and the crowds.  At some of the larger and at holiday meetings, crowds tend to spill out on to the race track at the fences, especially at meetings like the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that many race tracks seek extra funding for development plans &mdash; few race tracks do not have development plans.  This is an opportunity to provide the necessary funding.  The Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Trade <Col N="1710" /> and Tourism, Deputy McCreevy, who will have money to spend on tourism. Perhaps racing could be included in a tourism related plan; I am sure those involved would not hesitate to team up to develop plans.  It is an area which the Minister might look at.  Nobody has given me a hot tip, but those of us who attend race meetings know the hotter the tip, the more likely it is to fail.  However, I hope this new Authority does not fail and I wish the Minister the best.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem I have at race meetings is that I get more than one tip for each race, I then have a problem deciding which will win.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their valuable, well informed and sincere contributions to this debate.  They were helpful and interesting and were made for the best reasons and in the long term interest of the industry.  It is regrettable that we do not have debates on major industries like this more often in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>This is a comprehensive and important Bill which refers to most aspects of the industry.  It will make important changes in the way the sector is managed and financed.  These changes are necessary and the new structure will serve the industry well.  For this to happen the new Authority will have to be innovative and give strong leadership.</P>
      <P>The point has been made by several Senators that we are in competition with various other sports and entertainment.  We need innovation, imagination and the progressive implementation of policies for the future and for the future racegoer.  I meet many people who go racing and most of them are hard core racegoers.  They enjoy the sport and they are fans of it.  Whole families or younger couples are not often seen at the races. Senator Dardis and others mentioned that for example in the Curragh last weekend we saw many people who were there last year and will be there again next year, but in between very small numbers of them are regular racegoers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> The facilities and the cards at race meetings must be improved.  I agree that they are very good in the Curragh and many other places.  Very few Irish people like to see three or four horses running five or six furlongs with an odds-on favourite.  That is not what they go to see. Senator Sherlock referred to Doneraile point to point and Senator Rory Kiely referred to Kildorrery.  I was at a number of point to points this year.  The last one I attended was in Kinsale.  The crowds of people there were absolutely enormous. The fields at a number of the races had to be subdivided to cater for all the horses there.  People were training, breeding and running horses for prizes of around £100.  The prize money was very small but the pride in the animal and the pride in the breed and bloodline was sufficient for them.  It was totally for the sport. There was very little commercial consideration because again, as Senator Henry and Senator Dardis pointed out, most people who invest in the ownership of a horse do not get a good return on their investment unless they are extremely lucky.  It is not a great investment. The return on it is usually negative. There is a well worn story about how to make a small fortune out of horse racing. The way to make a small fortune is to start off with a large one and it will not be too long getting small in that business.</P>
    <P>I expect the Authority will examine the possibilities in all of these areas as soon as possible and will take the necessary action to provide a sound revenue base for the Authority.  It will then have to decide on the long term investment programme for the use of the funds which it has generated itself and from State funds as well.  Racecourses and their facilities would have to be improved and modernised and upgraded.  Marketing and promotion also need considerable improvement.  Irish Thoroughbred Marketing have done a tremendous job in this area.  Senator Sherlock commented on the fact that some owners at least seem to be reasonably happy with the prices they were getting.  There has been a general upswing in the industry and as <Col N="1712" /> well as everything else the Irish thoroughbred horse has been promoted in a very professional way by Irish Thoroughbred Marketing.</P>
    <P>This legislation should breathe new life into the industry.  It will give the industry the impetus it needs and I will not be happy if it is just more of the same.  There must be fundamental changes in the industry.  It must be brought into the next century.  The Authority must ensure that it competes with other forms of entertainment. Radical and pronounced changes are needed, in particular to cater for the modern person and the younger age profile.  The age profile of the regular race goer must be from 35 upwards and probably older than that.  I seldom see young couples and younger people and people new to the industry apart from some of the glamour events like the Derby or the Oaks.</P>
    <P>A whole range of people come to festival or holiday meetings and it is grand to see them enjoying themselves.  There is plenty of good racing, usually national hunt steeplechasing and hurdles with a mix of racing and facilities there.  Some of our tracks could learn a from this.  How can Galway, Listowel and other festival meetings like that present a range and a variety of racing activities to attract people there?  Some people might say that it is only done once a year.  That is true, but the race tracks in Galway and Listowel are crowded for the week of the races.  The turnover on the tote for Galway race meeting must make up a very large proportion of the overall turnover of that organisation.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there is still some concern about the Government funding aspect of the new arrangement.  If I had my way I would earmark a certain amount of money for this industry for the next 100 years.  I would like to be able to provide in the legislation for an adequate permanent State contribution of the kind demanded, but this is simply not possible. The same section in this Bill in relation to State funding applies to every other body which receives a State contribution.</P>
    <P>In relation to State contributions, about two thirds of total racing revenue <Col N="1713" /> in the last couple of years has come from the taxpayer.  It is entirely reasonable that there should be accountability for this money, because if the taxpayers are putting in two thirds of the amount the State is entitled to know how this money is spent and to have some interest in it.</P>
    <P>I have many other things to do in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, but I have an interest in this sport.  It has tremendous potential and it will respond to new leadership and to the increased amount of money.  It is not possible to do it the way people want to or the way I would like to do it.  However, I have given an undertaking both in the other House and here that this contribution from the taxpayer will be forthcoming right into the future and that it should be adequate and appropriate.  I have in good faith convinced the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners that the new Horseracing Authority should be tax exempt.  I intend to introduce an amendment next year to allow this to happen as an incentive for the new Authority to operate the tote and other fund-raising activities more efficiently so that they can plough revenue raised back into the industry.</P>
    <P>We have for this year provided the full level of funding required through the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I am already on record in this House regarding my commitment for future funding.  I have already appointed members of the new Authority on an interim basis pending enactment of the legislation.  There is a balanced representation from all the various interests of the horse racing industry on it and they have between them a vast depth of skill and experience.  I want to see the Authority giving us a return on our investment in terms of a growing vibrant industry, increased employment and, if at all possible, better conditions in jobs in the industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock talked about some of the people in the industry who work extremely hard.  It is fine for us to say that Sunday racing is a great thing, but young lads have to get up and muck out the stables on a Sunday morning and <Col N="1714" /> people have to take the horses to the races on Sunday evening and return home with them, wash them down and look after them.  They have their whole weekend taken up.  We have to consider the unsocial hours worked by those in the industry.  It is a seven days per week job and those trainers and owners and people working in it earn their money.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators expressed concern about the position of the Turf Club. The position of the Turf Club and the emphasis on the different sectors of the industry is exaggerated.  I have spent a great deal of time with the different people involved and through the various different committees and groups.  It was not the easiest thing in the world to get them all in the one paddock, but they are there and they are all interested in the industry.  I believe that they will work together in a coherent way for the development of the industry.  I was very pleased on Wednesday 22 June to hear the new senior steward of the Turf Club, Mr. Michael Osbourne, speak.  He is internationally renowned and a fine person in every possible way.  He is a little different from some of the former senior stewards in that he is president of the Kildare GAA.  I would say he the first senior steward who is president of the Kildare GAA and I hope that Kildare will go on to win the Leinster final on this occasion and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they will probably go on to win the All Ireland.  It is good to see a person of the international stature of Mr. Osbourne involved and his predecessors did a fantastic job over 200 years.  They did it voluntarily and got nothing out of it and often put their own resources into it.  Senator Rory Kiely talked about missing race meetings because they clashed with GAA fixtures. It now happens that some of the Curragh fixtures are decided upon having regard to GAA matches around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that Mr. Osbourne said he was fully behind the new Authority. He said that it would make racing more <Col N="1715" /> attractive for a lot of reasons and it would ensure better facilities in that it would be involved in giving capital grants to racecourses to improve facilities and comforts for the clients going racing.  He said that horseracing was a great Irish sport which is good value for money.  It is my intention that that philosophy will run through the new Authority.</P>
    <P>As I implied in my introductory speech, the position of the governing bodies is secured in the Bill.  We all recognise the major contribution they have made over 200 years.  The bodies are committed to the development of this industry and recognise fully that its potential must be realised to the maximum.  The governing bodies will continue to make and enforce the rules of racing and to maintain the integrity of racing in an independent and autonomous fashion without interference from others and will do so with the full statutory backing provided by this legislation.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to bookmakers and betting have been improved and I hope will lead to the provision of the full range of betting facilities that are sought by the public.  Racecourses will now be reviewed every five years and in these reviews I expect the Authority and course management to make every effort to satisfy the demands of the public by way of modern facilities.  These should encourage new people to take an interest in this fascinating sport.</P>
    <P>I was glad to be able to bring forward a Bill on the horseracing industry which received such strong support from the major sections of the industry and I was glad to hear the welcome to much of the Bill given in the D·il and in the Seanad by Senators who know the industry and accept that there is need for development. The success or otherwise of the new regime will depend on the industry itself and it will give them every encouragement to progressively move the industry forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave made a thoughtful and informed contribution, as is fitting from a person from a family with such a long tradition in support of the racing <Col N="1716" /> industry at all levels.  The Senator raised the matter of the operation of the tote and the staff and they will all be matters for the new Authority.  I will be calling the first meeting of the new Authority on 4 July and I hope to arrange it so that it will not clash with Ireland's football match in Orlando, but if it does not clash I will be there to welcome the new members.  In essence, the new Authority will be told to get on with the job it has been invited to do without interference from the Minister, the Department or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked in particular about the new members of the Authority and especially those from the Racing Club of Ireland.  The Racing Club of Ireland nominated three members and submitted the nominations to me and I invited one of the members submitted to be a member of the new Authority.  I assume that the Racing Club of Ireland submitted three appropriate members who would represent and reflect the interests of that club.  I did that in allowing for the nomination of the punter who pays money to go to the racing rather than watch it from their living room.  I did not confine it to any one club because a number of members of clubs said that in many racecourses there are good clubs surrounding the management who do a tremendous amount of work and in the future clubs may emerge, so I want to leave it open to the racegoer.  In October 1992, when I began my consideration of this matter, I was the first person to have the intention that the punter should be represented on the Authority &mdash; the ordinary racegoer who looks for the little comforts at a race meeting.  I was glad to have the punter represented and it is untrue to say that this was dragged out of me &mdash; an accusation I have read about.</P>
    <P>A number of Members mentioned point-to-point meetings.  I like point-to-point meetings myself and I am delighted that there is so much interest in them.  I will bring it to the attention of the new Authority that there is a great interest in point-to-point meetings in Seanad …ireann.  Irish people like to be as close to the horses as possible, not that we <Col N="1717" /> would want them to get too close, of course.  I would not like to see them bringing down Mr. Michael Kinane, or anybody else for that matter, while running across the track.</P>

      <P>Yes, a little.  I will take up the issue of the extension of the season because in dividing up various races it would be far better if it could be extended.  I do not know why it could not be extended, but I will look into the matter.</P>
      <P>The question of Mallow was raised and it is an issue close to my heart.  I asked the Racing Board if it would look at the position of Mallow and the race-starved race-going people of Cork to see if a track appropriate to the racegoer could be provided in the Cork region.  The Racing Board had a look at Mallow.  It is a family owned racetrack and the Racing Board negotiated with the family and agreed on the outline of acquiring the track.  The principles of that matter were agreed to some time last year.  I was happy about that.  In anticipation of putting a sizeable investment into it to upgrade the facilities and the track, I put money aside in this year's budget which is there to be drawn down.  Since then the detail of that acquisition is taking longer than I and the people in Cork and the surrounding areas would have liked.  I would have hoped that a lot of the work would have been done at this stage.  Hopefully, the matter will be resolved as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I referred to a number of aspects of Senator Dardis' contribution.  To allay any fears he might have about too much interference, I can assure him that I have no intention whatsoever of interfering other than to ensure that there is an adequate amount of finance made available and that the Department can facilitate the development of the industry.  The Curragh racecourse will remain the property and under the management of the Turf Club; this legislation will make no change whatsoever in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> A number of Members referred to prize money and its improvement.  We are not doing too badly in that regard. Senator Dardis pointed out that it is roughly around £7,000, but if we take out the classics or groups it is somewhat less than that.  However, it compares more than favourably with the situation in Britain.  With a more efficient operation and better sources of revenue the prize money can and will be improved.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton referred to the funds allocated to my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy; I have had my eyes on those funds for some time.  I convinced him that he should make an allocation to the Irish Thoroughbred Marketing Organisation because there is big export potential for our thoroughbred horses.  Indeed, the Minister came up trumps there; Bord F·ilte also made grants available to Punchestown. He was also deeply involved in attracting the World Equestrian Games which will be held in that location in a few years time.  My colleague is certainly making his contribution in that regard.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill.  The contributions made in this House are important and I will take them into account.  I know they were made for the best reasons, namely, the improvement and development of the industry.</P>
    <P>Everybody cannot be entirely satisfied by what one does in this life and the same would apply to this Bill.  The membership of the new Authority fairly reflects all aspects of the industry.  I would like to have seen more Cork people on the nominations that came through, for example, but it did not happen.  There might have been more Galway people on it, but that did not come through the system. However, it is broadly representative of the industry.  There is enough skill and experience among those on the Authority to do a good job, with the right motivation.</P>
    <P>The same would apply to the North of Ireland.  I often go to horseracing in the North.  I know Jim Nicholson, a fine person who has done a professional job with the Down Royal racecourse.  It is Government policy &mdash; I have no problem <Col N="1719" /> with it &mdash; to have a gender balance requirement on boards.  I am pleased there are five women on this new Authority. I defy anybody to say that any of these women did not deserve to be appointed.  This is not the case.</P>
    <P>I had no interest in the political affiliation of any member of this Authority. Indeed, I would have been happier if no reference had been made to it.  I know for sure that there is no comhairle ceanntar member on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>I suspect that if one went through the voting pattern of the Authority, it would be a varied one.  My only interest was in the calibre of the people selected.  I am confident they will do a good job for the industry.  If they do not succeed, it will be me, as Minister, who will suffer because I appointed them and I will stand over it.  As the person representing the taxpayer, who contributes two-thirds of the total revenue to the industry, I am entitled to a choice in the matter; I am as entitled to have as subjective a choice as any commentator or scribe.  The responsibility for this industry will lie on my shoulders and I hope this will be the case for some time to come.  I certainly look forward to the further development of this industry.  It is already at a high standard of development here.  Not alone do I have the responsibility on behalf of the taxpayers and the Government, but I enjoy the sport.  I have a personal and vested interest in ensuring that there will be more varied facilities available when I have more leisure time on my hands, to continue to enjoy horseracing for many years to come.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Orders of the House, the time limits for the debate on the motion are that the Minister has 15 minutes, the proposer of the motion has 12 minutes, other speakers have eight minutes and the proposer, or another Member nominated by him, has five minutes to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad …ireann, recognising that the Defence Forces are considerably below full operational strength and noting the huge interest in the recent Army recruitment programme in which only 500 recruits were enrolled, calls on the Government to provide for an annual recruitment programme.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending the House this evening to debate the motion. I tabled the motion because for the past number of months I was, like all public representatives, ambushed by many disappointed young people who are anxious to join the Defence Forces.  The figures speak for themselves.  Approximately 9,000 people applied to join the Defence Forces during the last recruitment drive. This was the first recruitment drive of any consideration held for at least four to five years, a situation which has caused enormous problems within the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These problems have been spelt out on many occasions by people in the Army as there is now a huge age gap.  A comparison may be made with the Irish soccer team.  If the manager of the team had not <Col N="1721" /> introduced new people &mdash; who performed well last night &mdash; on to the panel, the team would have been in trouble. Similarly with the Army; if it is to work as a team new blood must be introduced on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>This is one reason the motion is so important, and I believe it will be accepted by the House in the spirit in which it was put down.  The motion is an asset to the Minister who, in fairness, has gone to considerable lengths to address this issue but has not obtained the necessary funding which was not forthcoming from the Government.  Indeed, the Minister emphasised that he pulled off what he believed to be something of a coup by obtaining a commitment from the Government to proceed with the recruitment of 500 people to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>This reinforces the gravity of the present position.  This commitment from his colleagues in Government to agree to this measure is an example of the way the Government has treated the Army and the Defence Forces.  It has resulted in a crisis not only in the Army but also in the Navy.  Indeed, the Navy is unable to cope with its obligations.  Furthermore, the introduction of the new fisheries regulations mean there will be increased demands on the Navy which will require extra vessels and personnel.  The extra personnel must be trained, which takes time, but the Government is doing very little about that.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a huge drug problem afflicting the country. Many of the drugs come into the country by sea.  The Navy can play a role in tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>Criticism of the Navy was made by those in the fisheries industry.  The Navy defended its position by stating that it understood why those in the industry were annoyed and concerned.  However, the buck did not rest with them but elsewhere and it was carrying out its duties to the best of its ability, within the limited means and personnel available.  That is just one example of where our Defence Forces are going and that is why there is an emergency &mdash; and there is no other <Col N="1722" /> way to describe it.  In bringing forward this motion, I hope the Minister will increase the number of Defence Forces' personnel and update equipment, and be prepared for the next step.  Things are changing radically in all aspects of life, but especially within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In the not too distant past in the midlands the Army was called out to assist the Garda after an arms find.  The area had to be cordoned off and we had 24-hour security for weeks.  The Army, with the Garda, played a major role in that operation.  I have no doubt that the members of the Government are serious about combating terrorism but we must bear in mind that there is still a lot of ammunition in this country which is unaccounted for.  The Army can play a major role there too.</P>
    <P>The efficiency audit group is a development which will be awaited with interest to see how it will affect the Army and the security forces in general.  I hope the Government will see this as an opportunity to move on by streamlining and developing the Army and making it more efficient.  However, that should not be done by reducing personnel, which seems to be the idea now.  I hope the opposite will happen.  As I said in my opening remarks, 9,000 young people were anxious to get into the Defence Forces and the majority of them were suitable for the job but they were disappointed. Apart from the fact that they wanted employment and that the Army is a healthy life, they also wanted to make an input into the security and future of their own State.  It is disappointing that such an opportunity, which has not been there for years, is there now but only on a limited basis.  The Minister announced yesterday that he is taking on 500 recruits.  I do not know whether that is the same 500.</P>

      <P>The Minister has persuaded his colleagues in Government that there is a crisis.  Many problems arising from vandalism and crime could be <Col N="1723" /> better dealt with if members of the Defence Forces lived in certain urban areas.  I know from experience that many such people have organised boxing clubs and other youth activities in their leisure time.  They have a sense of responsibility to the State.  It is most unfortunate that the Army has been allowed to deteriorate in numbers at a time when so many people are anxious to join.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that my motion has been opposed, I hope the Minister will have something optimistic and newsworthy to say, other than announcing 500 recruits who are already on the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am looking forward to the discussion and to his response and overview of the situation.  I live in a Border county where public representatives and the public themselves see the Army in action and tend to know more about its day to day activities than most people, other than the Minister and his staff. My own view, which is shared by most people, is that the Army is doing a wonderful job in support of the Garda in the Border areas.  We are conscious that, from time to time, morale is not very high.  Because they are more or less a secondary force and act only in support of the Garda, Army personnel feel they are looked on as a secondary force in every sense and do not get the support they deserve.  That feeling has arisen along the Border in particular because of the kind of duties they have to perform 24 hours a day in all sorts of weather. Last winter must have been terrible for Army personnel who were out in wet, cold vicious conditions day after day, week after week, looking after the interests of those who live along the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Army personnel have been complaining for a long time about the mealy mouthed attitude of the Minister in relation to the Border allowance.  Having visited the Army barracks in Castleblaney, County Monaghan, from time to time, and from talking to friends of mine who are in the Army, I know they <Col N="1724" /> are not satisfied with the current situation. The age profile of the Force has been allowed to creep upwards.  Anybody in an Army who feels that it is gradually growing into a Dad's Army, is not happy and morale is not of the highest calibre. The Minister would do well to recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister has decided to recruit 500 people but, compared to the number needed, that is only a drop in the ocean, and it appears to be a once off.  I have not seen any evidence that it is part of a medium or long term strategy for the Army.  I am waiting for the Minister to give us his view on that.  There should be a long term strategy.  Those of us who live along the Border are aware that the intelligence gathering service is in a crucial situation at the moment.  Many people are afraid for their lives. Recently, the business people of Dublin were brought together for discussions with the Garda about how to handle a situation where bombs are being planted. That was reported in the newspapers and everyone who read it drew their own conclusions.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I spoke to people on their way to their local pub to watch the match. They were concerned that somebody might come in to the pub with a gun and blow a number of them away as happened in the Loughinisland disaster.  It was never more important than in recent times for the Army to be in good shape, for morale to be high and for it to be mobile.  There is a feeling that we are in for a difficult period, not just in the Border counties but elsewhere also.</P>
    <P>I have the highest regard for the way in which the Army and the Garda have handled the situation to date, although I do not wish to be specific because it is better not to be.  They have been most successful in their duties along the Border in preventing acts of terrorism which could easily have occurred if they were not vigilant.  There are a number of cases with which I am most familiar and people's lives were saved by the vigilance of the Garda and the Army in support of the Garda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> For years the Army has been considered a fine career.  I taught in a secondary school before I entered this House and I gave some career guidance in the days before it was fashionable to do so.  The Army was always high on people's agenda.  Parents looked upon Army training as a good and character forming experience for young people. The fact that 9,000 people applied during the recent recruitment campaign underlines the point that the Army is still considered a good career.  The shame is that this type of renewal is not ongoing on a regular basis and that the career opportunities are virtually nil.  For example, 8,500 people who wanted to be in the Army were prevented from doing so, although the unemployment situation is driving more than those people who want a career in the Army in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the privates in the Army of whom I know see their position as a career.  They are very committed to their jobs and maintain a high level of fitness in their spare time.  One sees them cycling and running when they are off duty.  There is great commitment and they are proud to be in the Army, even though there are difficulties which tend to make them feel undervalued. However, they feel that they are doing something for their country.  We are proud of them when they undertake United Nations duty abroad.  They do a wonderful job on our behalf.</P>
    <P>We need a long term plan for the Army.  The 500 people who will be taken on this year should have opportunities for training and personal and career development within the Army.  I understand that they will not have these opportunities. They will spend five years in the Army and come out without gathering further skills other than routine Army training.  That is not correct.  Most of the recruits are young people, just out of secondary school, who would be in a position to use opportunities for specific training within the Army.  It is a pity that is not available to them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine this matter and to give the House his insights into the long term development of the <Col N="1726" /> Army, not just in terms of a stop gap. There is a furore about the fact that 500 will be recruited this year but there are concerns that we will drift into the next decade without taking any more people on.  There will be natural wastage, decreasing numbers and morale problems as a result.  That is not good, given the crucial times in which we live.</P>
    <P>I give the Minister my best wishes for the task that faces him.  He has made some progress during his time in office to date.  It is a difficult area in that the Government, in my view, do not share the Minister's view that the Army requires money or that the level of funds the Minister believes is required is necessary. The Minister has a difficult job to do and I wish him the best of luck.  I look forward to hearing his medium and long term plans for the development of the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad …ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the recent enlistment of 500 new recruits in the Permanent Defence Force; and is satisfied that the Government are taking all necessary steps to ensure the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are fully met.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate him on his initiative in undertaking the new recruitment campaign. I understand that almost all of the 500 personnel have been recruited at this stage, with approximately 420 recruits to the Army and Air Corps and approximately 80 to the Naval Service.  This is a most welcome development which will assist in making the Permanent Defence Forces better organised and more efficient in providing a continuing excellent service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for a period, I dealt with the Defence Forces and I am aware of the esteem in which the people of this country hold the Defence Forces.  That esteem is well earned.  When one travels all over the world to any place in which <Col N="1727" /> the United Nations personnel have been in operation on peace-keeping missions or otherwise, one finds that the leaders of ordinary communities, whether in the Lebanon or elsewhere, have high praise for the dedication and goodwill of Irish personnel overseas.  On behalf of the House, I express appreciation to all sections of the Permanent Defence Forces and the Department for the manner in which they have carried out their duties with distinction and honour over the years.</P>
    <P>The fundamental role of the Permanent Defence Forces had not changed to any large extent up to September last year.  This role includes aiding the civil power, involvement in the United Nations peace-keeping missions and the search and rescue service and the operation of a Naval Service, providing protection for a most important economic fisheries zone.  These are just a few of the areas covered by the Army, the Naval and Air Corps Services.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson report, published some time ago, dealt to a large extent with pay and conditions issues within the Permanent Defence Forces.  It also indicated a number of shortcomings, one of which was the necessity to utilise trained personnel in the Army and Naval and Air Corps Services for those type of operational duties.  In the main, it would be fair to say that the Gleeson report was critical of the fact that so much of the time of trained personnel was taken up by administrative responsibilities and dealing with day to day technical administrative requirements.  An efficiency audit was established to look at the whole area and it carried out a thorough examination of the Department of Defence.  It made certain recommendations in relation to the giving over of responsibility, especially in the financial management area, to senior personnel in the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>This report, which received quite an amount of publicity at the time, was only half the required effort.  It was important that an efficiency audit of the Permanent Defence Forces was also carried out to <Col N="1728" /> see where duplication may have been occurring so as to get an overall balanced view of the requirements and to ensure, if there was to be reorganisation and redefinition of roles, that it would be done with the full knowledge and guidance of a carefully planned strategy.  This would take the Gleeson report and what emerged in the efficiency audit of the Department into account, in addition to the efficiency audit of the Permanent Defence Forces which is now taking place.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge, the efficiency audit is working at present on the Permanent Defence Forces and will probably submit a report to the Minister later this year.  At that stage the Minister will have good guidelines as to what will be necessary to deal with the shortcomings identified in the Gleeson report and putting in place a new dynamic structure which will ensure that we undertake the decided mandate.  It will also ensure that this is done in the most efficient and productive way.</P>
    <P>It is also important not to neglect the necessity of keeping a pool of skilled and trained personnel available to the Defence Forces.  This is why I welcome the recent announcement of the recruitment of Army apprentices.  In addition to the development of technological skills, it will be vitally necessary in the future to have skilled personnel available to both the Air Corps and the Naval Service to deal with modern and sophisticated developments that are taking place in technology, engineering, etc.  In my view the Army Apprenticeship School has been very effective in producing highly skilled and trained personnel for the whole service.</P>
    <P>A private search and rescue service was recently established in Shannon to replace that previously provided by the Air Corps.  When the new service was put in place many of the technical and professional people required to operate it had to be brought in from overseas. Many of them came from the United Kingdom.  We did not have in Ireland the trained and skilled personnel to operate a private search and rescue service.  The <Col N="1729" /> Air Corps in particular must pay attention to this.  I welcome its recruitment drive, by which it plans to increase its intake of young engineers and technicians. In spite of its present difficulties, there are indications of an upturn in the aviation business and there is a danger of a serious shortage of highly skilled professional and technical people.  I would like to see further attention paid to this.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter spoke about the deployment of personnel on security duties in Border areas.  All of us would like to see the day when it would be possible to withdraw some of these personnel and I support the efforts of the Minister and the Government to establish peace in Northern Ireland, which would mean that eventually there could be a scaling down of this security operation. Last year Border duty allowances amounted to about £3.5 million, and this is at a time when there are severe restrictions on the finances of every area of Government operation.  Some £400 million a year is spent by the Department of Defence and the Permanent Defence Force.  This is a sizeable amount and there is a necessity to ensure that in looking at new developments in the area we make every possible effort to avoid duplication and get the best possible value for money.</P>
    <P>The role of the Army may well change. Changes in international politics, such as the ending of the Cold War and the changes which are taking place in Europe, may mean that the Army will have to face new challenges and a new role in the future.  I congratulate the Minister on the effort he has made to date to modernise, streamline and recruit more people to the Army.  I urge him to continue along this line, which is worthwhile and meaningful for the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews) Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Belton for giving me the opportunity of addressing this august assembly on the matter of recruitment. I thought it was appropriate, in anticipation of his contribution, to table <Col N="1730" /> an amendment, which I think is reasonable. It states that Seanad …ireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>notes the recent enlistment of 500 new recruits in the Permanent Defence Force; and is satisfied that the Government are taking all necessary steps to ensure the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are fully met.</P>
      <P>As the Senator properly pointed out, this is the first time in four years &mdash; I intend no disrespect to or diminution of my predecessors &mdash; that such a recruitment drive was initiated.  The Government decided earlier this year that the 500 new personnel would be recruited on five year contracts.  After discussions with PDFORRA, the contract period was increased from three to five years and the maximum recruiting age was to be 27. In these circumstances the recruitment drive was initiated.  As the Senator pointed out, about 9,000 or 10,000 people applied for 500 places.  This might not necessarily indicate a desire to join the Defence Forces, but I would like to think that it does.  It probably reflected the unemployment figure, which is around 270,00 at the moment.  I think the majority of those who applied were most genuinely anxious to join the Defences Forces, which is an outstanding unit of our society.</P>
      <P>I have been Minister for Defence for 15 or 16 months.  Like Senator Daly, who was an incumbent of that office for a period, I am proud to be associated with the Defence Forces and I have seen them operate at first hand at home and abroad. As Senator Belton said and Senator Cotter agreed, we should be justly proud of the role they play.  It is appropriate as an island nation that we should deploy our Defence Forces as widely as possible. There are currently about 13,000 people in the Defence Forces, which includes the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A little over a year ago, as Senator Daly pointed out, the Government decided to undertake a major initiative to prepare the Defence Forces for the years ahead.  As a first step the roles of the Defence Forces, which had remained unchanged since 1981, were updated to <Col N="1731" /> take account of the realities of the 1990s. The stated primary role &mdash; defence against external aggression &mdash; had begun to look increasingly incongruous in the light of both the changed international environment, as Senator Daly said, and the day to day work of the Defence Forces.  The Government approved a revised statement of roles for the Defence Forces in September 1993.  Their operational roles have remained fundamentally unchanged, reflecting the tasks undertaken by the Defence Forces on a day to day basis, and may now be broadly expressed as follows: to aid the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda SÌoch·na &mdash; the Garda and the Defence Forces have a close liaison and co-operate closely &mdash; who have the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State; to participate in United Nations missions in the cause of international peace; to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union; and to carry out such other duties as may be assigned to them from time to time &mdash; for example, search and rescue, an air ambulance service and a ministerial air transport service, which is a very important function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As a second stage in the review process, the Government requested the efficiency audit group to undertake a fundamental review of the organisation, structures and deployment of the Defence Forces, based on the revision of the roles.  This is the proper and appropriate process in the circumstances of the needs of a modern army, particularly its requirements for the future, as Senator Daly pointed out. As we know, there will be an intergovernmental conference in 1996 on the whole area of security.  In that and other contexts we are modernising an outstanding organisation which has given <Col N="1732" /> wonderful service since the foundation of the State.  The consultants commenced work in January and are expected to report to the efficiency audit group in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>The range of issues to be considered by the consultants are not new.  The Gleeson report, published in 1990 and which dealt with pay matters principally, identified a number of shortcomings in the present organisation of the Defence Forces.  In particular, the report highlighted the excessive number of trained military personnel working in administrative and support areas and suggested, not unreasonably, that there might be scope for the elimination of duplication within the military organisation.  There is also the need to take a fundamental look at the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces with a view to ensuring that they are focused on operational tasks and that maximum use is made of their most valuable resource &mdash; trained personnel.</P>
      <P>Reform and reorganisation are necessary, not only to provide increased efficiency and correctness &mdash; they are also a positive development for those who choose a career in the Defence Forces. We are very proud that young men and women choose a career in the Defence Forces.  It is a matter of concern, as expressed by the Senators generally, that the opportunity may not be there on a consistent basis.  It is my intention, in my portfolio as Minister for Defence, to make every effort to ensure that there is continuity of intake.  I cannot say whether that will be a fact as it is a matter for the Government.  However, it is my wish and desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the report of the efficiency audit group in not yet available, it is likely that its conclusions will provide the basis for a long-term programme of change and development for the Defence Forces.  I wish to make clear that the emphasis of any programme adopted by the Government will be on enhancing the effectiveness of the military organisation to perform the important roles assigned to it by the Government.  Having been given a clear statement of roles, the review <Col N="1733" /> process is designed to ensure that the Defence Forces will be provided with the appropriate means to carry them out.  I wish to assure Senator Belton that this is not a cost cutting exercise.  The intention is to obtain optimum benefit from the use of resources.</P>
    <P>As Senator Daly pointed out, financial delegation has already taken place.  The Government has approved the implementation of proposals to give greater financial authority to the military authorities; control and responsibility for seven subheads in the procurement area have been assigned to the military authorities with effect from January of this year.  The question of delegating additional subheads to the military authorities will be addressed in the light of experience gained in 1994 and the forthcoming EAG report.</P>
    <P>To address the substantive issue, earlier this year I was very pleased to be in a position to announce a recruitment drive for the Permanent Defence Force. Five hundred personnel are almost enlisted &mdash; 420 to the Army and Air Corps and 80 to the Naval Service.  These recruits are being enlisted for a fixed period, extended from three to five years following discussions with the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA. They will receive pay and allowances on exactly the same basis as existing personnel. They will also have the same opportunities to undergo training courses and to serve overseas.  The cost of the first year's service of a new recruit is now about £14,300, rising to approximately £16,000 in the second year.  It is estimated that in a full year the cost of the 500 new recruits will amount to almost £8 million. The fixed term contracts will allow greater scope for regular intakes of new recruits and thus contribute considerably to what Senator Belton has asked for which is a lowering of the age profile of non-commissioned personnel.</P>
    <P>The majority of the 500 new recruits have already been enlisted with a balance of about 50 due to be enlisted next month.  I wish to make it clear to Senator Belton and to others that the Government <Col N="1734" /> would like to increase that figure on an annual basis.  However, the realties have to be taken into account.  This latter figure is comprised mainly of individuals who were completing the Leaving Certificate and of replacements for individuals who had been enlisted but were found to be not up to the required standard, which properly is very high. Approximately 64 per cent of the new recruits were members of the FCA.</P>
    <P>With the completion of the current intake, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force will be upwards of 13,000 all ranks, which bears very favourable comparison with the strength figure for the past five of six years.  The strength figure for the FCA as of 31 December 1993, was about 16,000.  A number of personnel, selected before the end of the five year term, will be given the option of a further period of service in the Permanent Defence Force.  A decision regarding the number to be given the option of extending their service will be made nearer that time.  Therefore, it is not a once off recruitment as some of the 500 will be given an opportunity to continue.</P>
    <P>The criteria for selecting personnel in the service are laid down in Defence Force regulations and will be based on such matters as conduct rating, physical fitness, medical category and successful completion of appropriate military courses of instruction.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator Taylor-Quinn has articulated from time to time the need to recruit women into all areas of the public service.  I think that I have for the first time in the recent past &mdash; I am sure that Senator Daly will correct me in this regard &mdash; addressed the question of the selection of women to the three services &mdash; the Army, Navy and Air Corps.  Of the 420 personnel being selected for the Army, 58 are women.  This might be a source of pleasure for Senator Taylor-Quinn because I know that she has been pressing this cause for a considerable length of time.</P>

      <P>I have given the Senator the good news and now I have to give her what she might consider to be bad news, although I do not consider it to be such. In assessing the suitability of applicants, women were considered on an equal basis with men; the basis of the selection was suitability rather than gender.  The Senator might find fault with that latter requirement but I think that it is the proper approach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not be after me tomorrow.  I did not select them.  I am just saying how it is.  I kept the recruitment at arm's length, as the Senator can appreciate.  Having regard to the need for transparency and openness, I had nothing to do with the recruitment.  The <Col N="1736" /> Government said that 500 people should be recruited and it was then a matter for the recruitment boards to decide who was taken into the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>There will be an intake of 60 apprentices this year for the Army and Air Corps Apprentice Schools.  Recently Senators will have seen advertisements inviting applications for the 1994 intake of cadets. The exact number to be appointed is being discussed at present.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly, arising out of his experience as a former Minister for Defence, very generously paid tribute to the overseas service of the Defence Forces.  As Minister for Defence, I stress the need to appreciate the magnificent service given by the Defence Forces since they undertook overseas duties for the first time in 1958.  They have served with great honour and dedication in many locations throughout the world.  Sometimes they do not receive sufficient recognition for the work they have done, although that is not true of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Members of both Houses are well aware of and appreciate the dedication and commitment of the Defence Forces to international peace.  Whether they are in Lebanon, Somalia or elsewhere, they act as diplomats in the best sense of the word.</P>
      <P>The Government remain committed to the principle of military participation in UN operations in the cause of international peace.  The Government have been concentrating on the safety of troops in the service of international peace, which is fundamental and of paramount importance.  It is an overriding consideration.  This commitment will continue, representing as it does a practical and exemplary manifestation of our support for the highest ideals of the United Nations.  At present there are approximately 830 members of the PDF serving overseas in various United Nations and European Union missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Naval Service have been very effective in the area of fishery protection and in aid to the civil authorities in combating the illegal importation of drugs. This again is an area where the Garda and the Navy co-operate in the strongest possible fashion.  They have had successes <Col N="1737" /> in the recent past.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, is seeking additional equipment for this type of detail and we will be glad to participate in any programme she proposes. The Navy are in possession of seven all-weather patrol vessels and with a current strength of more than 1,000 are well equipped to discharge their demanding duties.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps are also involved in fishery protection.  In addition they perform a vitally important function in search and rescue, air ambulance, security operations and from time to time assist in non-military operations, such as the relief of distress in emergency situations arising from natural disasters.  The present strength of the Air Corps is just over 100.  Like the Naval Service they operate in the most appalling conditions from time to time and are people of extraordinary courage.  They have proven time and again that they are willing to go into areas which the normal mortal would not even contemplate.  I must pay great respect to the courage of the Naval Service and the Air Corps for the type of work they do, particularly in the sea and air rescue services.</P>
    <P>Much is happening in the Defence Forces.  Reforms take time, but the process of change has begun.  The Government are convinced that at the end of the process the Permanent Defence Forces will be better structured and organised to meet their new roles in an effective and efficient manner.  I would like to make it clear that RACO and PDFORRA have had a strong input into the development of their organisations over the following decades.  The current recruitment campaign is an inherent part of the strategy to develop the PDF.  In the light of what I have said I strongly commend to the House the amendment to the motion.  I thank the Senators who have contributed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister and I thank him for his contribution.  There was little in it to which I would take exception.  He made the point at the outset that the <Col N="1738" /> amendment was a reasonable one.  The motion is also quite reasonable and I do not see the difficulty the Government had about accepting it.  All the motion asks for is an annual recruitment programme; it does not say that there has to be 500 recruits.  I do not see the difficulty about accepting the motion.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that there was such a large number of applicants for 500 places in the Army.  The Minister suggested that between 9,000 and 10,000 people applied.  It reflects the unemployment situation in the country.  If that is the case, there are sound arguments for recruiting a large number of people on an annual basis.  It is far better for the State to invest its money in training military personnel than in sustaining people on the dole.  That would strike me as a much more productive investment.</P>
      <P>I live very close to the Curragh in County Kildare and grew up surrounded by military personnel.  I can attest to the benefits which the Army brings to people in terms of their personal, social and other skills.  It definitely has a beneficial effect on people at every level, from the lowest private to the most senior officer. It is quite easy to spot those who served in the Army.  There is something about their bearing and demeanour which characterises them as Army or ex-Army personnel.</P>
      <P>The Army have made a huge contribution. This is not just in terms of their peace keeping and other duties for which we have all praised them and of which we are all proud.  They have also made a remarkable contribution to the societies in which they live.  The Army and ex-Army personnel in the area in which I live have had a huge input into the society in terms of the voluntary bodies to which they belong and contribute and the other activities in which they participate.  They make a very valuable contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is concern about the establishment strength of the Army.  There are senior Army officers who are concerned about the fact that people come off duty in squads and have to turn around and go back on duty.  I do not know whether that is happening now, but it was certainly <Col N="1739" /> happening about a year ago.  It is undesirable that people should come off duty and immediately have to turn around and go back out on duty.</P>
    <P>The standard of accommodation provided for residents in the Curragh Camp is deficient.  It is unfortunate that young people must live in such conditions.  They may have been good enough for a Victorian army but they are not good enough for modern society.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the efficiency audit group and the involvement of the Price Waterhouse consultants and said he hopes the report will be available next month.  I hope Members of the Oireachtas will see that report.  RACO and PDFORRA would like to see the report as would the general public.  It must be a matter of serious concern to us that the age profile of our Army is, by international standards, very high and appears to be getting older.  It is recognised that soldiering is a young person's activity and that an army must have young soldiers to be effective.  In that context I welcome the recruitment of 500 personnel.  However, more must be done to bring the Army to a more realistic established strength.</P>
    <P>The shortage of junior officers must be addressed.  There is also the so-called &ldquo;hump&rdquo;, a problem with which the Minister will be familiar from his discussions with the representative associations.  As a result of the high intake of officers some years ago the promotion prospects for some people have been seriously damaged. That causes problems in morale and in other areas.</P>
    <P>The question of funding for the Army is central.  Money for the Army is money well spent.  It benefits society, it takes people off the dole and it enhances our international profile.  We take pride in the achievements of our Defence Forces on international duties with the UN.  It would help enormously if the UN paid its debts.  However, it is work we should do, irrespective of whether the UN pays its debts on time.  That work benefits the country.  The merit of our Defence Forces <Col N="1740" /> on service abroad relative to those of other countries is not stated often enough.  Senior personnel in the UN would readily agree that the calibre and ability of the Irish soldier is frequently superior to that of the soldiers of other, perhaps more prominent, powers.  That is something of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the report of the efficiency audit group.  It made recommendations for the Department of Defence and I am not sure they were implemented to the extent anticipated at the time.  There was talk about cutbacks in the Department but I do not know their extent.  I hope the reports of the efficiency audit group and the consultants will show how the Army can become an efficient and modern army.  I do not subscribe to the proposition that we do not need an army.  We have an absolute need for an army.  The Army's role is changing and the Minister has referred to the implications of the interGovernmental conference in 1996.  I hope the Army will be funded and supported properly by the Government and that its role will be defended and expanded in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. The agreement to provide the Air Corps with blue uniforms is long overdue.  The uniform establishes an <i>esprit de corps</i> within the group and that is extremely important.  The Naval Service has a certain <i>Èlan</i> and I welcome the fact that the Air Corps will have its own distinctive uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I looked at one of the Irish Navy ships.  Nobody can say that the Naval Forces have the best equipment. It was a patched rubber rescue craft and my immediate thought was that the Navy could do with some funding.  The Department of Finance, when it is under pressure, appears to look on the Department of Defence as a soft target.  It is only since the Army achieved its current profile &mdash; UN service contributed enormously to the Army's standing and how it is perceived by the general public &mdash; that the Department of Finance has eased back a little.  It is no small achievement to secure <Col N="1741" /> the money required to recruit 500 people to the Defence Forces.  All politicians know how difficult it is to make the Department of Finance see the wisdom of a proposition which involves spending money.  I congratulate the Minister and the Department for securing that funding.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the sentiments expressed in the amendment.  As Senator Dardis said, it is good sense to recruit personnel annually, particularly in times of high unemployment.  However, there is also a danger, however, that we could fall into the trap of ageism.  We are not recruiting soldiers to attack a neighbouring island.  There is plenty of work in the Defence Forces which demands experience and shrewdness rather than agility and speed.  We must have a balance. The intake of 500 recruits will achieve the necessary decrease in the age profile but we must maintain balance.  We cannot throw people on the scrapheap at 45 or 50 years of age.  There is an important human element involved.  The variety of duties undertaken by the Defence Forces &mdash; which include UN duties, Border duties, prison duties and providing cash escorts &mdash; obviously places enormous strain on members.  We must maintain numbers and if we can do so by a regular intake of recruits, I would welcome that development.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator Taylor-Quinn took pleasure from the fact that 16 per cent of the total number of applicants were women and that they secured 14 per cent of the places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They got 7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair percentage. It is good that people of both sexes can apply for the Defence Forces and are treated equally.  That is as it should be.  I am sure Senator Taylor-Quinn was pleased with the Minister's remarks on the equality issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the ongoing re-equipping of the Defence Forces, the changed role of the PDF demands equipment that is constantly upgraded.  I hope such <Col N="1742" /> equipment can be provided.  I congratulate the Minister on the success of the recruitment drive.  I am not surprised so many people applied for the jobs. They are prestige jobs now.  I am also delighted that 64 per cent of the applicants were members of the FCA.  These are youngsters who give up their free time and go to annual camp for very little money.  I am delighted they are being recognised as ideal recruits.  I presume the same is true of the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has explained his case I am sure Fine Gael will withdraw the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hopeful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House; he is a good Minister for Defence and could be a good Minister in any Department.  While I agree with Senator Magner that it is an achievement to secure £8 million from the Department of Finance for the additional recruits, because the Government is not taking defence issues seriously we will not withdraw the motion, although the Minister is doing everything he can within Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I too am pleased that more than 64 per cent of those recruited were from the FCA.  That shows that these recruits have a genuine interest and a commitment to the Army.  It also encourages other young people to join the FCA at local level.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister said in the House that I, as a female Member, should be thankful that women are now being treated on an equal basis, not simply on gender but on suitability. Women are equal, competent and on balance better equipped to serve in the Irish Army than the male population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a savage attack on men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Magner's calculations are wrong; the number of women recruited in the new intake is 7 per cent rather than 14 per cent.  That was the figure in the Minister's speech also, but I think it is wrong. <Col N="1743" /> Nevertheless the female intake is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I take responsibility for the error, if it is an error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One figure the Minister did not give was the number of women who applied.  That would give an overall picture of the percentage of women who replied who were recruited. I do not know whether there was a reason for leaving out that figure.</P>
      <P>The statement on the role of the Army is welcome; it is interesting to see this was done because of the need for modernisation. However, the Minister excluded specific reference to the involvement of the Irish Army in EU affairs.  In 1996 we will have an intergovernmental conference on European security and defence and this was an opportunity for the Minister to put on record his view of the Irish Army's role in this matter.  Our Labour colleague, Senator Magner, has raised his eyes to heaven because the Minister for Foreign Affairs is a member of his party.</P>
      <P>It is time Fianna F·il and Labour stopped pussy-footing around and discussed the issue openly with the people rather than behind our backs.  The Irish are an intelligent people and everyone knows there is much closer co-operation and contact between the European armies at present.  The Minister has brought in management consultants, auditors and other experts but he has also called on personnel from other European armies for the efficiency audit being carried out at present.</P>
      <P>We should admit this is happening and not try to hide it.  We should mature politically on this issue.  The Minister did not take the opportunity to put this on the record this evening.  However, surely he will take the next opportunity to elaborate on what he sees as the role of the Irish Army in future European security and defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taken an international role in peacekeeping over the years by serving on UN peace missions.  As was said earlier, <Col N="1744" /> our troops abroad have been excellent ambassadors and ambassadresses for Ireland wherever they served.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can shed light on the establishment of the United Nations school, which I pursued some years ago. Since we have considerable expertise and skills and widespread international acceptance in UN peacekeeping I pushed the idea of the school.  I read some time ago that this had been established by the Minister and I ask him to let us know what work is being done in that school and how it is developing.</P>
    <P>The Minister barely touched on the important area of fisheries protection and the supply of vessels to the Navy, and I can understand why he did not.  He referred to drug detection.  That problem is becoming very serious around the west coast.  Increasingly there are reports from a variety of sources about these activities. No matter how many boats the Naval Service has it will not be in a position to do the necessary detective work.  It should be publicly highlighted that all seafaring people should report unusual activities off our west and south-west coasts.  We must be far more vigilant and make more equipment and facilities available to both the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice so they can stop this racketeering.  Most Members would recognise that need.</P>
    <P>The search and rescue service in Shannon is extremely important.  As Senator Daly said, much of the expertise for that service came from abroad.  It has worked extremely well in conjuction with the Army but if the Army had the proper equipment and facilities it would be in a position to provide that service.  That should be addressed by the Government and the service should be further upgraded and developed.  Not only will this provide an ambulance and rescue service, it will also provide a detection service for illegal drug activity around our coasts.</P>
    <P>PDFORRA and RACO, the two representative organisations within the Army, have done great work for their respective groups and I am pleased to see a good relationship between the replen <Col N="1745" /> resentative bodies and the Minister and his Department.  Because of various problems, there was a real need for the establishment of both organisations.  One hopes the public image of the Army will continue to improve, especially if a Minister with the competence and panache of Deputy Andrews remains in this portfolio.</P>
    <P>The Government should put more money into the Army and recruit more soldiers.  The recruitment of 500 new people does not even make up a full battalion.  The Minister has an opportunity to put another argument to Government; this was mentioned by Senator Dardis.  Since so many young people want to join the Army, we could provide another battalion to the UN.  If the cost was met by the UN and the reduction in social welfare costs was taken into account, a net gain would be made.  When the next Estimates discussions take place in November the Minister could put this argument to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the opportunity to comment on the motion and the amendment.  The Minister has clearly shown he is aware of the needs of the nation and of the Army.  I know the value of the Army because I come from a Border region where the Army is called on to give a service to the people of this country.  That is an excellent service, but those who contributed to this debate do not understand that the Defence Forces in this small country cost approximately £1 million a day, which is a substantial amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would like to say that he will accommodate those 10,000 young people seeking to join the Defence Force, many of whom are highly qualified. I am certain the Minister knows this would be desirable.  However, there must be a limit to the size of the Army and the Garda SÌoch·na and it must be in proportion to the size of the country. However, the Army has shown an excellent example of its fairness and diplomacy while on duty as peace-keepers throughout the world.  I am pleased about this because many of the people in the Army <Col N="1746" /> come from my part of the country and I see at first hand the contribution they make.  I am also pleased the Minister informed the House about the high percentage of recruits which coming from the Civil Defence because there is a perception that they were overlooked or excluded.  I am pleased the motion has done this.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the part of the motion which reads: &ldquo;That Seanad …ireann, recognising that the Defence Forces are considerably below full operational strength...&rdquo;.  Who would be the best judge of &ldquo;operational strength&rdquo; and what does it mean?  Does it mean we are ready to invade, or to defend the country against a major power?  The words &ldquo;operational strength&rdquo; can be bandied about and one can interpret them in different ways.  I am satisfied that the Minister is well informed and that the Defence Forces are the correct size and are well equipped.</P>
    <P>If there have been casualties in our peacekeeping forces, in a way it is because of the diplomacy, training and the morale of the Army personnel we send abroad.  They are a credit to us all and we should say this at every opportunity. But someone may lose their life as a result of diplomacy and training.  It is well known in Army circles that the person who shoots first is the person who has never been trained.  We have an excellent record in this area.  We recognise the standard and the quality of the Army.</P>
    <P>I hope I never see the day when we need a large Army in this country.  There are a number of young men who would like to join the Army, but there are as many who would like to join the Civil Service, and many of these are young, educated and trained people.  I live close to the problems on the island.  One cannot travel one mile without meeting a large number of people in uniforms.  I would like to see this deterrent removed. The barbed wire, the Army, the vehicles and the pointed guns are not conducive to the development of this country.  I hope we will never have to respond by increasing the Army.  It is the correct strength and I hope the Minister continues the recruitment, which is an excellent <Col N="1747" /> opportunity for young men.  The Minister has the balance right.  Everyone has their own interpretation of what the strategy should be, but the Minister is doing excellent work.  I am proud that in regard to the Army, he has the interests of the nation under control.  I compliment him for that.  He is doing a first class job and the Army is a credit to us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator McGowan, that the Minister is doing a first class job.  However, I wish he was Minister for Foreign Affairs because that would give me even greater pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Failing that, I am happy for him to occupy the position he does in the present Government.  I will comment on a couple of things in the Minister's speech and then address a few general remarks to the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister noted that the stated primary role &mdash; defence against external aggression &mdash; has begun to look increasingly incongruous in the light of a changed international environment in the day to day work of the Defence Forces. That is true.  The Army has a particular role.  It has never been directly engaged in warfare, certainly not aggressive warfare and scarcely even in defensive warfare in a major military conflict.  The role of the Army, in which we all take great pleasure, is the role of peacekeeping and monitoring of international troublesome areas.  It is important for us to emphasise this fact.  I consistently said, with regard to the so-called IRA, that the Irish Republican Army is a misnomer.  It has no right to describe itself in these terms and it befouls a name to which the citizens of the Irish Republic are entitled to claim for their Army, the Army of the Irish Republic, which has not been involved in outrages and in sectarian attacks and of which we can all be proud because of its international role in peacekeeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also notes that the role of the Defence Forces is to aid the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda SÌoch·na, who have the primary responsibility for <Col N="1748" /> law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State.  I would like to refer to something which I have not heard other speakers refer to, although they may have when I was out of the Chamber, and that is the significant and important role of the Army in policing the Border between the 26 counties and the six counties.  I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am greatly offended, as I believe many other people in this State are, by the continuous misrepresentation which occurs in the House of Commons and in the British media about the role of the Army and what is portrayed as a reluctance on the part of the Irish Republic to play its role and pay its share of the bill.  We do an extremely good job.  It costs this State a lot of money to police and patrol the Border and I salute the Defence Forces for the role they play in that important work.  I hope the Minister will take every opportunity to make this clear to the British authorities and media and to also indicate the increasing frustration of the people at this misrepresentation, which is so consistent in certain sections of the Tory controlled British press.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister said he was pleased to announce a recruitment drive. I also note that Senator Magner said he found it difficult to disagree with the idea of annual recruitment.  Perhaps there is an area of <i>rapprochement</i> between the two sides.  Speaking as an Independent, I would prefer if this did not come to a vote because it would be a pity if the Defence Forces, of whom we are all proud, became a matter of contention for political advantage between various parties in this State.  I hope it may be possible that the motion, as phrased, will be withdrawn so we will not have to vote on it, because it would be a pity to do so.</P>
    <P>I echo sentiments I heard earlier in the debate about the recruitment of women, because this is a good idea.  I recall some years ago, when I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, that there was still some remaining difficulties as regards the recruitment of women, to the Army band, in particular. I cannot remember why female musicians were not as welcome as male musicians.  It appears this situation has <Col N="1749" /> been ironed out.  I welcome attempts to seek a gender balance and the inclusion of women on the interview board.</P>
    <P>I refer to fisheries protection, which the Minister mentioned in his speech. This is not only a question for the Army, but for the Defence Forces &mdash; the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps.  I would like as many resources as possible to be made available for this.  As an island with a significant resource in terms of fish stocks, etc., we are vulnerable.  Before the Minister took office and before this Government came into being it would be a sustainable argument to maintain that in the negotiations with the EU part of our fishing stocks were bartered away. Invasion of our waters by Spanish and other trawlers continues.  I would like to see the fisheries protection element of the Defence Forces stepped up so that we will have the personnel and equipment to police our important fishing resources.</P>
    <P>Although I criticised certain elements of the British media, if we look at the use of air ambulances and air-sea rescue services, we can pay tribute to the co-operation which exists between our air-sea rescue services and those in the neighbouring island.  It is welcome that they co-operate so well.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the peacekeeping role of the Army, in particular, and the Garda SÌoch·na.  The question of serving with the United Nations is significant.  While we have more than played our role in this area, I do not believe we have been paid properly.  I understand &mdash; the Minister can confirm this &mdash; there are outstanding bills due to this country for work which has been done on behalf of the UN.  I do not blame the UN, but major nations which continually do not live up to their obligations and do not pay their bills.  The United States of America, the United Kingdom, the former Soviet Union, Germany and France do not really pay their bills and it is a continuing source of irritation.</P>
    <P>I attended the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting last autumn in Canberra, where I raised this issue.  Senior members of the UN attended that meeting and one of the more senior members in an opening speech spoke trenchantly on this issue and appealed for assistance in putting <Col N="1750" /> pressure on debtor nations so they would pay money which was owed.</P>
    <P>I refer to recruitment and operational strength.  While I would not like to think the Army was below operational strength, it is important that recruitment continues.  I am a member of a gym and there are a number of unemployed young men in that gym.  Many who would be excellent material applied for positions in the Defence Forces, but were turned down because of a lack of places.  This is good human material which would be economically efficient because we would not need to pay them dole.  It would provide them with good training and a good background.  I urge the Minister to continue the recruitment programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Army's approach and recent statements and developments with regard to sexual orientation and a code of behaviour which would be generally applicable.  I hope this code of behaviour will be made publicly available as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment that the Minister for Defence and the Government are taking all necessary steps to ensure that the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are met.  I do not believe the Opposition put their heart and soul into this motion but tabled it because it was their turn to do so.</P>
      <P>I have faith in the Army personnel, the Minister and the Government to provide an Army which is sufficient for our needs. What is a sufficient Army for our needs? Senator McGowan came close to it.  I would hate to see a day when we would need a large army like other EU countries. I would like an Army which is sufficient for our needs.  The Army covers a multitude of services and is available when something happens.  If there is a strike we look to the Army to transport people, for example.  If large sums of money need to be transferred from banks, the Army, along with the Garda SÌoch·na, provide protection.  The Army is there to do these jobs as well as the important job of Border duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the largest operation which the Army is involved in is peacekeeping overseas.  I understand approximately <Col N="1751" /> 1,000 people are working overseas for the EU and the UN in different missions throughout the world.  We must recognise that our peacekeeping forces have been of a high standard since they first went overseas in 1958.  We can only speak highly of the personnel in the Army and the Defence Forces generally.  Unfortunately, there have been tragedies and I sympathise with those who lost relatives, fathers and husbands, while on peacekeeping missions.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn should not make statements about coming clean and brushing matters aside.  What are we supposed to come clean about?  What are we brushing?  I do not know what we are trying to brush aside or on what we need to come clean.  She contradicted the Minister by saying his percentages were wrong.  As far as I am concerned, the Minister's percentages were correct.  If Senator Taylor-Quinn believes that 58 women out of 420 amounts to 17 per cent, the school I went to is wrong and so are my calculations, although the total is close to 17 per cent.  It is great that women have been recruited to the Army.  As Senator Taylor-Quinn said, they are well equipped for the job, even better equipped than some men.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps is doing a magnificent job, especially in relation to air-sea rescue.  The Naval Service is also doing a fabulous job in protecting sea fishing and in detecting drug smuggling along the coast.  I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn when she said drugs must be coming into this country somewhere.  I do not believe they are coming in by air, therefore they must be coming in by sea.  We should be vigilant as regards drugs coming into this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is the time or the place, but I was shocked recently when a spokesman for the fishing industry made rude and derogatory remarks about the Naval Service.  He should have withdrawn them.  I will not mention his name but everybody knows him.  I do not think he was supported by the fishing industry because there was not one word of support for him.  It was wrong of him to make those remarks and he should <Col N="1752" /> have withdrawn them immediately.  I have said enough about that.</P>
    <P>I spent five years in the FCA, or the LDF as it was known then.  Senator Neville is indicating that he did as well. They were great years.  They gave us a great education and a great outlook on life.  If we had the money in the morning I would like to see an upgrading of the FCA.  They provide great training.  When I was in the FCA the first lesson I learned was discipline and how to take orders. This lesson stayed with me all my life; my wife says I am fairly well disciplined as well.  The Army also taught us other things.  To be truthful I could not wait until we had our field day, as it was known then.  We were taught orienteering, mountaineering, rescue and first aid, etc. Of course we were taught how to use a gun.  I suppose that gave these young men the chance to see how good a shot they were.  I do not go in for that side of it too much.  The other side of the training was physical.  The FCA give top quality training. I have often wondered whether we should have compulsory service.  All young people should serve a certain amount of hours and they would learn a lot.</P>
    <P>I do not see any sense in the motion.  I am satisfied with what the Minister is doing.  I put my faith in him and his personnel.  He has a recruitment programme in progress and he said it would continue in 1994.  I look forward to that. I thank the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion I pay tribute to the Defence Forces for the excellent job they are doing.  They are a credit to the country, especially when they go abroad on peacekeeping missions.  The Defence Forces have a unique role in Irish society.  As an aid to the civil forces they are called upon to carry out different duties than those one would normally expect from a defence force in peace time.  They are not an army which takes and executes orders, they provide a security service aiding the civil forces and they are often in a position where they must make their own decisions.  The old command structure cannot be relied on in their circumstances. <Col N="1753" /> In that way they are asked to play a unique role.</P>
      <P>The motion which calls for ongoing recruitment to the Army is a worthy one and should be supported by everybody. The Minister referred to the ageing of the Army and said that an ongoing recruitment programme would reduce the age profile.  We can get too concerned about age profiles.  There is a hint of age discrimination there; the age profile is wrong if it gets too high.  I recognise what the Minister is saying in, we have not had recruitment for some time and that a more balanced age profile is more desirable.</P>
      <P>The Naval forces have a very important and a growing role, especially having regard to the changes in the fishing regulations and the presence of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets within the previous 12 mile limits.  This means there is a need for much more activity from the Naval Service.  It is important that the Naval Service is in a position to patrol our waters and ensure the survival of the fishing industry because if the fishing industry collapses &mdash; and there is some concern about that &mdash; there will be 18,000 jobs at stake.  Listening to what is happening outside the House at the moment, one must be always concerned about jobs.  The expansion and the proper equipping of the Naval Service to deal with any new situation must be a priority.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the 500 people recruited this year.  That is to be welcomed but we must be concerned about the changes in the conditions of employment of these people and the fact that they are now on five year contracts. I worry about that practice coming into the public sector.  We are now moving towards contracts because that is what has happened in private industry. Nobody has job security in the private sector at the moment.  The same career prospects are not available.  It was possible in the past to join the Army at the lowest level and go all the way to the top.  Now each member gets a five year contract and must look for another career after that.  That is unfortunate.  I wish the implications of this to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now, people in the Army had job security.  A soldier could have a <Col N="1754" /> career until his retirement, he could bring up a family, take on a mortgage and plan for the future.  That was a great advantage for people in the Army and it is unfortunate that, to a large extent, it is not available for new recruits.  I know that PDFORRA is extremely concerned about it.  Their president, Mr. Dermot Whelan, said that while the association is ready to welcome the Government's decision in this matter, it is not happy with the new approach.  He criticised the fact that the association was not consulted. The association feels that the careers, families and future members will be deeply affected by the new contracts arrangement.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Army and its members on the work it is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to overseas service by the Army, on Friday last I had the honour, as Chairman of Mallow Urban District Council, to attend a ceremony at Collins' Barracks, Cork, where an award was given by the Lebanese Government posthumously to the late Corporal Michael McCarthy and accepted by his widow, Margaret.  I represented Mallow Urban District Council and the community was also represented. I would like to record the appreciation of the family and the community for the manner in which the Army personnel handled that ceremony which gave a great uplift to both families.  They felt honoured by the manner in which the award was made, and that was commented on by all who attended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Naval Service, fishery protection and those involved in the illegal importation of drugs.  It is welcome to see greater coordination and co-operation in that regard.  The public are aware of that and appreciate it.  While I was spokesperson for Defence for my party in the other House, I had consultations with the Minister's predecessor.  He was visiting Cork and a site had been identified for the development of a training base in the Cork harbour area.  I know the site had been selected and developed but I am not aware to this day that any progress had been made.  It would be worthwhile <Col N="1755" /> when it comes to the integration of training for Navy and Army personnel.</P>
    <P>I would differ with the Minister on the question of recruitment &mdash; it should be continuous and people should have the opportunity of selecting the Defence Forces as a career.  Contracts for three or five years are not helpful.  We welcome any recruitment that takes place but the contract system does not provide young people with an opportunity to make the services a career.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the efficiency audit group.  I am being parochial but Mallow has a great connection with the Permanent Defence Forces and the FCA, but when the Minister talks about the efficiency audit group we are always a little wary about Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy.  Many people from the area are involved and we hope the camp will always be there.</P>
    <P>I join with others in complimenting and commending the Minister for his work.  I would support more recruitment to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to pay tribute to our Defence Forces who serve overseas and join with Senator Sherlock's tribute to the late Corporal Michael McCarthy.  I was glad to hear of the ceremony which took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish forces overseas have always <Col N="1756" /> been a credit to themselves.  Coming from a small nation one can understand why our forces can be acceptable in many roles.  They have proved themselves to be professionals and they go about their task in a way which proves their adaptability. This motion is important to ensure that continuity is maintained and the opportunity is there for Ireland to play a role in the UN.  The role of the UN has increased considerably; at times one wonders if the UN can continue to fulfil this role.  Ireland can play a significant role in the UN and there are many who are anxious to serve in the Army and participate in the UN role.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that a percentage of those recruited are women, although the number is not as high as we would like.  This is a welcome development which proves that young people are anxious for a career in the Army, to play a part in the security of the State and to have a worthwhile and fulfilling job.  It is important that recruitment is continued on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>At the outset I said I was disappointed that the Government side did not accept our motion.  As Senator Dardis said, it is a reasonable motion and we cannot accept the amendment.  I wish the Minister luck and I hope he will get the support of the Government.  This motion may assist him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity of raising this important matter.  I would also like to thank the Minister for coming to the House to listen to my contribution and hopefully to respond positively.</P>
      <P>In the parish of Cloyne in Cork there are 18 slow-learning school children.  To assist them achieve a good standard of primary education the manager and parents employed a resource teacher in October 1993 at their own expense.  The children are happy and are doing well, which proves beyond doubt that they have benefited from the services provided by that teacher.  The issue, therefore, is the application by the manager and parents to be allowed to retain the teacher by getting the sanction of the Minister, which I understand has not been forthcoming up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand this in view of the fact that it is so vitally important for the children's education.  We are well aware that illiteracy is increasing in all areas at an alarming rate.  This would not <Col N="1759" /> be the case if the problem was addressed at primary level, but we will stick to my current point.  The problem is compounded, however, when the manager of the school states that those children will have to go elsewhere if the services of the teacher are no longer provided.  If that happens, the children will leave primary school and in later years they will be looking for the provision of literacy classes.  I understand that if the resource teacher is not provided, the parents will have to travel, or provide transport, to Cork city.  Some parents from that region have already had to do that and it is not fair.  I appeal to the Minister to establish a dialogue with the chairman of the board of management so that a satisfactory solution to this problem will ensue.  I thank you for giving me the opportunity of raising this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the school in question has been seeking an allocation of additional teaching support from my Department for some time.  However, I am also aware that the case made by the school has lacked consistency in terms of the nature of the teaching support being sought and the nature of the problem which it is intended to address.  The school in question lost an assistant teacher to the panel at the end of the 1992/93 school year due to falling enrolments. The number of pupils attending this school had fallen from 170 at the end of the 1991/92 school year to 142 at the end of the 1993/94 school year.  The school has been seeking to recover this position since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially the school had sought the allocation of a remedial teaching post or a concessionary disadvantaged post.  At the end of a meeting with my adviser at the end of 1993 it was explained to the school that no remedial or concessionary posts were available for allocation at that time. However, it was also indicated that the needs of the school would be considered when additional posts were being allocated in 1994.  In 1994, some 100 additional remedial posts were allocated to primary schools with effect from September next.  The needs of all applicant <Col N="1760" /> schools, including Cloyne school, were considered in the context of this allocation. However, the needs of Cloyne school were not considered to be of such priority as to warrant an increase in their current level of remedial service on this occasion.  The school already shares a remedial service with four other primary schools in its area.  More recently the school shifted the focus of its request to that of seeking the allocation of a resource teacher.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should first point out that resource teacher posts are only allocated in special situations to support ordinary teaching staff in meeting the needs of handicapped children attending ordinary classes.  The role of the resource teacher in meeting the special needs of children with a handicap should not be confused with the role of the general remedial service.  At present there are 13 resource teaching posts in place nationwide at primary level and their allocation is the result of detailed assessment of needs by my Department's inspectorate. My Department is currently considering the allocation of a limited number of additional resource teacher posts in the current year.  These posts will be allocated on the basis of priority of need as identified by my Department's inspectorate and I can assure the Senator that the needs of Cloyne school will be fully considered in the context of this allocation. The appointment of further remedial and concessionary teachers will be kept under regular review and I can assure the Senator that the needs of Cloyne national school will be taken fully into account in this context.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.  Second, I thank the Minister for coming to the House herself. Given that she was out of operation for some time, I thank her for coming to the <Col N="1761" /> House personally rather than sending a junior Minister to deal with this issue. With the permission of the House, I wish to give a few minutes of my time to my colleague, Senator Brendan Daly.</P>

      <P>In 1987 the staff of three schools in Kilrush &mdash; the Convent of Mercy secondary school, the CBS secondary school and the vocational school &mdash; agreed to amalgamate to set up a community school.  In 1992 that went into place in so far as the three schools cooperated and worked together on a community school basis.  Since the discussions first began, attempts have been made to secure a site.  Unfortunately, to date no agreement has been secured on a site to be purchased, as far as we know.  It is important that a site should be purchased and a date set for the commencement of construction work.</P>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with west Clare, having connections in the area herself. The three schools are quite a distance apart, which involves children walking from one school to another, particularly between the CBS and the Convent of Mercy.  The vocational school is equidistant from the other two.  The result is that throughout the year, and in the winter months in particular, these children are subject to wind, rain and all the hazards of the elements.  In addition, staff are forced to travel between the schools.  They have done this successfully and have been most co-operative over the past number of years.  However, they are coming to the end of their tether and need constructive action.  They initially co-operated on the assumption that a school would be built relatively quickly after the agreement.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and they are becoming annoyed with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understand that a rather large sum of money has been offered for the CBS site.  I do not wish to deal with the details, but some of those on the board of management and staff would argue that it is quite an exorbitant sum and that a greenfield site could be purchased outright for that amount of money.  In any <Col N="1762" /> event, a site is required and I urge the Minister to take cognisance of what has occurred over the past number of years in relation to the distance and inconvenience involved.  The teachers who must travel between the schools are not financially compensated in any way and they are beginning to find the situation annoying.  The travelling is causing wear and tear on both teachers and pupils. I hope the Minister will consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>The teachers are also concerned about the appointments to posts of responsibility made over the last year.  The Department of Education has not made payments for the 1992-93 year to those who were given posts of responsibility. Perhaps the Minister will take this point into account also.</P>
    <P>Kilrush and west Clare in general are economically and socially deprived. There is a high number of unemployed and socially deprived people in the area. If the children there are to have any hope of success in the future, it will be through the best possible education that can be provided to them.  This can only be done in one school building, where everybody operates under the one roof.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise the urgency of what is required.  A good education for the children of west Clare is absolutely essential if they are to get anywhere in life.  The reality of the economics of the region is that it will not provide one with a living in one's area.  If one has to leave, one needs the backing of a good education. It is a fundamental necessity.</P>
    <P>Another issue relates to a remedial teacher in the school.  There are a number of remedial teachers in the local primary schools and I compliment the Minister for making recent appointments to schools in the area.  However, the fall out is that children who come into second level do not have that support system.  Perhaps the Minister will also consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to urgently purchase a site and announce a date for commencement of building so the parents, teachers and board of management will see that constructive progress is being made within the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>I support the case made by Senator Taylor-Quinn.  I thank her for allowing me the opportunity to contribute on this issue.</P>
      <P>I press upon the Minister the necessity to expedite the developments in Kilrush. She will be aware from the files that this has been a long drawn out saga.  It was initially difficult to reach agreement and, although it was secured, there is now further disruption because of the indecision regarding the site.  The case has been well documented and a number of people have spoken to the Minister. Questions were put down in the other House about it.</P>
      <P>The urgent necessity is to get the site sorted out and to get on to the planning stages.  It will then be possible to put it in the queue for funding, which is another day's work.  The Minister is aware that teachers are becoming impatient and that the parents are also becoming agitated. In the long run, the pupils will suffer. They will be disadvantaged in the sense that they will not have the same standard of facilities as in other institutions.  It is urgently necessary to get action.  If it cannot be resolved here, perhaps the Minister would meet a delegation from Kilrush, which would press upon her the urgency of the case.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank both Senators who contributed for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position concerning the development of the new community school at Kilrush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators are aware that the three post primary schools at Kilrush amalgamated to form a new community school from the beginning of the 1992-93 school year. I welcome this development.  The three schools involved are the ¡rd Mhuire Christian Brothers, the Convent of Mercy and the Vocational School in Kilrush. <Col N="1764" /> I know the situation as I travelled from one to another during a visit.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the CBS sites, both secondary and primary, will be purchased and developed with a view to providing the accommodation needed for the community school.  Negotiations regarding the acquisition of the Christian Brothers' property have been in progress since the establishment of the community school.  Department officials again met with representatives of the Christian Brothers last week.  Agreement was not reached at this meeting, but the Christian Brothers' representatives are to further consider their price for the sale of the site.  It is expected that the negotiations will be concluded soon and that the purchase of the property will be finalised as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The matter is between the negotiating teams, not the Minister.  It is expected that they will be concluded shortly. Where an amalgamation is agreed, there is a responsibility on the Department to respond positively and quickly.  This is where the matter lies at present.  The position regarding the planning of the project is that the design team are currently in the process of completing a condition report on the existing CBS building which it is intended to develop.  On receipt of this report, which is expected to be submitted shortly, architectural planning of the project will proceed.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say when the building of the school will commence. However, this is one of the projects that has been designated as a priority.  I will ensure that there is no undue delay in the completion of the architectural planning so that the construction of the project can commence at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 June 1994.</P>
