      <P>I have notice from Senator Ormonde that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review the present academic qualifications required for the post of library assistant in local authority libraries, particularly the requirement of two grade Cs in the leaving certificate, as an anomaly exists whereby an applicant may have higher qualifications but not the required two Cs and consequently will not be considered for the post.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for a new water source for the people of Monaghan town as the current supply is unsatisfactory as two of the three current sources of supply are from time to time discoloured, carry an unsavoury odour and contain sediment and, as a result, consumers believe the water is unfit for human consumption.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to consider the introduction of alternative methods of transporting money for social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>I have selected Senator Ormonde's and Senator Cotter's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Kiely may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Yet again I am sure the House would want me to express sympathy on the tragic deaths on Saturday night in Loughinisland and condemn those involved in violence.  While the rest of the country rejoiced and basked in events in New York, these tragedies were happening not too far from here.  I am sure other speakers would like to add their voice to the condemnation of such violence.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1993, which will be concluded.  With the agreement of the House, we will take all stages of Item 2, the Health Insurance Bill.  Item 42 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Adjournment Matters will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I join with the Leader of the House in his expression of sympathy to the relatives of the six people killed in County Down last Saturday night and also the relatives of the four others, who brought the number killed in Northern Ireland to ten in the past week.  As the Leader of the House said, it is appalling that when the rest of the country, north and south, was united in the joy of a great national occasion in New York, a group of decent people watching this event in a small village in County Down were mercilessly gunned down.  Young children have been left orphans, wives have been left widows and an old man of 87 years was shot in the back as he watched a football game. Atrocities we condemn elsewhere in the <Col N="1487" /> world are not very different to the coldness and barbarity of what happened in County Down last weekend.  I know the sympathy of everyone in this part of the country goes out to the bereaved.</P>
      <P>Yet again this highlights the urgent need for political movement in Northern Ireland.  The European elections are over and if people have an answer to the peace document, they should give it.  There is no time to waste while people seek further clarification to a generous offer, which was made seven moths ago.  I ask Unionist political leaders to speak out unequivocally against movements in their community which tolerate the type of activity which happened last weekend. Although it may be small, we need total lack of equivocation on this matter.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government to renew its efforts to try to restart political movement. I ask the Leader of the House to make time available to debate Northern Ireland in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I always restrain from asking for debate on topical issues which arise.  However, there is widespread feeling among Members that the atrocity last Saturday night in County Down requires us to make use of this platform to indicate our views and positions, in particular, to those North of the Border.  I have always taken the view &mdash; and I am not just responding to the last atrocity &mdash; that it is important that we state our position, that words lead to decisions and decisions lead to actions.  Actions can lead to improvement.  We need to start that process. It has to be a political process, with political initiation, and we should use this urgent matter as an opportunity to address those issues.  Anybody who could watch the footage last week of that small country pub without feeling close to tears would need to have a heart of stone.  It was an extraordinary scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more mundane note, but in regard to a matter which affects the lives of many people, the Leader of the House and myself are the two Members of this House living closest to Dublin Airport. It is a tragic day there for those employed <Col N="1488" /> by TEAM.  It is important that those people also recognise that the topicality and the urgency of their position needs to be addressed by politicians.  If politicians do not address it, other people fill the vacuum.  It is not an opportunity to hammer Government; it is an opportunity to indicate points of view and possibly to understand better what the position is and may be find solutions without interfering in any way or taking any cheap shots.</P>
    <P>On two other issues of business, I wish to put it very firmly on the record of the House that in the Leader's apology to the House last week he very carefully enunciated the words that in this week's sitting he would make up the Private Members' Business &ldquo;in Government time&rdquo;.  I bring to his attention a fact of which I am sure he is well aware, that this has not been done.  The motion is being return tonight, but it is being rerun in Private Members' Business &mdash; the Government's Private Members' Business, but Private Members' Business nonetheless.  Like <i>The Skibbereen Eagle,</i> we will be keeping a close and watching brief to ensure that this change does not affect us in ensuring that we get our just share of time for Private Members' Business during the term.  I have raised that matter with the Government Whip who has assured me that balance will be found.</P>
    <P>I regretted last week that it was not possible to hold the debate on the regional educational councils and particularly on the input of elected public representatives because of the absence of the Minister, whom I am glad to hear is out of hospital.  I hope that she has fully recovered.  The Minister of State is busy on the other side of the Atlantic with important things relative to his job as Minister for Sport.  We should now reschedule that debate as soon as possible. Yesterday the Government published a report of the discussions on the regional educational committees and it should be discussed.  If the Government do not have time this side of the summer I can handle that, but we need it to be <Col N="1489" /> dealt with.  The discussion needs to be opened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in condemning absolutely the savagery that took place in County Down last weekend.  It is essential that we do not give in to despair in the face of such events.  We must move forward, there must be political movement and I support what Senator Manning said in that regard.  If we give in to despair then we give in to those people in whose interests it is to keep communities apart.  I agree that it is essential that politicians on all sides unequivocally condemn what has taken place and condemn violence on all sides of the divide.  It is essential now that everybody on all sides come to the table and that the discussions and negotiations take place as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again we are confronted with a situation where our vocabulary is deficient in terms of how we condemn these atrocities.  It seems that in this House we have to repeatedly get up and make the same type of statement. These atrocities happen again and we wonder what it is within us that keeps them happening again.  We had Teebane, Enniskillen, the Shankill, Greysteel; now we have Loughinisland, another name to go into the lexicon of atrocities that have taken place over the years.  There is a solemn responsibility on us in the Houses of Parliament to debate these matters, as we have in the past, with compassion and with a degree of understanding and temperate language.  One wonders how it can be construed that people sitting in a quiet country pub, or at a republican gathering, or how an 87 year old man can be legitimate targets.  Animals would get better treatment than those in that pub received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In condemning such acts we have to ask what we can do as a response.  We are not asking this as a result of this atrocity, but I suggest to the Leader that we have a debate on Northern Ireland. It should not be by way of resumed statements; I note that Item 9 on the Order Paper is &ldquo;Statements on Northern <Col N="1490" /> Ireland (resumed)&rdquo;; but it is important that everybody should be able to contribute to the debate.  We must renew our efforts once again to bring about peace. I only wonder whether such people are prepared to listen at all.  We were given a commitment that there would be a response to the clarification of the Joint Declaration after the European elections and we need that response now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak with great sadness in my heart because it has been a dreadful week in Northern Ireland.  I have never known such revulsion across the whole community as there has been since the events on last Saturday evening. The circumstances are dreadful and the question arises as to what can we do.  We can discuss the problem, but we must do more.  We must each make our own effort in our own particular field to do what we can to bring peace nearer.</P>
      <P>I heard the news of Saturday's events at 5.50 a.m. on Sunday when a London radio station rang me for a response to the previous evening's tragedy.  I had heard nothing about it until then.  I was sickened to death when I heard the news and I was lost for words to try to find a response, as I am now.  I condemn it, but we must do more.  I appeal to the Leader to allow the House to have a day of statements on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in condemning the atrocity.  It is frightening to think that this could happen in Northern Ireland and that anybody could be so evil as to gun down people in those circumstances.  We should call on those responsible to control those mad dogs and to stop the tit for that murders of innocent people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us are of one mind on this matter.  The best any of us can do is to reflect the concern expressed by Senator Wilson, who in every sense has been closer to this tragedy than any of us can imagine.  For some time we have been hoping for a debate in the House. Although I understand the problems of Government accommodating debates <Col N="1491" /> and making statements formally, it is evident from what has been said that the restrained attitude of all Members could only be conducive to a better understanding. Even if it is not required of a Minister to make a formal statement on issues that may currently be in negotiation, I hope we would have the opportunity of having a continuation of statements in the format colleagues have expressed.</P>
      <P>It is important that the House might be able to reassure the Unionists.  I come from a republican tradition and I am proud to be called republican in the proper sense of the term &mdash; someone concerned for the public wellbeing and the protection of the private citizen.  We should not allow the term &ldquo;republican&rdquo; to be abused.  I hear loose phrases used about us relinquishing our claim to the North, but it is important that Unionists would know that we have no claim to the North.  It is a misunderstanding of our Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are so many ways we can reassure people as to our actual position that I hope we could have that facility which, from what I have heard today, would be a positive contribution towards ensuring that awful events, like Loughinisland, cannot happen again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members of the House in my utter condemnation of what happened in Loughinisland over the weekend and join with others in calling for a debate on this subject.  The response of people on this island is very interesting and instructive.  I was particularly glad to hear members of both unionist parties, especially the Democratic Unionist Party, in so directly, clearly and forthrightly condemning this horrible atrocity.  It is a pity they did not condemn such atrocities a long time ago, <Col N="1492" /> but I welcome it now.  However, I cannot give so hearty a welcome to the words of Gerry Adams.  As Deputy Currie recently said on the radio, it is a nauseating performance for someone who has advocated, promoted and justified butchery to condemn this sort of activity. There is an element of hypocrisy there, as there is in the UVF and all its works.</P>
      <P>I would be regarded &mdash; although I do not regard myself &mdash; as a Protestant in this community and I would like to say that this kind of savagery has nothing whatsoever to do with Protestantism. The people in the UVF, the Shankill butchers, who justify what they do using the word Protestantism, have no place in any category of religion to which I belong and are totally devoid of a sense of irony. I remember reading a book and seeing on the headstone of the worst of the Shankill butchers &ldquo;For God, King and Country&rdquo;.  I do not see how they could, in conscience, commit these kinds of crimes and then seek to justify them.</P>
      <P>Mr. Mayhew was right when he asked what will these people say they did, in what they classify as a war, when a child asks them in 20 years time.  Will they say they went to a public house where a group of people were watching a football match on television and shot dead an 87 year old man in the back?  That is not my definition of heroism.</P>
      <P>I am calling for a debate on the subject. Certain uncomfortable issues have to be raised.  I and an increasing number of people feel that if the authorities know who is responsible for these atrocities and have insufficient evidence to convict them in a public court, then it is time to consider the possibility of internment on both sides.  I can say that because I am an Independent; I have no party affiliations putting pressure on me.</P>

      <P>I am looking for a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to ask for advice from the House on East Timor.  This matter was discussed through the motion I proposed <Col N="1493" /> but, unfortunately, I was abroad at the time.  However, there are matters arising from that.  Would it be possible to raise on the Adjournment the events of ten days ago when Tom Hyland of the Ireland-East Timor Solidarity Campaign and Mairéad Corrigan-Maguire, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, were expelled from the Philippines.  They had valid passports, they were Irish citizens and Ireland is a friendly country.  They were not convicted of, or did not propose to conduct, any criminal activity.  They were there as invited representatives and citizens of this country to a conference on human rights abuses in East Timor.  They were expelled from that country.  Suppose an Irish person was invited to Paris for a conference on Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Put your question to the Leader, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would the French Government be entitled to expel them? In light of the debate on East Timor held some weeks ago, could the expulsion of Tom Hyland and Mairéad Corrigan-Maguire be raised as a matter on the Adjournment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should first send its sympathy to the families who have lost their loved ones.  It must be clearly stated to the paramilitaries who committed this atrocity that their action is counter productive.  They have achieved nothing, as the shooting of these Catholics will give the Provisional IRA a swell in their ranks.  This arises because no matter how much the relatives of the dead call for no reprisals, there is an understandable bitterness which promotes revenge on both sides.</P>
      <P>There is abhorrence at the slaughter of people in Rwanda which results in bodies floating in its rivers, yet a similar slaughter takes place in this country.  It is a tragedy.  In view of this, I urge the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in the South do not take kindly to being advised that they are not interested in security.  They are very <Col N="1494" /> interested.  The State is spending substantial sums of money, over £1 million per day, on security.  In addition, it is costing the UK £9 million per day to stay in the North.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">

      <P>Senator, you may put that on the record of the House in any debate which takes place.  I take it that you are asking the Leader of the House for a debate on Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The message of the House should go out as loudly and as clearly as possible that the actions of the savages who engaged in the atrocity at Loughinisland over the weekend is counter productive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also request the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on Northern Ireland.  If a debate in the House, or any debate in the South, can help to highlight to the decent people of Northern Ireland that planned developments will not mean a takeover of the North, then it must be welcomed.  Over the past six months the fears of the ordinary, decent people of Northern Ireland have increased because of interpretations of the developing situation.  How appropriate is it to term savages as paramilitaries? To refer to savages as such is being somewhat unkind to paramilitaries.</P>
      <P>Last week in the House I proposed a vote of good wishes to the Irish World Cup team.  This week I am proud to report that the team has done well.  It has two more matches over the next few days. Hopefully, the House will be in a position to compliment the team next week if the climate does not overcome the team members and their supporters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I condemn the atrocity in the North of Ireland which took place over the weekend.  If a debate takes place in the House on that atrocity I ask the Leader of the House to ensure that it be extended to cover atrocities worldwide. People in this country do not live insulated from developments around the world.  If there is a direct debate on incidents in the North of Ireland, it will be a lost debate, as all debates in the House have been lost to the paramilitaries, or whoever was involved in these atrocities, since I first entered the House in 1977.</P>
      <P>There must be a strengthening of the international bodies which are supposed to police the world and give people hope in the world.  There will be a short debate in the House this evening on the UN and the role of the UN, but it is necessary for any debate to link the atrocities which take place in the North of Ireland with the atrocities which take place on the continents of Europe and Africa, the Far East or wherever.  There must be a general debate in the House on the causes of these atrocities.  Even though they appear to be generalised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Over the past number of months in the educational area huge debates have been going on in every town and country place about providing universities for them. There is not a town or county that is not looking for a new university.  If all these universities were to come on stream there would be one at every crossroads.  I would ask the Leader for a debate so that the Seanad could judge what the concept of a university is and what the needs of the people are regarding university education. Where is university education going if, as it is established at present, it is not fulfilling the needs of the country?</P>

I feel strongly about it.  We have been looking long enough for debates on Africa, the Middle East, Bosnia and all the other troubled places.  It is high time that we looked into our own hearts and had such a debate in this House.  I learned about the Loughinisland atrocity coming out of the stadium last Saturday evening.  What the Irish football team achieved for us in 90 minutes, in terms of trying to attract tourism and industry here, was destroyed by the announcement that six people had been brutally killed while trying to watch the match.</P>

It is still my hope and desire that between now and the recess we will deal with Northern Ireland.  The Tánaiste has been here on many occasions and as soon as this week's European summit is out of the way it would be my intention to seek a further discussion on the matter and to report back to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;The following subparagraphs shall be inserted after subsection (1) (a) (v) of section 17 of the Act of 1980:</P>
      <P>`(vi)  in the case only of a tenement falling within the description of the tenement referred to in section 13 (1) (a) (as amended by section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1994), the tenant prior to the commencement of a tenancy, which provides for the exclusive use of the tenement as an office has executed whether for or without valuable consideration a valid renunciation of his entitlement to a new tenancy under Part II of this Act.</P>
      <P>(vii)  A renunciation for the purpose of subparagraph (vi) shall not be valid unless the tenant prior to executing such renunciation first obtained independent legal advice.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment allows for longer leases than five years and the rights to opt out and renew in the case of office premises only.  This argument was made on Second Stage and was discussed with the Minister. It would suit people in an office situation to have tenancies for longer than five years, say, for ten years; it would be advantageous to the landlord and the tenant.  The original Bill allowed for an opt out clause for all commercial <Col N="1499" /> properties but the argument was made on Committee Stage in the Dáil that in the case of retail premises this would be unfair on tenants who have built up goodwill in their businesses which is of value and whose landlords could benefit from a windfall gain if the right of renewal was not contained in the Bill.  This amendment allows for an opt out clause only for office premises and only after a tenant has obtained legal advice.  Such advice may not be usual in legislation but is not unique.  It was proposed in the opt out situation provided for in the Matrimonial Home Bill, which was unfortunately found to be unconstitutional. The opt out situation should apply to offices where a value is not put on the goodwill of the premises which results from a trading situation.</P>

      <P>I think the House will accept that Senator Neville's amendment and those proposed by the Government attempt to achieve precisely the same thing, which is that tenants entering into leases for premises to be used exclusively as offices should be free to renounce their statutory rights to a new tenancy under the 1980 Act at the time of entering into the tenancy, provided they receive independent legal advice.  When I spoke on Second Stage, I went into some detail about opting out.  I mentioned in particular that the Government does not favour a global opting out provision as had been included in the Bill as originally presented.  However, we accept the case which has been made for allowing opting out where offices are involved.  In these cases goodwill does not arise and it has been represented to us that allowing this new flexibility for leasing arrangements in the office sector should work to the advantage of lessors and lessees in this area.  A case has been made for extending the opt out to other types of premises but the issues which arise in these cases are not as clearcut as those which arise in relation to offices alone and I would not be prepared to go any further at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the Government <Col N="1500" /> amendments was prepared by the parliamentary draftsman.  While there is no real difference of substance between these and Senator Neville's amendments, the advice we have is that the approach taken in the official amendments is the clearest and tightest way to achieve what we both want.  In these circumstances I hope Senator Neville can withdraw his amendment and allow the Government's to go through.  He and I have the same objectives in mind and both my amendments and his achieve the same thing. My advice is that our amendments achieve this in a slightly better way.  As we are <i>ad idem</i> on the objective, I hope the Senator will see his way to comply with my request.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the content of our amendment on board.  We will bow to the better advice and expertise which the Minister has available to him.  However, that is not to in any way criticise the expertise which we have in the person of Deputy Shatter on this issue.  We are achieving the same objective and I thank the Minister for taking on board our amendment.</P>
      <P>It highlights something which I have been raising for some time, which is that Opposition spokespersons should have expertise from the various Departments available to them to assist them in wording amendments or developing Private Members' Bills.  Working alone we feel very isolated.  Those of us who do not have legal expertise do our best to grapple with the legislation.  I am pleased to withdraw my amendment in favour of that of the Minister which achieves the objectives which we set out to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section allows a court to fix a tenancy of 35 years or less as the tenant may require.  As the Minister is aware, if a person in private rented accommodation has 20 years tenancy then they may seek a 35 year lease from their landlord.  At present a number of my constituents are under threat of eviction because they have not reached the twentieth year.  One has been a tenant for 19 years and 11 months, which is just one month short.  It is now before the courts as a private eviction notice case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that when this Bill came <Col N="1502" /> before the House the Minister of State gave an assurance that he was setting up a working group to look at private rented accommodation.  When does the Minister of State expect this working group to report to him and when does he intend to bring in comprehensive legislation to relieve the anxiety of tenants in rented accommodation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, which was presented by Deputy Shatter and accepted by the Government, deals with commercial tenancies only.  Senator Doyle is dealing with the private rented sector.  He is right in saying that we set up a working party.  I indicated in the other House to Deputy McDowell that I had hoped that the working party would have reported by now.  It will not be a very difficult job to draft the legislation &mdash; I understand that it can be drafted in a matter of hours if we accept the recommendations of the working party when it reports.</P>
      <P>It is matter of making choices.  The working party has not reported yet.  I am disappointed with that and I have been in contract with the working party over recent days to see if we could get definite decisions from it.  When it reports, legislative proposals will be brought to Government based on its report.  The Government will have to agree those legislative proposals, although I would be fairly optimistic that it will agree them.</P>
      <P>The working party has met a number of the associations involved, including the tenants in Mespil Road.  As a result of that meeting the association representing the tenants in Mespil Road agreed to send in a submission to the working party which, as I understand it, only arrived two or three weeks ago.  The secretary of the Mespil Road group will have a response to that from the working group tomorrow which raises certain issues.</P>
      <P>Much work has been done and we received a large number of submissions from many areas to which the working party has given detailed consideration.  I hope to have legislative proposals ready for the next session and I will work very hard to achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> The case mentioned by Senator Doyle involves a technical legal point relating the format of a notice to quit.  I obviously cannot comment on that because it is before the courts.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill to the House and I thank both him and the Minister for Justice for accepting it.  It is simple but important legislation which will assist commercial enterprises and encourage the development of enterprises especially among people starting businesses.  They will have more flexibility in terms of tenancy and in terms of having time to establish themselves.  I am convinced that the effects of the Bill will lead to job creation and a better climate for job creation.</P>

      <P>I again recognise that this is Deputy Shatter's legislation, which the Government accepted with some amendments.  The final shape of the Bill does not correspond exactly to its original format.  However, the acceptance of a number of Deputy Shatter's Bills reflects the fact that the Government does not have a monopoly of expertise and wisdom, even though it has the whole public sector at its disposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill, which we have now accepted with our own amendments, will, as Senator Neville said, make a significant change in this area.  It will create flexibility in the commercial letting sector and, I have no doubt, will lead to job creation.  That is what we should be doing here.</P>

    <Title>Health Insurance Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Third Directive on Non-Life Insurance comes into effect on 1 July 1994 throughout the European Union.  This directive is part of the process, known generally as the Single Market, of opening up the markets of the member states of the EU to competition.  We are obliged to enact legislation to introduce into Irish law the provisions of the directive which enable us to regulate the future market in health insurance in the interests of the common good while complying with the intent of the directive.</P>
      <P>Within the competitive environment which the Single Market promotes we have to ensure that what is done is in the general good.  There is an overriding requirement to protect that general good, to maintain social solidarity and, where health insurance is concerned, to strive to ensure that it will remain available and affordable for those who need it most, including the elderly, the chronically ill and those struck down by serious illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first of two insurance Bills which I hope to have enacted this year. In the next term I intend to introduce legislation which will amend the 1957 Act and provide the framework for the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to compete effectively.  In the development of these Bills, the report of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, chaired by Deputy Liam Kavanagh, <Col N="1505" /> on the VHI has been of considerable assistance.  I thank Deputy Kavanagh and the Members of the committee for the care and attention to detail which they showed in completing a very useful report.  Senator Frank Fahey, Senator Michael Finneran, Senator Shane Ross and Senator Jack Wall were Members of the committee and I extend my gratitude to them also.  In both content and timing the report was a very good example of the work of the committee system in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In this country, health insurance has played a major role since 1957 in the development of the health services.  Its success can be seen in the numbers covered, which now approximate to 1.3 million persons or over 35 per cent of the total population.  Such a high level of coverage demonstrates that health insurance is accepted as offering value for money to consumers and its continuing strength, despite periods of adverse conditions for the economy generally, is a testament to the value that the insured population place on their membership of the various schemes.  Despite consistent and sustained improvements in public health services and the broadening of eligibility criteria, health insurance continues to be an attractive product.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some of the fundamental thinking which informs the provisions incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Any regulatory system for health insurance in this country must be placed in the wider context of the general community. The Long Title for this Bill speaks of the legislation being necessary &ldquo;in the interests of the common good&rdquo; and it is this aspect of the new system which lies at the heart of the proposals. The common good requires that we be concerned with society as a whole.  The strong should help the weak, the young should help the old.  The principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime membership spring from this view of how we should behave as a society.</P>
    <P>Competition and profit making must take place within this framework thereby <Col N="1506" /> encouraging innovation, efficiency and keen awareness of market opportunities. The alternative is to allow risk related insurance, attractive to the young and healthy, potentially unavailable to the old and sick.  The inevitable result would be that many people would leave health insurance and, through no fault of their own, be put in a position where they had no choices about health care despite being contributors to health insurance for many years.</P>
    <P>This Bill also implicitly recognises, as a second principle underlying these purposes, the significant role of insurance over the years within the broader public health services.  Our hospital system is second to none in terms of quality of service and the public hospitals have benefited enormously from the presence of private care on their sites.  In this year alone a total of over £60 million will be earned by public hospitals from private care and this is an invaluable support for the maintenance of high standards of care for all patients.  The £60 million goes directly into the income of the public hospitals and their standards are enhanced by the availability of such income.</P>
    <P>It is vital that public hospitals continue to have a mix of private and public practice on site.  If this mix did not exist the result would be a fragmented hospital system where one group of hospitals treated private patients only and public hospitals treated exclusively public patients.  Quite apart from the loss of £60 million income, there could also be a reduction in the quality of medical supervision and involvement at the highest level in patient care in public hospitals.  I do not believe that the private hospitals would gain from the divided and divisive system I have described.</P>
    <P>The competitive spirit which should be generated by the Single Market will have a major impact on the range and type of products available to consumers. Insurers must look at what they are offering now and see if those policies are truly matching the needs of the market and if there are any gaps in that market they can usefully fill.  Responsiveness to customers' <Col N="1507" /> requirements will become ever more important and the development of niche marketing will more readily identify those critical gaps.</P>
    <P>For example, companies which wish to specialise in non-hospital products will be able to sell plans which are related to the particular area of expertise of that company and will not have to become involved in the marketing of a hospital plan.  An insurer who wishes to sell dental care benefits can do so without having to sell hospital policies.  From experience elsewhere it is clear the availability of these ancillary products is critical in maintaining the attractiveness of health insurance.  A healthy rivalry in the marketplace based on genuine consumer need will be of benefit to all.</P>
    <P>I have circulated to Senators an information document on the main features of this Bill.  That is not the usual practice but the Bill is quite complex.  I felt it would be of assistance to Senators in preparing for this debate if an information document was circulated in advance.  The proposals outlined in that document as to the fine points of the future regulation of health insurance will be the subject of detailed consultations with interested parties between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The principles involved are important, the first of them being community rating, which is the system of pricing by which members of an insurance plan are charged the same premium by a company for a range of benefits.  No discrimination is made by the insurer in regard to the age, health status or sex of the individual member.</P>
    <P>The rationale which underlies this concept is that high risk groups, mainly the elderly, should not have to pay more in premia at a stage in their lives when they may most need to use the benefits of an insurance policy.  Furthermore, the low risk groups, such as the young, healthy, insured population will benefit from community rating when they age and come to need services.</P>
    <P>The Bill as passed by the Dáil seeks to ensure that while a number of specific <Col N="1508" /> and appropriate exceptions are allowed, the principle of community rating will apply to all health insurance contracts, whether they cover adults or those under 18 years of age.  I have, however, accepted that health insurance packages covering long term care are unlikely to be made available unless they can be sold at a risk rated basis.  The Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>Community rating is not anti-competitive. It does not prevent companies from competing.  There is ample scope for commercial rivalry to gain greater market share by concentrating on price, product and quality of service.  It is a matter for each insurance undertaking to determine how it competes on price with its market rivals, provided it does not discriminate within its own plans against vulnerable groups within society.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in community rating or in any of the proposed regulatory arrangements which will prevent the development of innovative products for the consumer.  I am anxious to see new thinking on product lines in health insurance and I anticipate that should competition occur there will be a notable increase in marketing and related activities.</P>
    <P>The second principle is open enrolment which, like community rating, is a concept of particular value to vulnerable people who can be assured they will have access to insurance when they choose to purchase it.  Of course it is important that people take out health insurance at an early age if inter-generational solidarity is to continue and community rating to prosper.  A decline in the number of young people with insurance would have serious consequencess for the system as there would be insufficient low risk members to balance out the high risk groups.</P>
    <P>However, open entry cannot be absolute as no insurance company can be expected immediately to give full coverage to any individual who wished to join. Such an arrangement could have a significant adverse effect on the insurer in a short period.  A waiting period for cover <Col N="1509" /> must be applied if the insurance system is not to be undermined.</P>
    <P>The third principle enshrined in the ground rules for the operation of health insurance is that of lifetime cover, which is linked to open enrolment and community rating in its protection of the highly vulnerable.  Continuing cover is critically important because health insurance would have little attraction if we were likely to be denied cover at the point in our lives when we are most likely to need it.  I am therefore providing for the concept of lifetime cover to be an intergral part of the new regulatory arrangements but there will be some qualifications.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important points arising from the interpretations which are set out in section 2 of the Bill to which I would now like to draw the attention of the House.  The term &ldquo;ancillary health services&rdquo; is defined in the Bill.  The term &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; is used in the context of the Bill in a specific way to distinguish a range of services from those which are likely to be included in the schedule of minimum benefits to which I will refer to later.  The term does not in any way denote that these are less important services.  The intention is to distinguish these services so that, for example, they can be marketed either on a separate basis or as a top up in a package which includes minimum benefits.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo;, which is a fundamental part of the Bill, defines health insurance as applying to payments which are made for or on behalf of insured persons for the specific reimbursement of fees or charges.  In other words, there must be an element of indemnity before a policy can be described as health insurance. Policies which are merely cash payments and can be paid irrespective of the actual costs incurred in treatment are not, under this definition, health insurance.  They do not constitute an indemnity policy as such and present no real threat to health insurance at present.  However, my Department will be keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> Section 7 of the Bill prohibits insurers from offering non-community rated policies. It also defines community rating. However, there are a number of aspects of community rating on which I would like to make further comments.  It will be noted that section 7 (2) (a) uses the phrase &ldquo;suffering or prospective suffering of a person from a chronic disease&rdquo;. My intention in using the word &ldquo;prospective&rdquo; is to prevent the application of current and anticipated diagnostic techniques, such as genetic testing, as a means of providing information on which a decision could be made to increase an individual's premium or to deny insurance cover to a client.</P>
    <P>The House will also note from section 7 (3) of the Bill that, as I have already mentioned, I am not requiring health insurance policies covering long term care to be marketed on a community rated basis.  I hope that insurers will develop products which can cover the costs of long term care.  The demographics of this country and, indeed, other developed nations, would suggest that such products can be directed at a sizeable market which would justify their development.</P>
    <P>I am making a number of exceptions in section 7 (4) (a) and (b) to the principle of community rating.  These exceptions reflect current practice by insurers here, whether by the Voluntary Health Insurance or the friendly societies, and do not, therefore, dilute to any significant extent the principle of community rating. The concessions on group discounts are important and are necessary if insurers are to continue to attract the type of risk that can be set off against higher risks. Considerable care has been taken to give insurers flexibility in determining how they will charge for children.  For example, in larger families it will be possible for insurers to waive charges for children in excess of a particular number. However, all policies must comply with the basic principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill sets out, with certain qualifications, the requirement on insurers not to refuse a contract to a <Col N="1511" /> person under 65 years of age.  An insurer is not obliged to accept for membership a person who is 65 years or more, except where that person's insurance company has ceased to trade.  In this situation the insured person will be allowed to enrol with another undertaking and may not be prevented from doing so.  Section 8 (4) (a) of the Bill provides for all those, irrespective of age, who have had a health insurance contract with an undertaking to transfer to another company.  This provision is a reasonable one, given that a person over 65 years would probably have been paying into a scheme for many years and is, therefore, entitled to continue to receive benefit.</P>
    <P>I will be prescribing in regulations waiting periods which are generally similar to those operated at present by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. However, there are a number of areas which require further examination and to which I have referred in paragraph 3.1 of my information document.  My aim is to ensure that the regulations will provide a balance between necessary controls by insurers on entry while at the same time adhering to the principle of open enrolment. I should add that restricted membership undertakings will be allowed to limit their membership to the relevant occupational group but may not refuse to accept a qualified person under 65 years.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill explicitly prohibits a company from refusing to renew or terminating cover without the insured person's consent, except in circumstances to be prescribed in regulations.  It is likely that these circumstances will allow for cover not to be renewed or to be terminated if it can be established that there was fraud on the part of the insured person or non-disclosure by him or her of significant relevant information to the company.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides that an insurance contract which covers hospital services must provide for a minimum level of benefit to be offered to a potential subscriber.  An insurance company which is offering benefits which do not include any element of hospital costs but relate <Col N="1512" /> only to ancillary services, such as dental care, will not be subject to this requirement.</P>
    <P>The level of statutory minimum benefits will be clearly defined in regulations which will be publicised in the autumn after detailed consultations with interested parties.  However, these benefits will only be paid in respect of what are regarded as medically necessary procedures. The main elements which would be included in minimum benefit are hospital in-patient treatment, including day care, hospital outpatient treatment, consultants fees, maternity benefits on a grant-in-aid basis, convalescence, psychiatric treatment, and substance abuse. The minimum level of accommodation which will require to be covered is semiprivate in a public hospital.  My general approach is to ensure that the regulatory framework gives a guarantee of minimum benefit to consumers.  If individuals want to top up and purchase more cover they will be able to do so.</P>
    <P>The components to be included in the minimum benefits package will be kept under regular review.  It would obviously be attractive to have all insured people covered for services such as general practitioner services and dental care. However, the reality is that this would tend to increase significantly the cost of the package and probably lead to a significant reduction in the number of people with health insurance.  There is the further complication that general practitioner services are not an attractive or easy to manage proposition for an insurer's viewpoint.</P>
    <P>It is important that all those purchasing health insurance should be given full information in a clear and comprehensive manner.  It is also necessary to ensure that any advertising or promotion of health insurance is accurate and truthful and does not mislead the public.  Section 13 gives the power to the Minister to make regulations for the control of advertising and promotion by insurers.  It is a permissive provision and will not be invoked unless it is clear that it is necessary to protect the consumer.  Developments in other countries clearly suggest that such <Col N="1513" /> a power is necessary, particularly in a competitive market, offering a wide range of marginally differentiated products.</P>
    <P>One further issue which is of continuing concern to me is the problem of balance billing by consultants where patients may be billed at a level which is not reimbursed by the insurer.  This is a particularly difficult issue which will require careful consideration.  An excessive amount of balance billing must be avoided if health insurance is to maintain its standing as good value for money. However, any insurance company could be put under great strain if it were to meet the demands for increases in private fees, introduced from time to time by medical consultants independent of any statutory control or review process.  My Department will be reviewing this matter further while the regulations on minimum benefit are being drafted.</P>
    <P>Community rating can be undermined by some insurers deliberately selecting low risk groups or individuals.  A number of marketing techniques can be employed by companies to make certain that their risk profiles are lower than the average. Those techniques could include having a direct mailing system to particular groups, or targeting occupational schemes with a relatively low average age, or designing policies in such a way that they appeal only to those who present the least risk.  The inevitable result of selection of low risk members is considerable instability in the market as other insurance companies, with a higher than average risk profile, would find their financial position rapidly deteriorating.</P>
    <P>There are different methods of risk equalisation.  The method which I am considering is based primarily on profiling each company's membership by sex and age bands.  I am opposed to any system which would pool all risks or costs in the insured population as this would be a disincentive to competition and would reimburse the inefficient insurance companies and service providers.  The type of scheme I am considering for risk equalisation would cover costs up to semiprivate accommodation in most private <Col N="1514" /> hospitals.  This and other aspects of risk equalisation will be examined in more detail by my Department over the coming months while the regulations are being drafted; there will be consultation with all relevant interest groups while the regulations are made.  The EU Third Directive provides that member states may introduce risk equalisations schemes if considered appropriate.  The proposals in the Bill are in accordance with the intent of the directive and are seen by the European Commission as a necessary part of the regulatory framework to maintain community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.</P>
    <P>A health insurance authority has been provided for in Part IV of the Bill.  It will not be necessary to establish the Authority immediately as the regulatory functions in regard to health insurance will, from July 1994, lie with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, where prudential issues such as minimum solvency margins are concerned.  These matters have been the responsibility of that Minister as part of his functions under the insurance sector generally.  My regulatory responsibilities, as Minister for Health, will involve the maintenance of a register of health insurers as provided for in Part II of the Bill.  My Department will also monitor policies to ensure they comply with community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and minimum benefits.</P>
    <P>I will also make arrangements with an independent body under section 12 to advise me on whether equalisation should come into being, in line with a formula set out in regulations.  The body appointed to undertake this task will not provide me with any commercially sensitive information on individual companies. The body will receive information from the first quarter of 1995 from health insurers, which will provide it with the data to assess whether or not a risk equalisation scheme should be introduced.  I stress that such information would be entirely confidential to that body; its task would be to alert my Department to the possibility that the equalisation process, involving actual compensatory transfers <Col N="1515" /> between companies, may have to be introduced.  My Department will inform insurers over the next few weeks of the proposed arrangement in regard to the detailed operation of risk equalisation, including the data to be supplied from the first quarter of next year.</P>
    <P>The Health Insurance Authority will be established if risk equalisation is introduced or if in the interim period there are changes in the market which would justify it being established.  If risk equalisation were to be introduced, it would require some body which is independent of the Department of Health to administer the system, particularly in a situation where financial transactions were being made.  It would be inappropriate for a Government Department to involve itself in any such arrangement.  It will on its establishment assume all the regulatory functions to be carried out from July by the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Health.  I do not believe the arrangements to be put in place next month would of themselves justify the creation of another semi-State agency and I am satisfied that arrangements as outlined in the Bill will work satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I have described the main elements of the Bill and the remaining sections deal with standard provisions in regard to the maintenance of a register and the work of the authority, including matters relating to staffing.  In addition, under sections 10 and 12 I will appoint an assessor who will advise me from time on the appropriate level of minimum benefit and the level of costs that should be subject to risk equalisation.  It is likely that he or she will review annually minimum benefits to see whether they should be changed and, again perhaps on an annual basis, consider what changes might be made to those costs which must be risk equalised.</P>
    <P>The regulatory system must be kept under review and should in any event be the subject of a comprehensive examination not later than five years after its introduction.  Nobody can say with certainty how the market will respond to the new environment.  It may be that there <Col N="1516" /> are areas which will need to be changed so the principles enshrined in the Bill will not be undermined.  The advice to be tendered by the Authority, if established, and the evaluations conducted on an ongoing basis by my Department should together form a good foundation on which to conduct a full scale review.</P>
    <P>All parties involved in health insurance and private care have an interest in understanding the wider arena in which they operate.  No one interest can stand aside and demand that its needs be met, even if it means that others are adversely affected.  Service providers who would insist that their demands be put at the top of the agenda, no matter what the impact may be on the affordability and the attractiveness of health insurance, would be behaving in a short sighted way. If the price of health insurance escalates because of excessive demands by service providers, the losers will not be confined to any one insurer or provider.  We have seen elsewhere that increases over 30 per cent in one year can be applied by insurers and this has had a serious impact on members covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to see an adversarial relationship develop between insurers, service providers and consumers.  In order to create a better understanding between the different interests involved in private health insurance and private care, I proposed in the document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> that a monitoring and consultative mechanism be established which would be representative of these interests.  The forum to be established would include the Department of Health, the public health services and the institutional providers of private care.</P>
    <P>As the strategy document made clear, as Minister for Health I do not have any function in relation to the regulation, coordination or assessment of the services provided by private hospitals; the exceptions are maternity and psychiatric services. My overall objective is to do what I can to ensure that the highest standards of care are delivered to the entire population. The consultative arrangements set out in <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> will give me the opportunity to assess what <Col N="1517" /> needs to be done to develop the correct relationship between private and public sectors.</P>
    <P>The proposals incorporated in the Bill are designed to protect those features of our system which have worked so well and to allow the market place to operate and provide a wider range of choice to the consumer.  The proposals have been structured in the interests of the common good and with no other objective whatsoever in mind.  I believe this Bill and the related Bill which I will introduce later this year will set a solid foundation for health insurance for this decade and beyond.  I hope it will be as successful as the VHI Act, 1957, in laying the basis for affordable and attractive health insurance.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I commence my contribution, I would like to thank the Minister for circulating the briefing document in relation to this Bill to Members of the Oireachtas.  Most Members do not have research facilities and a document of this kind can be most helpful.  I hope the Minister's example will be followed by other Ministers when introducing legislation to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Health Insurance Bill, 1994, is to allow for competition and to regulate the Irish private insurance market on foot of the Third Directive on non life insurance.  Until now the VHI had a monopoly on health insurance. VHI subscriptions are based on the community rating principle, that is, everyone pays the same insurance premium irrespective of their risk of making a claim. These risks rise progressively with age so that community rating involves a transfer from the young to the old.  This transfer is justifiable on social grounds because the old are judged to be more vulnerable economically than the young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opposite to community rating is risk rating whereby premiums are calculated in relation to their probability that a class of subscriber will make a claim.  In a competitive environment it is believed that new entrants to health insurance, either domestic or foreign, <Col N="1518" /> would offer lower risk related schemes which would mean lower rates for young people.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies in its first report on the Voluntary Health Insurance Board &mdash; the Minister said it was an excellent report &mdash; indicated that it was its view that community rating is a principle worth defending.  It was of the view that a fully risk related scheme, which would rate subscribers according to age group, would not be acceptable.  I am also of the view that the elderly, who were net contributors to the VHI in their younger days, have a moral, if not a legal entitlement, to be net beneficiaries in their old age.</P>
    <P>In October 1990, the European Union Commission presented its proposals for the completion of the Internal Market in direct insurance.  The Irish Government was successful in its submission to the Commission.  As a result the Commission, in recognition of the social importance of private health insurance and in the interests of the general good, allowed member states to provide for community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and related matters.  The directive was accordingly amended.</P>
    <P>The community rating principle will now apply under the new EU regulations. Under this system, foreign competitors will not be able to cherry pick from the most lucrative end of the market by offering cheap insurance while refusing to entertain high risk categories.  Instead, they will have to tender for all age groups and offer prices which are reflected in the overall health costs.</P>
    <P>The cost of claims to insurers tends to rise when members pass the age of 50. The British health insurers will not be able to challenge the VHI's monopoly on the terms which operate in the domestic market.  Their premiums escalate as members get older and as a result the young pay little while the elderly pay a lot.  This approach has been ruled out here because of the Government supported amendment to the European Union's insurance directive.  As a result the only way that foreign companies will be able to gain a sufficient hold in the <Col N="1519" /> Irish market is through cutting their administrative costs, paying less to consultants, doctors and hospitals or charging below-cost premiums.  In case any foreign competitor would try to circumvent the system of community rating, the Minister has taken powers under section 12 of the Bill to introduce a risk equalisation scheme designed to compensate companies who are carrying a disproportionate number of high risks. New companies with better than average risk profiles would then have to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that since its introduction in 1957 the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme has been a great success, attracting almost 1.2 million members and providing voluntary health care for one-third of our population.  In anticipation of competition the VHI has confronted running costs and overheads aggressively.  This, in turn, has generated a running battle between the VHI and the hospital consultants over the level of professional fees.  Patients who attend some consultants &mdash; the Minister referred to this &mdash; find that they are under-insured and as a result receive an extra bill from the consultant.  This practice is known as balance billing.</P>
    <P>Recently a motion was passed by the Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, requesting the VHI to supply a list of all consultants serving the Eastern Health Board area and that those consultants who do not engage in balance billing be identified on the list by means of an asterisk.  Doctor Bernadette Carr replying on behalf of the chief executive stated:</P>
    <P>With respect to the request contained therein, I am pleased to inform you that our directory of consultants is complete and we shall be happy to forward you a copy.  However, I must emphasise that our directory is produced for circulation to general practitioners and may not be publicly displayed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> This information should be available to every member of the public who subscribes to a voluntary health scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House today opens the insurance market to European competition. In their report, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies recommended that an ombudsman be appointed to take account of all the necessary information, including information about consultants' fees and the incomes of comparable professions and to make recommendations about fee scales.  I suggest that an ombudsman would be the appropriate person to make recommendations as to whether information about consultants' fees and those engaged in balance billing should be made available to the public.  The only people who have published that list of consultants is the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  In the appendix they have listed those consultants who are not involved in balance billing.</P>
    <P>I note that a number of foreign insurance companies have shown an interest in the Irish market.  This will lead to better competition which should be to the benefit of the subscriber.  Competition must not be at the expense of quality.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for making the explanatory information document available to us.  It is extremely helpful and simplifies what is a technical Bill.  I urge other Ministers to follow this example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been very easy to have done very little work and to produce legislation in a short time which would have seen us in a lot of trouble.  This Minister has once again shown that this is not the way he approaches legislation or challenges.  Deregulation in all areas, open competition and the breaking down of monopolies has produced its own problems and this legislation, from what I can glean from the information document, from the Minister's speech and from the work the Minister has put into it, attempts to anticipate what might have <Col N="1521" /> happened if legislative action had not been taken.  The Minister seems to have succeeded.</P>
    <P>The further legislation which he will be bringing in later this year will copperfasten the VHI's excellent position as service providers; it has been one of the few private insurance service providers in this country.  That needs to be acknowledged and the Minister has done so. Above all else the Minister has said clearly again and again that the thrust of this legislation, and of his entire Ministry, is that he wants to ensure that whatever is done is for the general good, and I commend him for that.</P>
    <P>I was taken with the descriptions of how the insurance would work.  On a first reading I did not understand as I had never heard such terms as &ldquo;community rating&rdquo; and &ldquo;risk equalisation&rdquo;.  I presume the Minister had experience of them but if one had not, it would be very easy to embark on legislation which would allow competition from all sides. As Senator Doyle said, only the fittest would survive.</P>
    <P>A new phrase for me is &ldquo;inter-generational solidarity&rdquo;.  That is a lovely phrase and is one that should apply across the board.  The sentiment in the speech and to which Senator Doyle referred, of the younger people helping the older, is something which should apply not only to health insurance cover.  If it applied across the board we would have a completely different and maybe a better society.</P>
    <P>It is vital that any health insurers or health insurance providers must know before they enter the market that they will not be allowed to come in and offer to a niche in the market which is low risk and high pay.  Any insurance operator coming in will have to offer cover to people regardless of age, sex or health status.  I welcome that.  Similarly the Minister stated that the principle of lifetime cover will apply, although I am not sure how he will ensure that a company offers lifetime cover.  If a company goes down the tubes does that mean another company will have to take on its responsibilities? <Col N="1522" /> Nothing is permanent and pensionable any longer.</P>
    <P>Risk equalisation is very important for three reasons &mdash; the community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, but the Minister said he will be looking to see if this is necessary.  I thought it was implicit that the cover would have to be across the board and that if one insurer found it was carrying a high risk category and another was not, then automatically there would be some mechanism by which the risk would be shared.  Those are the principles in this legislation.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the section of the legislation which prohibits insurers from discriminating against people because of prospective suffering or because a person may be suffering from a chronic disease.  I commend him for his foresight because hugely improved diagnostic techniques and genetic counselling will become more evident during the Minister's term of office. If this is being laid down in law now does it mean that it did not apply before? There is a perception at least that certain categories of people cannot get health insurance; specifically, HIV sufferers or those with genetically inherited diseases who find it difficult to get medical insurance.  Would the Minister tell us if health insurers who are refusing cover &mdash; not life insurance cover &mdash; to HIV sufferers are acting outside of the law or if this is a new provision?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that people over 65 years of age must be allowed access to another health scheme if their insurers find themselves in difficulty, and that is to be welcomed.  I do not have great experience of the VHI as my insurance comes from my husband's employment.  The Minister referred to ancillary services.  My husband's health insurance scheme allows for dental care and GP visits quite successfully.  This should be considered in the context of new insurance schemes.  Such treatments are increasingly routine for families.  I have a bill of £1,800 currently for orthodontic treatment which is not refundable. However, such charges are ordinary and <Col N="1523" /> if one is in the older age category or if one has children one finds that one has regular £20 charges for GP visits.  Such charges put an additional burden on families and cannot, I understand, be recouped through the VHI.  They should be incorporated into the new schemes under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned psychiatric treatment and minimum benefits etc.  I had reason recently to come across the case of a young man who is suffering manic depression and is in a private insurance scheme.  It would appear that there is an unwritten decision &mdash; of which I am sure the Minister would not approve &mdash; by insurers not to cover people for psychiatric hospitals.  In the case I mentioned the GP urgently referred the man to a psychiatric hospital but the health insurers said that they would not pay the cost.  As a result the patient ended up in a very serious state within three days and the insurers agreed to the cover.  Is the Minister aware of such cases?  Is it permissible that an administrator who does not have a medical background can decide that they will not cover the members of a scheme for St. John of God's Hospital or St. Patrick's Hospital? I understand that there was a history of people &ldquo;booking themselves in&rdquo;, as it was termed, in times of stress; but I am talking about cases where a GP or a consultant decides that a patient needs and should have psychiatric treatment.  The Minister should address this issue.</P>
    <P>I am taken by the Minister's intent to watch advertising and promotion by insurers.  There should be a health warning on all advertising.  It would be great if the Minister had some power to clamp down on advertising as a whole, because it is damaging to one's health.  It would be for the good of the nation's health if the Minister could extend his powers to advertising generally.</P>
    <P>I do not know who decides fee levels or what power the Minister has in that regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but they vary from place to place.  It is a question of the marketplace dictating.  There is little cross party disagreement on this Bill.  Can alternative medicine be considered in this measure?  Under the VHI and other voluntary schemes alternative medicine is not covered in any form.  There is a greater recognition nowadays that it is more cost effective and seems to be quite successful.  The old view of its being dismissed as the preserve of quacks is long gone.  The Minister might consider for the future that recognised and accredited alternative practitioners would come within the scope of such schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill.  The general philosophy of the Bill appeals to me most because what comes over is the stress on the interests of the common good and this, after all, is the most important aspect of health care.</P>
      <P>If we look at how important health care is in any country we should look at the United States.  The President of the US feels that his presidency will hinge on whether he can or cannot get affordable available health care for everyone in what is the richest country in the world.  The US spends 15 per cent of its GNP on health care while in western Europe, where 7 to 8 per cent of GNP is spent on health care, we have a better level of health care for all our citizens.  We may be lacking some of the incredible institutions in the US but, as a practitioner, I would have to say that one could get a better standard of health care for all here than in that rich country.  Firing money at the health service will not necessarily make any difference; it is important to put thought and effort into it and that is what the Minister is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have what most people consider a good mix of public and private health care.  About 30 to 35 per cent of the population have been constantly opting for private health care insurance over the last 40 years.  This figure has fluctuated little, so there must be a satisfactory level of health care as people do not leave the private system to go into the public <Col N="1525" /> system.  At the same time I can say with my hand on my heart that while I recognise the deficiencies in the public health care system, I do not think that people are in serious ill health because of the divide between the public and private health care system.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister has put an important stress on the mix of public and private health care.  It is not just important from the point of view of the public hospitals because of the amount of money they get from private health care insurance, it is also extremely important from the private patient's point of view.  In some circumstances in health care nobody but the State can afford what is happening.  Institutions which buy expensive new technology have grave difficulties in keeping up to date with the latest technology.  Rather than firing out CAT scanners all at the same time to various hospitals, it is better to introduce such technology on a phased basis so that the newest model will constantly be coming in.</P>
    <P>In these fields better techniques and machines are arriving all the time and one does not want to be in the situation of having to get value out of a machine before it can be replaced.  Machinery makes no money while it is idle, and this is an important consideration for those buying it simply for private health care. Most of the machinery in the public hospitals is well utilised.  The machines bought for the private part of a public hospital are being utilised for public patients as well.  This crossover and mix of patient care has been well thought out and I commend the Minister for it.</P>
    <P>One should look carefully at why one should want private health care in the first place.  A great deal of the money one has to pay for private health care is for accommodation.  One may want the better accommodation, a single room with a telephone, television and so on. The hotel aspect of private health care must not be under-estimated.  It costs a substantial amount.  This, of course, is one of the aspects people like and for which they are prepared to pay.  They are also prepared to pay for other facilities <Col N="1526" /> that would also be desirable for those in public health care, such as a choice of doctor.  It is difficult to get this option if one is in public health care.  Patients are mainly sent to the doctor with the shortest waiting list.  I commend the Minister for giving another £10 million to shorten these waiting lists.  Giving £20 million this year and a further £10 million next year may seem an odd way to shorten these lists, but it is probably as good a way as any other.  There will always be waiting lists.</P>
    <P>A member of one of the medical journals asked me to comment on the amount of money the Minister had given to cover operations for varicose veins.  I said I had discovered there are approximately 1,100 people waiting for such operations, but the Minister has given enough money to cover 850 of them.  Some people are on several lists, waiting to see on which list they will get to the top first.  It is like having an egg in every basket watching to see which one hatches first.  The Minister may have made great inroads there. Giving a certain sum every year is as good a method as any, especially to those hospitals that are proving to be efficient in getting through waiting lists.  It is making a great difference to those on the waiting lists for plastic surgery, for example, which had recently got out of hand.  Not having to wait long for treatment is a good reason for opting for private health care, they can also schedule a suitable time for patients to go to hospital and this means they can plan ahead.  This is hard to do if one is on a public waiting list.  Operations may be cancelled month after month and a patient may be called and expected to go into hospital at a moment's notice.  However, the Minister is trying to deal with that.</P>
    <P>Community rating is essential, and I am glad the Minister has stressed this. Like Senator McGennis, I like this notion of generational solidarity; as Senator McGennis said, it would be good if it spilled over into more than the health service.  One aspect of the Bill made me anxious, and I will go into it in greater detail on Committee Stage.  What if one changes from one insurance company to <Col N="1527" /> another?  Could a gap develop?  The Minister rightly said that while enrolment has to be open to all, there must be some sort of a waiting time.  Could there be a waiting time of six weeks when one has finished with one company and goes to another?  This can happen with car insurance.  If one has not transferred car insurance from one company to another on the right day, one might not be insured for a certain period.  It happened to me once.  Mercifully, nothing happened to me in that time, but I thought I was insured.  I would not like to see gaps like that emerging in the health insurance area.  Hopefully, the Minister will cover this by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>Lifetime cover is also important.  If people develop a chronic disease, they should not be excluded from the service. Open enrolment is also important.  While a person can declare the illnesses he knows he has, what about unknown illnesses? Now that genetic screening is becoming more prevalent and common, insurance companies should not be able to discard people because they are likely to have cardiac problems, say, in their forties.  It is important to have open enrolment and community rating covered in our legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been wise in saying that the minimum cover of semi-private level for public hospitals is acceptable.  I would agree with that.  To force companies to have it at a higher level would increase the cost of health care.  A great deal of these costs cover hotel type accommodation.  Some people may want to be in private health care because they may want to choose their hospital, they do not want to go on waiting lists and they have a choice of consultant.  If I have to go to hospital &mdash; I have had to too often &mdash; I always go to a public ward of a public hospital where one has the advantage of being closely examined every day by many doctors, not only by one.  The intern does not want anything to go wrong, so she tells the senior house officer, who tells the intern, the registrar and so on.  It gives one a great sense of security, even if one only has a minor <Col N="1528" /> aliment.  The Minister has hit the right level there.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis raised other aspects, such as ancillary services that are not included in this Bill but are also important.  The Minister said insurance companies can bring in these services, but they should be made to look at them more seriously.  Dental care is now a major expense, often much more than medical expenses.  It was all right to exclude dental health care when it was considered acceptable to be given a pair of false teeth on one's 25th birthday but more emphasis should be put on this matter and the Minister could look at this area.  He has already done work in the areas of orthodontics and dental care. There is now a totally different attitude to dental care, and I am delighted to see it.  The Minister and his Department are stressing primary health care.  We want to see how general practice fees will be covered.  One wants to prevent referring on if at all possible and cover at primary level is important.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis mentioned alternative medicine, attitudes are changing towards this branch of medicine and it should be examined for the future.  It was heavily covered by the German health care service but due to high costs, especially in physical medicine, they had to cut back on it.  One must be careful here because while one may cut back on visits to health spas or chiropractors, one may be spending more on drugs and it is an arguable point where the savings are made and which option is better for the patient, who is our primary concern.</P>
    <P>In his health care strategy, the Minister has rightly stressed the importance of preventative medicine.  I especially wish to refer to those people outside the public service &mdash; they will be on too high an income level to avail of it &mdash; whom we should encourage to look after their health.  I particularly have in mind the Minister's health programme for women, to be introduced in the autumn, particularly things like cover for cervical smears and mammography for women between 50 and 64 years of age &mdash; a time when it is useful in the early diagnosis of <Col N="1529" /> carcinoma of the breast.  There is a type of cover but I want to ensure health insurers examine this as well.</P>
    <P>Convalescence is also important because it can get people out of expensive hospital care.  If home circumstances are suitable, especially for the elderly, one could almost send them home.  This is not appreciated enough by the public.  A great deal can be done in hospital, but it could also be done at home.  Our better socio-economic conditions enable many patients to be discharged sooner.  There is nothing magical about the new removal of the gall bladder; the change has come about because people live in better conditions than they did 20 to 30 years ago. The Minister should get insurers to consider convalescence from the point of view that it would save them money in terms of cost transfers from an expensive hospital bed to less expensive care.</P>
    <P>On the issue of balanced billing, the reason the VHI did not advise those who were not on balanced billing of the system was because it would have been considered to be a form of advertising. However, it must be pointed out to members of the public that when they make inquiries they are entitled to ask about balanced billing and if the amount provided by the VHI is in respect of the entire fee.</P>
    <P>However, there are problems with this because, for example, a person requiring hospital treatment may find that the surgeon is not involved in balanced billing, the anaesthetist is, the pathologist is not, but the radiologist is and so on.  It is therefore a complicated system if the patient is not dealing with one person.  In addition, in some specialities there are enormous expenses within the practise which have to be covered by the entire fee charged by the surgeon for any given operation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the idea of a health ombudsman, as a member of the medical profession I hope that such an institution is not necessary.  I would hate to think that the profession was in a position where complaints about it were so serious that it was felt desirable to appoint an ombudsman.  The profession has always <Col N="1530" /> policed itself in the past under the aegis of The Medical Council.  The new president of the council has advised that there will be greater transparency and openness by the council regarding complaints and dissatisfaction by patients, and hopefully this will continue.</P>
    <P>This issue is important, not only from the patient's point of view but also from that of the doctor.  The first ethical duty of a medical practitioner is to the patient. To allow a situation to develop where this was not to be the doctor's greatest priority would be very serious.  In this respect it would be unthinkable that as members of the profession we could ever hide behind the fact that complaints about us should be made to somebody else.  Complaints about us should be made to ourselves.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the new council being more open regarding complaints made to it and I hope that it could be seen that we in the profession can police ourselves and that the public do not feel obliged to have somebody speak on its behalf to us.</P>

      <P>This is probably another piece of legislation forced on us arising from our membership of the EU. However, if it opens up the market and allows for greater competitiveness which will help the people who have ultimately to pay, it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for allocating a further £10 million to the alleviation of the waiting lists.  This is to welcomed by all, including my own health board which has received approximately £800,000, some two thirds of which has been allocated to my own town of Letterkenny.  I am delighted with this development as, no doubt, is my colleague, Senator McGowan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This development is in line with the other positive measures the Minister has undertaken since entering office.  I welcome these, especially the measures taken in respect of the area of the mentally handicapped services.  The Minister advised that £25 million would be provided to this area and his subsequent allocation of this amount is most welcome. In addition, the extension of <Col N="1531" /> dental care to school going children from 12 to 16 years of age is an excellent measure which I appreciate and welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The VHI has operated a monopoly hitherto, and in this respect the allowing of competitiveness is a good idea.  The VHI has served the country well, but as in other areas the monopoly situation under which it has operated will not last indefinitely.  The coming changes will be for the common good ultimately, as they will enable people to shop around for health cover. If a better deal can be provided, people will take it and in this respect the new situation will be similar to the car insurance market.</P>
    <P>People work for their wages so they are entitled to decide how they may be spent and it is an important development if the measures provided by the Bill offer a better health service for wage earners and their families.  In terms of priority, payment for a mortgage is first, but this would be followed by payment for a health service.  In this respect I am pleased to note that the VHI is gearing itself for the impending competition.  The company may have been condemned for its premium increases over the years, but it has prepared for this development and hopefully it will survive in the new market.</P>
    <P>The Minister has advised that approximately 35 per cent of the country's population is covered by health insurance.  My main concern is in respect of the 65 per cent of the population who, to some extent, are unable to pay for such insurance.  While a significant proportion of these people are covered by medical cards, there are many &mdash; for example a significant number of PAYE workers &mdash; who do not qualify for medical cards and who cannot afford health insurance.  Such people look at those who can afford such cover and at those on medical cards and ask themselves for what purpose are they working.  Hopefully measures will be taken in the future to make life easier for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> When I worked in the psychiatric service many years ago there were special salary protection schemes for those working in the health services.  Such schemes are different to the matter under consideration today, but a noticeable feature of these schemes was that they were very attractive, providing full cover from day one.  They appeared to be cheap, the average premium at the time for male nurses being £16 per month.  However, when a situation arose where, for example, five or six people left the scheme through sickness or retirement, the premiums exploded, increasing by 60 per cent or so.  This often compelled those who had contributed to the scheme to leave it, having paid premiums for ten or more years.</P>
    <P>The same history often unfolded with female insurance schemes, where cover was more difficult to obtain due to an apparently higher risk factor.  It transpired in one instance, in respect of a group of people whom I represented, that the cost of their insurance had increased by some 120 per cent.  Despite the opposition to such increases, the insurance companies had themselves covered by the small print of their policies.  Matters such as this must be considered when creating a competitive market.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the new situation is to ensure that insurance is affordable to the elderly, chronically ill and those who have serious illnesses.  For those who have reached the age of 65 years and have worked all their lives, health insurance is important.  The Minister provides, under section 8 of the Bill, for insurers not to refuse a contract to a person under 65 years of age.  In this respect I note that the means of placing and selecting business is to be given further consideration.</P>
    <P>Regarding those requiring psychiatric services, this is another area which should be monitored to ensure that such people are given the care and protection they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Doubtless the Minister will ensure that people will obtain benefit and value for their money in this area.  The Bill is therefore to be welcomed and commended.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation as it updates the area of health insurance which is an important aspect of our lives.  I compliment the Minister, and as a member of the North Western Health Board I am aware of the Minister's value and concern.  I compliment him on his approach and availability. While he is a Labour Party Minister and I am a Fianna Fáil Party Senator, I have had no difficulty with the Minister, but rather the best of receptiveness and response on all occasions.  I am grateful to the Minister for his readiness to discuss health problems with any elected public representative, which is as it should be.</P>
      <P>No parliamentary draftsman or Minister for Health could ever claim to have covered completely the field of health insurance because one is dealing with changing situations every day of the week.  The more service you provide the more recognition is needed for other sections like the dental service.  I would encourage those who can afford it to join the VHI.  I have been a Member of this House for 25 years and I have had occasion to call pretty heavily on the VHI.  If I were depending on the contributions that I made during those years to get medical treatment I would be lying in a box somewhere up in Donegal and would not be here at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aspect that has not been focused on very much is that vast section of the community who continually pay into a service that they never benefit from. Some people continue to snipe at the VHI but from personal experience I can refute that criticism.  The VHI has provided a marvellous service for the country. Before we encourage others to compete it is the Minister's job to see that anybody coming in, wherever they come from, will compete with the VHI on equal terms.  I am sure that the Minister will discharge that obligation.  Others coming in to compete should know the conditions and there should be no opt out clause, however well written or legally phrased it may be.  Only the clearest language should be used to let it be understood beyond doubt by those who benefit from the health service that they will not <Col N="1534" /> have to employ a solicitor to interpret the quality of the offer they are getting from outsiders.  The Minister should force competitors coming into this country to have simple language to describe their packages.  I do not know of a single case where the VHI has tried to opt out on legal grounds because of flaws in the agreement or a badly written contract. That fact should be valued.  I have no difficulty in saying that and I say it as somebody who has benefited substantially from VHI membership.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is constantly reviewing this vast area which is necessary. If VHI members go to a doctor some are admissible and some are not. There has to be simplification and doctors' fees must be regulated on an ongoing basis.  The doctor must receive a fee that covers the service he provides. The Minister must supervise the functioning of the VHI or any other voluntary insurance company in operation.  The regulations have to be simple and clearly understood.  I welcome the introduction of the revised regulations in the Bill and I want to thank the Minister for his obvious concern in updating the legislation.</P>
    <P>I was at a meeting in Sligo to discuss the report <i>Developing the West Together,</i> where a young, energetic university graduate spoke about how bad the services were in the west,.  He spoke about transport, potholes and cuts in the health service.  He had good elocution and was getting his message through to his audience. When he had finished I asked how much of a cut had been made in the health service.  He said he did not know. I informed him that the health bill for the north west region is £150 million and is increasing by 10 to 15 per cent a year.  I told him that I did not know of a single year in which there had been a cut.  I cautioned him and suggested that he should get his facts together.  It is the easiest thing to get a slogan going about health cuts, which to some extent has been successful.  Yet there have been no health cuts at all in this country.  There are increased demands for health services, which is slightly different.  It is our job to highlight these and I am satisfied <Col N="1535" /> that the present Minister for Health is actively responding to all cases in a positive way.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the Minister has received such a warm welcome from the senior coalition party in the form of Senator McGowan.  It is a particularly deserved tribute.  I had not intended to speak in this debate.  I actually came in because I wanted to speak on the Report Stage of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill but I had no idea that it was going to get such an easy passage through the House.  This may explain why my speech will be uncharacteristically short.  I welcome, however, the opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister and to raise a couple of points about this Bill.  I have also taken the opportunity to put down an amendment. I hope that that will be all right and will not cause any great problems.  The amendment I have sought to put down is the simple addition of the words &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; in page 7 of the Bill where it says:</P>
      <P>...without prejudice to the generalities of subsection (1), premiums payable under health insurance contracts should not be made by reference to (a) the age or sex...</P>
      <P>I put in &ldquo;sex or sexual orientation&rdquo; because, as the Minister knows, this House has established a tradition of adding the phrase sexual orientation into Government legislation almost as a matter of course.  This is a good principle, particularly with regard to health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some four or five years ago I was asked to be the keynote speaker at the Insurance Industry Federation.  It was a big gathering of 700 or 800 people in Jurys Hotel in Ballsbridge.  I was briefed by workers inside the insurance industry as well as by people who were concerned on this matter.  As I understand it, the principle of the Minister's interest as outlined in his speech and also in the explanatory memorandum is that people should not be disadvantaged by belonging <Col N="1536" /> to particular groups, age categories, sex and so on.  One of the things that worried me &mdash; and people inside the insurance industry who contacted me because they felt they could make their point clear through me rather than by making it themselves &mdash; was that, particularly with regards to Aids, application forms for life insurance were being circulated which made it clear that insurance companies were either rejecting out of hand people who were placed in risk categories or applying considerably higher premiums to them.  This was the case even if, and I should say particularly if, they were responsible in their behaviour and took the precaution of ascertaining through blood tests whether they had been exposed to the HIV infection.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this is a bad principle. If people are responsible, if they monitor their health and take a blood test to establish what their HIV status is and it is negative, they should certainly not be penalised by an additional premium in that situation.  This was what was happening at that point.  I raised it with the Minister who then had responsibility for insurance, Deputy Seamus Brennan.  He called in the insurance people and there was some degree of discussion.  I understand that the situation did change a little bit, but not to the entire satisfaction of people who contacted me and claimed that they were being required to go for tests if they said they were part of a risk category.  For example, if they said they were homosexual they were compelled to take a test and were then given an extra loading.  For that reason it might be useful if the Minister would consider the addition of &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; at this point.</P>
    <P>I was in New York ten days ago; alas, I missed the World Cup.  I was very studious; as I had to mark examination papers I spent my whole time in a hotel room.  For relaxation I watched a television channel which broadcast nothing but American Senate committees.  I watched with great interest as Senator Edward Kennedy, who chairs a committee which deals with a similar area to <Col N="1537" /> that which we are discussing, was probing the question of health insurance.  He argued for the inclusion of sexual orientation. I was surprised that the Republican vice-chariman of the committee, whom I had anticipated to be antagonistic to this, accepted it completely, although she was more delicate about accepting other proposals Mr. Kennedy was advocating at the time.  I hope, particularly with regard to the question of AIDS, that the Minister might feel able to look at this.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely versed in the issue of competition.  Although I am a three piece suited socialist, and am not ashamed of this, I think one can tolerate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The principles enunciated by the Minister are very good: the requirement to protect the general good, to maintain social solidarity where health insurance is concerned and strive to ensure it will remain available and affordable to those who most need it &mdash; the elderly, the chronically sick and those struck down by serious illness.  I detect under the wording of certain sections of the Bill a sensitivity to people who are chronically ill or HIV positive.  These people are vulnerable and need special protection.  It is important, in an era when we are allowing the introduction of a degree of competition, that these principles should be stated.  The insurance world is a simple mathematical one.  It is involved in the calculation of risks and this is how it sets premiums.  Being sensitive to people who may become chronically ill or are HIV positive may involve <Col N="1538" /> an expense and I welcome the enunciation of this principle by the Minister.</P>
      <P>We are a people who, in general terms, take an interest in health.  This is demonstrated by the figures the Minister placed on the record.  Some 1.3 million persons, 35 per cent of the total population, are already involved in these schemes as I also am.  The VHI is an extremely good, socially beneficial operation. I have been a member of its Trinity College group scheme for many years.  I regret that I never had the opportunity to collect any money from it because I suffer from notoriously good health but at least there is the reassurance of having that safety net there.  This is particularly the case if one is single and cannot necessarily call on the extended family to nurse one through illness.  The fact that one can with a calm conscience have whatever hospital and medical treatment is necessary without the additional strain of economic worry is an important factor in living a civilised life.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the medical profession.  We have extremely high standards of caring, qualification and expertise not just among doctors, whom I regard highly, but among nurses, medical technicians and laboratory staff.  Even though I have never been seriously ill, I occasionally have to go for tests of various kinds when I get bugs of one sort or another and the degree of human concern &mdash; I suppose one could call it public relations &mdash; and the bedside manner are different in quality in this country from that which obtains in most other European countries.  This is why Irish doctors and nurses are in such high demand all over the world.  It is not inappropriate to make some reference to this during this debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome that the Minister has committed himself to a mix of private and public hospitals.  I would hate to see the day when ill health became a resource which could be industrially exploited.  We should never tolerate this.  The misfortune of ill health is something for which all of us should bear some degree of responsibility and I am glad this principle is also accepted by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> It is important that the Minister should regulate the insurance industry.  He stated that a further Bill will be introduced later in the year.  It is important that the State keeps a watching brief on behalf of citizens in this area because we have seen the collapse of travel companies. At present people are stranded in Orlando; at least they have good weather and they can watch the soccer on television. However, It would be far worse if people accepted the blandishments of an alien insurance network trying to penetrate the Irish market and then found they were not sufficiently underwritten and were exposed to risk at a time when their health was vulnerable.  I know there is a legal phrase, <i>caveat emptor,</i> let the buyer beware, but in this case it is appropriate that the State should hold a watching brief and ensure that defective products are not widely marketed in this jurisdiction and that people are not vulnerable to them.  Senator Henry told me it is important that people know what they are getting when they purchase an insurance policy.  The Minister has shown a degree of concern in this area which is heartening.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and am glad the Minister has further enhanced his reputation by taking these steps.  I hope it may be possible for him, in the light of what I have said, to introduce the phrase &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; and accept the amendment.  Even before the recent decriminalisation, a previous Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry introduced a degree of protection in employment in the public service on the basis of HIV status, full blown AIDS status and sexual orientation.  It is not a madly adventurous step but one which could be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. Unlike Senator Norris, I do not claim to be a socialist.  I was delighted to see references in the Minister's speech to responses to customers' requirements, value for money to consumers, encouraging innovation, awareness of market opportunities and the dangers of niche <Col N="1540" /> marketing.  I congratulate him on the thought that has gone into the Bill and the effort to get the balance right between a market driven health insurance and one protected by the State.</P>
      <P>I have no quarrel with the general purpose of the Bill but I have a major problem with the provision of a health insurance authority.  I am amazed at the number of State bodies which have been established during the short time I have been a Member, which is about 18 months.  It seems that setting up a new body has become almost a knee jerk response to every administrative need.  It is time somebody shouted stop, and this is what I am doing now.</P>
      <P>I see no reason the functions envisaged in this Bill cannot be carried out with perfect efficiency by the two relevant Departments, the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The latter is at present responsible for the regulation of the entire insurance industry.  This arrangement seems to work perfectly well and without any separate authority.  The notion of setting up a separate arms length authority to regulate a small part of the overall insurance business does not make sense to me.  Every time a State body is set up there are pluses and minuses.  The main plus is that it gives a necessary degree of flexibility to a commercial operation which cannot be provided by a Department because of the restrictions of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, etc.  Another advantage is that it allows bringing a wide range of outside expertise on to the board.  Neither of these factors applies here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The downside of setting up a State body is that it reduces accountability, it becomes more difficult for the Oireachtas to scrutinise its activities and, just as importantly, it creates expense.  Every State body, no matter how tiny, becomes a little empire in itself.  It has to have a board, a chief executive, an administrative set up of its own, its own premises, logo and lavish annual report.  All those items are fine if they are needed. However, they are a total waste of time and taxpayers' money if the work could <Col N="1541" /> just as efficiently be done within the existing public service framework.</P>
    <P>In this case it may be argued that the health insurance authority is not being brought into existence now.  The Minister did a great job of explaining that it will be only introduced if risk equalisation is introduced.  It is, therefore, being put on the shelf as a contingency but it could be summoned up at any time in the future if the Minister of the day thinks there is a need for it.  In my opinion, that actually makes the situation much worse.  It is one thing to come to the House and say we need a new State body now and give the reasons.  However, it is a totally different matter to come to the House and say there is a State body which we might need at some time in the future so we are putting it in place now on the off chance that we will need it when risk equalisation comes in.</P>
    <P>A Government should not be in the business of setting up shelf companies, as I suggest this is.  It should only set up bodies when it needs them.  If at some stage in the future there is a genuine need for a health insurance authority, then the Government of the day should bring that need to this and the other House and the legislation should be put in place then. One of the many problems about doing it in this way is that as long as this authority is just a remote possibility the provision setting it up will not get the same scrutiny as they would if it was a reality which would come into place in the following week or month.</P>
    <P>There is a major question mark over whether we need a health insurance authority at all; there is an even bigger question mark over whether we should be setting it up on the off chance that we might need it at some time in the future. I appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to striking out Part IV of this Bill in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The VHI is one of the most important bodies in this country in that it provides cover for people when they are ill and require hospitalisation or medical treatment.  People regard any discussion on matters relating to health <Col N="1542" /> in an emotive manner.  Some people question the increases in fees.  Many people believe that the service they are receiving is not as good as it should be. As I said, it is a very emotive subject about which people feel very aggrieved on many occasions.  The VHI has made a valuable contribution to private care in hospitals.  I understand the VHI pay about £60 million each year on behalf of people who receive hospital treatment.</P>
      <P>Since the VHI was set up in 1957 by the then Minister for Health, Mr. Tom O'Higgins, it has been of enormous importance.  When one looks at the VHI report and accounts for 1993, one appreciates just how important it is.  As the Minister said, each year about 1.3 million people require cover from the VHI, a vast number.  Some years ago the VHI was in considerable disarray.  There were problems about reserves and its level of debt.  In the year ended 28 February 1993 the VHI showed a surplus of £5.8 million; the previous year it had a surplus of £8.4 million.</P>
      <P>I am still concerned about the level of reserves in the VHI, which stands at about £36.9 million.  The organisation is going to face major competition from Britain &mdash; perhaps we will have some competition from Europe but the main competition will be from the British insurance companies &mdash; and we have to be particularly careful here.</P>
      <P>The VHI does not have too many flaws.  I have a high regard for that body. I am apprehensive that in the future many younger people and those who move from one company to another will be attracted to some of the companies which will be brought to their attention by very good advertising and PR campaigns.  We must ensure that people are not attracted away from the VHI into other companies where at a later stage elderly people or long stay patients find that they are not able to obtain the cover they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that people have the same VHI cover available in their later as well as their younger years.  That is the one worry people have.  Even at present I am not entirely happy that sufficient <Col N="1543" /> numbers of people have cover.  I believe there is a cut off point where people are not cared for after a specific period. When somebody becomes ill they should be cared for as long as they have health problems.  This is something we should examine.  If we do not attend to our duty here and try to ensure that there are substantial reserves in the VHI, we could be leaving the VHI vulnerable when it has to face competition from British medical insurance boards which have vast resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>One of the areas about which I feel very strongly is dental care.  We should examine how we can provide dental care under the VHI.  Sufficient time or attention has not been given to this and I ask the Minister to see how this can be done because it is of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>I am not going to discuss the details of the Bill as it can be dealt with on Committee Stage. However, I am a little concerned about section 9 of the Bill which deals with the prohibition of, termination of or refusal to renew the health insurance contract.  This will be prescribed by regulations but I am nervous that bodies would be able to refuse cover.  The Minister mentioned this in his speech and referred to people submitting an application for health insurance cover. He also mentioned that fraud is one exception.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to situations where errors are made on application forms.  I do not have the exact quotation but I think he referred to mistakes or serious errors in the completion of forms. I would caution the Minister here.  Some irregularities may be accidental as people may not have been aware of the problems they had at particular stages in their lives. I ask him to be very careful.  I am certain he will be deligent in drafting any regulations and I would hate to see people penalised because of errors in the completion of application forms.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Finance Bill I raised a matter in relation to the VHI; the Minister was not present on that occasion.  I was speaking about the <Col N="1544" /> former chief executive officer, Mr. Ryan, whose employment has since terminated. I was reading the annual report of the VHI which was signed by the chairman Mr. Noel Hanlon.  The chairman referred to the staff and stated:</P>
    <P>It is my pleasant duty to thank the chief executive Mr. T.R. Ryan and his management team and all of the board's staff for their commitment and energy during the past year.  A considerable amount of change and reorganisation has taken place and this has been embraced with enthusiasm by all concerned.</P>
    <P>When this was signed on 10 June 1993 apparently the chairman was quite happy with the work of the chief executive.  On the last occasion I said that the chairman had a car valued at £100,000.  I understand that is incorrect and that the value is considerably less than £50,000.  I would like to place on record that I accept that fact.  The chairman has written to me to that effect and I am certain that it is correct.</P>
    <P>The VHI is facing considerable competition. I am unhappy about the difficulties that arose and I am concerned about them.  I believe the manner of the departure of the chief executive is a matter of public concern.  It is something on which I would like the Minister to comment this afternoon.  We are facing major competition from British firms.  It worries me that a chairman, supported by the board, had the position of chief executive officer terminated.  I understand that he received a sum of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect to you, Sir, and to Senator McGowan, I wish to put on record that we are discussing the future of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board which is of fundamental importance to 1.3 million people who have made regular payments. This is not a personal attack on anybody.</P>
      <P>A dedicated person who had contributed an enormous amount to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, who had given a lifetime's work to this board, found himself without the support of the board.  I feel very aggrieved about this.  I have a high regard for the Minister but I am disappointed that on this occasion he did not pay sufficient attention to what was happening.  He had a duty to ensure that normal policy was adhered to.  The day to day running of the board is a matter for the chief executive officer; policy matters are dealt with by the board.  In this instance I was very concerned about it.  We do not want politics brought into a board of that nature.  It certainly has to be at arm's length and that is very important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The daily running of the organisation is the responsibility of the chief executive.  Policy is decided by the chairman and board.  It is important that both functions be separate and the Minister would agree with me in that regard. We must ensure that the organisation is run in that fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn was correct in his point about the bodies, authorities and boards we establish.  There is no means of having a proper discussion on these in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Some matters can be discussed in the Committee of Public Accounts and other fora. However, it is essential that public representatives have a right and an opportunity <Col N="1548" /> to discuss and comment on the establishment of boards and authorities in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I support most of the content of this Bill.  It is important and welcome.  I look forward to the introduction of the other Bill to which the Minister referred.  The information document furnished by the Minister was of considerable benefit.  It discussed matters such as age of enrolment, waiting periods, the factors involved in risk equalisation and so forth. It was helpful and informative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is progressive and caring legislation which should be widely welcomed.  This Minister, during his one and a half years in office, has made a greater impact on the health sector than any previous Minister in the history of the State has made in the equivalent time. I have been critical of the Minister on particular issues during the last year and I will continue to be critical as required. However, the commitment he has shown and the progress he has made are reflected in this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a good example of how taking a political philosophy and softening and broadening it in response to the common good can culminate in legislation which protects people.  This legislation is a source of reassurance to many people in this country.  Many people have been asking questions about the effect of the Single Market on them.  They worried about companies which, in another context, only want to insure safe 45 year old drivers and how that would affect people with difficulties and problems.  I could not give a greater welcome to the crucial points of this Bill, although I may disagree with aspects of it.  There are many measures of democracy, including access to health, education and the law.  We are discussing health today although this Bill does not deal with free access to health. However, we are discussing the creation of the so-called level playing pitch in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill permits the opening up of the market.  It is noteworthy that a Labour Party Minister has introduced this Bill which allows market forces to play their <Col N="1549" /> part, in a controlled fashion.  That is how the system must work in the future.  We cannot ignore the fact that market forces will determine and have determined many aspects of our lives.  Those with an ostrich like policy in that regard are the people who do not make progress and who go out of business.  We must be competitive and we must ensure that everybody is providing an equal service.</P>
    <P>I am pleased about the community rating.  Only two years ago people were wondering what would happen.  There was a big debate about whether we should opt for community rating or throw it open and let the strong survive and the weak get sicker and sicker until eventually we would be unable to pay for them. We have seen that happen in other supposedly wealthy countries.  It is now impossible to pay for treatment when one is in America and we certainly do not want to take that road.</P>
    <P>Open enrolment with a safety net built into it means that a person cannot simply join.  I know the relevance of that provision from my experience of organising a teachers' health scheme.  Many insurers, as a marketing ploy, will open the market now and again to increase membership.  That is a risk on their part. They measure the risk and pay for it and they pay for it for a long time.  It is important that there is a time lapse in order to have a fair approach.  Something similar could be done about car insurance.  Perhaps there could be a type of community rating in that sector. People could pay for their accidents; there should be a more open and honest way of approaching it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>More people would pay more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We would pay a little more and we would be more careful about congratulating people who claim above the odds for insignificant accidents. If it was our own money we might be more responsible in showing disapproval of people who play the system. However, that is a peripheral point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> It is important that group discounts are continued.  I confess to a personal interest in this regard because I deal with the largest group in the VHI at present. Group discounts are a useful encouragement to people within a group of workers to buy health insurance.  I had an interest in the larger families policy although I am past the stage where it makes a great deal of difference to me. Insurance can be expensive when multiplied by five plus two adults.  I am, for that reason, pleased about the risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>I will risk the wrath of the Chair by recounting my experience of the efficiency of the VHI on a personal basis. It was less than satisfactory.  I have experienced some of the problems people have outlined.  On one occasion my child had a reasonably serious accident on holiday in France.  The child required an operation on our return.  It was an emergency so we went through the outpatients' department of Temple Street Hospital.  As we were registering I was asked if we were members of VHI and I answered in the affirmative.  The child was operated on successfully.  However, I was left with a serious problem.  I received a bill from the consultant, the person who operated and the anaesthetist. I examined the policy and saw that because the child had only gone to outpatients I should not have to claim.</P>
    <P>At that stage I wrote to the medical team and told them I was not claiming under VHI because it was covered under the scheme.  I received a long letter in reply to the effect that if I did not claim from the VHI the medical team would lose money.  I do not know who operated on my child; there was a team of doctors but there was no question of a choice of doctors.</P>
    <P>I had just been elected to this House and I sent the file to the VHI.  I received a reply from a senior source in the body whose name I will not mention who told me I was right but the easiest thing to do was to claim because there was no cost, as I knew already.  I never did anything on the matter &mdash; the file is still extant &mdash; but it annoyed me, as does overclaiming <Col N="1551" /> for car insurance.  Although there was no cost involved to me, I was not prepared to claim and be refunded.  It was some years later that this became public and people are now well aware of this problem.</P>
    <P>I use this to illustrate my point.  I do not fully understand the section about risk equalisation but I fully approve of its philosophy.  I also agree we should not support or give safety nets to people who cannot make their operation efficient and effective by lumping all risks in the insured and insuring population together.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good day's work.  There may be aspects of the legislation which cause difficulties but I approve the underlying philosophy, the attempt to create a realistic level playing pitch, the openness with which this has been approached, the way it has addressed difficult issues and answered the questions of many old, insecure people who are looking to a future when they may not be able to afford health insurance.  They will certainly be fully re-assured by this legislation.</P>
    <P>This may not be a function of the VHI, but a user's group or council could be highly effective.  This would not be a forum for whingers but it would look at the operation of the scheme to ensure people were getting good value for their insurance premia.  The council could raise the questions Senator Enright has put to the appropriate people.  It would also be a clear voice for people.  Perhaps it could be done through the concept of a health ombudsman but there is a need for linkage in this area so that people have a voice in the system that will raise questions and deal with matters.  The idea of a user's council or a health ombudsman should be given further consideration.</P>
    <P>This is important and welcome legislation which will make many people involved in the health insurance industry in Ireland and abroad consider their future.  Then insured people will get a reasonable level of coverage for a fair price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators who contributed to a fine debate.  It was more extensive and prolonged in this House than the other House, because of the pressure of time there.  It again proves the value of this Chamber as a House of review, because important issues have arisen here.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle welcomed the Bill and, like every other speaker, he strongly supported its basic principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, which amount to social solidarity and are the basic building blocks of the legislation.  He mentioned the thorny question of balanced billing and in my contribution I said I was concerned about this on a number of fronts.  The primary one is public information, because people have a consumer right to know what they are buying.  Before they have any procedure performed they should know if there will be an additional cost.  I am anxious to assist any mechanism which gives consumers that basic information. Some professionals have argued that to give that basic information amounts to advertising, but I believe that must be questioned.  I support access to the information.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis made important points in a long contribution.  She spoke about the effect of open competition.  I am not convinced that such competition in health insurance would be to the advantage of the consumer.  We have a comparatively small health market in Ireland and there is no vast array of key professionals competing against each other in a range of specialties.  I am not sure a number of competing insurance companies seeking to buy the skills of a limited pool of people would not in itself be inflationary, rather than depress the price of health procedures.  At least currently one insurance provider can talk to health providers and keep a cap on inflation pressures.  If there are competitors in the market the reverse may be true.  However, we have to live within the diktats of the EU and I have to accept open competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last year many issues have taken up an inordinate amount of time <Col N="1553" /> in my Department, some of which have come before this House, ranging from anti-D to child care to the Kilkenny incest case.  This insurance issue has been ongoing since I became Minister 18 months ago.  It is not normal to do so, but I pay tribute to the officials in my Department, whom I am not allowed to name but are sitting in this House, who have put tremendous work into the drafting of this legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is unique; there is no similar provision elsewhere.  They have checked in other countries to find comparable systems. On foot of the last year's work, the principle of community rating is now becoming a desirable objective in the EU, whereas we were almost alone in advocating it at the start of this process. Other European countries are considering enshrining community rating in their basic legislation.  There has been a tremendous amount of good assessment, good work and positive thought put into the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis was unclear about lifetime cover.  It means people do not have their cover terminated by an insurance company when they enter the risk age category.  There is an ancillary to that in that should a company cease to trade, it will give the right to an insurer who has paid premia over a number of years to have automatic access to another insurance company extant in the market. Then someone will not be left high and dry at a vulnerable age, perhaps having paid contributions for 30 years without ever drawing upon them, as Senator Norris said.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have asked how risk equalisation will work.  We have looked at various mechanisms and the one envisaged under the Bill is complex.  It requires independent assessment of the risks in the various portfolios held by insurance operators in Ireland and a direct transfer of resources from one to another.  If there is a distortion so that one insurance company is left with a more vulnerable or aging group, this must be compensated for.  We have carefully looked at the Australian mechanism, which has a large number of insurance operators, approximately <Col N="1554" /> 40, who operate the principle of community rating.  It is a complex situation for them.  It is a fluid situation, as Senators have said, which will require careful monitoring and adjustment because we must ensure that we preserve people's rights to affordable private health insurance in this country.  As other Senators have said, health insurance and affordable health care is an important international question which is on the agendas of every Government in the world at present.  It is a crucial issue and it is important we get it right.  We have got a lot right in our health services, therefore we can be proud of them.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the role of the Health Insurance Authority will not be brought into operation unless there is sufficient competition in the market, sufficient pressures to bring in risk equalisation and a monitoring system to carry this out.  That will be the function of the Health Insurance Authority.</P>
    <P>Several Senators mentioned ancillary services, particularly dental services.  In the Bill we have defined a basic package which must be on offer as a basic minimum. This means that useless insurance cover cannot be sold to someone, that people cannot be lulled into a false sense of security by believing they are covered, only to find that the insurance cover is useless when they need it.  We have defined the basic minimum package, which includes &ldquo;hospital inpatient treatment, including day care; hospital outpatient treatment; consultants fees; maternity benefits on a grant-in-aid basis; convalescence; psychiatric treatment; and substance abuse treatment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We could have included other things. For example, we had a long debate about including general practice.  As Senators will know, particularly those who have read the strategy document, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future,</i> I have a strong desire to develop general practice in this country.  I am loath to exclude that from a core package of services, although it has been excluded from the basic insurance schemes of many other European countries. However, if we include general practice, do we include dental care?  We <Col N="1555" /> have defined the basic affordable package, but we hope people will buy more developed packages, which will include dental care and general practice.</P>
    <P>I do not want to put too many legislative impediments in the way of competition. If we want to embrace competition, we should do so in a controlled way which will benefit the consumer. We need as much consumer choice as possible in the prescribed framework.  If someone is able to add a package which includes general practice for a competitive premium, people will accept it if a number of insurance companies are operating it.  Senator McGennis mentioned psychiatric cover; this will be covered.</P>
    <P>We have considered advertising for some time and controls have been included in the Bill to allow me to interfere where advertising is misleading. That is a direct response to experiences we discovered abroad, where people were lulled into a false sense of security and were sold a pup by some insurance companies around the world.  I am determined not to allow that to happen here. It is always dangerous to say it will not happen here, but we will do our best and adopt the powers to address that issue.</P>
    <P>The VHI is the main insurance operator here and alternative medicine packages are, as Senators are aware, specifically excluded in its exclusion clause.  However, it is open to any insurance company to offer them as an addition, particularly if people want them and they can be competitive, because that is what competition is supposed to mean.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry made some positive comments about the Irish health system and the fact that it bears up fairly well to international comparison.  I agree with that comment.  The more I see other health systems, the more impressed I am by our own.  We can be proud of the health services in this country, but we cannot be complacent because of the enormous pressure of new developments. However, we cover more people to a greater extent than any comparable system I have seen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> I agree with Senator Henry's view that there is a good public and private mix. As regards the juxtaposition of public and private care in this country, I have said to my officials that I want private facilities, as far as is practicable, in the public system so that they will achieve two things.  They will generate income for the public system, which is welcome, and they will also mean that the best consultants will be available on a common campus to public and private patients, rather than having a structural division between the two.  This is in everyone's interest.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Henry for her comment about the waiting lists.  Last year people took a jaundiced view when I said we could do that amount of work for £20 million.  We did a remarkable amount of work on a contract basis with each health agency and health provider.  We did 18,000 plus additional procedures for that amount of money and it has had a remarkable impact on the waiting lists.  It has reduced the long stay waiting lists, which have been increasing over the last five to ten years, by 57 per cent in one year.  For the first time we have not only halted the increase, but we have substantially reduced it and we intend, under the new round, to do an additional 12,500 procedures this year.  This is in addition to the increased base line activities we have negotiated with the health agencies in the first part of the year.  We will achieve my first objective of not having a child on a waiting list for longer than six months for any elective procedure by the end of this year and not having an adult on an elective waiting list for longer than 12 months by the end of this year.  Those are my short term objectives.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry supported the three basic principles and she talked about a number of issues, including balanced billing and preventive medicine.  I share her views on those issues.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Maloney for his kind comments.  I mentioned my view on competition. He also mentioned the fact that 35 per cent of the population are covered by voluntary health insurance and he asked what type of cover the remainder <Col N="1557" /> had.  Almost 40 per cent are covered by medical cards and have comprehensive access to all medical services free of charge.  Every citizen in Ireland has free access to public medicine, regardless of income.  Anyone who has a medical condition and who chooses not to go private has a right to a public bed in a public hospital and to be treated by a consultant.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator McGowan for his kind comments.  I agree with his point that health systems are constantly changing. It reminds me of a comment I heard that constant change is here to stay.  It is a fluid situation.  Grappling with health problems is like wrestling with a balloon in that when one suppresses one end, something else springs up.  There is always a different and exciting challenge and I have had an interesting 18 months in the job.  I have taken careful note of Senator McGowan's comments about his personal experience in the VHI.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris accepts and supports the basic principles of the Bill.  I am interested in the fact that he spent time in the United States watching C-SPAN, where one can not only see the US Congress but also the Canadian Parliament. I was a member of the working group on televising the Dáil and the Seanad and we had opportunities to see C-SPAN. We hoped there would be a channel in Ireland so that people could focus on the workings of these Houses.  Perhaps that will happen in the future.  I am not sure how many people will adopt Senator Norris' approach, but there may be a sufficient number to justify it.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also mentioned open competition.  He talked about his own amendment.  I am disposed to the principles he has outlined in his contribution. It is important and it is already covered in the Bill.  I will discuss the specific amendments at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn welcomed the thought behind the Bill.  It is clear to those who read it that officials thought deeply about it.  Senator Quinn was a little disingenuous when he spoke about a kneejerk reaction.  This was a &ldquo;slow-jerk&rdquo; reaction because we spent 18 months looking at this and we thought of all the <Col N="1558" /> options.  There are two options which I could follow.  I could follow Senator Quinn's proposition and let things happen and then respond to events, or I could to the best of my ability control events before they happen.</P>
    <P>I am not one to fly on a wing and a prayer, I prefer to control my destiny and the destiny of things under my control.  I am not prepared and my Department advised that we should not be prepared to let competition reign and then further down stream draft legislation for a competitions authority or a health insurance authority should the need arise.  If health insurance was being destroyed by an unbridled market I would then not want to cobble together a response to that.  I would not be thanked by anyone for not mapping out exactly what I wanted to do in advance.</P>
    <P>The Health Insurance Authority will come into place if there is a necessity in the market place to make adjustments and bring in risk equalisation.  That is the intent of the Bill.  It would not be appropriate for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment or I, as Senator Quinn suggested, to retain the power to do that.  I am not establishing a quango for the sake of it.  I, on behalf of the State, own all the shares of the VHI, the largest insurance operator in the country and, therefore, the Competitions Directorate of the EU would look askance if the beneficial owner of the largest operator in the market decided how much money was to be transferred from one insurance company to another.  It would not be tolerated and would not be seen as competition.  It must be done at arm's length and not by me or a ministerial colleague who, obviously as a collective under the Constitution, would share ownership of the VHI for the common good on behalf of the people.  Transparency is necessary, but it must be at arm's length.  The only way to do that is to establish an authority.  It was necessary to do that even in Australia where there is a significant number of players.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that we are trying to predict the future.  It is a unique Bill in that no other has probably come <Col N="1559" /> before the House which has tried to work out what will happen in the future and address a situation which has not yet arisen.  Perhaps nobody will come into the market and things will continue as they are.  In that case there would be no need for a Health Insurance Authority or for risk equalisation.  However, we cannot depend on that happening.  I cannot be seen to create an environment which protects unduly one particular player, even if it is State owned.  I must create an environment which is fair to any potential player or I will run foul of the EU Competitions Directorate.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright stressed the importance of the VHI, a point I agree with. He also referred to the level of reserves. Under the Third Directive on Non Life Insurance, there is a requirement for reserves and it is an issue which has been carefully addressed by the VHI board. The VHI will comment on that in its report, which is due to be published in the next couple of weeks.  Senator Enright mentioned dental care, which should be part of add-on plans which are available. He also referred to section 9 regarding the termination of a contract.  Although section 9 prohibits the termination of a contract, obviously there are circumstances where a company should be allowed to terminate a contract &mdash; in cases of deceit, fraud or where people made a false declaration to get insurance cover which they would otherwise not be entitled to.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright also made some comments on the former chief executive and the board of the VHI.  I do not propose to comment other than to say that some of his comments were unhelpful.  The board of the VHI has my confidence and support.</P>

      <P>I understand that.  I know Senator Enright long enough to understand his goodwill in this regard.  I do not attribute anything to him but the best of motives and intent.  Having dealt with <Col N="1560" /> Senator Enright for a long time, I know he is a man of the highest calibre and integrity and I say that readily.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made some welcome comments, which I am grateful for, on the Bill and improvements in the health service in the past 18 months.  He outlined his own experience in dealing with the health services.  As a prominent trade unionist, he will be aware that the trade union movement under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiated the complete separation and transparency of public and private care so there would be no artificial subsidy of private medicine.  That has given us a great deal of information as to the extent of private and public care in the health system.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole supports the key principle of the Bill.  He also mentioned the issue of a user's council, something which could be considered.  Senator O'Toole and other Senators also raised the issue of a health Ombudsman.  I have not closed my mind to that issue.  However, we have advanced the issue of charters for patients and a number of others will come on stream in the next few years, including one for psychiatric patients and the mentally ill, which I hope will be paralleled by the White Paper on Mental Health to be published before the end of the year.  I thank Senators for their contributions and I welcome the broad support for this important legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2) (a), line 29, to delete &ldquo;or sex&rdquo; and substitute, &ldquo;sex or sexual orientation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I made the substance of this argument on Second Stage and I am pleased, but not surprised, that the Minister accepted the trend of the argument and declared himself to be sympathetic.  He said he believes this might be covered in other elements of the Bill.  The amendment has been circulated but I believe it is useful to spell it out, to make it explicit rather than assuming that it is there by implication for the very cogent reasons that I put on the record of the House on the Second Stage, particularly with regard to HIV status and the question of patients with AIDS and the insurance risks involved in being part of what is defined as a high risk category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the spirit of the amendment and I have asked my officials to look at it in the few minutes we have had.  They have assured me that under the global non-discrimination aspect of the Bill, sexual orientation is covered already.  They are <Col N="1562" /> a little concerned that if somebody is specified then others not specified might be adversely affected.  Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill already ensure that a person cannot be discriminated against by virtue of sexual orientation or other lifestyle factors.  Section 7 (2) is a form of clarification of section 7 (1) but does not purport to form a definitive list of circumstances in which discrimination is prohibited.</P>
      <P>The fear is there &mdash; and we have not had much time to think about this &mdash; that if a specific list of groups or people who cannot be discriminated against is inserted, we might leave somebody out, for example, sportsmen or some other high risk group and it could be argued subsequently that since this is a list of people who are excluded, the Bill allows insurers to exclude that lifestyle or activity.  I am assured that to use a global brush and simply prohibit discrimination is the more effective way of doing it.  I hope that is acceptable to the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Not really.  This is the same argument that has come up on every occasion we put forward sexual discrimination clauses, including the first ones which were in the Incitement to Hatred Bill and the video Bill.  That argument does not carry any conviction for me, particularly because if that was true the Minister would not include age or sex. It would just say you cannot discriminate. Age, sex and sexual orientation have become a linked group which are almost invariably spelled out.  I have had this argument before, it is on the record of the House when we were discussing the Incitement to Hatred Bill and the video Bill, but it does not wash as far as I am concerned.  I am not convinced that it is covered; it seems extraordinary that it is not covered.  It did not arise directly from myself, I was alerted to it by senior people in the insurance industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Minister's compliments to his advisers they have done a very comprehensive job and it is a pity they cannot be complimented by name.  I know it is a tradition of the House, it probably spares other less efficient servants of the State <Col N="1563" /> from being excoriated by name in other circumstances but on this occasion I do not accept the advice they have proffered to the Minister.</P>

      <P>A related question was asked about the VHI's current treatment of people with HIV.  I am informed that the VHI deals with HIV on the same basis as other pre-existing conditions under rule 1.6.  This position will be copperfastened in the regulations which I will make under section 8 of this Bill. Those affected by HIV will have to be accepted by insurers subject only to the normal period governing any pre-existing condition.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, in light of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations, calls upon the Irish Government, after consultation with both Houses of the Oireachtas, to redefine and restate Ireland's view of the future role of the United Nations and of Ireland's participation in UN activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy T. Kitt, to the House.  He is always welcome and we always appreciate the courtesy with which he deals with matters.  The collapse of the Berlin Wall and, with it, the end of the Cold War created for a <Col N="1567" /> short time an illusion that all was well with the world and that an era of peace and stability lay ahead.  We could not have been more wrong.  The past couple of years have seen a record number of unresolved and, in some cases, apparently unresolvable conflicts.  We have never at one time seen so many seemingly intractable problems and without doubt further such problems are likely to surface around the world.</P>
    <P>Never before have there been so many calls on the services of the UN; never before has it found itself at the centre of so many major conflicts, and never before has there been so much confusion as to what it is possible for the UN to do, what it is legal for the UN to do and what it is that the UN should be doing.  The upcoming 50th anniversary of the foundation of the UN gives us an opportunity, world wide and in this country, to try to redefine what the role of the UN should be in the 21st century and what Ireland's contribution to the working of the UN should be.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State is here this evening as it is important at this stage that we get an indication of the Government's thinking on this matter, which may well be the most important matter we debate in this House this year. It may seem pretentious for a small country such as this to talk of global security and to talk in terms of reshaping the world order.  It may be pretentious but for us to abdicate or not face up to this responsibility could lead to consequences that might be even worse.</P>
    <P>Most of us here have seen the tailend of one world war and have lived through 40 years of the Cold War.  This century we have seen two major attempts to establish organisations aiming at global security. The League of Nations, which in effect was strangled at birth and eventually petered out in ineffectualness, nevertheless represented decent and generous aspirations. The UN, founded in 1945, has up to now not made the contributions which its founders would have hoped.  It has survived for 50 years.  That very fact and that it is so central to so many of the <Col N="1568" /> world's problems gives us hope that the aspirations of its founders may in the next 50 years have a better chance of being realised.</P>
    <P>It is worth asking ourselves what went wrong with the UN.  In the first place, almost before the ink was dry on the charter, the Cold War broke out.  The 40 years which followed the foundation of the UN was to a great extent dominated and distorted by the Cold War.  It was the Cold War which made it so difficult for the UN to realise what was central to its charter.  Furthermore, over the past 40 years we have seen the effects of decolonisation as countries escaped from the bondage of their colonial masters but were in many cases singularly badly prepared for the responsibilities of nationhood or statehood.  Some countries quickly degenerated into some form of chaos or spent decades trying to shake off the burden of the past and reshape themselves.</P>
    <P>We have also seen the gap between the rich and the poor countries grow ever greater.  Another reason is that the central core of the UN was not made strong enough at the beginning.  It did not have the resources, the moral authority or the support to carry out the role its founders intended.  A further reason was the rapid growth of technology, particularly that of the weapons of destruction, on a scale which even in 1945 could not have been envisaged.  Many countries and guerrilla and other groups possess weapons which could not have been foreseen in 1945 and this has also made the task all the more difficult.</P>
    <P>Any debate must start from the assumption that we are all convinced that the UN is not just a worthwhile but a central organisation as far as the future of the world is concerned.  We must also start from the assumption that up to now it has been prevented from achieving the fullness of its role by the failure of so many of its individual members to live up to the responsibilities they assumed when they signed the charter and became members.</P>
    <P>All of us will want to see a strong United Nations, and if we want that we <Col N="1569" /> must accept that the UN does not have a particularly good image worldwide at present.  It is associated with too many failures and compromises.  It is defied by too many of its own members when it suits them.  We see long overdue bills owed by countries which can often well afford to pay the debts they have incurred.  There is a picture of ineffectiveness and a bad image which belies the fact that the UN is the only body which can carry out certain key functions on the necessary scale.</P>
    <P>Nobody is competing with the UN at present for the role of global policeman. In the past the two great superpowers, the US and the Soviet Union, did compete for good or bad reasons, but invariably for reasons more to do with their own interests than global peace. At present the only country capable of having a world policing role is the US but it manifestly does not want that role. There is no competition, which means that whether it wants it or not the UN is the only body capable of operating on behalf of all of us in a global way.</P>
    <P>To solve these problems needs an unprecedented degree of international co-operation.  If there is to be such cooperation, it must have firm political foundations.  This can only be done if the main actors, the nation states or the regional groupings such as the EU, are willing to get involved.  The UN is the only universal body where the voice of all nations can be expressed in a fair way and to which they all give assent.  Unless there is universal acceptance by all the countries in the UN that it is the only body which can carry out certain key functions, we will unfortunately see a repetition of the ineffectiveness that has characterised it up until now.  We would then be restarting on shaky foundations.</P>
    <P>The UN can only be strengthened if we are clear as to why we want it strengthened. What should it be strengthened to do?  The UN Charter is committed to the task of &ldquo;the maintenance of international peace and security&rdquo;.  Does this mean peacekeeping, peace monitoring, peace building or peace enforcement?  All these phrases are used routinely.  There is currently <Col N="1570" /> great confusion as to the appropriate response in particular circumstances. What is appropriate, what is feasible and where should the emphasis be?</P>
    <P>The current situation in Rwanda highlights many of the current difficulties facing the UN.  We all feel total revulsion at the genocide taking place within a political system that has clearly failed. Everybody is calling for UN intervention. Whether they like it or not, they are calling for peace enforcement.  What does this mean?  It means the willingness of UN member states to commit troops to a virtual certainty of large scale losses of life.  There is no willingness at present on the part of UN members to do this.  They judge that the chances of success with this measure would not be great; the costs would be enormous and the chances of a clear outcome are uncertain.  The African states are either unwilling or unable to get involved in peace enforcement.  If we want peace enforcement in Rwanda, for example, which may be the worst case to take, in all probability it will not be possible.</P>
    <P>What other measures are open to the UN in a situation like Rwanda?  It is giving humanitarian assistance, helping refugees, trying to bring about negotiations aimed to bringing the opposing sides together and trying to identify a long term solution.  All of that does not answer the immediate response that people expect from a body like the UN in a situation as horrific as Rwanda, which is being mirrored in Bosnia and other conflicts.</P>
    <P>This raises further questions &mdash; we are not here to solve immediate problems but to raise questions about the future long term role of the UN &mdash; about whether the UN should be involved at an earlier stage when there is potential for conflict.  Could the UN have an anticipatory role?  Could the UN have an anticipated what has happened in Rwanda and have taken action earlier?  Is it possible to build peace and act to deal in advance with underlying sources of conflict and to bed down peace in post-conflict situations? How can the UN do this?  How <Col N="1571" /> can it get hold of the huge expenditures that will be required to anticipate and prevent problems before they take a huge amount of lives and money.</P>
    <P>Action to prevent emerging disputes from becoming conflicts was rarely, if ever, taken during the past 40 years. Herein may be found one of the great failures of the UN.  It simply was not possible.  It was not on the agenda of the major powers during the Cold War. Indeed, the main response then given to emerging conflicts was for the superpowers to select and back a side to the dispute and to use the veto to prevent the UN from taking disinterested objective action.  This is the diametric opposite to what the UN, in terms of co-operative security, should be doing.  It is not what should be happening today.  Today, above all else, the UN needs preventative action.  It is possible where it was not so in the past and is justified by cost alone. I have only touched on one issue.  I want to see how the UN over the next number of years can carry out its peace mandate. The 50th anniversary of the UN will at least sharpen that debate.</P>
    <P>Ireland is uniquely well placed to make a contribution to that debate.  Our role in the UN over the past number of years has been an honourable one.  There is a wealth of experience in this country of UN operations, whether in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the armed services, with those people who have retired or are in academia.  More than most, we have seen how and where it has gone wrong and how it can be put right.  In our Constitution and in the political values of our people, our country has a civilised contribution to make to any debate on the further role of the UN.  The time for that debate has come.  The reason we, in Fine Gael, have put down this motion is because we want to start such a debate within the Houses of the Oireachtas as a beginning, to raise questions and to get some idea of the Government's thinking. We hope this will culminate in Ireland, at least, having clear ideas, a definite point of view and a real contribution to make towards the strengthening of the <Col N="1572" /> UN, which is coming up to its 50th anniversary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.</P>
      <P>Nearly all Members of this House have been exceptionally lucky.  We have been born into a period when no world war has taken place.  Many of our parents and relations have lived through a period covering two world wars.  Let us hope we succeed in avoiding such a war.</P>
      <P>The United Nations has to some extent been of benefit in helping to avoid a third world war.  However, it also has much to do with the greater level of democracy worldwide.  Ordinary people are now involved in politics in most countries to a far greater degree.  There are some sad exceptions, such as East Timor, Rwanda and parts of central Europe.  Many countries that were sworn enemies and were involved in war with each other are now friends.  The growth of democracy and the power of the press and television have also helped to avoid international conflicts on past scales.  However, we must be vigilant.  We must not become complacent and think all is well.  The United Nations has done a splendid job. Because of our unique position, Ireland has in its own way put forward an independent viewpoint that has been listened to with great respect by the UN at all times.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about some of the events in other countries, for example, in Rwanda, where the people are facing major problems, such as starvation and continuous indebtedness.  John Pilger's report on East Timor, including the way 200,000 people died under Indonesian occupation, illustrates the inadequacies and failure of the UN to take action in time.  It is something about which the House must be concerned.  Failures of that magnitude, involving the death of 200,000 people, also illustrates the weakness of the UN in endeavouring to take a positive stand regarding matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland must examine its role in the UN.  Hitherto we have, to some extent, adopted a neutral stance.  However, our future sense of direction must be considered <Col N="1573" /> and policy decisions may have to be taken regarding the role of neutrality.</P>
    <P>On the issue of peacekeeping, monitoring and enforcement, Irish troops have been sent overseas on a continuous basis.  We are aware of their peacekeeping efforts and the duties they have undertaken.  In this respect, the Army, the Garda Síochána and successive Governments have contributed an enormous amount to the UN which has been greatly respected, and the organisation has acknowledged the debt owed to the Irish people regarding the work undertaken by our security forces.</P>
    <P>The financing of the UN must be given serious consideration because so many nations are not contributing and are continually failing to contribute.  Unless this problem is tackled and proper financial contributions are made by these reneging countries, the future of the UN will be a cause for concern.  A much greater level of participation and finance must be provided by many of the member states, especially some of the larger member states who have not been contributing as they should.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the UN and the Security Council be seen to be independent at all times.  The UN acts in the role of a policeman who has to be seen to be fair and who is fair.  If a situation is allowed to develop where only the viewpoint of a nation or group of nations is listened to or acted upon, then the UN will no longer be seen to be independent and to be acting independently.  In this respect, it is essential that Ireland, as a small country with a strong and independent voice, continues to express its views on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The UN is the one institution which can prevent international turmoil and anarchy.  It is essential, therefore, that we continue to support the UN and ensure that it is properly financed because it is with the UN that the future safety of the world lies.</P>
    <P>The UN has a role to play in many areas.  For example, the refugee problem is ever increasing, and when people are imprisoned behind barbed wire, fenced in and treated in a manner which is far <Col N="1574" /> worse than the way we treat animals; we must see what can be done to help.  The way in which refugees are treated at present is a scandal and it is a problem which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>This motion is of importance because the work and future role of the UN is vital to the future of all.</P>

      <P>I thank those who proposed the motion and I welcome this debate and the opportunity to outline the Government's position on this important matter.</P>
      <P>Next year marks not only the fiftieth anniversary of the UN but also the fortieth anniversary of Ireland's membership of the organisation.  As a committed member, we have a proud record of contributing to the core UN objective of maintaining international peace and security.  From the first deployment of Irish military observers in 1958 we have maintained an unbroken tradition of involvement in UN peacekeeping and today 820 members of the Permanent Defence Forces and 59 members of the Garda Síochána are serving in ten UN operations worldwide.  We have twice served as a non permanent member of the Security Council.  The early years of our membership saw Ireland active in encouraging the decolonisation process which has today led to a UN of 184 member states.  One of the key multilateral disarmament instruments, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, originated in an Irish initiative at the UN.  Ireland has also traditionally had a high profile on human rights question in UN fora and has been active in promoting dialogue on these questions among the different regions of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our scope for having an impact on international events may be limited but I believe that over the years we have made a constructive contribution to the purposes and principle of the UN, beyond our size and resources.  As we approach these two important anniversaries, we will not forget those members of the Permanent Defence Forces who made the <Col N="1575" /> ultimate sacrifice in the cause of peace on UN service, from the former Belgian Congo to the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the UN will continue to play a central role in the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of economic and social cooperation among the nations of the world.  I have recalled the important areas of Ireland's involvement in the UN because they provide a sound basis on which a small member state can participate in the current debate on the future of the organisation.</P>

      <P>I would be pleased to make arrangements for a copy of my speech to be distributed as soon as possible; I hope this is something which would normally be provided.</P>
      <P>Our involvement in UN peacekeeping has given us solid credentials for an active participation in this debate.  For much of the period since the UN Charter was adopted in 1945 the vision of its framers was frustrated.  It is only in the past few years that the ending of the intense rivalry between two super power blocs has opened up the potential of the UN organisation to establish enduring international peace and security.  The Security Council has now begun to function effectively for the first time without the abiding threat that the veto power will be exercised.  The UN has had a number of notable successes, for example, in Namibia and Cambodia where Ireland too has made its contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet the tragedy of Bosnia and the uncertain handling of the UN operations in Somalia and Rwanda have provoked penetrating questions that go to the heart of peacekeeping and the international community's moral and political obligations when faced with a multiplicity of <Col N="1576" /> ethnic and regional conflicts.  The removal, too, of the relative certainties engendered by a world divided into two superpower arenas of influence has caused many of the new UN members states, and the emerging economic powers of the Third World, to challenge the continuing relevance of institutional arrangements which were created by the victors of World War II.</P>
    <P>It is a time of great change in the United Nations.  Of that there can be no doubt.  Ireland is well placed to offer its ideas on the future structure of the UN and on the organisation and doctrines of UN peacekeeping.  In doing so, however, we need to be aware that the traditional influence in the United Nations of smaller member states such as Ireland is changing as other regions and countries justly claim their share of influence in the organisation.  I draw attention to this reality to emphasise the point that we will need to be creative in seeking ways to continue to bring our concerns in such fields as human rights, disarmament, peacekeeping and social and humanitarian affairs to the fore on UN agendas.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation to the UN in New York is actively engaged in all the strands of the current reform debate, and I will say something about this in a moment. We are engaged because we are committed to the future wellbeing of the organisation.  But just as we must do when we look to the future of the European Union, we will remain alert to the interests of smaller member states in the United Nations, finding ways to express our particular concerns and bringing our European partners with us wherever possible.  By actively contributing to the development of European Union positions at the United Nations we can ensure that the issues which Ireland has long championed are kept firmly on its agenda.</P>
    <P>When the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, launched his report <i>An Agenda for Peace</i> in 1992, he initiated a major debate on the role of the UN in conflict resolution. We were active in formulating the European Union response to the Secretary-General's <Col N="1577" /> proposals and the Permanent Representative of Ireland chaired consultations which led to a consensus resolution of the General Assembly on follow-up to these proposals last autumn.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring, addressed the General Assembly on 1 October 1993 and spoke of the need to draw lessons from the large scale peacekeeping operations of recent years.  He called for special attention to be given to issues of command and control.  Ireland subsequently co-sponsored a General Assembly resolution on this subject.  I spoke earlier of the sacrifice already made by Irish soldiers in the cause of UN peacekeeping.  Ireland has strongly supported an initiative by New Zealand, another country with an admirable record in this area, to elaborate an international convention on the safety of UN personnel.  We are active in the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of the General Assembly established to draft such a document.  We have supported efforts to strengthen the department of peacekeeping operations in the UN Secretariat and an Irish military officer is currently serving on secondment there.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation will continue to participate in the ongoing debate on peacekeeping and the Government will carefully monitor any developments which might affect the nature of our traditional commitment to peacekeeping.  We will not, however, be influenced by what are perhaps over-hasty reactions to the latest difficulties being faced in the field.  I recall that last year some doubts were being expressed about Ireland's role in the operation in Somalia.  Irish troops have, in fact, served in that country with distinction and honour since they were deployed last September and have accomplished key humanitarian and logistical tasks.  Lately we have heard demands for vigorous intervention in the tragic situation in Rwanda, and I myself can certainly sympathise with those who make these demands, having visited that troubled part of Africa only a few weeks ago.  The Government will take a carefully considered approach to Ireland's <Col N="1578" /> role in peacekeeping and the debate on its future evolution.  In the case of Rwanda, Ireland will continue to press for the earliest possible deployment of the expanded UNAMIR force authorised by Security Council Resolution 925 of 8 June 1994.  Ultimately, it is Dáil Éireann which will continue to decide whether armed Irish contingents will serve abroad in any specific UN peacekeeping operation in response to requests from the UN Secretary-General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Dáil and Seanad Éireann. Thank you very much, Senator.  I accept your point of order.  I believe Senators will share my conviction that the Irish tradition in peacekeeping has particular strengths which can continue to serve the cause of international peace and security as the UN enters its second half-century.</P>
      <P>Under Article 24 of the Charter, the member states of the United Nations confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and agree that in carrying out its duties in this area it acts on their behalf.  This is one of the reasons that the current debate on the future size and role of the Council is of such critical importance, not least to troop contributing nations such as Ireland.  The last expansion of the Security Council, to the current figures of five permanent and ten non-permanent members, took place almost 30 years ago. It is hardly surprising, given the major changes in political and economic power in the world since then, that the general membership of the United Nations, now standing at 184 member states, has seen fit to look again at these arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has been active in this debate. The Tánaiste, in his address to the General Assembly on 1 October 1993, stated the Government's support for an increase in the membership of the Council and our hope that decisions on this could be taken in time for the 50th anniversary. The Irish delegation is participating fully in the General Assembly working group <Col N="1579" /> on the question of equitable representation on and increase in membership of the Security Council, which began its work in January this year.  The Irish Permanent Representative has made a number of interventions in the working group in which he further developed our support for expansion in the membership which would make it more reflective of the reality of today's world and at the same time ensure its continued effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches particular importance to improving the representation of the developing world while at the same time maintaining the opportunity for smaller countries, such as Ireland, to serve periodically on the Council.  We have given particular consideration to an Italian proposal to develop a new and additional category of semi-permanent membership which could improve the representation of larger countries in the Third World without detracting from the contribution which smaller countries can make.  On another key issue we have expressed hesitation about any extension of the veto power.</P>
    <P>A number of trends have now begun to emerge from the debate.  One area of possible convergence is that the generally preferred optimal size of the reformed Security Council could be in the low 20s, within a range of 20 to 25.  Further discussion is needed on the mix of permanent and non-permanent members in any expansion.</P>
    <P>There are a range of views on the veto power.  Numberous proposals have been made in the debate.  It would be premature and imprudent to commit ourselves at this point to a definitive position on these matters.  However, the Irish delegation has emphasised that all proposals for enlargement and other reforms in working procedures must be put to the test of whether they improve the relationship between the general membership, including troop contributors like Ireland, and the Security Council.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that any proposal to amend the Charter to reform <Col N="1580" /> the Security Council will require the support of at least two thirds of the member states and all five permanent members. The prospects for reaching agreement on concrete reform in time for the 50th anniversary are uncertain, not least because of significant differences between the stated positions of some of the current permanent members and those of many of the general membership.</P>
    <P>The Government remains of the view that a modest enlargement, along the lines of the range which seems to command widespread support, is desirable. We will work to encourage the emergence of the necessary consensus during or as soon as possible after the anniversary year.  In the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, we attach importance to the provisions of the Treaty on European Union which provide that partners who are members of the Security Council will concert and keep other EU member states fully informed, and that those who are permanent members will ensure the defence of the EU positions.</P>
    <P>In view of my particular responsibilities as Minister of State, I am pleased to say that there has been progress in some of the humanitarian areas of concern to us in recent months.  In 1992, Ireland called for an Agenda for Development which would complement the Agenda for Peace which had been published that year.  The Secretary-General has recently issued a draft report on an Agenda for Development and I will be participating in a high-level debate to consider action to be taken at the meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council in New York in the course of next week.  Another important forthcoming meeting is the UN Conference on Population and Development, in Cairo this September, where the Minister for Health and myself will represent Ireland.</P>
    <P>When he addressed the World Conference on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly last year, the Tánaiste called for the appointment of a UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The Irish delegation actively pursued this <Col N="1581" /> objective during the subsequent General Assembly debate.  The High Commissioner, Mr. Ayala Lasso, was appointed on 31 March this year and has already proven that he intends to take a vigorous approach to his mandate by visiting Rwanda recently.  Ireland strongly supported his call for a special session of the UN Commission on Human Rights to consider the appalling human rights violations in that country and was active in the formulation of the European intervention at the emergency meeting held on 24 and 25 May last.  Many instances of violations of human rights were reported by me to Geneva on my return from Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that more resources should be devoted to the promotion of human rights from within the UN budget and we will continue to press for adequate resources to be made available to the High Commissioner.  We have substantially increased our own national contribution to the UN voluntary funds for advisory services in the field of human rights and for torture victims this year. These now total £50,000.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a wide range of policy areas, but we should bear in mind that one of the major constraints on the effective operation of the United Nations is the failure of many member states to pay their assessed contributions to the regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time.  Senator Enright referred to this. As of 15 May, some $2.9 billion was owed by these member states to the UN, $1.9 billion for peacekeeping and $1 billion for the regular budget.  Regrettably, the largest amounts were owed by some permanent members of the Security Council who bear a special responsibility for international peace and security.</P>
    <P>The Government has maintained Ireland's policy, even in times of budgetary constraint, of paying our UN assessments in full and on time.  We have done this despite the fact that we are regularly owed moneys by the UN for our troop contributions because of the failure of other member states to pay.  The Tánaiste and I will continue to use every opportunity to press for the payment of these <Col N="1582" /> amounts, which currently run to about £13.5 million.  We have done this on a number of occasions.  I made this point to Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali when I accompanied the President to New York on her last visit.  However, we will maintain the traditional policy of fully meeting our commitments to the UN in the conviction that a strong United Nations is in our national interest.  Failure to do so would be a breach of our legal obligations under the Charter and would undermine the force of our arguments on the financing of the organisation.</P>
    <P>As we prepare nationally and in the United Nations Organisation to celebrate the anniversaries of the Charter and Ireland's membership, the Government will continue to keep the Oireachtas informed.  We welcome in particular the contribution of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs since it was established.  I know that its UN subcommittee is preparing its own proposals in the areas of peacekeeping and reform. These will be carefully considered by the Tánaiste and myself when available.  The Tánaiste and the chairman of the joint committee, Deputy Brian Lenihan, are consulting about the appointment, with all-party agreement, of Members of the Oireachtas to the national committee which will shortly be established for the 50th anniversary.</P>
    <P>Both the Tánaiste and I welcomed the establishment of the joint committee and I believe that the experience to date of its operation has been of considerable value to all concerned.  It is a reflection also of the importance of the United Nations to Irish foreign policy that one of the earliest decisions of the joint committee was to establish a specific subgroup to deal with UN issues.  The debate on the future of the UN is dynamic and it is difficult to predict whether genuine reform can be accomplished in the context of the 50th anniversary.  The Government is determined that Ireland will continue to play its part in seeking to build the necessary consensus among the member states of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I know his good feelings in this area because I have stood on many platforms with him in the past on Tibet, East Timor and other issues and it is good to see him in his present position.  I am glad he referred to the creation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and its special subcommittee on the United Nations.  As the Minister knows, it paid a visit recently to New York.  Our representative there made the members welcome and explained the situation to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points I wish to make were all referred to by the Minister in his wide-ranging speech.  The first relates to the Cairo conference and the question of population control.  It is important that we make a balanced contribution here.  I was horrified by the editorial in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> which said it was a wet liberal notion that we have to embark on the question of population control. It is the single most serious and most potentially explosive situation facing the planet at the moment.  It was appalling in my opinion that the Vatican and the American State Department under George Bush managed to force it off the agenda of the Rio Earth Summit.  I hope that this Government and State will not allow itself, by virtue of the overwhelming Roman Catholic nature of the population, to be over-influenced by the view of the Vatican representatives on this matter.  I was recently at a conference in Holland about identify within the European Union, which was attended by Ministers of the Dutch Government.  One of the senior representatives from Belgium was extremely exercised in her mind about the tactics being used by Vatican representatives to promote a point of view which was detrimental to attempts to control world population and to label all who wish to do so in the long term interests of humanity as mad <Col N="1584" /> abortionists.  I hope that the Government will take into account that this State is not a fief of the Vatican and will present a balanced and reasonable view on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has visited the tragic country of Rwanda.  I heard last night that there are supposed to be two million dead, but five million are apparently missing.  It is an appalling situation.  We had a remarkable contribution to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs by a De La Salle brother, Tom O'Donoghue, to whom it was an honour to listen.  He has made a very courageous decision to go back to that shattered country, even though most of his pupils would by now have been hacked to death. One of the things suggested at that meeting was the construction of an airport runway facility for a comparatively small amount of money so that relief supplies could be delivered most efficiently into Rwanda.  This is something that Ireland could do independently.  The amount of money this would involve is not disproportionate and I very much hope that the Minister will look at this situation.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad that he raised the shameful situation with regard to the payment of the bills of the United Nations but he was too delicate and sensitive. He covered the shame of those countries.  I want to name them.  They are the US, Germany, Britain, the former Soviet Union and France.  We need a standing army which can be employed directly.  We need proper payment for the UN, as the Minister suggested.  We need to look at the establishment of a war crimes tribunal.  We need these things to oppose mulitnational interests and forces.  We need particularly to look at land mines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Minister.  We have talked about military matters.  I am equally proud of all our forces and gardaí who have served abroad.  Sometimes it is difficult to get information on our attitude to various conflicts &mdash; for example, our attitude to the French offer of help in solving the <Col N="1585" /> situation in Rwanda.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us about this later.  Not all the activities of the United Nations are military.  I am glad the Minister mentioned the UN conference on population in Cairo.  There has been very odd criticism regarding this and of the President's speech in Harvard.  It has been argued that a western philosophy is taking over the United Nations.  I have seen it stated that feminists want to transform societies such as Saudi Arabia and India.  I possibly do so also from the point of view of women.  A change of attitude would be no harm.</P>
      <P>There is the situation regarding food and girls.  One of the most poignant photographs I ever saw was of an Indian woman who had twins &mdash; a boy and a girl.  The longed for boy was at her breast and was a fine, big child.  On her knee sat a child half the size, skin and bone, with a bottle stuck in its mouth with some sort of formula which was probably polluted. The totally different values put on the respective lives of the boy and girl was incredible.  To this day we know that in developing countries female children are less well fed than males.</P>
      <P>The situation is even worse from the point of view of pre-natal diagnosis of the sex of the child, where one may be sure that it is the girls who are aborted.  This will have terrible demographic effects in a very short time.  We must address these sorts of activities.  Infanticide is also far more common in some countries among girls.  I have not heard of it anywhere among boys, unless they were physically or mentally disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding this conference on population control, every time the word abortion is mentioned I think of the 500,000 women who die in pregnancy and childbirth every year; 200,000 of them die from illegal septic abortions, every one of them for economic reasons, in developing countries.  I do not hear anyone talking about those 200,000 cases where there is not just the loss of the child but also of the mother.  When discussing abortion in Cairo, we should remember legal abortion was never introduced anywhere, except where the situation regarding <Col N="1586" /> illegal abortion was so appalling that it was felt something must be done to reduce the death rate among women.</P>
    <P>When we talk about family planning here we are not talking about it because children are starving.  However, a large number of women in the developing world try to seek adequate family planning because they do not have food to feed their children.  The economic issues are entwined in this conference and must not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>As regards AIDS, some people object to the distribution of condoms in these countries.  However, I saw statistics from Uganda the other day which said that 27 per cent of the urban population and 8 per cent of the rural population are HIV positive and I can assure the Minister that all of these are due to heterosexual spread of the AIDS virus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this debate is taking place on a day when, as Senator Henry mentioned, there is conflict in Rwanda and the surrounding area regarding French involvement in the United Nations force to go in to create an atmosphere in which peace can evolve.</P>
      <P>The question of the United Nations has been addressed in the Committee on Foreign Affairs over the past number of months.  We cannot say the United Nations has been a force for good in one area and a force for bad in another.  The fact is that the United Nations as it has evolved has been good and bad and the evolution of the United Nations is a matter of concern.</P>
      <P>I heard people talking about World Wars I and II this evening.  World War I was confined to Europe but World War II did not encompass the world. However, in today's terms one could not talk about those conflicts as world wars. There are more wars going on in the world at present than ever; there are wars in small countries throughout Africa, the Middle East and central Europe.  These wars will not go away and there is no point in anybody suggesting that because the Cold War between the East and the West is over there is going to be a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking at the structures of the <Col N="1587" /> United Nations this evening but it is very hard to delve deeply into these matters in such a short time.  However, it has to be said that the permanent members of the Security Council were the cause of most of the problems.  They have not been the biggest contributors, as they are supposed to be, but they have been the inhibitors of the growth of the power of the United Nations.  When the question of the veto came up and the United Kingdom, the USA and France were on one side, occasionally Russia or China would exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>The question of peacekeeping must be addressed.  We will not be able to fully address it this evening but up to 1987 there were only 13 peacekeeping situations worldwide.  Since then, that figure has increased dramatically.  I would like anybody inside or outside this House to show me where a peacekeeping force was able to leave after a short time having completed its mandate.  That never happened. The longest established peacekeeping force &mdash; UNIFIL &mdash; is still in South Lebanon and I cannot see it leaving because a member state, Israel, would not abide by the resolutions of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry talks about population control as being one of the problems.  It is a problem worldwide but the major problem at present is not essentially caused by population but by the high ratio of military expenditure to peacekeeping. If states did not spend so much on military matters the world would be able to feed its hungry and address its problems.  For example, Russia's ratio of military expenditure to peacekeeping is 3,714:1; in Turkey the ratio is 15,911:1; in Iraq it is 108,622:1 and in Burma it is 162,118:1.  This also applies to countries where people are hungry, for example, in Ethiopia the ratio is 182,485:1.</P>
    <P>The United Nations must ensure there is a fair balance for all member states. That does not mean there will be 184 permanent members of the Security Council.  We must make certain that there is a balance to ensure fair play for all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> With regard to reform of the secretariat, it is a monolithic institution. There are probably 50 times too many people working in the United Nations. Often, its very size ensures that it cannot do the job.  There has to be a change in the expenditure pattern of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>There must also be a realisation that we will only get somewhere if members pay their contributions; they must pay their assessed dues on time and in full. Ireland is owed money because of our UNIFIL involvement.  It is a small amount in relative terms but if we had it we could spend the money building up our Army or tackling social deprivation. Those who do not pay are the permanent members, those who should be giving the lead in these matters.</P>
    <P>We, as a small nation, have played an honourable role in the United Nations over the years.  We have to thank our representatives at the United Nations &mdash; who are often forgotten &mdash; from the secretariat to the ambassador.  Equally, we should thank the officials from Department of Foreign Affairs who are so <i>au fait</i> with what is happening.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming in here this evening.  His speech encompassed many of the issues that will set the agenda for the debate, because that is all we are doing here this evening.  We are not really debating the role of the United Nations, its evolution and our role in the United Nations; we are trying to set an agenda.  The Minister has gone through much of what we need.  I thank Senator Manning for bringing the matter before the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important motion.  It is vital that we as a State take a firm position in the current international debate on the future role of the United Nations.  Last year Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali published a document called <i>An Agenda for Peace</i> in which he set out and sought debate on the role of the United Nations, particularly the expanded role at all levels of the United Nations.  Very fine contributions were <Col N="1589" /> made this evening on that role.  It is important that Ireland clearly states its position in the international debate on the role of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The United Nations will be 50 years old next year.  There would appear to be an urgency on the part of the United Nations to have each future role clearly defined when it sets about celebrating that 50th anniversary.  We must realise that the political climate in which it was founded in 1945 was post Second World War.  There was a very definite political world order, particularly because of the two super powers.  There was always a reluctance and consideration when the United Nations made a decision.  The consideration took the implications for the Cold War and its effects into account. There was a certain constraint on the United Nations.  For several years since the fall of one of those powers there has been a change in the United Nations and in the attitude of the world towards it.  It is important to recognise that suddenly people, nations and states realise that the United Nations is there for a very particular purpose.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, decisions are now being made which do not take account of the Cold War implications.  The result is that greater demands are being made on the United Nations, which is neither prepared nor equipped to undertake this great change.  It is important that we, as a member of the United Nations, recognise that fact in any contribution we make.</P>
      <P>The reality is that increased sophistication in the electronic media means that televisions throughout the world can now bring situations right into the sitting rooms of every household.  People are aware of the world order and, more particularly, world disorder.  They expect the United Nations to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations has recently come in for much criticism for the lack of response or slow response to situations that have arisen in Europe, Africa and elsewhere.  That is unfortunate because it is up to the member states, the General Assembly and the Security Council to change and amend the Charter to take account of changing times and the changing <Col N="1590" /> world order.  That has not occurred. Until the Charter which founded the United Nations is changed to adapt to the current world order, one cannot criticise the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Great efforts have been made, particularly within the Secretariat and the General Assembly.  Business now goes through the General Assembly more efficiently than it did hitherto because of the Cold War situation, which is now a thing of the past.  Resolutions now go through and business is done more efficiently.  The Secretariat have also improved and adapted their situation and now provide a much better service.  Previously there was no service in the United Nations at weekends.  Now there is a service and a contact point at United Nations headquarters at weekends.</P>
    <P>The Security Council comes in for much criticism because of its limited membership.  In addressing the issue of the membership of the Security Council there is one yardstick we should use and one definite line we should consider which is what increasing the membership of the Security Council would mean.  If we are to reduce the conflict in the various parts of the world, the membership of the Security Council should only be increased if doing so will increase the effectiveness of the United Nations in getting to areas of crisis throughout the world.  Any decisions that will be taken to increase that membership should use that as a fundamental yardstick on which to base the decision.</P>
    <P>There is a danger if the membership is significantly increased, there could be a delay in coming to decisions on action. At present there are delays in relation to taking action on particular issues. Rwanda is a case in point.  There are 5,500 African soldiers ready to go into Rwanda.  The Security Council has passed a resolution, but has said that it will not take effect for at least three months.  That is most unsatisfactory.  At the same time the French are saying that they are also ready to provide assistance.</P>
    <P>We must ask why the international community is standing by and allowing the situation in Rwanda to continue without <Col N="1591" /> intervening.  This is a serious question which we, as part of the developed world, must address.  Is it the case that within the membership of the United Nations an African life is not considered as sacred as a European life or a life in the rest of the developed world?  That is a fundamental question.  One can only assume from the lack of action that this is the reality.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in relation to logistics, and the answer from official level will be that these African troops are not sufficiently equipped or trained to go in to Rwanda.  If they are not why is the international community not providing the expertise in relation to the logistics, command and control which would get the people in there to try to resolve the situation?  Unfortunately that is not happening.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he put these questions forcibly at United Nations level.  It is a matter of simple logistics and getting people who have the expertise and specialise in that area to accompany the African troops.  That has not occurred and a delay of three months is totally unacceptable when one considers the inhuman atrocities and massive loss of life occurring in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The Charter firmly respects the sovereignty of states, but since the breakdown of the world order that has changed considerably.  There is less respect for sovereignty.  Questions relating to that have to be addressed.  When the United Nations decides to go into an area, what are the criteria on which that decision is based?  This is a particularly sensitive question when there are terrible human tragedies occurring and lives being lost. These criteria need to be specifically laid out so that the United Nations can feel free and able under its Charter to go in. There are many issues in the Charter which need to be addressed and amended to take account of the changing political circumstances in the world order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Fine Gael Senators for raising this motion on the UN.  We have all seen the results of <Col N="1592" /> Ireland's contribution to the UN over the years.  It is evident from the deaths of soldiers through the years.  We have lost quite a few people from this country who went out to trouble spots throughout the world to try to solve problems for others.</P>
      <P>In the early 1960s a young man I grew up with died in the Congo.  His remains were never found and his people still wonder what happened him.  In 1982 another friend of mine was killed in the Lebanon. He was brought home and buried along with many others who have died from my own county and others.  Their people still ask why.  We have made a tremendous sacrifice for many of the trouble spots in the world and have reason to be proud of our contribution to the United Nations.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, of the percentage of GNP we will give to undeveloped countries.  That is one way we can help avoid the occurrence of war and famine.  If we support these countries and if other much wealthier countries give more money, we could do a great deal to solve such problems.  We have served the United Nations and the world well and we have reason to be proud.</P>
      <P>In March this year Deputy Séan Barrett and I visited our troops in Somalia and Lebanon to see the conditions in which they were living.  Major doubts were expressed about our troops going to Somalia.  People wondered whether they should go there but the Irish forces have made a major contribution to peace in that country.  The conditions there were deplorable.  There was famine there and thousands of people died.  The soldiers brought stability to their area of operations.  The Irish nature appears to foster peace in such areas.  Irish troops get on well with local people.  Even in Somalia where they had to be on guard at all times outside their camp they still had a way with the local people who respected that quality in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lebanon was different.  Our troops have been there for many years and have suffered many deaths.  There is a monument to the people who have given their lives for peace in that country; a number <Col N="1593" /> of Irish names are on that monument.  It annoyed me that the allowances for the Irish forces were about one quarter the allowances given to the French soldiers who were carrying out the same role.  It is a disgrace that our soldiers should be treated differently from others.  They have played a major role in every trouble spot to which they have been sent in the last 40 years, and that should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this country is owed £13.5 million.  That is a disgrace especially when that money should be paid by countries such as the USA and Russia.  I accept that the CIS States have problems at present but the debt was allowed to build up.  We paid our way while they did not.  Anybody who has visited the UN in New York will discover that its administration is an absolute disgrace. It is over-manned and a senior official told us that each sheet of paper printed by the UN in New York costs $714.  That is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the motion, we should continue to raise this issue at the UN. We have an excellent team in New York doing a first rate job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate.  I draw the attention of the House to three statistics.  Military spending is running at $767 billion per year, roughly three times the GDP of all of Africa south of the Sahara; in poorer countries the chance of dying from malnutrition and preventable diseases is 33 times greater than dying as a result of war with neighbours and poor countries have 20 soldiers for every doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 82 armed conflicts that occurred in the world between 1989 and 1992 &mdash; the latest figures available &mdash; only three were between states; the others were internal conflicts.  We must bear that crucial point in mind when considering the work of the United Nations.  Armies are not being used to defend a country against other countries.  In general they are used inside the country.  Costa Rica has no army.  It made the decision many years ago and it has not had any more <Col N="1594" /> problems than other countries.  That is an interesting policy.</P>
    <P>One development in the United Nations which we should view with caution and possibly concern is the trend for the UN to become increasingly involved in peace making rather than the more restricted duty of peacekeeping.  We must think long and hard about that development. We must consider whether it is a good idea for the organisation to move in that direction at all and whether we want to supply troops for peace making operations.  The problem with peace making is that the term is highly misleading. Peace making means, in effect, waging war.  It may mean waging war for a very good reason against an enemy that deserves to be resisted.  However, it is waging war and we must ask if a world organisation such as the United Nations should get involved in that task and whether it is possible to do so successfully.</P>
    <P>We need only look at Somalia to see the difficulties involved.  Yet many people are calling on the United Nations to become actively involved in a war in Bosnia instead of simply protecting the humanitarian effort.  I have doubts about whether the United Nations should make war in the pursuit of peace in the first place and whether it can do so successfully. The moral authority of the United Nations, which is fragile anyway, is unlikely to survive a war making role even if it is in the pursuit of peace.  Wars are bloody and terrible regardless of the motives of the participants.  I do not envisage many countries being prepared to offer the lives of their citizens as mercenaries in a world police force and we should be slow to do so.</P>
    <P>The United Nations can, with a large measure of success, carry out the very limited role of peacekeeping.  It has been doing so since Lester Pearson created the concept after the 1956 crisis.  In many situations throughout the world the United Nations has gone between the combatants and successfully remained there as a buffer and Irish troops have played a major part in that role.  That, of course, is no solution to the problems <Col N="1595" /> that cause the conflicts.  Next month it will be 20 years since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.  The United Nations is still there with Irish troops and police included in the force.  The force is holding the line between two communities which appear to be permanently frozen in aggression against each other.  Although the United Nations has not solved the problem that does not mean peacekeeping is not valuable.</P>
    <P>It is time we redefined our approach to the United Nations.  We have undergone a number of changes since we joined that organisation.  Our involvement in the European Union has almost distracted our attention from the UN.  We should look on the United Nations and the world stage as an important opportunity to contribute rather than to gain.  I am not sure that we have had that approach in the past.  We should seek a role that would involve us making a specific and constructive contribution, based on our values and experiences, in solving world problems.</P>
    <P>Last year I visited Norway and that country has achieved such a role.  We cannot fail to be impressed at the attitude of the Norwegians which led those few brave people to play a key role in the Arab-Israeli peace process.  Such people consider themselves to be world citizens. We should do so as well.  We should not be inhibited simply because we have problems on this island which we have not yet solved.  Our experience of the problems in the North should make us all the more determined to get involved in the many similar situations throughout the world where two different communities have great difficulty living together in the same territory.  That appears to be the classic problem of the 20th century; it is repeated all over the world.  If we were involved in more of those problems we might not only help other countries but also learn lessons which might be of benefit to us.</P>
    <P>I refuse to believe the problems of two communities living together are incapable of solution except by the non-solution <Col N="1596" /> of one community dominating the other.  Last year I had the opportunity to visit Bali, a Hindu island in the middle of a Muslim state, Indonesia.  I never encountered such peace and tranquility as there.  Some people are able to solve difficulties and we should see if we can learn from them as well as contribute to the peace process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support this timely and constructive motion.  All organisations go through what has been termed an organisational life cycle.  Most begin in a small way, then rapidly develop and eventually reach a stage of maturity which is sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;fat and happy&rdquo; stage.  At this point, in order to avoid entropy, an organisation must renew and revitalise itself or else die. The necessity for renewal does not imply there are flaws or faults in the organisation but it does imply that in order to continue to be vital and meaningful the organisation must continually look at itself, examine its ways of doing things, re-assess its goals and objectives and heed the signs of the times while reaffirming its primary purpose.</P>
      <P>The UN should welcome an examination of its roles, goals and structures and emerge from any such examination a stronger, healthier, more vibrant and more meaningful organisation.  The UN Secretary-General, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has begun this process with the publication of his report, <i>The Agenda for Peace</i>.  In it he writes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the creation of the UN in 1945, over 100 major conflicts around the world have left some 20 million people dead.  The United Nations was rendered powerless to deal with some of these crises because of the vetoes &mdash; 279 of them &mdash; cast in the Security Council, which were a vivid expression of the divisions of that period.  At the end of the cold war there have been no such vetoes since 31 May 1990 and demands on the United Nations have surged.  Its security arm, once disabled <Col N="1597" /> by circumstances it was not created or equipped to control, has emerged as a central instrument for the prevention and resolution of conflicts and for the preservation of peace ... Our aims must be to seek to identify at the earliest possible stage situations which could produce conflict and to try through diplomacy to remove the sources of danger before violence results.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General mentions a number of other aims but I will discuss this one in particular.  The UN has been developing a network of early warning systems concerning threats to the environment, the threat of famine and the spread of disease and the threat of nuclear accident such as occurred at Chernobyl and is waiting to occur at Windscale, now called Sellafield and at the THORP reprocessing plant.  We must formalise arrangements for providing data from various sources on possible threats.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General further states in his report:</P>
    <P>There is a need however to strengthen arrangements in such a manner that information from these sources can be synthesised with political indicators to assess whether a threat to peace exists and to analyse what action might be taken by the United Nations to alleviate it.  This is a process which will continue to require the close co-operation of the various specialised agencies and functional offices of the United Nations.  These analyses and recommendations for preventative action that emerge will be made available by me as appropriate to the Security Council and other United Nations organs.  I recommend in addition that the Security Council invite a re-invigorated and re-structured Economic and Social Council to provide reports in accordance with Article 65 of the Charter on those economic and social developments that may unless mitigated <Col N="1598" /> threaten international peace and security.</P>
    <P>In January of this year in The Hague in the Netherlands, Parliamentarians for Global Action met at an international parliamentarian conference on strengthening collective security based on an agenda for peace.  At the conference there was a call to set up a committee of parliamentarians on early warning.  Parliamentarians for Global Action is an organisation of democratically elected parliamentarians from all over the world and this country is unique in having four Ministers as members: the Minister for Defence and for the Marine, Deputy Andrews; the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins; the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin; and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who is present at this debate, is also a long term member of that organisation.  Mr. M.J. Nolan is a member of its international executive.</P>
    <P>In his address to that conference the Secretary-General said: &ldquo;The proposal of an early warning system run by parliamentarians is an excellent idea.&rdquo;  That system was set up and I am proud to be a member of it.  The membership is drawn from various countries and continents. An early warning system must be thought through.  How will 75 parliaments work to give a thorough and distilled report to the UN?  Consideration must be given to what kinds of emergency the network would want to draw to the attention of the UN.  Would they be primarily domestic or would they involve threats to neighbouring countries?  Intervention is a thorny issue.  Sovereignty is being gradually eroded by practice, but sensitivities remain.  An early warning alert system would have to remain focussed and narrow in scope.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General is insistent on enhancing conflict prevention and early warning is an essential aspect of any preventive effort.  He has already called upon ECOSOC to act as an early warning mechanism and to alert the Secretary-General's office to an economic issue in <Col N="1599" /> a nation or region which might be dangerous. In addition the UN has formed a working group under the UN Department of Humanitarian Assistance for early warning.  The group meets every two months to examine the need for preventive action.</P>
    <P>The parliamentarian early alert system is another step in the plan which could be co-ordinated with ECOSOC and DHA.  A parliamentarian early warning system is one small albeit important step in helping the UN in its role not merely of peace keeping and peace enforcement but in the prevention of conflict and the elimination of all threats to global human security before these threats develop to a level where they can no longer easily be controlled or eliminated.  I trust the Minister will see his way to assist this development and help the UN in its renewal process, thereby making it a more effective and efficient organisation, dedicated to world peace.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am tired of hearing Senator Norris attack the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church.  If the UN puts forward the view that abortion is one way of population control&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in congratulating and thanking Fine Gael for putting down this motion at this appropriate time.  I also thank the Minister for attending and giving us a broad and comprehensive review of the range of issues to be brought before the UN at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN is unique, not only in being the only international organisation truly representative of all the states of the world but also because it can only exercise <Col N="1600" /> its functions with the consent of all the member states.  I do not disagree with the Minister when he said:</P>
    <P>It is clear the United Nations will continue to play a central role in the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of economic and social co-operation among the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>While we would acknowledge that is clear, it is also shameful that the individual member states of that organisation, especially the more powerful states, are the ones which create and foment the violence for the selfish and unprincipled reasons of their armaments industry.  For as long as the armaments trade of the powerful UN member states is allowed to go unchecked we will find cause to regret the suffering, oppression and horrible tragedies we will see and many of us will be frustrated by the fact that we cannot do enough to alleviate the suffering and hardship of innocent people throughout the world.</P>
    <P>For that reason we should acknowledge it is unfortunate that despite the stated aims of the UN, the shameful and unprincipled activities of many member states cause the very problems we now decry and are shocked and horrified by on our television screens.  It is only now when it is happening before our eyes that we have become awake to these shameful actions by powerful member states.</P>
    <P>It is important to condemn the hypocrisy of those who prop up and support brutal regimes and facilitate slaughter by supplying armaments to them for their own unprincipled profit motives and who at a later stage make proposals through the United Nations and suggest United Nations intervention, while sometimes preventing that intervention.  The list is a litany of shame.  The Iran-Iraq conflict would not have lasted six months were it not for the fact that member states, and an individual member state of the EU, to which we belong, were supplying both sides.  Uganda's oppressive regime under Idi Amin could not have been the instrument of torture and oppression it was <Col N="1601" /> were it not for the fact that member states of the EU were supplying arms to that brutal tyrant.  I met people from Haiti in the Bahamas and I saw the fear and terror in their eyes when they were being deported back to Haiti.  How long could that situation have continued had it not been for the fact that member states of the United Nations supplied arms to these brutal regimes?  I am not only referring to the western world, although America has a lot to answer for, but also to the Soviet Union and many others which supplied arms to these brutal regimes.</P>
    <P>The list is endless.  Would Rwanda have had the power and the brutal forces which have been operating against the people, and imposing the type of suffering we find shameful and objectionable, were it not for the fact that others from a comfortable distance were making profit from the slaughter?  The same can be said about Cambodia.  When I was Minister for Foreign Affairs the killing fields of Cambodia represented one of the most shameful tragedies.  The EC, as it was called at that time, supported Pol Pot as the legitimate expression of the Cambodian people because it suited it not to acknowledge that the Vietnamese had a lawful role to play.  It did not matter that countless millions of people were being slaughtered. We supported this in the knowledge that at the same time it was being supplied with armaments by those who supported the regime.  The same can be said about the warlords in Somalia.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn was correct when he said that these countries spend $767 billion annually on arms.  That would not be the case were it not for the shameful actions of those with whom we are partners in many other ventures.  It is time we reminded them that such shame cannot be continued.  In 20 or 30 years' time someone will look at the irony of the fact that we had an international organisation with financial support, although not as great as it should have been, committed to peace, while at the same time its member states were doing everything possible to bring about <Col N="1602" /> slaughter and to create conditions for their own illicit, shameful profits.  The United Nations should be given a new role to sanction and, if necessary, to expel those members who profit from such illicit trading.</P>
    <P>There are safe havens with numbered accounts for the brutal tyrants of the world.  I have mentioned this many times in the House.  Switzerland has set an example for the world with its safe havens from which it makes a profit.  Instead of condemning this through the United Nations &mdash; and that is what we should do in any reformation of the United Nations &mdash; we should not follow that example and establish safe havens.  If we are to look at the future role of the United Nations, we should find ways of imposing sanctions and severe penalties on those who foment suffering and slaughter in so many parts of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this motion.  I compliment Senator Manning for introducing it and I support it.  I compliment the United Nations for the work it has done since its foundation almost 50 years ago.  My first memory of Irish participation in the United Nations relates to the Congo.  My cousin was a chaplain to the forces in the Congo.  As a child, I remember the reaction of this nation to the atrocities in the Congo as a result of the Niemba ambush.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning said that if the founders of the UN looked at the situation they would realise they had not achieved the aspirations they had for it.  I agree with that viewpoint.  It is a pity the members of the United Nations did not fully back the aspirations or objectives of the original founders of the United Nations.  One of the reasons for this is that the Cold War dominated world politics for 40 years and the United Nations was on the sidelines.  The major powers dominated such events as the erection of the Berlin Wall, the Hungarian rising and the defeat of Dubcek in Czechoslovakia, while the United Nations had to stand aside.  The Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States dominated the agenda during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> Now that things have changed, the United Nations and its members should assert themselves in a more dominant way in peacekeeping and in developing world events.  However, the members must ensure that the United Nations has the resources to do that.  We have already heard that the resources of the United Nations are stretched and that the major participants in world politics are slow to pay their financial dues to the United Nations.  Dáil questions have often been tabled about the level of payments due to this country for work done for the United Nations.  I understand there is still a considerable sum outstanding to the Exchequer from the United Nations for the excellent work our peacekeeping forces do in various areas.  I am sorry the Minister does not have an opportunity to tell us the level of moneys outstanding to the Exchequer.  As a small nation we have done our share for world peacekeeping, perhaps more so than many other countries. It is unfortunate there is an Exchequer deficit, while bigger nations, which have the resources to contribute to the finances of the United Nations, limit the payment of moneys to us.</P>
    <P>One is concerned about the failure of the United Nations to achieve the aspirations of its founders.  The United Nations and its members do not have the moral authority to ensure that its central role is carried out.  Often individual strong nations, for their own political objectives, limit, restrict and even eliminate the role the UN should play in conflict areas throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The House debated East Timor at length some time ago and I was happy to participate because I have an interest in that area.  The UN has been silent in this area.  Nations have not asserted or stated their position.  Strong members of the UN encourage the Indonesians in their role and approach to East Timor.  With the exception of Portugal and some other countries, no steps have been taken by the UN to intervene in the horrific slaughter and genocide of the East Timorese.</P>
    <P>The failure of UN participation in former Yugoslavia is a reflection of its <Col N="1604" /> success and its role.  Former Yugoslavia is part of Europe, it is part of our continent, yet we, as Europeans, have not brought this issue strongly enough to the UN, which has failed us.  Rwanda was discussed at length by other speakers. The genocide in that country is sickening. Television pictures are so revolting that one might ask what is the world political scene doing about this.  Why is the UN not more successful in intervening or controlling these areas?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the peace institute in Limerick.  I compliment it on the role it has taken in areas relating to the UN and in promoting a multinational research project on UN peacekeeping.  A team of researchers from Denmark, Germany and Austria are participating in that and I compliment them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is timely and I could use the time available to me to list the various activities of the UN.  This matter will need further discussion and debate when the structure of the UN is looked at.  I compliment Senator Manning for tabling this motion.</P>
      <P>This motion is timely because the UN Charter was signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945.  Its objectives were to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly relations among states based on the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples; to achieve international co-operation in solving problems of an economic social, cultural and humanitarian character; and to harmonise the actions of states in the attainment of these common ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a large extent, tonight's debate has been overshadowed by references to recent tragic events in Somalia, Rwanda and other trouble spots.  However, there is a huge dimension to the operation of the UN in many of the specialised agencies for which it is responsible and with which it deals.  I single out UNICEF, the children's organisation, for the tremendous work it has done.  We must remember 40,000 children die each day from malnutrition and disease.  Previous speakers mentioned horrific facts in other areas, but 150 million children suffer <Col N="1605" /> from disease and malnutrition.  These areas require urgent attention.  In any reorganisation of the UN in the coming years, it will be important to specify the various agencies, the contribution they make and where they may be expanded and further developed.</P>
    <P>It is equally important to hive off some activities dealt with by agencies but which could perhaps be dealt with on a national or state by state basis.  I wonder what influence the International Civil Aviation Authority has?  The International Labour Organisation could be dealt with at national level by Government; other than the small framework arrangement which would need to be put in place, I am sure most of these matters could be dealt with at national level.  The International Maritime Organisation and educational, scientific and research areas which have been dealt with by the UN could be hived off to some of the economic blocs which are developing at a rapid pace.</P>
    <P>Some of the other objectives of the UN are not being dealt with and are causing hardship and deprivation and, to a large extent, are the cause of unrest, conflict, economic despair, social injustice and political oppression.  These matters require urgent attention by the UN.  Crushing debt burdens, barriers to trade in the international arena, the gap between the rich and the poor, which is growing daily &mdash; I saw evidence of this on my recent visit to South Africa &mdash; poverty, disease, famine and the spread of drugs abuse are fundamentally damaging prospects for peace and stability in many countries.</P>
    <P>One only has to look at figures in relation to events which have happened over the past number of years to see the tragedy on our door step.  There are 17 million refugees and 20 million displaced people in the world today.  There is also a constant threat to our environment. Many of these issues, including humanitarian ones relating to children, the spread of disease and organisations like the World Health Organisations, must be supported.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary-General pointed out in the document, <i>Agenda for Peace,</i><Col N="1606" /> that the financial foundations of the organisation are getting weaker daily. World leaders &mdash; we can have an input here because I know the Minister is concerned about developments in the UN &mdash; must respond.  At the end of the day, world leaders will make the decisions in this regard.  We can play our part; I am sure our debate will be useful to the Minister in his deliberations at the UN.</P>
    <P>Irish people throughout the world have played an outstanding role in peacekeeping, peace making, the development of humanitarian assistance and helping people in the developing world to help themselves.  It is important that we note the work which has been done by nongovernmental and governmental personnel who have put their lives at risk and have given their lives when endeavouring to find solutions to problems which are always beyond comprehension. This evening's debate was worthwhile and I would like the opportunity to discuss this issue further at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to reply.  In such a debate, it is important to reply to points raised.  The Cairo conference was referred to and I agree with Members who suggested that we maintain a balance in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before, at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and at other meetings, that this whole question of population is central to the debate which began during the Rio conference on the environment.  The message from that conference was very clear: that the issues of development, environment, population, equality and justice are linked. The population is exploding, in particular in the developing world.  There is a link between population and sustainable <Col N="1607" /> development.  We support the human right to family planning and the right of parents to choose the number and spacing of their children.  We have been endeavouring to co-ordinate our position closely with our EU partners.  If Members look carefully at the EU position they will see that the principles of non-coercion and respect for traditions are clearly part of the EU position.  In consultation with our partners we are preparing for this very important conference.  We will not accept the promotion of abortion as a means of population control.  I have to spell out that position very clearly.</P>
    <P>The other issue raised was Rwanda. Many Senators have referred to the French position.  I wish to clarify what is happening.  As Members know, the French intend to send a force of 2,000 troops to Rwanda immediately to help stop the massacre.  The purpose of the force will be to contribute to the security of displaced people, refugees and civilians in danger.  The force would be empowered under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and would thus be able to use all the necessary means to attain its objectives. A precedent for this exists in the case of Somalia and UNITAF.  The force will be there for two months, until the increased UNAMIR force can become operative.</P>
    <P>It is a military mission with a humanitarian purpose.  That is the factual situation. During my visit to Rwanda I spoke with the Prime Minister of Tanzania, Mr. Malacela.  He made it very clear that his country could provide 3,000 troops if the logistics were made available. As a result of that, I spoke to the Tánaiste and to the Taoiseach on my return and our Government approached the United States with regard to this type of logistical support.  There has been some progress on that front.  The Organisation of African Unity has a crucial role and I welcome the involvement of President Mandela in that area.</P>
    <P>I agree with all those who have expressed concern.  Having been there, I share your deep concern about the appalling <Col N="1608" /> situation there.  The time for action is now.  I could talk at some length but I do not have time.  The Government has ensured that this is on the agenda for the Council summit in Corfu over the weekend.  I am not in a position to comment on the French position because the Security Council is dealing with it right now and it would not be prudent or appropriate to deal with it.  However, Members can be assured that the Government is giving this matter its full attention.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinn and O'Kennedy talked about armament expenditure.  It is a deplorable situation and obliges us to redouble our efforts in the area of multilateral disarmament.  The total spent on UN peacekeeping is less than 1 per cent of military expenditure worldwide.  That is a startling figure.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to Cambodia. I was the first representative of the Irish Government to go there, and as a result of our increase in expenditure on development, try to help with the reconstruction of Cambodia.  One of the major issues that we are helping as a Government to deal with is that of demining. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Kennedy.  It is time to call a stop to that.  In regard to the arms trade, we are very involved.  As the House knows, we have an honourable record on disarmament.  In my speech I talked about the non-proliferation treaty; we have also been active in promoting more effective control and transfers of conventional weapons and we will continue to play an active part in attempts to curb the arms trade and to advance the objective of a world free of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>I was asked the amount of arrears owing to Ireland from the UN.  The figure is £13.5 million, largely due to the UNIFIL account.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point of order, I have had it checked and a resolution of the Dáil is required.  A resolution of the Seanad is not required in regard to the deployment of the Army in these situations. When we want to send an armed contingent abroad as part of UN service <Col N="1609" /> a resolution of the Dáil is required.  In the normal course of legislation the Dáil and the Seanad are involved.  In this case I have had it checked with my officials to clear the record.  No doubt a debate would be required in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I was afraid the Minister would check that up, because as soon as I said it I felt that his civil servants would not make that sort of mistake, especially the two he has behind him there.  I thank everybody who has contributed to this debate.  It has been a very useful debate and all Members here agree with that.</P>
      <P>A number of the contributions touched upon some of the fundamental issues. Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Quinn in particular raised issues which are fundamental to any reform.  Senator O'Kennedy spoke about the double standards inherent in the behaviour of so many of the member states and Senator Quinn spoke about the contradiction implied in an organisation adopting warlike methods to bring about peace.  All in all, the debate has been extremely worthwhile. It is a debate which allows us to survey the issue from an honourable role. The question is probably one of the most important facing the world today.  From the experience we have gathered over 40 years in the UN and from the position of being one of the relatively few stable and very civic democracies in the world, we are in a position to make a new contribution, one which will not just reinforce the <i>status quo</i> but which, I hope, will plough new ground in the debate on the future of the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that this was the fortieth anniversary of Ireland's membership, and I pay tribute in that regard to our Minister for External Affairs at that time, Liam Cosgrave, who was the first Irish Minister in the UN.  He has grown in stature with the passing years. I also pay tribute to Frank Aiken.  Of all the Irish Ministers who have participated in the UN, Frank Aiken is the one who left the most lasting imprint.  He did so because he was prepared to break out of conventions.  He was often reviled for that at the time.  He had one of the better <Col N="1610" /> traditions of Fianna Fáil in that he was prepared to risk the belt of a crozier if he thought that what he was saying was right.  It is important that we put the contribution of Frank Aiken and of other Minsters, such as Garret FitzGerald, into the context of the UN.</P>
    <P>Senators Henry, Daly, Taylor-Quinn and others highlighted the fact that the activities of the UN go much further than peacekeeping, peacemaking or peace-enforcing. The UN carries out a wide range of activities and it has been entrusted with an enormous range of responsibilities arising out of the Rio summit.  It is probably the only forum where many of these issues can properly be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is always a pleasure to have the Minister in the House.  His speech was interesting; it was a very accurate account of what Ireland has done and is doing.  I give the Minister one piece of advice here this evening.  If we are to make the contribution all of us want to make to the ongoing debate, I urge him to go the Aiken way, to break out of the mould of conventional thinking on this.  I am sure that the civil servants in his Department would like him to go that way.  I cannot speak for them but I think that they do not want to be bound by being too careful.</P>
    <P>The public is now very well informed. Whether among those who served in voluntary agencies, in the universities or in Limerick in the Peace Institute, among the Army or members of the Garda who have served in the UN, there is a much wider consciousness; and with the end of the Cold War and the new central role for the UN, now is the time to start a real debate on how the UN should progress and what Ireland's contribution should be.  In this we will be in line with Australia, Canada and many of the other countries who have been the stalwarts of the UN over the years, all of whom have been dedicated to peace, justice and democracy and to a stable world order. We have many allies.</P>
    <P>Let this debate start a wider debate. Our contribution will be the main beneficiary. <Col N="1611" /> If the Minister starts the process of listening in this House and elsewhere, he will be surprised at the positiveness of the response.  I thank all those who contributed to the debate.</P>

The approval of the Oireachtas for such a transfer is totally disproportionate to the issues involved.

    <P>The section states that &ldquo;a person other than a registered undertaking shall not carry on health insurance business&rdquo;.  I want to change this as proposed in the amendment.  When there is competition &mdash; as we hope there will be &mdash; under the new regulations as in all insurance there will be intermediaries who will try to give people what they feel is the best quote or benefit available.  Sometimes these people have no responsibility for what they sell to the public.  The purpose of the amendment is that these intermediaries should not act in relation to health insurance.</P>

    <P>This section says that &ldquo;The authority may accept gifts of money, land or other property upon such trusts or conditions ... as may be specified by the donor&rdquo;.  I wish to amend this as proposed.  There should be some control over the gifts that are made to such an authority and they should have the approval of the Houses of the <Col N="1613" /> Oireachtas.

      <P>This amendment is not necessary, given that subsection (2) of this section provides that the Authority shall not accept a gift if the trusts or conditions attached to it would be inconsistent with the functions given to the Authority under the Act.  To make the acceptance of gifts by the Authority subject to the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas is an inappropriate use of Oireachtas time and disproportionate to the activities that would be monitored under the amendment.  Every corporate body established under the Acts of the Oireachtas has as a normal part of its functions the power to accept gifts.  There is no case in which the acceptance of such gifts is conditional upon a formal approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas. If that was to be the case for every corporate body we would do little else in these Houses.</P>

Such an amendment does not seem necessary or appropriate.  Few appointments require the formal approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas; the only two which spring to mind are the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General.

      <P>The registrar of the Authority will not discharge functions directly on behalf of the Oireachtas; the functions exercised by the registrar will be on behalf of the Authority, which will be appointed by me.

    <P>We had some discussion today concerning transparency in relation to this Authority and Senator Quinn spoke about this.  Transparency and accountability are important in an Authority of this nature.  My amendment asks that the words &ldquo;or to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rdquo; be inserted after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.  This is where disclosure of information shall be made.

      <P>I do not propose to accept Senator Doyle's amendment.

      <P>As a career guidance counsellor by profession, many of my constituents have approached me on this matter as they presumed I would be knowledgeable regarding the requirements for the position of librarian assistant in Dublin city, County Dublin or countrywide.  The requirements stipulate that the applicant must have attained at least two grade Cs at higher level in the leaving certificate examination before being called for the competition for librarian assistant.  Success in the competition leads to interview stage and success at that stage leads to placement on a panel.</P>
      <P>A woman contacted me regarding this stipulation to advise that, despite the fact that she has her Leaving Certificate, in addition to a diploma in librarianship from UCD, she did not qualify for the position of librarian assistant as she did not have at least two grade Cs at higher level in the leaving certificate examination. The reason for this was that she matriculated into college by combining her results from both the leaving certificate and matriculation examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should review this stipulation as it is unfair that people should be deprived of the possibility of being considered for assessment at interview for this position, given that some of them, <Col N="1617" /> with a diploma in librarianship, are so well qualified.  This is especially the case, given that the position under consideration is that of librarian assistant, not assistant librarianship.</P>
    <P>On the point of job titles, the terminology used is confusing.  One post is a grade V, while the other post is a grade III.  In this respect communication lines must be made clearer for the benefit of the public.</P>
    <P>Another stipulation for this position is that the applicant must obtain the necessary results on one sitting of the leaving certificate.  In this respect, there are many students returning to second chance education. What happens in the case of those students operating through the VTOS programme, who may have to obtain their leaving certificate by taking a couple of subjects per year?  Will they be deprived, through these regulations, of consideration for the position of librarian assistant and of getting into the Civil Service?</P>
    <P>These regulations and stipulations must be reviewed and there must be an examination made of how best they may be changed.  There are many people who, under the encouragement of my guidance and counselling, would take a diploma in librarianship, following which they may have a better chance of being called, through interview, to the Civil Service or to the libraries of the corporations and county councils.  However, at present they will not be considered if they do not have two grade Cs at higher level obtained at one sitting of the leaving certificate examination, not matter how highly qualified they are.</P>
    <P>The Minister should change the requirement to two grade Cs at higher level obtained at the leaving certificate examinations, or higher qualification. This should then be sufficient for consideration, not alone for the competition but also for assessment at interview.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Ormonde for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline developments in this regard.  I agree that <Col N="1618" /> there is a need for a review of the qualifications and particulars of office for the post of library assistant in the local authorities service.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be pleased to note that a working group, consisting of representatives from local authorities, the County and City Manager's Association and my Department has already been established for the purpose of reviewing the qualifications and particulars of office concerned, and the remit of the working group extends to clerical recruitment grades also.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a statutory function regarding the declaration of qualifications and the approval of particulars of office for local authority officer grades. Before proceeding to declare and approve amended qualifications and particulars of office, respectively, for the post of library assistant, the Minister will of course have regard to whatever conclusions are reached by the working group.</P>
      <P>Consultations with staff interests are likely to arise also before matters are finalised.  The existing qualifications and particulars of office date back to the late 1970s and it is clear that in the intervening period major changes have occurred which impact on recruitment requirements.</P>
      <P>The most pertinent changes are the raising of recruitment age limits and changes in the educational system.  In addition, the question of possible implications arising from our membership of the EU needs to be considered.  Furthermore, in recent times the proportion of candidates presenting with third level qualifications has increased and the desirability of allowing credit to be given for such qualifications also needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I will convey the views of the Senator to the working group to assist it in its deliberations and I hope that matters can be finalised without undue delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, for allowing me to raise <Col N="1619" /> this most important issue in the House this evening, an issue which has caused much disturbance in Monaghan town.  I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and hopefully the debate this evening will be productive.</P>
      <P>I placed a request for this debate because the quality of water in Monaghan town was a major issue during the recent local elections.  It is generally agreed that the quality of water in some parts of the town is seriously substandard.  The water is drawn from three different sources &mdash; Togan, Lambs Lake and the Saint Davnett's borehole.  The water from Togan is of good quality; however, the water from the other two sources is substandard.  At regular intervals it contains sediment, is discoloured and carries an unsavoury odour.  Consumer's can see these obvious imperfections for themselves in the water and they have, naturally, formed the opinion that the water is unfit for human consumption.</P>
      <P>The people believe that the water constitutes a danger to health.  At certain times people find that their clothing and other items are discoloured after washing. Indeed, ingenious housewives are now placing items for washing inside a pillow case in an effort to prevent discolouring, an exercise which is partially successful.</P>
      <P>However, the most important aspect of the situation is that consumer's are afraid to drink the water.  They are providing for their household needs either by purchasing water in the shops or, as is the case for many people, by drawing water from clean wells.</P>
      <P>This situation is untenable and unique in urban Ireland today.  An urgent solution to the problem must be found, and hopefully the debate in the House this evening will give impetus and urgency to this effort.  In this respect, and on behalf of the people of Monaghan town, I urge the Minister to take a personal interest in this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should satisfy himself that the water in parts of the town is seriously substandard.  When he realises the seriousness of the situation the Minister <Col N="1620" /> will be impelled to take immediate action.  He will find that the situation is unacceptable and that it should not allowed to continue for one minute longer.</P>
    <P>The Department's plan for that area is that the new water source for Monaghan town should be sourced in the Tydavnet underground basin.  Indeed, the Department has already provided finance for test drilling of this source.  However, the problem in this instance is that it will be a number of years before the source is tapped.  It is obvious that consumers in Monaghan town cannot be asked to wait until good water from this source is available.</P>
    <P>There is another solution which I would like the Minister to evaluate urgently.  Monaghan County Council has developed a regional source at Kilkitt, east of Ballybay.  This scheme can provide an abundance of good water, which is currently being fed to households a few miles from Monaghan town through the pipes of a rural water scheme.  At very little cost this good water could be supplied to the disillusioned householders in Monaghan town.  It could be flowing through the taps within a short period of time.  When the Minister examines the situation I hope he will agree that this solution must be pursued as a matter of urgency.  My purpose this evening is to persuade the Minister to take this course of action and I hope I will succeed in that.</P>
    <P>There is one element of this matter which saddens me greatly and which I feel I must report to the House.  During the course of the local election campaign a Sinn Féin candidate, who is a sitting member of Monaghan County Council, publicised the fact that he held in his possession documented proof that the water in Monaghan town constituted a health hazard.  This information was widely publicised in the local media and at public meetings.  However, on two separate occasions today I requested that his alleged proof be presented to the Minister this evening.  He callously declined to provide it.  I can only conclude that he <Col N="1621" /> used the poor quality of the water to collect votes in the election.  Mind you, he was quite successful in that.  If that turns out to be the case, many people will conclude that his approach was wildly irresponsible.  He will be accused of callous and dangerous bluff, having no regard for the health of the people he purports to represent.  By refusing to bring forward his alleged documented proof today, he effectively made a negative contribution to finding a solution. He put himself forward during the campaign as the single most outspoken proponent of a solution for the problem.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to fully inform himself of the substandard quality of the water in Monaghan.  I further urge that he immediately initiate steps to bring good quality water from the Kilkitt scheme to the beleaguered consumers in Monaghan town.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senator Cotter for raising this matter.  I am aware that there are problems with water supply in Monaghan and I appreciate the importance attached to the Monaghan water supply.  The overall project, which is estimated to cost £8.5 million, involves the development of production bores together with associate storage, treatment and transmission lines to deliver water to Monaghan town.  Tenders for phase 1A of the scheme, which involves development of production bores at Knockatallon in north Monaghan, have been received in the Department. However, in common with many other worthwhile proposals around the country, it has not been possible to provide financing for it up to now due to the pressure of other priority schemes within the water and sanitary services programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator will be aware, considerable progress has been made in the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure in County Monaghan.  In the <Col N="1622" /> 1989-93 period over £9 million of Exchequer and EU finance has been invested in important projects, including sewerage works at Carrickmacross, Smithboro, Newbliss, Rockcorry and a flood relief scheme in Monaghan town. Only last April the Minister for the Environment opened a modern sophisticated sewage treatment plant facility for Monaghan town which has been completed at a cost of over £7 million.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding such progress, I am sure the Senator will appreciate that we cannot meet all the demands for water and sewerage schemes at the pace we would all like.  Work is well advanced within the framework of the National Development Plan on the water and sewerage programme for the period 1994-99.  The determination of priorities under this programme will take account of a wide range of factors, including the need to meet our obligations under the urban waste, water and drinking water directives, and the requirements of industry and the tourism sector.  I will keep the Senator informed of the position in relation to Monaghan water in this regard.</P>

      <P>I want to thank him for his response.  He has an understanding of the situation but, quite honestly, it is worse than the Minister appreciates.  I hope I can discuss the matter with him on a personal basis.  Will the Minister agree to look at the Kilkitt scheme in the interim period because it will take some years before the scheme he mentioned, the Knockatallon/Tydavnet water basin, is completed?  The people of Monaghan town really cannot wait that long.  Water is being taken from Kilkitt to within three miles of Monaghan town at this stage. Could the Minister discuss this with me and with the local authority with a view <Col N="1623" /> to eliminating the terribly bad supply which is seriously substandard?  I would appreciate it if the Minister would initiate discussions on that.</P>

      <P>My officials will examine <Col N="1624" /> the alternative supply that the Senator has suggested from the nearby water scheme and we will advise him of the outcome of that examination.</P>
