      <P>I call on the Leader of the House to express the sympathy of the Seanad to Senator Wilson on the recent tragic death of his son.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with the deepest sense of sadness that I propose this expression of sympathy on the tragic death of Peter Wilson, son of our colleague, Senator Wilson.  That the Wilson family should have to endure this double tragedy is hard to accept.  As Senator Wilson said: &ldquo;What more can befall of us?  We have suffered so much.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Seanad who have come to know Gordon personally can only hope and pray that his faith in God, which clearly shines through all his political work, will give him and his family the strength to bear this unbelievable burden. Those of us who attended the very <Col N="1094" /> moving service of thanksgiving in Enniskillen could not but be struck by the church and the community which were of immeasurable strength and support to the Wilson family.  On behalf of my Fianna Fáil colleagues I express our deepest sympathy to Peter's wife Ingrid, daughters Eloise and Judith, to Gordon and his wife Joan, and to Peter's sister Julie Anne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Senators, I join with you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader of the House in the moving tribute he has paid and sympathy he has expressed to Senator Wilson.  It is an indication of the special place Gordon Wilson has carved out for himself in the minds and hearts of the people on all parts of this island that the universal reaction to the tragic death of his son Peter last week was horror and shock and a profound sense of sympathy at how much one man and one family were being asked to bear.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House referred to the very moving funeral service; it was a tribute to the affection which Gordon Wilson has in all our hearts that so many people from all parties in this House, and officials of the House, journeyed to Enniskillen to be present with the Wilson family at this moment of unutterable sadness.  As the Leader said, we were profoundly impressed with the faith of the people present and the simple but very moving service, but in the midst of it all, our hearts had to go out to Peter Wilson's widow, his two young daughters and to the family who have shown us all such an extraordinary example during these difficult times.  On behalf of my colleagues, I join in the expression of sympathy to our dear colleague, Gordan Wilson.</P>

      <P>I do not know what we can say to offer comfort to Senator Wilson at this time.  It is sad that a family who had to go through a tragedy should suffer another one, particularly when peace had come, a peace for which Gordon has worked so hard and which he should have been able to <Col N="1095" /> enjoy.  As other Senators said, he has been an inspiration to us and to all the people on this island.  His message to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation last Friday, following the vote of sympathy, was that although he and his wife had suffered a tragedy, it was worse for his son's wife and children.  This is an indication of the way Gordon Wilson thinks.  That is an indication of how, even at that stage, he was thinking of someone else rather than himself.  On behalf of my party, I extend my sympathy to Senator Wilson, his wife, daughter, daughter-in-law and grandchildren.</P>

      <P>A couple of weeks ago the Taoiseach said in the Dáil that no matter how great the distress of public life is to a public person, we must always remember the great distress and grief borne by those in the background and by the family.  Those of us who were at the service for Mr. Peter Wilson last Saturday saw the tremendous courage and dignity of a family in the background and the way they accepted God's will in the terrible loss &mdash; the second &mdash; for their family.  Watching their acceptance of a terrible tragedy for a second time and seeing the people in that church made us understand even more why Senator Wilson is such a constant witness of the need for peace in this country and why we should be ever grateful for people such as the Wilson family and those who were there that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The death of Peter Wilson is a terrible loss for Gordon.  As others have said, we must remember, particularly today, the great loss for his family.  It is important to remember that Mrs. Joan Wilson would have been at the cenotaph that day had it not been for the fact that she plays the organ in the church we attended last week.  It was a long time after the service before they realised there had been an explosion at the cenotaph and Joan Wilson learned that Marie had been killed and her husband <Col N="1096" /> badly injured.  I know Peter's loss is terrible for her.</P>
    <P>We must remember that what we have gained as a result of Senator Wilson coming into public life and accepting the offer to be with us in the Seanad, Joan has lost.  She is on her own in the evenings, although she has a good social life and teaches the violin.  I occasionally telephoned her in the evenings and she often said that Peter would be calling in later.</P>
    <P>One saw the great courage of Ingrid Wilson, who teaches in the Model School, and of Eloise and Judith during the service.  I remember Eloise and Judith being on &ldquo;School Around the Corner&rdquo;, they were wonderful.  I wrote to Gordon and Joan later and said how proud they must have been.  They said they were proud of the children; and they must have been proud of them last weekend too.</P>
    <P>While we and Ireland have gained a lot as a result of Senator Wilson being among us, it is important to remember that his immediate family have lost a great deal.  The first day we came into the Seanad I explained my family's connection with Senator Wilson's family; my father was given his first good job by Senator Wilson's father.  It is extraordinary that a family who always seemed to give should have, once again, something taken away from them.  It is extremely hard at times to understand God's will but, having seen their courage last Saturday, I am sure they will bear this bereavement.  Our prayers and sympathies will be greatly appreciated by the Wilson family and their friends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I, too, would like to extend our sympathy to Senator Gordon Wilson, his wife, Joan, and particularly Peter's wife, Ingrid, and their two daughters, Eloise and Judith.  I, like many of the Members of this House, attended the ceremony in Enniskillen on Saturday and looking at that family it is very difficult to understand why one family can be expected to accept so much suffering.  The death of a child is <Col N="1097" /> not in the natural order of things.  To have a child taken from you as Gordon and Joan have with their daughter Marie is difficult enough, but to lose a second child would seem almost impossible to bear.</P>
      <P>I am sure that once again through their great courage and inspiration and strength of character Gordon and Joan will come through this and Gordon will once again be able to join us here in the Seanad where he can do so much, and where so much remains to be done.  As other Senators have said, the peace process meant a great deal to all of us, but to Gordon Wilson it meant much more. He really understood the great benefits of peace.</P>
      <P>Gordon Wilson has become part of every family in this country and because of that all families on this island mourned the death of Peter last Saturday. It is difficult for anything we say here today to mean anything, but I want Gordon and his wife, Ingrid and their daughter to know they are in our thoughts and prayers.  I hope that will help them to bear this great loss.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The service in the church in Enniskillen last week for Peter Wilson was a thanksgiving service.  That they were able to have a thanksgiving service for the 38 years of Peter Wilson's life showed us the strength of Gordon Wilson and his family.  It is a reminder to us of that faith that was referred to earlier by the Leader of the House.  When Gordon Wilson lost his daughter Marie he talked about forgiveness in the very first week.  The words &ldquo;forgive them, for they know not what they do&rdquo; are clearly the words of a true Christian.  The lorry <Col N="1098" /> driver who was involved in the accident with Peter Wilson visited their home. They joined with him, hugged him and talked about the happy life Peter had; they looked back on the good things rather than on their own sorrow.</P>
    <P>I am reminded as well of their thoughts for Ingrid, for Eloise and for Judith, the family who are left behind. We all express our sympathy to Gordon and to Joan and, through them, to the remainder of that family who so miss Peter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy to Gordon Wilson and his family.  I was at his daughter Marie's funeral and it was a sad occasion.  No one thinks that lightning will strike twice but it has struck very hard in the Wilson household.</P>
      <P>The late Peter Wilson was very much involved in the commercial life of Enniskillen. He was an active member of the Methodist Church and will be very much missed.  It was very sad for him and for his great friend.  The two fathers and two sons played four ball golf, every Boxing Day.  They played last Boxing Day.  Little did they know it would be the last time.  The two young men are buried today.  Sadness is doubled in the area; two good friends have been taken from this life callously and cruelly, but such is the way of the world.</P>
      <P>To Gordon, his wife and family my sincere sympathy.  Go dtuga Dia suaimhneas dá n-anamacha.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the votes of sympathy to Gordon Wilson and his family.  Those of us who were there in Enniskillen on Saturday felt the change in atmosphere that has taken place in Northern Ireland.  It bears testimony to the tragedy which the Wilson family has had to endure and to the unifying force which Gordon Wilson has been to the South and Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, made an inspired choice when he named Gordon Wilson as one of his nominees.  He has been a unifying force since he came to the Seanad.  We <Col N="1099" /> all sympathise with him and his family on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I too would like to express my sympathy.  I have been impressed by the faith and courage shown by Senator Wilson and his family. That faith and courage have been an inspiration to us all.  I extend my sympathy to Gordon's family and to Peter's family.  It was a second tragedy to befall this family.  Again, I extend my sympathy.</P>

      <P>Over the weekend two men very much associated with both Houses of the Oireachtas passed away. I speak of the late Paddy Cullagh who was a member of the staff for 52 years. He was one of the great characters of these Houses and was loved by all.  I extend the deepest sympathy of the House to his daughter, Sandra.</P>
      <P>The death of Jack O'Leary also occurred at the weekend.  He was a former Captain of the Guard and Superintendent of the House and served from 1963 to 1981.  On behalf of the House, I extend its sympathy to his daughter, Pauline.</P>

      <P>One is reluctant to intrude a note of disruption given the outbreak of peace all round.  I accept what the Leader has said and we are anxious to accommodate him.  However, it is not very satisfactory.  There is an almost indecent haste in bringing the legislation to the House and it is evident from listening to Committee Stage in the Dáil this afternoon just how complex the issues are and how much potential there is for trouble.  Experience has taught us that when we rush Bills through the House, we tend to create problems further on.  It is a pity that the haste which is evident in the Bill is not evident in the formation of the Government. That is perhaps where the focus of haste should be.</P>

      <P>In accepting the Leader's suggested Order of Business we have to be very careful.  When I came into this House I spoke about the need for speed and brevity.  However, I did not mean this sort of speed.  Brevity is not at the top of my agenda having listened to and watched the proceedings in the other Chamber today.  It seems that this legislation is much more complex than was originally envisaged.</P>
      <P>It scares and worries me when we take Bills at such a speed that we do not get a chance to examine them in detail. I am concerned about it.  I have spoken on this issue before &mdash; I accept that this is the first time we have had such an instance &mdash; but it seems that on this occasion, there is a great need for speed. In undertaking to pass all Stages tonight we should do so with care, attention and with the interests of the citizens at heart and make sure that we do not pass something which infringes on their rights which have been so carefully protected in our Constitution.</P>

    <Title>Select Committee on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Immunity) Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Government initially planned to introduce a somewhat different Bill to this House to deal with privilege of witnesses before Oireachtas committees and related matters.  That Bill was much wider in its scope than the measure initially introduced in Dáil Éireann. <Col N="1103" /> While the complex issues involved in such legislation have been considered in depth both by my Department and the Attorney General's Office, a final text had not come to hand when other events came into play.  There are few Members of the House who have held ministerial office who will not understand the exasperation I feel at introducing a rapidly produced measure on the same subject to cope with a transient problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill before this House today is not designed for posterity; it is tailored to an immediate issue now and has a simple purpose &mdash; to ensure that witnesses before a specific Oireachtas committee who do not already enjoy the absolute privilege accorded to Members of the Oireachtas at a meeting of an Oireachtas committee are accorded protection from the hazards of litigation arising from the evidence they give to the Dáil's Select Committee on Legislation and Security in the inquiry it is currently undertaking.</P>
      <P>The Bill relates only to the particular inquiry initiated on the sixth day of this month.  Since the mandate then given has lapsed to whatever new order is made by the Dáil for its continuance, it has no application beyond that.  Generally Acts are brought into operation by ministerial order.  In this case, because of the Dáil's right under the Constitution to regulate its own procedures, a different mechanism is required.  Therefore the Bill, if enacted, will be brought into operation by resolution of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Chairman of the Dáil committee has already listed to that House a number of people who are not Members of the Oireachtas from whom evidence is to be sought.  They include public servants and the Attorney General who is a constitutional officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General has indicated that he is prepared to give evidence to the committee.  A crucial condition &mdash; the grant of unqualified privilege &mdash; was not within the Government's gift and can only be conferred by an Act of the <Col N="1104" /> Oireachtas.  The Bill is designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to do so.  What the Attorney General's approach ensured was that the issue would be dealt with before evidence taking commenced rather than, as in the past, during or subsequent to that process.</P>
    <P>The fundamental thrust of the Bill is to confer privilege on witnesses.  The projected Bill in its initial form contained a basic provision giving witnesses the same privilege afforded to witnesses giving evidence in the High Court.  This is not an absolute privilege.  If a witness in the High Court was to take advantage of his or her position to utter something defamatory, having no reference to the cause or matter of inquiry but introduced maliciously for his or her own purpose, no privilege or immunity would attach.  The privilege provided for in the Act will be similarly limited.</P>
    <P>Privilege applies not only to evidence given before the committee but also to any document or thing &mdash; the most obvious example being a tape recording or video &mdash; produced or sent to the committee at its request.  It protects the witness not only from civil but also from criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Doubts have been expressed about the impact on privilege of the presence at committee hearings of the public, press or broadcasting.  The Bill seeks to put this beyond all possible doubt by providing that their presence will not diminish the privilege which it is intended to confer on witnesses.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have already emphasised to the Dáil that it is not within the power of the Oireachtas, even when its Members are animated by the most high minded of motives, to deprive citizens of this State of certain fundamental rights which derive from the Constitution.  Failure in the past by a committee to pay due regard to those rights culminated in its actions being set aside in the courts.  These purport to be met by section 3 of the Bill which replaced specific sections recommended by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Bill initially provided for the payment of reasonable costs to a person <Col N="1105" /> appearing, either in person or through a legal representative, before the committee or furnishing evidence.  This requirement, too, arises from a specific High Court judgment based on the Haughey case which recognised that inquiries by an Oireachtas committee or tribunal could put a witness in &ldquo;a position more analogous to that of a person accused of a criminal offence than to that of a witness to facts&rdquo; and therefore entitled to legal representation and to &ldquo;be indemnified by the State against the expense incurred for such legal representation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Members of all parties in the House will be aware that this Bill was the subject of inter-party consultation.  The text which has been produced attempts to address the various concerns expressed in those discussions.  One point repeatedly made to Ministers when the original Bill underwent the scrutiny of Ministers and civil servants was that changes in the power of committees could not leave us with committees functioning as they had before being invested with a new authority.  Changes in the relationship between a committee and its witnesses, I was told, had to bring about fundamental changes in the way in which committees worked.  Anybody who believed that committees with an inquisitorial dimension could function in the same way as a court or a tribunal without the checks and balances built into the operation of those institutions, I was informed, had got things totally wrong.  For, once a committee sets out upon an investigative road involving witnesses making privileged statements and a compulsion on witnesses to attend, the basic concepts of natural justice which underpin our Constitution come automatically into play.</P>
    <P>The change means that the free ranging spontaneous line of questioning initiated by a member as the spirit moves him or her must be reviewed so that a witness has a clear indication of the matters about which he or she is to be questioned.  The latitude traditionally and often productively accorded to committee members in interpreting the terms of reference of their committee <Col N="1106" /> will have to be reined in.  Most of all, it will require that members abandon at the door of the committee room the preconceptions which they might bring to bear on the same issue before the whole House.</P>
    <P>This places a particular burden of responsibility on the Chair, but it does not stop there.  Even the most astute and vigilant chairperson will find it impossible to predict whether a particular line of questioning initiated by a member will elicit a reply improperly damaging to a third party.  It is true that mechanisms to correct or rebut such statements can be put in place but, if, as the proverb states &ldquo;The spoken word cannot be recalled&rdquo;, the immediate impact of a sound bite on a live broadcast of committee proceedings is even less susceptible to effective correction.  This fact alone shifts the burden of responsibility from chairpersons towards the individual member and from my own experience as a committee member, I am conscious of the difficulty of shedding old and valued modes of working.  However, there must be change.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the difficult task facing chairpersons in controlling the contribution of members whose quirks and proclivities they know from working in the intimacy of a committee.  These difficulties are increased immeasurably when, as in the present instance, non members of a committee exercise their right to attend and be heard.  I suspect that in the transition the committees questioning privileged witnesses or functioning in an investigating mode, the right to participate will, in the interests of effective operation, have to be curtailed in some way.  Witnesses are now to be invested with privilege and rendered substantially, if not totally, unamenable to the law for what they say or transmit.  This is unusual and it is essential that the privilege now confirmed be balanced by a clear recognition that they as members have clear responsibilities.</P>
    <P>One, hopefully hypothetical, danger, with which the Bill in its present state does not deal is the possibility of a witness <Col N="1107" /> coming before this committee making allegations and then withdrawing when his or her statement is to be put to the test of cross-examination.  Ideally, some sanction should be available to prevent such an occurrence.  The Bill, which we earlier planned to bring before the House, addressed this problem. It provided a &ldquo;trade off&rdquo; between compellability of witnesses and the grant of privilege.  A witness could be compelled under strict penalties to come before certain committees or produce certain documentation which in normal circumstances could bring adverse legal consequences on their head.  In these circumstances, it was obviously essential to provide a corresponding level of immunity from the law.  Such is a balance is absent from this Bill and the thinking which influenced the Government in this regard will be evident to all.</P>
    <P>Compellability involves, as those who read the preliminary draft text will appreciate, a recognition that certain categories of information or even certain categories of person be exempted. Clearly, the choices which this or any Government envisages in that respect will be a matter at any time of legitimate political controversy.  However, since this measure is purpose built for one inquiry only and the persons which the committee wishes to question would be expected to be co-operative, once their constitutional rights were adequately protected, it is presumed that compellability is not essential.</P>
    <P>I began by referring to another Bill which I had for some time hoped and expected to bring before the House in the present session.  While this measure falls short of that, it does afford an opportunity to see how elements of what I wished to introduce might work in practice.  Manufacturers and marketers use trial runs to see how innovations can be improved; it is rare that a Legislature has an opportunity to test drive a new process.  It is vital for the future development of our committees that this particular exercise be <Col N="1108" /> approached with the sense of justice, fairness and non-partisanship which for so long characterised the committees of the House.</P>
    <P>It is normal for a Minister introducing a Bill to commend it to the House.  This is a formula which, unfortunately, I will not use tonight.  The Bill in its original form was introduced to Dáil Éireann as a bipartisan measure, designed for a limited purpose, but, in the course of its progress through that House, suffered serious evisceration.  What remains may still perform to some degree the task required of it but the changes made to it give me strong reasons for doubting its capacity to pass the various tests of constitutionality which apply to legislation in terms of its text and application.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the choice the Government faced and with regard to the Bill he stated:</P>
      <P>However, since this measure is purpose built for one inquiry only and the persons which the committee wishes to question would be expected to be co-operative once their constitutional rights were adequately protected, it is presumed that compellability is not essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the measure is tailored for one inquiry, but the procedures which will be adopted in this matter will be used as a precedent in the future.  It is important that the measures taken and the methods adopted in the inquiry are done so with care.  Since this House is <Col N="1109" /> governed by rules and by precedent great care is essential.</P>
    <P>When the Attorney General appeared before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security he was willing to furnish all information and documents in his possession as long as he was granted privilege.  The former Attorney General is also agreeable to give all necessary information.  I presume that all the civil servants involved &mdash; some of whom have been named &mdash; particularly from the Office of the Attorney General, will also agree to come before the committee and co-operate fully with the inquiry.</P>
    <P>When dealing with inquiries of this nature it is important to examine the matters involved.  There are a number of factors we should consider, although they are not major points which will cause any difficulty.  The Select Committee on Legislation and Security has 31 members and all Members of the Dáil have a right to take part.  A committee of that size is unwieldy and makes it difficult to manage procedures.  Holding the proceedings of an inquiry of this nature in the vast Chamber of the Lower House is not satisfactory.  Committees usually meet in the committee rooms which allow debates to proceed in a more orderly manner.  These problems should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the committee, Deputy Wallace, made a great effort to control proceedings but it was difficult. With the greatest respect to the Chairman of that committee, he will require a senior public official, preferably with a strong legal background, to guide him. He may even require a team of officials because it is essential that he have guidance as to the intricacies that can arise.</P>
    <P>When dealing with issues of this nature the political parties and groups should give thought to the line of questioning and how it is organised.  Each group should structure its questioning.  I have experience of court procedures and it is unfair for any witness to be <Col N="1110" /> cross-examined by between five and 20 people.</P>

It is essential that the questioning be more confined and precise.  Each party or group should take it upon itself to organise this questioning in a proper manner.  Certain rules and regulations should be in place for advocacy and questioning the evidence of others.  If some thought is given to this it can be addressed but it is essential that each party does its work beforehand.</P>

      <P>It would be much more equitable if Members did not require legal representation.  The same applies to witnesses.  We are speaking of an inquiry by Members of the other House to learn the truth of what happened.  In this instance the committee will inquire into all the items set out in the Schedule. None of the people with whom I have discussed the matter feels they need legal representation.</P>
      <P>This will not be a court; it will not have the power to impose penalties.  The worst that can happen is that any offence found to have been committed will be reported to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; perhaps the Minister can correct me if that is not the case.  Since it is not a court, it is not necessary to have legal representation.</P>
      <P>The people who are to be questioned are Ministers, the Attorney General, his predecessor and officials from that office.  From my knowledge of those people they will be well able to make their case, look after their interests, defend their actions and protect their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to have procedures which will be acted upon.  As Members of the Oireachtas we have a duty to ensure that whatever issues come before the House &mdash; Question Time in the Dáil, Ministers giving information to the Dáil or Seanad &mdash; all the facts are given, but this committee will not be able to do that.  The sooner we examine how Ministers can be compelled to give full, frank and proper answers to questions in both Houses the better.  If this procedure had been in place the beef tribunal would never have been required.  The current situation is somewhat different.  We will not know whether the full facts were provided until they are published.  This Bill will be used as a guideline in future. <Col N="1112" /> It is essential that all political parties bear in mind that whatever happens, whatever questions are asked and replies given, they will be taken as precedents and it is important that we get it right.  Points of view will be put forward and questions will be asked on behalf of one side.  They are seeking the truth and will be supported by their own people.</P>
    <P>It is important to get at the truth.  The full facts should be brought before the people so that they can decide what is accurate and what is not.  It would be terrible if anybody, because they are not getting legal representation or for some other reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with you, a Chathaoirligh, in welcoming back Senator Howard.  The man is in such rude good health that I thought he was prepared to charge around the country, but I do not think that will be necessary. <Col N="1113" /> Nonetheless, Senator Howard knows he has our best wishes.</P>
      <P>There are very few of the concluding comments made by Senator Enright with which I would disagree.  The first and most fundamental point is to get to the truth; that is the greatest anxiety of all parties in this House.  It is particularly the anxiety of my party and all Members of my party.  That view has been clearly put on the record by the Leader of the party, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, by putting before the House some reservations I have about this Bill in its current state, it should not be taken that I am any less energetic in the pursuit of truth.  However, I do not believe that in the pursuit of truth we have the right to walk over constitutional realities that we must face. Senator O'Toole made the correct observation that this is probably the least ringing endorsement of a Bill he had ever heard.  He had not heard what I have to say, and my contribution will be positively leaden.</P>
      <P>The purposes of the Bill as introduced was to provide privilege and immunity to witnesses who may be called to give evidence to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  I agree, incidentally, with the comments about the size of this committee.  It is entirely wrong to expect any standards of evidence or inquiry to be applied by a committee of 31 members.  It is even more questionable if, after today's events in the Dáil, the Bill will achieve the purpose for which it was originally intended.  It is my view that there is a very real prospect that it will be found to be unconstitutional; I believe it is seriously constitutionally infirm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, appeared before the committee on 7 December he declined to give evidence unless he received certain assurances.  One of these was the granting to him of absolute privilege in respect of his evidence to the committee.  I would argue that one of the great services the Attorney General has done this House and the <Col N="1114" /> nation was to clarify in a very succinct way on that occasion the very core issues involved here.  We would be at our peril to ignore what he had to say.</P>
    <P>His evidence brought into sharp focus what has long been established as a deficiency in the powers and procedures of committees, as indicated in the Dáil and here tonight by the Minister for State whose draft Bill, entitled the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas Privileges Immunity and the Compellability of Witnesses Bill, 1994, has been in the course of preparation for some time.  I, as a person interested in the committees and proceedings of the Oireachtas, would argue that it has been in preparation for far too long. However, it is much wider in scope than the present Bill and is designed to meet the expanding role of all Dáil committees. As the title indicates, it dealt with the privileges, immunity and, most importantly, the compellability of witnesses. I have some experience in this matter.  I was chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies when several Ministers refused to co-operate with it. These are issues which have been debated and examined time and time again over the last 25 years.  They are not matters which can be easily shrugged aside or resolved by quick fix legislation.</P>
    <P>We have the unusual circumstance of a Bill such as this being introduced by a caretaker Administration.  It is intended &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; to limit the effect of the Bill to the hearings of the Dáil Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  All parties would accept that this is a prudent course of action.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that a person giving evidence before the committee is entitled to the same privileges and immunities as he or she would enjoy were he or she a witness before the High Court.  This means that a witness will have absolute privilege for oral and written statements made in the course of the proceedings of the committee, provided such evidence is relevant to the proceedings.  Anybody who knows <Col N="1115" /> anything about court proceedings knows that relevance in that sense is very wide.  He or she could not be sued for libel or slander for words written or spoken even if malicious or without justification or excuse or if they were uttered from ill will, anger or with a wish to defame a particular person. There were seven specific advantages and a number of specific disadvantages in the Bill as it was originally introduced by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was introduced by the Government and not by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis will get his turn and he can then excuse the actions of his party.</P>
      <P>The first advantage in the Bill as introduced by my party is that it facilitates the holding of a full inquiry by the committee established for that purpose. We are all anxious that this should take place.  Second, the inquiry would be held in open session and the proceedings would be televised.  This would be a transparent way of dealing with the problems which have arisen and the allegations of conspiracy and cover up, which certainly need to be examined fully and thoroughly and without any equivocation.  Third, the committee is already in being and this would avoid any delay in getting the procedures under way.  Fourth, in the particular circumstances, the only real alternative would be a tribunal of inquiry which could have all the disadvantages of the beef tribunal.  None of us would wish for a repetition of that.  Such a procedure would be lengthy and costly and, as in the beef tribunal, it could gain a momentum of its own, drag on and cost a fortune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifth, the rights of individual witnesses were fully underlined and protected. This is a particularly important and core issue.  These rights include the privilege of witnesses, provision for legal representation, rights of cross-examination and rights to be furnished <Col N="1116" /> with statements of evidence.  Having referred to legal representation.  I agree with Senator Enright that any Member of this House, or the other House, should be willing to appear before a Oireachtas committee.  However, this committee could be inviting not only serving civil servants but people who are not in the service of the State at present. This goes wider; that is the issue that is important relating to witnesses.</P>
    <P>The sixth advantage was that witnesses would not be put to any unnecessary expense, as there was originally a provision relating to costs, and the seventh advantage was that, under section 1, the Bill was limited &mdash; a prudent provision which we all accept.</P>
    <P>Amendments introduced in the Dáil today by the Progressive Democrats have removed key elements of these protections and, to my mind, these changes put the constitutionality of the Bill in question.  I am sure that was not the intention but I think that is the effect.</P>
    <P>There were some disadvantages in the original Bill, and we need to put them before the House and consider them.  In the first instance, there was no provision for compellability of witnesses.  The Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies produced a Special Report on Terms of References and Resources &mdash; reference Pl. 8454, of which Senator Neville will be aware. That report instanced over a ten year period at least 16 cases where compellability became a real issue, ranging from the time when the Minister of the day, Deputy Mitchell, refused to appear before the committee and discuss the sinking of Irish Shipping&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn also refused to appear before the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and public servants refused to attend and discuss this issue, up to the inquiry the committee sought to initiate into the affairs of the Sugar Company.  It will be recalled that in the investigation of the Sugar Company, the <Col N="1117" /> committee was perversely turned away from the main activity of examining what was happening in that company at some cost to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>In my view compellability is not a small issue, and even in the original Bill the failure to deal with this issue was a problem.  Witnesses could refuse to be cross-examined or to attend, or to remain in attendance as they thought fit. Members will recall another report by the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  A witness, a barrister, appeared before the committee, seriously defamed a number of other people, withdrew from the committee and refused to return to answer other questions.  I think Senator O'Toole had just joined the committee at that time; but perhaps it was before his time.</P>
      <P>The big problem about compellability is that witnesses can attend this committee, make any allegation they wish, and walk away and they cannot be compelled to come back and lay themselves open to cross-examination.  There is no sanction with regard to lay witnesses, that is, non-political or non-Civil Service witnesses.  Thus, if such witnesses behave, misbehave or make outrageous assertions, they are not amenable to the courts or to the Dáil.  Ironically, while Members of the Dáil or the Seanad could be sanctioned by suspension or otherwise, and are thus answerable to the House, the lay witnesses are not amenable to any such threat or to any sanction whatsoever under the Bill, either as it is amended or as it was originally introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the original provisions of the Bill, such a lay witness could make any defamatory remark he or she wished, provided it was relevant &mdash; in a High Court case relevance is a very wide concept &mdash; to the proceedings about anybody, be they civil servant, politician or an ordinary member of the public; he or she can choose to do this for whatever motive.  Such a witness could not be sued for defamation and there is no procedure to bring such a witness to book <Col N="1118" /> before the Dáil or even back to answer valid questions before the committee.</P>
    <P>Another major weakness arises under the terms of Article 40.3.2º of the Constitution which guarantees the protection of a citizen's rights to a good name. It is difficult to see how this Bill, even in its original form, could not conflict with this constitutional provision.  Even if this is just a hypothetical example of what could happen, the reality is that it does infringe that aspect of the Constitution. Section 3(1) of the original Bill provides a procedure whereby a witness shall be obliged to give evidence before the committee and if he or she fails to do so, will be guilty of an offence.  That is missing from this Bill, and it is doubly missing as a result of the manner in which it has now been amended.</P>
    <P>The argument was made in the other House that the Bill is unwieldy, and certain aspects of it are unwieldy.  Section 3 (1) (c) of the original proposals, which required that a witness before the committee shall be furnished &ldquo;with a statement of the evidence given or then proposed to be given&rdquo;, seems to suggest that, as in the beef tribunal, it would be necessary to have at least a book of allegations, if not a book of evidence, available to a witness before they would be required to give evidence.  This is a bureaucratic procedure and it would constitute a disadvantage even in the original proposition, let alone in the amended proposition.  In those circumstances, if such a witness were to avail of this right, it would require the committee to have a secretarial back-up and to conduct initial inquiries before it embarked on the hearings.  It would be unwieldy, but probably necessary, if the individual's constitutional rights were to be protected.  Even in the unaltered Bill there were serious deficiencies which, in my view, could bring the Bill constitutionally into question.</P>
    <P>There is more than an element of rushing to a conclusion as regards all the matters before this House and this committee. The use of a select parliamentary committee of inquiry to investigate events giving rise to public disquiet or <Col N="1119" /> alleged misconduct of Ministers or public servants is not new, nor, indeed, is the judgment that these procedures are inadequate.  It was because of the inadequacies of such procedures that in 1921 the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act was passed.  The history of select committees of inquiry is very unfortunate. Lord Justice Salmon in the Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry Report, 1966, stated:</P>
    <P>The record of such Committees appointed to investigate allegations of public misconduct is to say the least unfortunate .... the Marconi Scandal for this purpose sounded the death knell of this form of investigation and because it was wholly discredited, the Act of 1921 was passed.  To go back to it would, in our view, be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>We are now going back to that procedure, although we have stronger constitutional protections and we know in our heart of hearts that this infringes those constitutional protections.  The report also states:</P>
    <P>We, of course, recognise that there are many purposes for which Select Parliamentary Committees are most useful and, indeed, indispensable, but the investigation of allegations of public misconduct is not one of them. Such matters should be entirely removed from political influences.  A Select Parliamentary Committee is constituted of members representing the relative strength of the parties in the House.  Accordingly, it may tend in its report to reflect the views of the party having the majority of the members or, indeed, as in the Marconi case, it may produce two reports.</P>
    <P>The reality is that any political committee is made up of politicians and will reflect their political views.  Under Article 26.1.1 of the Constitution, the &ldquo;President may, after consultation with the Council of State, refer any Bill to which this Article applies to the Supreme Court&rdquo; to test if its provisions <Col N="1120" /> are repugnant to the Constitution. Under Article 40.3.2 and also arising from the decisions in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> Hamilton (No. 2) case, there are profound reasons consideration should be given to referring this Bill to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Leader of Fianna Fáil put down a series of markers on this matter in the Dáil last week.  He made that point that fundamental rights cannot be set aside for short term political advantage.  The markers and valid concerns expressed in the House by Fianna Fáil speakers on this matter last week were dismissed as filibustering.  The term was publicly used by a party which is relatively new to constitutional politics.  However, within 24 hours of these allegations of filibustering being made, the Attorney General, as I mentioned, illustrated before the committee just how valid were our concerns.  The present Bill presented by the Fianna Fáil caretaker Administration was the best effort at addressing the complex factors involved.  The Opposition parties have combined to remove key sections of the Bill.  The draft legislation before us is, in my view, fundamentally undermined by the actions of those parties.  I hope I am wrong about this, but I must express my honest views on the matter.</P>
    <P>The question of natural justice has been frequently referred to in this debate.  There are a number of principles involved in that concept.  One of those is that a person is entitled to be tried before judges who have an open mind on the issue in question.  I question whether, with the best will in the world, a committee made up of political opponents can or will be seen as approaching the matters involved with an open mind.</P>
    <P>The high standards demanded in our Constitution cannot be guaranteed by this committee.  Amendments made in the Dáil today even more seriously undermine the Bill before us.  I would be more than surprised if the legislation does not end up in the Supreme Court. If that happens the blame must rest squarely with the Opposition parties <Col N="1121" /> who rammed through the measures which they in their hearts know are questionable.</P>

I would be prepared to wager the President will refer it to the Supreme Court and that it will not get past the Supreme Court.  It reminds me of the night we passed the rod licence Bill some years back; everyone knew that there were serious questions about it.</P>
      <P>If a trade union were to put forward the protections in this legislation for an internal or domestic tribunal it would not get past the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I made the same case to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House two years ago when the Cathaoirleach of the time was in difficulty about some issue.  I said the rules of natural justice were not being complied with, and that applies in this case too.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this Bill will stand up to scrutiny.  The previous speaker referred to Article 26.1.1º of the Constitution and the President's right to refer legislation to the Supreme Court. Article 26.2.1º tells us how that constitutionality is tested.  It is tested by the case for the Government being put to the Supreme Court by or on behalf of the Attorney General.  There is a clear conflict of interests here immediately, even before we begin to test the legislation. Imagine the Attorney General or somebody on his or her behalf putting the case for this legislation to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I participated in one circus last week and I am certainly not going to participate in another without being paid for it.  This is not the way to move forward.</P>
      <P>I do not understand this legislation. I have read it a number of times over the last couple of hours.  I have not been privy to the discussion in the other House today.  I do not know of anything that has taken place there.  In the last 20 minutes I got a copy of the original legislation and I agree that some elements should be included in this Bill. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to be there when somebody who is asked to take all reasonable steps to protect and vindicate the good name and other constitutional rights of witnesses has to take the following steps: when one of those people says that he or she wishes to bring counsel into this investigation, the person who is charged to protect his or her good name and other constitutional rights will have to refuse that witness legal representation <Col N="1123" /> in the committee.  It is a joke.  This legislation is going all over the place.</P>
    <P>The first section, mentions the order of Dáil Éireann which specifies the functions of the committee, and the text of that order is set out in the Schedule. Elements of the Schedule are unprecedented; there are three paragraphs in the Schedule, each with subsections, but only paragraph (3) has any relevance to the Bill.  Why is there a Schedule that has nothing to do with the working of the Bill?  Reading paragraph (3) it is hard to find out what the functions might be because they are not specified. It states: &ldquo;...for the purpose of questioning all persons the Committee deems appropriate ... and shall report to Dáil Éireann ...&rdquo;.  I am extrapolating from that that the functions of this committee are to question and to report.  As regards questioning, we have now established that if people do not want to be questioned they do not have to turn up.  Half of that function &mdash; if it is a function &mdash; has been eliminated or diluted.  The second half means that the committee shall report to Dáil Éireann without a conclusion or judgment or without apportioning blame.</P>
    <P>It was bad enough for the people to hear the beef tribunal report but this non-conclusive foray means we are mixing the work of the Legislature with that of the courts, which our Constitution goes to great lengths to keep separate. That is unacceptable.  The fact that the Attorney General will be asked to put the case on behalf of the Government to the Supreme Courts in support of this legislation when we know he favoured the first Bill means there is a conflict of interests.  He is being asked to tell the Supreme Court on behalf of the Government that this is the correct legislation although everyone knows he wrote the other Bill.  We are not going anywhere with this.</P>
    <P>I do not know who the witnesses are, although this was probably explained in the debate in other House.  There is no mention of witnesses in the functions; it <Col N="1124" /> states: &ldquo;questioning all persons the Committee deems appropriate&rdquo;.  I take it that these people will be witnesses. This means that everyone who comes before the hearing is a witness.  The procedure in this Bill is compared with a High Court proceeding.  It grants the same privileges and immunities as if a person was a witness before the High Court.  These are two different things.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the principles of natural justice are complied with in section 3 and I am prepared to place a wager on that.  From experience at different levels, I know the ability, the right and, perhaps, the responsibility to take advantage of the questioning and cross-examination of witnesses cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>As regards access to evidence, a person may say that evidence interferes with their good name or personal rights from a constitutional point of view, and that that they want access to the evidence and to the cross-examination of the witnesses.  According to this legislation, the Chairman, in other words the committee, is given the responsibility to take all steps which, in the opinion of the committee, are necessary to protect and vindicate the person's good name, although that person may say the best way to do that is to have legal representation, access to evidence and cross-examination of witnesses.  The committee now says one cannot do that.  It is ridiculous.  A first year law student would not allow this Bill to pass First Stage.</P>

      <P>I am not participating in a political ball game &mdash; I am speaking as a Member of the Legislature and I would say this no matter where this Bill <Col N="1125" /> originated.  I read and make judgments on legislation as I find it.  What I say is based on experience reading or being the subject of legislation.  I paid for an inquiry in Donegal today where these rules would not have been agreed to.</P>
      <P>The rules of natural justice provide for the cross-examination of witnesses, access to evidence, etc.  It is a cop out to say that the committee shall take all the steps which in its opinion are necessary to protect, vindicate the good name and character and other constitutional rights, of witnesses.  Who will do that? That also goes against the Constitution which says very clearly in Article 40.3: &ldquo;The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen&rdquo; and &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person ...&rdquo;.  It does not propose to ask the chairperson of a committee with no track record in that area to do it.</P>
      <P>How can somebody without a background in constitutional law be asked by the Legislature to protect constitutional rights?  It is a disgrace and I cannot see how we can live with it.  We will regret this.  I will probably be in a minority of one on this, but I cannot see how this legislation can be passed without serious questioning.</P>
      <P>A camel is supposed to have been designed by a committee.  We saw what a committee did last Wednesday in the Lower House and it happened again today.  I do not exclude any party from blame because this Bill came through the House, as far as I know, without a vote to the discredit of that House.</P>

      <P>We have created something which does not have the power to do its business because it cannot compel witnesses and will produce an inconclusive report which will not apportion blame or indicate the rights and wrongs. This legislation will pose an inexplicable conundrum for the Attorney General whereby he will defend something with which he does not agree in the context of an issue with which he is involved. We have disregarded the rules of natural justice.  We have given the guardianship of the constitutional rights of citizens to a person with no experience or, perhaps, understanding of the law.  We have done a disservice in that regard.</P>
      <P>A person cannot be compelled to appear as a witness before any judicial, quasi-judicial or legislative forum and then be told that his expenses cannot be paid.

      <P>The Labour Party welcomes this Bill to enable the committee to undertake the task entrusted to it by the Dáil.  We recognise that it is an interim measure designed to facilitate the work of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security but does not deal with the broader issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members must agree on the need to renew the democratic relationship between the people and those they elect, and those who work on their behalf.  An investigation needs to be carried out on the people's behalf.  If questions <Col N="1127" /> need to be asked, it is only proper that they are asked by the representatives of the people.  The aim is to get at the truth and nothing else.  This committee has been empowered to ask the questions which the public needs answered.</P>
    <P>These questions are well known but they should be highlighted.  The first and most important is why there was a seven month delay in processing the Brendan Smyth file.  How responsible was the former Attorney General for the operation of his office?  How accountable was he to the Taoiseach, the Cabinet and the Dáil?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his Fianna Fáil Ministers must ask why they persisted, in the teeth of such opposition, to appoint Mr. Whelehan to one of the highest offices in the land, why they persisted even further when he turned down their suggestion to reconsider his position and publicly backed his suitability for this position.  The people are entitled to answers to those and any other questions which their representatives choose to ask on their behalf.</P>
    <P>There is far too much secrecy in the administration of this country.  If a civil servant does not like certain questions, he or she can hide behind the facade of the Official Secrets Act.  While balance is always required and there are times when secrecy is in the nation's best interest, the simplest questions are often evaded on the basis of an outmoded Official Secrets Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In a court of law the Minister would be regarded as a hostile witness and, therefore, anything he says can be treated as such.</P>
      <P>The role of the committee will be vital.  I agree with Senator Enright that a committee of 30 members would be unwieldy.  I am glad that the committee will have the power to select a subcommittee with the same rights and privileges as the main committee.  However, it may still be unfair to witnesses.  While a subcommittee of ten or 12 people would be a small subcommittee of the Dáil, ten to 12 people firing random questions at a witness would flabbergast even the most professional witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee must realise its vital role.  Every attempt must be made to handle witnesses subtly.  The same questions <Col N="1130" /> should not be asked again and again in different forms.  One question should lead to another and from that the truth shall come, otherwise it could be seen as fundamentally unfair to witnesses.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, each Member has a responsibility to be fair and non partisan.  The committee should take a lesson from the good behaviour of Members in this House.  It has been the experience that when Bills are discussed here, particularly on Committee Stage, there is a cross-fertilisation of ideas.  Different parties support common sense ideas and where a provision is not seen to constitute common sense, there is often cross-party agreement, even in the teeth of ministerial objection. Perhaps, therefore, the manner in which we operated in this House up to now should be taken as a model.</P>
    <P>Witnesses also have a role to play. Those listed to appear are all honourable people who hold and have held responsible positions.  Nobody need fear the truth.  This Bill ensures the privilege afforded to witnesses before the High Court.  We must remember that there is a life outside these Houses and beyond this issue.  Any witness will have to live with his or her own conscience.  Everybody must realise that there is a judge over and above these Houses and this nation to whom at the end of the day, a person is answerable.  That point cannot be stressed highly enough.  The truth cannot hurt anybody and therefore, there is no reason a witness should fail to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</P>
    <P>The chairman's position is not a job for which I will be likely to apply.  It is a most unenviable job but a vital role. When the broader legislation is eventually enacted, great care should be taken to fully equip the chairman, legally and administratively, to adjudicate on issues. I agree with Senator O'Toole that the Bill places an enormous onus on the chairman of the committee who has to &ldquo;take all steps which in the opinion of the committee are necessary to protect and vindicate the good name, character <Col N="1131" /> and other constitutional rights of witnesses and other persons.&rdquo;  Full legal and administrative back-up is required to enable the chairperson to do that effectively and to prevent the committee straying from the subject matter and infringing on personal rights.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not perfect &mdash; there is no doubt about that.  However, it serves a particular purpose.  It is not designed to deal with the broader issue of the public's right to be given answers.  More detailed legislation and more time is required for that.  This Bill deals with a particular set of circumstances.  If everybody co-operates &mdash; the committee members, witnesses and the chairman &mdash; the imperfections in this Bill will be minimised and the purpose for which it has been introduced will come to the fore.  That purpose is getting at the truth and hearing answers to the questions I have asked.  When the truth is revealed the public will see that they are living in a democracy and that we are answerable to them.  We are, after all, their servants. The public is our boss.</P>

      <P>This legislation is necessary because we are faced with the biggest political crisis this country has experienced in many decades.  Swift action is necessary to ensure that the full truth is exposed.  We are the representatives of the people.  The people want to know what happened.  They <Col N="1133" /> want to know the full truth.  They want the facts regarding all the issues laid before them.  We, the representatives of the people, have a duty to do that. Hence, this legislation is necessary.</P>
      <P>We are setting guidelines for a new and more open approach to the committee system.  This Bill is a prototype for a Bill which will give teeth and more openness to Oireachtas committees. That must be welcomed.</P>

      <P>The Committee's work is straightforward.  It must, on behalf of the people, expose the full facts.  The events of the past weeks have highlighted the secretive nature of our public administration system.  The State is permeated by a culture of secrecy which promotes the idea that people should not know and that Members of the Dáil when questioned by public representatives should give minimal answers rather than straightforward, truthful answers.</P>

      <P>The full facts should be given when questions are asked in the Dáil.  It is unfortunate that answers are prepared in a way which tries to avoid giving the full facts.  As stated, one of the outcomes of this was the costly expense of the beef tribunal.  Most people accept that if full answers had been given to Dáil questions, the tribunal would not have been necessary. While the Bill attempts to address the issues in hand, it is important that substantive legislation is introduced to ensure that there will be proper <Col N="1136" /> reporting to all Oireachtas committees. This Bill is a forerunner.</P>

      <P>I will cope with the interruptions.  Senator Kelly mentioned getting to the truth and receiving an explanation for the seven month delay. I read the Bill several times, and the terms of reference of the committee, and could find no reference to the need to find the reason for the seven month delay in handling the extradition warrant in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong. The Schedule is the Order of Business of the day the Dáil decided to examine certain matters, including the events of 11, 13 and 14 November, which led to the appointment of the President of the High Court and the request on Sunday, 13 November from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General to re-examine the details.</P>

      <P>It is not, as far as I am concerned.  All Members of the Oireachtas, not least Fianna Fáil Members, said they wanted the truth to be known.  I understand the original Bill would have attempted to ensure that this happened and bring some type of balance into the proceedings of the committee.  That Bill was drafted in consultation with the Attorney General, a man who is in good standing with all Members and there is no reason to question his input.  However, the Bill, as amended today &mdash; Senator Dardis is not interested, he has left &mdash; with the portions taken out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We look forward to working with the Senator.  Nothing stopped the Senator's party colluding to produce this Bill.  As Senators O'Toole and Roche said, the Bill will not be signed by the President.  I will be very surprised if she signs it.  Why has it ended up like this?  Are those who claimed to seek openness, accountability, transparency and the truth, now slightly afraid of that truth?  Are certain people, who were a little less than their usual confident selves in recent days, perhaps saying that they do not want to answer questions?  It is not just Members on the Fianna Fáil side of the House who will be asked to answer questions.  As has been stated, public servants have rights and entitlements and the original Bill at least gave them some protection.  Some Members of the <Col N="1139" /> Dáil who will probably hold Cabinet posts in the next few days are, perhaps not comfortable about being asked questions.  Perhaps that is why we ended up with this rubbish tonight.</P>
      <P>I will be surprised if the President does not refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.  Once the deals are done and the mercs and perks have been divided out, everything to do with this committee will be swiftly forgotten.  There will be some reason advanced for this inquiry not being held and this side of the House will not allow that to happen.</P>

My view may be due to the fact that I have been so short a time a Member but I am particularly surprised at those Members, who are involved in anything to do with children, making such a joke of the proceedings this evening.  I am quite astounded by it. I see some Members who, on previous occasions, professed their great care for children hysterical with laughter about an issue which is one of the most serious problems with which this State must deal.</P>
      <P>There is a joke I am not getting but behind this delay of seven months is a case of a man who was charged with the most serious offences in another part of the island and was not extradited.  I have very little interest in whether this committee sits but I have a great deal of interest in why we are here tonight.  I do not know why a Minister is in the House bringing in a Bill if the Government is not introducing it.  I can only presume, on a division, that the Members on the Government side will vote against it.  I hate to spoil the fun but whether this committee sits is of very little interest to me.</P>

I have no intention of even thinking that any of them is trying to mislead us.  With any conversation, particularly when it has taken place at length, everyone's recollections will be different.  It is particularly sad to see Ministers who served ably in Government contradicting themselves on matters on which they feel they were absolutely right.</P>
      <P>I am not a constitutional lawyer so I will rely on the President to decide whether she should refer the Bill to the Supreme Court and on the Supreme Court as to what it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Senators have rightly said how difficult it would be for a large committee to question people and how easily it could turn into an inquisition.  This committee <Col N="1142" /> should sit soon and should decide to sit for only a short time &mdash; perhaps from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. for one week. Only a few people need to be called as witnesses and the compellability cannot be a great problem when they are Ministers who have served ably in Government, two Attorneys General &mdash; who feel they acted correctly in the circumstances &mdash; and a senior civil servant who felt he did the right thing.  The committee should not have to sit at length.</P>
    <P>While I understand the difficulties about the lack of legal advice available to witnesses I find it hard to believe that any of these able people would not do more than tell the facts as they saw them.  The committee is not a court of law: it is trying to establish the truth.  If there are eight witnesses to an accident who are asked for their recollections a month later one will get a different answer from each of them.  The committee is not an inquisition at which various people will be described as liars and others as having told the truth.  They will all be telling the truth to the best of their abilities.</P>

      <P>I did not think that I would see enacted in the Legislature in the course of our consideration of these issues in the Oireachtas all the elements of Greek tragicomedy &mdash; comedy that becomes tragedy and tragedy that becomes farce.  I do not mind what we propose to do with ourselves, here or in the Dáil, but I care when Bunreacht na hÉireann &mdash; the bible text given to us by the people &mdash; is brought into disrepute in our considerations &mdash; if that is not too kind a word for the attitude which has been adopted.  I am not only referring to the jokes but the way we approach this serious issue.  It all started with what was clearly a breach of Article 28 of the Constitution and we should remember that none of us has a right to do anything other than respect and act in accordance with the Constitution that gives us the right to be here as legislators and the Government the right to govern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> Article 28.4.2º says: &ldquo;The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State ...&rdquo; The first breach of that fundamental principle was when the Labour Party, while still claiming to be part of a collective authority, removed itself from the collective responsibility and still claimed to be part of the collective authority.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that those who remained and purported to act in collective authority as representatives of the Departments of State administered by the Government when half the Government was absent acted against the principles and the spirit of the Constitution when it says that the Government shall meet and act as a collective authority.</P>
    <P>From that sorry failure to recognise the obligations of the Constitution we have continued with this farce throughout the legislation proposed here.  I sympathise with the Minister of State but for the first time we have a Minister in the House not commending the legislation before us, and, having regard to the nature of the legislation, I do not expect that he could or should do so.</P>
    <P>We should have some respect for the Seanad.  We are here at this late hour to consider a Bill which, as it happens, the Minister is not commending to us, and we are proposing to give consideration &mdash; as we are obliged to do by the Constitution &mdash; to this legislation.  With regard to the Seanad and legislation, the Constitution says that every Bill initiated in and passed by Dáil Éireann shall be sent to Seanad Éireann and shall be considered in Seanad Éireann, and, unless the time for the consideration of which is abridged under a formal procedure to abridge the time for Seanad Éireann, Seanad Éireann shall consider that Bill and shall send it back amended, to Dáil Éireann.  Are we seriously pretending that we are considering legislation as required of us by the Constitution?  Are we seriously saying that the time for the consideration of this Bill is adequate at this late hour?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> Are we to pretend to the people who, incidentally, do not have much confidence in the Houses of the Oireachtas at present, that what we are engaged in &mdash; I do not just mean the jokes but the manner in which we approach this &mdash; is a serious discharge of our obligations under Article 23 of the Constitution in so far as the time for the consideration of this Bill has not been abridged under Article 24 of the Constitution?  We are free to consider this and send it back and spend 120 days considering it.  Is that our serious intention?  Of course, it is not.  In this we are making a farce of a House of the Oireachtas.  Everyone knows that is not our intention this evening.</P>
    <P>This all happened because of this nonsense of the Houses of the Oireachtas trying to confer powers on individuals.  People in the Lower House in reaction to the recent chaos foolishly thought this was the way to solve the problem.  They ignored the basic fact that the privilege conferred on the Oireachtas is given by the Constitution. Under Article 15.12 Members of the Oireachtas are given absolute privilege as regards anything they say there. Where in the Constitution is it written that we are entitled to confer that privilege on committees, witnesses or anyone else appearing before such committees? The relevant provision states:</P>
    <P>All official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof and utterances made in either House wherever published shall be privileged.</P>
    <P>The people conferred that authority on us.  Who gave us the right to confer it on others?  If we propose to give that privilege to committees or witnesses before such committees, the only way to do so is to ask the people if they wish to include the type of privileges this nonsense legislation purports to confer on witnesses and documents.  It is now proposed to make a nonsense of Bunreacht na hÉireann in this Bill and we also say we will give witnesses the privileges witnesses have in court.  Those who suggest <Col N="1145" /> that should be aware of standard procedures in court.  Senator Enright at some stage in his legal career must have heard a judge say he was sending the papers before him either in a criminal or civil case for adjudication to the Director of Public Prosecutions, so that arising from the evidence given in court the Director of Public Prosecutions could consider whether to bring criminal proceedings.  Those who suggest we give witnesses before committees the privilege they would have in court seem to think it confers an absolute privilege of the type we enjoy because it has been conferred by the people.</P>
    <P>The nonsense proposed in the Lower House is a reaction to one of our saddest experiences in recent times, but whatever else is proposed I will not participate in riding roughshod over our Constitution.  If we want to get to the end of this we should ask that it be amended.</P>
    <P>Members spoke about the circumstances surrounding the appointment of the President of the High Court and a little consistency would be no harm.  I put certain matters on the record in the course of the debate on the report of the beef tribunal.  At that time people who were in Government until recently demanded certain things in Dáil Éireann.  In that debate as recorded at Col. 131, Volume 141 of the Official Report of 1 September, I said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring specifically and uniquely requested that the tribunal have power to summon witnesses and procure documents.  He was the only one who did.</P>
    <P>Yet, when the tribunal began, who claimed privilege against either producing witnesses or documents?  There is inconsistency of the highest order.  Are we now to hear the same nonsense from Deputy Spring, who demanded this power for the tribunal and then claimed the privilege he now wants to see extended?  What kind of honesty and consistency is that?</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly thinks it is now time to renew the democratic relationship <Col N="1146" /> between the people and those they elect to represent them.  I agree enthusiastically. The only way to renew that democratic relationship is to end this farce, go back to the people and let them pass judgment on us in a general election. Let us be honest in what we say and how we act.</P>

      <P>I find it curious that more often than not I agree with Senator O'Kennedy and I agree with much of what he said this evening.  All who come into these Houses are charged with a solemn responsibility and I do not suggest for a moment that the Minister with us this evening does not share my views in this respect.  We are charged with representing the people, implementing the law and amending it if required.  What we saw today was an exercise in what Parliament should be about; it debated and made its own decision.</P>
      <P>I hope I treat this House, the Minister and the Government with the respect they deserve and that everyone in the House treats it with the same respect.  I do not presume to have any moral superiority or to speak from a moral high ground.</P>
      <P>Tonight we have taken a message from the Dáil, which desires us to agree with what it did this afternoon in deciding on the legislation.  This evening, we will make our decision on the legislation, on its desirability and its constitutionality. We can express our view on the constitutionality of the legislation but ultimately that decision is not ours; it lies with the President and the courts.</P>
      <P>People have been quoting the Constitution freely.  Article 28.8 of the Constitution states that every member of the Government shall have the right to attend and be heard in each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It may happen that the member of Fianna Fáil is a member of the Government but when the Minister enters this House he does so as a representative of the Government.</P>

      <P>He expresses exasperation at introducing a rapidly produced measure on the same subject to cope with a transient problem.  While the measure may be rapidly produced the problem is not transient, nor could it be regarded as such by any definition.  On the Order of Business I said that this was an unsatisfactory way in which to conduct the business of the House and to introduce legislation.  I stand by that remark.  Everything that has happened this evening has demonstrated the validity of that claim.  Is the committee to meet tomorrow at 10 o'clock?  If not, then why could this legislation not have been considered overnight and in the morning, and been given the balanced and considered attention which this House gives to all legislation that comes before it?</P>
      <P>I find it disquieting that the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is normal for a Minister bringing a Bill before this House to commend it to the House.  That is a formula which I will not be using tonight.</P>
      <P>This is the first time in my experience &mdash; and, I suspect, in the experience of people who have been Members of the House far longer than I &mdash; that we have heard something of that nature.  I do not expect the Minister to renege on his Fianna Fáil credentials but I do expect that when a Minister comes to the House he should behave as a Minister of Government.  The Minister's party is still in Government.  The country has a Government which we respect and the Minister should show the Government the same respect.</P>

      <P>We are a sovereign House of Parliament and this House will decide whether legislation is good, bad or indifferent.  In recent weeks I have heard many people on that side of the House express the need to get at the truth.  I have heard Government Ministers <Col N="1149" /> in the media talking about the need to get at the truth.  That is a view we all share but there is a subtle difference in that people who were party to these momentous decisions &mdash; which brought us to the point we are at &mdash; know the truth, while the rest of us suspect what we believe to be the truth.  It is only through this Committee and the procedures which have been introduced by the legislation before us that we are likely to arrive at the truth.  It is fortunate that, when the Select Committee on Legislation and Security met on 7 November 1994, Deputy O'Malley pointed out that it was not in the gift of the Government to confer privilege, but in the gift of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>We seem to have strayed far away from the legislation before us but in my view the legislation was improved this afternoon by decision of the Dáil and that is what democracy is about.  There seems to be a presumption that because Government decrees something it becomes law.  We now have the converse of that proposition; that because the Government does not happen to agree with something, it should not become law.  However, it is the Houses of the Oireachtas, not the Government, which make the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the reservations that have been expressed about the predicament in which the chairperson of the committee might be placed by having to make what may be described as quasi-judicial decisions.  I can understand that difficulty. However, the rights of citizens which are enshrined in the Constitution should not be used as a mask by Members of this House, or even more definitively by members of the Government, to evade answering questions which the committee is entitled to ask. The committee has been given the power through legislation, of its own right, to decide the number of people who will be on the sub-committee which will pose those questions.  That is as it should be.  There remains the question of substitutes and how they should be dealt with.  My own view is that where it is difficult for people &mdash; for whatever <Col N="1150" /> personal or other circumstances &mdash; to attend meetings, it should be possible to have substitutes.</P>
    <P>As to the constitutionality of this legislation, we can have all the views we like but the President and the courts will decide whether the legislation which passes through this House is constitutional.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few comments in relation to some of the remarks made this evening.  I do it with some regret.  The idea that anybody in this House of any party &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Democratic Left, the Progressive Democrats or Independents &mdash; would have any truck whatsoever with the idea of protecting a paedophile priest is repulsive.  There can be no suggestion that anybody in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would have any sympathy for or understanding of that position.  Nonetheless, we still want to know why this file was in the Attorney General's Office for seven months.  That is a legitimate inquiry.</P>
      <P>The beef tribunal focused on one particular demand, that never again should we have the spectacle of lawyers getting rich on the backs of ordinary people while they debated how many angels could exist on the head of a pin.  I was in the Dáil today and listened to what was essentially a debate between lawyers, in which nobody else was involved.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, Deputy Michael McDowell, who is a barrister and Deputies O'Donoghue and Taylor, who are solicitors &mdash; I do not know if I have left anybody out &mdash; have one thing in common, they all have law degrees.  All I saw was heads going from one side to the other, as one might see at Wimbledon. The poor lay legislators were trying <Col N="1151" /> to make sense of what was going on. Without such expertise we do not have a hope of legislating in such a complex area as this.  I have no great objection to the Supreme Court or the President earning their money in trying to decipher what we intend.  We know what we intend, we want to establish the truth as expeditiously as possible, using the least amount of public money.</P>
      <P>To refer to the point made by Senator Dardis, in one sense the Minister is sent here with a Bill which is not his creation so we cannot expect him to have faith in it.  His obligation is to bring it to us and he has said frankly that he is bringing it to us as a message from the Dáil but it is not the message he would like to bring.  That is fair enough and I do not see any difficulty with it. it.</P>

      <P>The House can only do its best.  I disagree fundamentally with Senator O'Kennedy.  I am sorry he has left the House because there are other things I want to say to him.  We spoke about rushed legislation last year.  It was discovered by someone who was kind enough to do some research that the Bills which were debated for longest were the ones which were more often struck down by the Supreme Court.  In other words, the length of time spent on the debate had little to do with constitutionality or otherwise of a Bill whereas lack of understanding might have a great deal to do with it.  We are subject to the same disadvantages this evening.  I have served honourably in this House for the past two years with Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>

      <P>I have no intention, when Fianna Fáil moves to the other side of the House, of attacking it on items with which I agreed in the previous two years.  I resent deeply the <Col N="1152" /> cheap attack made by Senator O'Kennedy on Deputy Dick Spring, who has been in this House more often than any previous Tánaiste.  If Senator O'Kennedy has such views about Deputy Spring, he should have had the guts to express them at the time.  One will not find me following such despicable practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are witnessing a certain amount of confusion and possibly frustration because we have a Government in office but not necessarily in power.  Senator O'Kennedy made strong arguments about the constitutional provisions relating to the Oireachtas and the absolute privilege vested by the Constitution in the Members of the Oireachtas.  His argument that this Bill is not acceptable equally applies to the original Bill drafted and presented by the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>We should consider why this Bill is before us this evening.  It was introduced because the Attorney General, when he addressed the Dáil Select Committee on Legislation and Security last week, said that he could not proceed to be examined and questioned by the committee until he was provided with privilege. The result was that this matter was examined and this legislation was drafted and presented.</P>
      <P>There is a certain urgency in addressing the matter quickly and having the questions which arise answered and resolved.  We should not need a special Bill to enable a committee, whether it is a select or a joint Oireachtas one, to establish the truth.  If people were prepared to account for their stewardship in the portfolios they held and to tell the truth, we would not need this mire of legislation and would not have the confusion experienced by the people of Ireland in the past weeks.  Why are we not being told the truth by the Ministers concerned?  A number of caretaker Ministers have little or no credibility left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier today it seemed the Government was willing to allow the Attorney <Col N="1153" /> General to put forward amendments to the original Bill.  It would have been bizarre in the extreme and ridiculous if the Attorney General had been allowed to lay down the ground rules by which a committee of the Oireachtas would examine himself and other people. Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas should not allow their powers to be superseded in any way.  It is up to us to lay the ground rules and legislate. For the Attorney General to have proceeded to lay down the rules under which he would have been examined would have been farcical and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Government originally proposed in a Bill, which it said was simple, an outrageously elaborate system providing for legal representation of witnesses appearing before the committee.  No Member of the Oireachtas should require legal representation to help them do the job they are elected to do. Such suggestion was extreme.  Fianna Fáil sought to justify legal representation by invoking the need for natural justice.  I will not debate natural justice or Fianna Fáil's application of it to situations which have arisen over the years in relation to the party and the national interest.  It appears to me that natural justice is a yardstick used by Fianna Fáil when it wants to stay in power or acquire or achieve something.</P>
    <P>What has the Attorney General to say?  Why does he feel he needs the protection of absolute privilege when being examined by a House of the Oireachtas?  I find this very disconcerting and curious.  I am anxious to hear what the Attorney General has to say.  We must establish why he needs this protection.  This was a strange departure for a witness appearing before a committee, whether it was an Oireachtas Joint committee or a select committee of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the committee is not a court.  No matter what the findings of the committee are, nobody will be charged with an offence before the courts.  Any offences found will be strictly political.  The jury in this case <Col N="1154" /> will be the people at the next general election, who will cast their votes and make a judgment on what they have seen over the past number of weeks.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) states that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>A statement or admission made by a person before the committee, or a document produced or sent by a person to the committee at its request, shall not be admissible as evidence against the person in any criminal proceedings and subsection (1) shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this subsection should also apply to civil proceedings because it is important that this aspect is also covered.  I am also concerned that there is no specific provision in the Bill dealing with the compellability of witnesses.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy provided an analysis of the constitutionality of the Bill and the sections of the Constitution which apply, but we should recognise that the powers of the Constitution are vested in the President to assess the constitutionality of the Bill.  She has powers under the Constitution to decide on this issue and I have every confidence that, given her record and legal experience as a constitutional lawyer, she will exercise those powers effectively with regard to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be subject to close examination; lawyers will differ with regard to its contents.  However, the matter will, and must, be examined.  If the Bill is to be referred to the Supreme Court, hopefully it will be done quickly rather than put the public through months of more confusion.  Hopefully also the constitutionality of the Bill will be assessed, if that is the wish of the President, before the committee proceeds with its detailed work.  We do not want a further fiasco where the committee will proceed and, if there is a challenge to the Bill, any workings undertaken by the committee under this legislation may be deemed unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to address the issue as to why the Attorney General considered it necessary to have <Col N="1155" /> legislation to protect him while attending a committee of the Oireachtas.  This is a fundamental question which raises many further questions which I do not wish to place on the record this evening.  However, an answer is required and hopefully the Select Committee on Legislation and Security will secure this answer when the Attorney General attends its deliberations. I wonder what he has to say, what is so dramatic that he considers he requires this protection.</P>
    <P>I hope the matter will be resolved quickly and I appreciate and understand the difficulties which many people are experiencing.  The present political situation is unprecedented and there is much confusion, frustration, annoyance, disappointment, anger and various other emotions regarding the matter. Some of these were on display in the House tonight.  Perhaps sitting at this late hour is not wise and the House should take business earlier in the day. I have every confidence that the President will deal with the constitutionality of the Bill which is within her remit.  Our business is to pass the Bill as expeditiously as possible and send it to the President.</P>

He has attended the House on numerous occasions dealing with technical and detailed legislation and he has always displayed courtesy to me personally.  I also wish to place on record my appreciation of the work undertaken by the <Col N="1156" /> Minister for Justice.  In the short time both Ministers have been in the Department, it has been a reforming Department and the House has considered many pieces of legislation which are a credit to them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this legislation will not, to any significant extent, clear up the question of the delay in the dealing with the Fr. Smyth extradition case.  It will either be referred to the Supreme Court by the President or challenged by others and found to be unconstitutional.  To go into great detail and engage in long discussion about this legislation will only delay the constructive work of the House.  For this reason, by dealing with this kind of legislation and recognising as we all do that it will be found to be unconstitutional, we are only bringing the House into disrepute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to place on record my profound unease at what we are doing tonight.  We have lost the run of ourselves.  I hope it is not too late to take a long hard look at exactly what we are undertaking.  This House should not operate on the basis of processing quickie legislation.  Senator Magner spoke of long legislation, but we should never have quickie legislation or <i>ad hoc</i> legislation which deals with only one subject or one situation.  I am against quickie legislation because it is often fundamentally flawed, and I am against <i>ad hoc</i> legislation because it often merely illustrates knee jerk, crisis management, and this is not the way this House should work.  In this case we have rolled both quickie legislation and <i>ad hoc hoc</i> legislation together and people must be asking what is the Seanad doing at this hour of the night trying to solve something after the last bus has gone.  It does not appear to be a realistic way to process legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this quickie legislation, the original idea of having an overnight investigation was good.  It deserved attention and it would have worked.  However, the matter has become bogged down with all kinds of difficulties, and in the end we will not <Col N="1157" /> have this overnight investigation.  The investigation will continue into the new year.  Therefore, the argument for having speedy legislation has evaporated. There is no excuse for taking legislative short cuts.  Now that there is the time, we should get it right and we should not operate on the basis we thought was required when we needed speedy legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, if, on consideration, matters are going to take time, there are ways and means of proceeding, and one such well established way is by judicial inquiry.  I am aware that since the beef tribunal judicial inquiries are not the flavour of the month but we should not attempt to establish quasi-judicial processes at which we have no experience.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned that the committee would not be a court, but if we want bodies which are going to act and behave like courts, as apparently defined in the Bill, then we should get them out of Leinster House because this is not the place for them.</P>
    <P>In the past month or so I am sure most of us have read the Constitution.  I found it interesting to consider it again, to consider the year 1937 and the thoughts that went into the wording of the Constitution.  The Constitution separates the legislative and the judicial process.  These two aspects are well thought out and they form a precious part of our heritage and we should think long and hard before throwing them away.  We should not try to mix them together; we should stick to our guns. There must be a better way to do this and we should adopt that approach now rather than run the risk of quickie and <i>ad hoc</i> legislation which will get us into trouble.  We have already realised there is no reason to do what we originally intended.  This is bad legislation, so we must find another way to deal with this issue.</P>

      <P>The last sentence of the Minister's speech states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> What remains may still perform, to some degree, the task required for it &mdash;but the changes made to it give me strong reasons for doubting its capacity to pass the various tests of constitutionality which apply to the legislation in terms of its text and application.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister, Deputy O'Dea.  This is the first time in my experience that a Minister has brought in legislation in which he has no faith.  I understand how he has been landed with this legislation.  As Senator Magner said, we all want the truth.  However, I also take on board what Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Quinn said.  Are we passing quickie or <i>ad hoc</i> legislation to get the truth?  The truth is so important that the route to it must be above board. I do not believe that the Oireachtas, the President or the Supreme Court has the power to grant to any citizen privileges which are in the Constitution without a referendum.  For that reason, I believe this is bad legislation and I am surprised we are pushing it through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to all the comments I still believe this is important legislation for many reasons.  It is important because it is trying to do something necessary and it is a signpost which points us in a particular direction. I was interested in the arguments about constitutionality, none of which is convincing. People are invited to appear before a committee and I am sure it could be construed that while they are there they are taking part in the affairs of that committee.  One could, therefore, presume that under the Constitution they would be entitled to the same protection as the Members of the committee.</P>
      <P>As regards the arguments made by Senator O'Kennedy and others, one can look at this issue from various viewpoints and I do not think Senator O'Kennedy or anyone in the Fianna Fáil Party has the ability to be dispassionate about these matters, for obvious reasons.</P>

      <P>I will do so and I will also discuss the constitutionality factor.  It could be construed that when people come before the committee they are taking part in the affairs of the committee. It could also be construed that they are part of the committee and therefore entitled, without any legislation, to the same protection as Members of the committee.  I am sure people who are charged with the responsibility of looking at the constitutionality of this issue will do so from various angles.  We all have different opinions on this issue, but it will be decided.  That does not mean the legislation should not be passed, <Col N="1162" /> because it can be tested later by the President, who has the power to do so.</P>
      <P>The public has now turned off this issue.  The Bill would have been more effective if it had been possible to hear the people involved at the outset.  The public has made up its mind and no matter what happens, the people are not in a mood to listen to any more detail because they have heard enough.  They are bored with this issue.  They may listen to a few of the star players; I am sure they would like to hear the Attorney General and the former Attorney General to see what type of people they are.  Perhaps we should go in this direction.</P>
      <P>The type of autocratic power which Ministers have to make appointments must be brought to light.  It would be better if the committee system was refined in such a way that the Attorney General and other people who are appointed to various positions by Ministers could make an appearance and could satisfy the public that they are capable of handling the positions they have been offered.  This legislation will point us in that direction.  I believe our democracy will never be the same again after this sad story.  That is one of the reasons I welcome this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the new Government will try to expand the powers which the committee systems can use.  I also hope that ministerial actions and decisions can be considered in public so that the people, whom Governments are supposed to serve, can see what is happening.  The present system where parliamentary questions are asked about particular appointments and where Ministers may give vague answers and can in subtle ways succeed in not giving the information that is required is past.  That is not enough.  Anybody talking about transparency and openness would have to agree that the current system is not in any way transparent or open.  I hope the new Government will find ways of making ministerial decisions more visible to the public in a way that was never done before.  That is a platform I <Col N="1163" /> have been on for a while, even before this débâcle.</P>
    <P>The public are certainly sceptical about a lot of the work that politicians and Governments do.  They feel that it is a cloak and dagger business.  Many people feel that Ministers make partisan decisions all the time.  They feel that Ministers have to be partial to members of their own party and to their friends and associates.  That is a commonly held view and we have to try to break it because in many cases it is not true.  I am not concerned about the political background of people who are appointed to any position.  I would be far more concerned to see that they were capable of carrying out the functions attached to the position.  To date we have not devised a system where that is possible, but we must do so.  Everyone talks about accountability, openness and transparency.  Let us try and achieve them.</P>
    <P>We would not be discussing this legislation this evening but for a few incidents that happened recently.  The Arcon affair was one and the debacle surrounding the appointment of the former Attorney General to the presidency of the High Court is the other.  Both incidents are questionable.  The public have made up their minds about those two issues and they want to see changes. It has confirmed in their minds the kind of things that they thought were at the level of rumour and if we are to have a healthy democracy we need to go in the direction that this Bill is pointing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. Many views have been expressed and it is a very early hour of the morning.  I would like to think that all politicians in both Houses of the Oireachtas believe in transparency, accountability, credibility and truthfulness.  Everyone who is elected to public office considers it a very great honour to represent the public and they do their very best whether they are in Government or Opposition, as chairmen of committees or in whatever position they hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> There is far too much criticism of the profession of politics.  Politicians are answerable to the people every so often. Members of no other profession are as answerable for what they do.  We are fair game for unfair media criticism. Statements which are made from time to time are taken to apply to all Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I was here last Thursday and I heard the Taoiseach say that an apology was received from Mr. A that evening.  I would like to see this person brought before the committee and examined and cross-examined in relation to the statement in which he freely and openly apologised.</P>
    <P>I have stood back from this, and tried to assess the situation.  Having been here for over 12 years I know most of the people personally who are in Government and in Opposition.  They are trying to do their best on behalf of their political parties and their constituencies and are trying to represent their people in a fair way.</P>
    <P>I can see the justification for giving protection to the Attorney General when he is seeking it in the House but I wonder whether he is seeking protection from an allegation or from a Member of the House who already has protection or whether he is seeking protection from another person who is not a Member of the House regarding something he might say in his contribution or might divulge under questioning. I sympathise with the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, as it is a very early hour of the morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate can be distilled down to three or four propositions. The first is one which has been put forward by all speakers who have said that the objective is to get to the truth.  Truth is a very funny thing.  It often depends on where you are standing, on the position from which you see events.  I am not sure there is in many cases a totally objective truth.  It could be that over the past couple of weeks people who have given different versions are all telling the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> I have been 13 years in the Oireachtas.  Most people I know have behaved honourably on most occasions. Truth may be difficult to find, but at least we want to find out what the truth may be even if it is surrounded by very many qualifications.  We are all agreed on that.  Nobody is looking for scalps or scapegoats.  The people want to know what happened during those days.  I suspect that when the full truth is known it will be much less spectacular than it has appeared to be in recent times.</P>
    <P>We then come to the question of how to find the truth.  There is no clear way of doing that.  We are discovering that as the debates go on.  Senator Quinn tonight in his very interesting, pungent and short contribution centred on how to find the truth.  If I heard the Senator correctly, he was suggesting that perhaps a judicial tribunal might be the way in which the truth could best be established.</P>
    <P>The trouble with judicial tribunals is that the last one left a terrible smell in the nostrils of the people.  Who knows what the truth is after the beef tribunal? It was the worst tribunal, the worst report, the worst written report.  It came to no conclusions about anything, left it all there for people to find.  It was necessary to go around with a geiger counter to find out what the conclusions were at the end of it all, at a cost of millions of pounds.  Nobody in their right mind would say that we should have a judicial tribunal again.  If we go back to earlier judicial tribunals such as the judicial tribunal in the mid-1940s into the Dr. Ward case, the Locke's tribunals in 1947 and the various tribunals dealing with the Whiddy disaster, moneylending and so forth, they were not particularly expensive.  They came up with a truth that was fairly easily recognisable. Maybe we should not close our minds to this option.  The problem is that we are up against the avarice of the legal profession which has made it virtually impossible to have a properly costed, reasonably priced tribunal without teams of lawyers milking the system to the end, turning the public off and turning <Col N="1166" /> us off.  Ultimately we carry the blame for the excesses of the costs of the beef tribunal.  I would not rule Senator Quinn's proposal out of hand completely.  We may throw this ball back to the Law Library and if it has a contribution to make in ascertaining the truth, perhaps it would curb its members.  I do not know if there is a clear way to find the truth.</P>
    <P>The question of privilege has been exercising the minds of people for many years.  I cannot say it exercised the mind of the last Government too much.  I suspect that a seven month delay in the Attorney General's Office on this question would have been slight.  However, the extension of privilege must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is a new phenomenon in Irish life in that people are tuning in to the Oireachtas proceedings and are forming their own views.  Fortunately or unfortunately the camera does not lie too much. This phenomenon extends the operations of Parliament and the question of privilege is central.  For the past number of years the Attorney General's Office has been looking at this but it has not come to any conclusion perhaps because it cannot reach a conclusion.  This Bill is probably the best shot at giving privilege in difficult circumstances but it is once off legislation.  Some situations require emergency or once off treatments and this is perhaps one of them. Senator Magner was right that the length of time devoted to legislation is not a guarantee that it will be better at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>Nobody in the House knows how the five or seven members of the Supreme court will judge anything.  Professor Basil Chubb in his book on the Constitution quoted a senior lawyer who referred to the Supreme Court as Disneyland because nobody knew what would come out of it.  There is an element of truth in that.</P>

      <P>I heard the debate in the other House, and Senator Enright, an eminent lawyer on the circuit, could put arguments which we could argue for or against all day.  At the end of that debate the legislation must be tested and judged.  We must wait until those who can judge tell us their view. Although they may not be wiser, they have the forces of the constitutional law behind them.</P>
      <P>After this long debate on a difficult question to which there is no short answer, I hope the President, when she receives this Bill tomorrow morning, will decide to refer it to the Supreme Court for adjudication.  That would put everybody out of their agony.  If it is constitutional, we must get on with the job, but if not, we must get back to the drawing board.  It is like the time Carlow footballers and hurlers were not doing well.</P>

If the President says the Bill is unconstitutional, things will not be great.  We will have to go back to the drawing board to see what can be done.  We have spoken enough about this.  We put the Bill through the House and send it to the President who will do what is right. It must be adjudicated on because everyone is sick of what is happening. We must resolve these questions so we can move on to other business.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive, helpful and informed contributions.  Senator Enright mentioned that compellability is not provided for in the Bill.  I explained in my speech the reason for that.  As Senator Manning said, this is emergency legislation.  We did not have time to give proper and due consideration to all the issues which would need to be taken into account in the matter of providing for compellability.  Because this is a caretaker Administration and because the provision of compellability of witnesses would be a fundamental change to our system, we do not believe it would be appropriate to make such provision at this stage.  I am not using that as an excuse but as an another reason why it would be inappropriate for a caretaker Government to take a decision of that magnitude.</P>
      <P>Senator Enright pointed out that because there was no compellability care should be taken to protect people's rights and the interests of natural justice, etc.  The point I made, which has been made on a few occasions tonight, is that we did provide for the protection of people's rights to natural and constitutional justice in the initial legislation but those provisions were deleted today. Admittedly, something was put in their place.  The feeling on this side of the House is that what replaced those provisions, which were included on the specific advice of the Attorney General, is not equivalent and, therefore, the Bill is more vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Enright said the chairman of the committee needs legal guidance.  I agree with that and I understand something will be done.  The Senator said that the committee should not be large and unwieldy and that a small, tight and focused committee would be appropriate. Members will be happy to hear that an amendment was made in the Lower House to provide that the committee may appoint a subcommittee of itself which shall not include more members than it decides &mdash; in other words, the committee will decide how many <Col N="1169" /> members will be on the subcommittee. If different parties want to include people with legal expertise, there is provision for substituting present members with others so there will be appropriate people on the committee &mdash; a small team, mainly lawyers drawn from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The point was made as to why people need legal representation before such a committee, particularly Members of the Oireachtas.  A Member said that the only possible sanction for a Member of the Oireachtas would be a referral to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I must dispute that.  The range of witnesses will be fairly broad.  The committee has already agreed on some witnesses and it specifically agreed that more could be called if needed.  Witnesses will not be mainly Members of the Oireachtas.  There are others who might find themselves defamed and their name, business or profession ruined as a result of a one sided presentation. In the interest of natural justice they should be able to put their side of the case.</P>
    <P>The committee is not likely to come to any conclusions, nevertheless the report and the deliberations will be public. If a witness at the committee should defame somebody, perhaps ruin their good name which, as I said, could have extraordinary or profound effects on their business or their profession or relations with neighbours and friends, it is right and fair that procedure be in place to allow that person to put the other side of the case.  That is our basic contention.</P>
    <P>By and large public representatives should not need senior counsel, etc. to present a case on their behalf.  Nevertheless, it would be wrong to say that a referral to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is the only possible consequence for a public representative who might be so defamed and destroyed by a one sided presentation which he or she could not answer that they might lose their seat at the next election.  That is a very profound consequence: somebody's career might be grossly interfered <Col N="1170" /> with.  There are consequences even for public representatives; they can suffer too.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche made the point that because there is no compellability people need not subject themselves to cross-examination.  A witness before the tribunal could grossly defame another witness and because they are not compellable, if the person who is defamed wants to cross-examine and give their side of the case, the person who gives the initial evidence can simply walk away.  I recognise that they cannot be compelled to stay.  The only consolation I can give to a person in that position is that if somebody makes defamatory and outrageous statements and refuses to subject themselves to cross-examination, that will be reflected in the committee's report which will state explicitly that witness A said something about witness B but refused to be subjected to cross-examination.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Roche's fears about the possible unconstitutionality of the Bill.  A number of key sections which sought to protect constitutional rights were voted down in the Lower House today.  These are rights which the Supreme Court decided <i>In re</i> Haughey 1971 Irish Reports, that a person before a tribunal should have.  We enumerated them on the advice of the Attorney General who advised that, to make the Bill as invulnerable as possible against successful constitutional challenge, we should write those rights in.  The Dáil, in its wisdom, decided to write them out again.</P>
    <P>In their place, it accepted an amendment from the Progressive Democrats which creates a new section 3 which states: &ldquo;The committee shall, while engaged in the functions referred to in the Schedule to this Act [that is, the order of the House which set up the committee], take all steps which in the opinion of the committee are necessary to protect and vindicate the good name, character and other constitutional rights of witnesses and other citizens&rdquo;.  We are basically saying that the committee will decide in each case what constitutional <Col N="1171" /> rights each witness has; what natural justice demands that witness should get.</P>
    <P>I put it to a Deputy today in the Lower House if he felt that, because the facts of this case were somewhat different from the Haughey case, the rights of witnesses here should be less and, if so, what they should be.  He did not answer, he simply said we will let the committee decide.  The difficulty is that witnesses who feel they are not getting fair play or exactly what they want from the committee can refer to the courts straightaway and delay this indefinitely, quite apart from the constitutional considerations. It would have been far better to include the rights which were given by the Supreme Court to witnesses before tribunals whose names might be impugned in the Haughey case, as we were advised to do by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Some Senators suggested that it is extraordinary to see a Minister or a Minister of State hostile to their own Bill.  The Bill published this morning was our Bill.  Because our party does not have a majority in the Dáil any longer, the Bill which I have brought here this evening is a horse of a very different colour from the original one.  Senator Magner explained that very well and I thank him for his understanding.  It demonstrates a far greater understanding of the reality than certain other members of his party to whom we will not refer.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville said that we were setting out guidelines for a new system.  I do not agree.  I said that the new Government has undertaken &mdash; and I will keep it to this promise &mdash; to introduce the larger legislation which has been in gestation for 17 years.</P>

      <P>In drafting the legislation the new Government will have the advantage of seeing how this system <Col N="1172" /> worked under this legislation.  However, this is not a blueprint or a set of guidelines. This deals with real people.  There will be real witnesses and real examination of people which will perhaps affect their character and so on.  This is more than just guidelines and to view it as such would underestimate its effect.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Kennedy said that High Court judges can refer papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions to see if a prosecution can take place, although those witnesses have the same sort of privilege as we are now giving to witnesses before the tribunal.  Therefore, the protection given to witnesses might not be as much as they think. However, Senator O'Kennedy overlooked section 2 (3) of this Bill which says that any statement made during the course of the investigation in evidence before the tribunal is not admissible in any court in criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said that the fact that the Dáil changed the legislation, although the Government did not want it to do so, is an exercise in democracy.</P>

      <P>Apparently, democracy breaks out in the Lower House when the Government does not have a majority; that is the only time we see democracy in action.  Sadly for Senator Dardis and those of like mind, democracy as we know it will come to an end within the next few days.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said it is not our decision to decide what is constitutional and Senator Manning made a similar point.  Of course, I agree with them &mdash; it is the function of the Supreme Court. However, our duty is not to pass legislation which we feel is unconstitutional. The only way we can get a decision on that is to ask our chief law officer, the Attorney General.  I do not wish to labour the point but the legislation which we are putting through now falls short, from the aspect of constitutional safety, of what the Attorney General advised us would be safe.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis also pointed out that Deputy O'Malley was the first to mention that the Government might not be in a position to give absolute privilege. I have to correct him on that as I was the first person to mention that.  The reference is column 164 of the Official Report of 7 December 1994.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis said it is only by the deliberations of this committee that we can arrive at the truth and that members of the Government should not evade their responsibilities to answer questions or delay the committee in its work.  We are not trying to delay the committee.  Various members of my party inside the House, outside on the plinth and various other places have made the point that we want to get the truth as quickly as possible.  I am seriously worried that if this legislation is struck down the inquiry will be delayed indefinitely.  Will it ever finish?</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn said we were not told the truth by the caretaker Ministers. The committee is being set up specifically to decide that issue.  She also said that natural justice is used by Fianna Fáil for its own ends.  It was decided by the Supreme Court that people appearing before tribunals were entitled to natural justice, including legal representation, the right to rebut statements made about them and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has nothing to do with it.  The Attorney General advised us that the manner in which we were ensuring natural justice was the best way.  Fine Gael, in conjunction with their partners, have decided differently. Senator Taylor-Quinn was also interested in why the Attorney General needs privilege and asked what he had to say?  We would all love to hear that.</P>

      <P>The sooner we get workable legislation which will not be struck down by the Supreme Court, the sooner <Col N="1175" /> we will know what he has to say Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to section 2 (3) which provides that a statement made before the committee cannot be admitted in criminal proceedings and she asked that it be extended to civil proceedings.  That is a fair technical point but it is already dealt with in section 2 (1) which grants immunity in relation to civil proceedings.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to provide that such evidence would not be admissible in civil proceedings because there is one type of civil proceeding where it would have to be admitted.  High Court witnesses do not have absolute privilege. Privilege does not apply where a person introduces extraneous matters in a malicious manner and in such instances, witnesses are not covered by privilege and can be sued; they cannot be prosecuted. Statements would have to admitted in such an action but, in all other cases, there is an exclusion under section 2 (1).</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to a judicial inquiry which is precisely what we proposed initially.</P>
    </Speaker>

In fairness we would encounter the same problems as we do in the present situation.</P>

      <P>The committee shall take all steps which in the opinion of the committee are necessary to protect and vindicate the good name, character and other constitutional rights of witnesses and other citizens.</P>
      <P>That is almost bound to be struck down. I agree with Senator Quinn that we should not pass laws without at least flagging our concerns about them.  I certainly do not wish to delay this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original sections 3, 4, and 5 were imperfect and I pointed out earlier five disadvantages of the original proposal. However, this is so constitutionally infirm, we could be back here in a short time.  My concern is not to prove who is right and who is wrong but if we pass legislation which purports to do something <Col N="1177" /> and which we know is unconstitutional, we will find ourselves with an even worse delay in getting to the truth.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning and I do not know any Member of either House who does not want to get to the truth, resolve this issue and give a reasonable explanation to the people as soon as possible.  My personal concern is that what we are doing will actually delay rather than expendite the process. I accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Deputies who proposed this amendment; they believe it will expedite the issue.  Is there advice to suggest that this proposal is constitutional?</P>

      <P>The problem is that the section was inserted on Committee Stage today in the Dáil and I do not have any advice on it yet.  It is intended to ensure that the committee protects the constitutional rights of witnesses and third parties who may be mentioned by name or in a manner which makes them easily identifiable in documents furnished or evidence given before the committee.</P>
      <P>The various rights involved were identified in a 1970s court judgment on foot of a challenge to an Oireachtas committee decision by Mr. Padraig Haughey and include: the right to examine witnesses, see relevant documentation and the right to legal representation. While the Government has doubts about the adequacy of this provision, which leaves it to the committee to form the opinion as to what steps are necessary to vindicate a person's rights, it assumes, in light of previous experience of Oireachtas committees and litigation, that the committee will act responsibly.</P>

I believe that paragraph (a) should have dealt with the extraordinary dealy in the handling of the extradition of a paedophile.

I was not party to the decision and I was not one of the people who drafted the Schedule.

    <P>I am not a lawyer but it has been said that this Bill can be subject to constitutional challenge.

      <P>I thank the Senators for their constructive contributions. Our objective is to get this committee doing its work as quickly as possible. I hope that the changes made in the Lower House will not prove to be an obstacle.  Those who proposed the changes genuinely wanted to circumvent cumbersome procedures and to get matters moving as quickly as possible.  I sincerely hope &mdash; and I speak on behalf of everybody in my party &mdash; that those changes will not have the opposite effect.</P>

      <P>The Cathaoirleach's timing today was not great as he has already confessed.  However, it was not a hanging offence.  I thank the Minister. It is a difficult Bill introduced at a difficult time.  The Minister handled it extremely well and he was open and fair.  We all recognise that this Bill is not partisan; in a way it is part of a developing system of new ways.  When the history is written, we will be able to face historians with a reasonable degree of certainty that at least we did the right thing.</P>

      <P>I echo Senator Manning's comments.  I compliment the Minister on the way he steered the Bill through the House.  He did so with good humour and he was most instructive.  I listened to him in the Dáil today and he was equally instructive there.</P>

      <P>No, instructive.  As we approach the changing of the guard, I compliment and congratulate the Minister. I wish him well in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister. He has always introduced legislation with panache and good humour.  I also commend the good grace of Senator Manning and Senator Magner in generously recognising the Minister's difficulties with this Bill &mdash; a Bill for which he is not responsible.  It augurs well for the first constitutional change of the guard in mid-term in rather unique circumstances. Not only will constitutional history have been made but the transition will be less traumatic if we will observe it with the same good humour as it was observed tonight.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well.  I have no doubt that he will be around for a long time when the guard changes again.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his work in the Seanad during his term of office.  We have had many debates in this Chamber and, as my party's spokesman on Justice, I always found the Minister to be positive and a good listener. As a fellow Limerick man, I thank him.</P>
