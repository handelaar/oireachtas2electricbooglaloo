      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to grant aid the rewiring and replacement of existing electrical equipment at the Holy Family school hall, Convent of Mercy, Ennis, County Clare, in order to bring it up to proper safety standards.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to include a drainage programme to alleviate flooding in the south Galway area in the Estimates for 1994.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to list those post-primary schools and their enrolment numbers in the Republic which have more than one in-quota guidance officer authorised by the Department and/or the vocational education committee, to indicate the provisions she intends making to ensure adequate guidance <Col N="1162" /> and counselling personnel in post-primary schools of 900 to 1,100 day pupils considering that the Department's regulations authorise one full time in-quota teacher in a school of 500 plus enrollees.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Taylor-Quinn's and Senator Fahey's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator McGennis may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from yesterday's Order of Business, it is intended to deal with the Social Welfare Bill before Easter.  The Extradition (Amendment) Bill and the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill will also be dealt with before Easter.  With the agreement of the Whips, we will deal with Items 1 and 10 instead of Item 4 from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Thursday.  These are issues on which Members requested a debate on yesterday's Order of Business.  Item 1 relates to the Liaison Committee and Item 10 relates to the Library services.  Item 4 will be dealt with before Easter.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 2 from now until 12.30 p.m.  Item 3 will be taken from 12.30 p.m. to 6 p.m. with a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.  Item 37 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>Can the Leader of the House clarify the arrangements for next week and the week after?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week we requested a debate on East Timor and the Leader indicated that he would permit such a debate.  It is not on the agenda for this week.  Perhaps he would arrange an early date for that debate.  It is important that the Oireachtas voice its protest at the genocide in East Timor where one-third of the population has been wiped out.  We should not be influenced by the ambivalence of some of our friends abroad to the genocide perpetrated in that area. <Col N="1163" /> We should strongly protest and voice our abhorrence at what is happening in East Timor.  The Seanad is the appropriate place to voice such protest.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader of the House allocate time for a debate on the prison system?  I have requested such a debate previously. The situation in the prison system is serious.  Criminals who have committed serious crimes are allowed to go free while old women who may not have paid fines are imprisoned.  An old woman in her sixties who broke a pane of glass was sentenced to 12 months and is at present in Mountjoy Prison.  A young girl who failed to pay her bus fare was sentenced to 15 days in prison.  There should be a full debate on developments in the prison system as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to provide time for a discussion on the report from the task force on small businesses.  I know it was only issued last night and I was fortunate enough to get a copy.  I am reminded of its importance when I recall the motion Senator Henry and I tabled some months ago about the opportunities for jobs in the future being based on the service industry created by small businesses.  The task force issued its report yesterday.  I know it is an up to date issue, but I would like the House to find time to discuss it.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Neville's comments about the prison system.  We had the opportunity to touch on this matter in two recent motions on the Public Order and Criminal Justice Acts.  Some of the ideas mooted in those discussions need further thought.  A great deal could be done if attention was drawn to that matter as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Neville in calling for a debate on East Timor.  However, it should be broadened into a major foreign affairs debate.  At present, a number of our people are working abroad.  Now would be an appropriate time for the House to debate South Africa.  Since a number of observers have already left Ireland to serve as UN monitors <Col N="1164" /> in South Africa under the APSO scheme and another 100 people, including Members of both Houses will be going there, it is appropriate to debate this matter.  Last week, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs was given a resume of events there by Archbishop Napier of Durban.  Some of the matters to which he referred would be relevant to this House and our attitude to what would happen in South Africa before and after the elections.</P>
      <P>Senator Maloney has come back from visiting our troops in South Lebanon. This week, our troops have come under extreme pressure from the South Lebanese Army who are run and armed by Israel.  It is time a protest was made from this House to the Israeli Government on the conduct of the SLA in South Lebanon. Somalia, eastern Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Senator Neville's support for the proposed debate on East Timor.  It is timely and it should take place as soon as possible.  I know the Government side have made valiant efforts to secure the presence of either the Tánaiste or the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt.  I am grateful to them for doing that, but the situation is so urgent that it does not matter to me which Minister is present.  People are being murdered there every day.  While we wait, death is taking place.  People have been moved by the film &ldquo;Schlinder's <Col N="1165" /> List&rdquo;.  However, the same practice is taking place in East Timor with the connivance of the Australian and British Governments.  This must be stopped by protests from small independent nations like our own.  The Seanad is an appropriate forum to launch such an appeal to the international conscience.  I have copies of the television programme shown recently and I would be happy to make it available as briefing material to Members who wish to advise themselves on this matter.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on foreign affairs.  However, this topic should be treated separately because we will blur the focus of an extremely important debate if APSO, South Africa and Somalia are discussed together.  These are all vitally important issues.  Senator Lanigan is a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and he plays a full and significant role there.  I am also a member of that committee.  I attend frequently and important discussions there would be of relevance to the House if we had a regular debate on foreign affairs.  I support Senator Lanigan's call for regular debates on foreign affairs.  Only five of the 30 Members of that Committee are from this House.  That is disgraceful. These five Members could brief other Members of this House on what happens there.</P>
      <P>Are there any details yet available about a debate on the drug problem in the inner city?  Many would welcome such a debate.  I was surprised and pleased that a reference made in this House on this matter was widely taken up by the media. There is a genuine interest in the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the drug problem and the prison system.  I heard a discussion about the latter on a radio programme this morning.  We should have some input into changing and improving our prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Leader arrange for a debate on agriculture?  In the last 36 hours, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry decided to close one of the ports from which we export live cattle.  This will <Col N="1166" /> have a devastating effect on the prices farmers receive for animals they sell over the next two weeks.  It is only proper that the Minister should tell the House if his Department took this action under pressure from the slaughtering plants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Leader of the House to initiate a debate on foreign affairs, and especially the role of the Defence Forces in Somalia and the Lebanon. With Deputy Barrett, I had the pleasure of visiting both regions over the last number of days to see how our forces are working in these areas.  United States personnel are moving out of Somalia at the end of this month.  The changing role caused by this move should be seriously looked at, especially the role of our forces after that date.  Our forces are held in great esteem by the local populations in Somalia and the Lebanon.  They are doing a tremendous job.</P>

I appreciate this will not take place because the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy T. Kitt, are not in the country.  I understand the Tánaiste will be back next week.  This House should sit one day next week to discuss East Timor.  Most Members would agree to a one day sitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A debate on East Timor will take place as soon as possible before Easter.  We would also welcome a debate on the prison system as soon as possible. There is a lot of legislation to be dealt with.  Senator Quinn's call for a debate on the report on small businesses will also be dealt with.  A debate on this report would be one of the most important to take place in this House.</P>
      <P>We will also try to fit in a debate on foreign affairs.  It has always been a priority of this House to discuss foreign affairs and agriculture.  Item 1, which will be discussed next Thursday, will give the House a chance to expand on some of the matters mentioned this morning. Hopefully the Seanad will have a better opportunity to become involved in committees after the revision of the committee system.</P>
      <P>The House will not be sitting next week.  However, we will sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the following week.</P>
      <P>On today's Order of Business, the time allowed is 20 minutes per spokesperson and 15 minutes for other speakers.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Training (Apprenticeship Levy) Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to be in the Seanad again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the introduction and collection of a payroll levy from 6 April 1994, in certain sectors of industry to fund the new FÁS apprenticeship system.  This new apprenticeship system has been agreed following several years of in depth examination. It is a standards based system which is designed to ensure that apprentices are taught pre-defined skills and knowledge. A national craft certificate which will give recognition, nationally and internationally, to the standards achieved <Col N="1168" /> must be obtained for recognition as a craftworker.</P>
    <P>The traditional time-served apprenticeship has served this country well in many respects and the system has produced many skilled craftworkers. However, many others have completed apprenticeships without a proper skills foundation.  The system was fragmented and lacked any coherence and a major disadvantage was that no certification of skills or knowledge was required.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Education I became aware of the inadequacies of the present system and the need to upgrade the skills base of Irish workers to the best international standards.  I was, and still am, conscious of the need to have a skilled and mobile workforce capable of matching the skills levels which prevail in the European Union as a whole.  This is particularly relevant now in the context of the EU Internal Market where it will be vital that due recognition is given to the skills of the Irish workforce.  This is why it is necessary that there is a system of certifying the attainment of skills and knowledge and why, in the case of apprentices, a national craft certificate will be awarded to qualified apprentices.</P>
    <P>We dealt with Second Stage of this Bill in the Dáil over several days and Committee Stage was taken in the Select Committee.  I heard Senators talking earlier about the need to get Senators involved in the committee system.  The Bill then went back to the Dáil for Report Stage.  During the debate the issue of equity came to the fore.  I am determined to address the problem of access to apprenticeships.  This was one of the major points of discussion during the Dáil debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention on many occasions that recruitment to an apprenticeship is often based on who one knows rather than suitability or qualifications for the position.  I was glad to have the agreement of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats on that point.  I intimated at an early stage in the Dáil debate on this Bill that I was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Well done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The record shows clearly that it was I who brought it up and not Senator Neville's colleague.  I was concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I read the two reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the inequity in the system of recruitment and I asked the board of FÁS to examine the position with a view to producing solutions.  When I had spoken all sides of the House expressed similar concerns and were anxious that something should be done about the matter.  I discussed the position with FÁS and I met representatives of IBEC, CIF, SIMI and ICTU at several meetings.</P>
      <P>There was general agreement that the current inequities need to be removed from the system.  There are, however, sensitivities and complex issues to be taken into account in resolving the problem. We are dealing with contracts of employment between private individuals &mdash; employer and apprentice.  We are not dealing with the public service.  Many of those involved run small operations.  It is important that any solution we come up with should not alienate potential employers, particularly at this time as we make the transition from the old to the new apprenticeship system and as we seek to increase the numbers in the system.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I felt sufficiently strongly about the issue that I contemplated the possibility of bringing in a legislative provision which would give compulsory backing to an equitable recruitment regime.  The State would have the right to do this given the investment &mdash; £30 million annually between European and national funds &mdash; it is making to the training of apprentices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is that figure now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>However, on balance, and in the light of my discussions with employers and employees who feel that the compulsory road would be premature <Col N="1170" /> at this time, I propose to hold off on such an approach for the moment.</P>
      <P>I have, however, introduced a new section 4 to the Bill on Report Stage which was approved by the Dáil and which will enable the Minister of the day to make regulations to provide for conditions of recruitment of apprentices. The purpose of such regulations would be to ensure that recruitment is undertaken in a fair and equitable manner. I also propose in subsection (2) that a resolution approved by both Houses will be necessary before the regulation can be introduced.  Accordingly, both Houses will later have the opportunity to discuss those regulations and to add to or take from them as they see fit.  This is being done in an open fashion.  When the regulations are brought forward by the board of FÁS, and it has its statutory remit to carry out its functions, the regulations will go before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important to note that.</P>
      <P>At this stage it is proposed to develop and operate over a trial period of two years a code of practice to be followed by employers in the recruitment of apprentices.  This code has been developed by FÁS and has already been discussed by their board; it is now with the major social partners.  I should also mention that the new <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> commits the social partners to the adoption of this code of practice.  Not content with getting it through as we did on Report Stage in the Dáil, I then made sure, with the help of the officials in my Department and in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Central Review Committee, that it should be written into the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  Nobody in sectors with apprenticeships will be allowed escape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, we cannot get too fond of levity.  I should also mention that the new <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> commits the social partners to the adoption of the code of practice.  The objectives of that code will be to achieve equity through recruitment by open and fair competition; to ensure equal opportunity through filling apprenticeship vacancies on the basis of individual merit, and to promote the use of sound recruitment procedures.  Specific measures for achieving these objectives will be outlined in the code.</P>
      <P>I recognise there can be a degree of scepticism about the effectiveness of codes of practice.  Self-regulating bodies with voluntary codes are fine to a certain extent but legislation is necessary if such bodies do not work.  We have allowed a strong voluntary code a limited period and if bodies do not conform further action will be taken.  In deference to the concerns expressed we are prepared to give the code a trial period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a positive reaction from the social partners and I undertook to say so publicly.  Both employers and employees came to meet us on this issue.  Finally and without wishing to be seen to be wielding <Col N="1172" /> a big stick, the prospect of a compulsory approach remains open if the code is not seen to be effective over the two year trial period.  I will be monitoring the position carefully and if I am not convinced it is working we will take the other option.</P>
    <P>A new system of apprenticeship is necessary for many reasons.  The inadequacies of the &ldquo;time served&rdquo; system were first highlighted in the White Paper on manpower policy published in September 1986.  A detailed review was subsequently undertaken in 1988 by the apprenticeship review group set up by the FÁS board on the direction of the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern.  This group identified the shortcomings of the existing apprenticeship system, the most important of which were that it was not standards based and apprentices could qualify without reaching pre-defined standards; it was too limited in the number of trades designated; employers were not taking sufficient responsibility for training apprentices compared, say, to the German system where employers must provide adequate on the job training and release apprentices for off the job training.  Irish employers for the most part were and are not committed to apprenticeship training. The existing system was inflexible.  It was incapable of ensuring the apprentices had either an adequate skills base or that skills were updated on an ongoing basis. This was particularly relevant in trades where technology was rapidly changing. It also provided too few opportunities for women, did not facilitate late entry after school-going age and did not reflect the fact that present day apprentices had higher education entry levels than in the past.</P>
    <P>The review group published its findings in December 1989 and the process has been going on for even longer than that. The 1986 White Paper was published by the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, in the then coalition Government and his successor Deputy Ahern published the subsequent report.  The question of a new apprenticeship system, including the proposals of the review group, was the subject of detailed discussions between the <Col N="1173" /> social partners during the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in late 1990 and early 1991. Agreement was reached on the introduction of a new apprenticeship system.</P>
    <P>The new system is to be based on standards and there will be minimum entry requirements.  Special provision will be made to encourage female apprentices and such groups as the disadvantaged, the disabled and mature entrants.  The system will be modular and provision will be made to determine the duration by the requirements of each trade.</P>
    <P>Further discussions were necessary to consider the funding arrangements for off-the-job training and for the appropriate delivery arrangements by the education and training providers, FÁS and the regional technical colleges.  Agreements were concluded and the new system commenced on 1 September 1993 for 15 trades.  A further ten trades will be brought on stream as soon as possible and as practicable, which we envisage being quite soon; those trades are the remaining ten of the existing trades.  The Programme for a Partnership Government recognised the agreement between the social partners and set the objective of building on the scheme.</P>
    <P>One main benefit of the new system is that its standards are based on best international practice.  The curriculum will include on- and off-the-job training and education.  Each apprenticeship will have seven phases, three off-the-job and four on-the-job.  This modular structure allows for a certain degree of flexibility. The modular system is increasingly seen worldwide as the best way of delivering education and training.</P>
    <P>The integration of the required levels of skill and knowledge in the curricula will lead to more efficient and cost effective delivery arrangements.  The raised minimum entry requirements reflect the general increase in the education levels of school leavers.  The system can then be adapted to bring in more businesses, apprenticeships and trades.</P>
    <P>Structured ongoing assessment will give more valid evidence of attainment during apprenticeship.  Modular assessment <Col N="1174" /> makes it easier to update the system if necessary and the new system will be more transparent to users as published minimum standards will form the basis of all assessment.</P>
    <P>After the curriculum, the delivery of the curriculum and assessment comes the certification of all proper standards of excellence in any system.  The national craft certificate will be a compulsory requirement for craftsperson status as agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The new system will have nationally and internationally recognised certification which will provided improved mobility for craftspersons.</P>
    <P>A most important need which was impressed on me by teachers, instructors, young people and parents is the need for progression within the apprenticeship system.  It is the intention that the training and apprenticeship programmes in the new apprenticeship system should provide for progression to technician and other qualifications for persons able to and interested in pursuing these options.</P>
    <P>This will build ladders of opportunity into the apprenticeship system.  These have existed in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion but correct steps are being put in place.  Now those who wish and who have the ability will be able to move through different types of third level colleges for certificates, diplomas, degrees and postgraduate qualifications.  There should not be a limit to how far people can go.</P>
    <P>The new apprenticeship levy in the principal craft sectors of industry will ensure the individual employer will not be directly out of pocket as a result of releasing an apprentice for off the job training or education.  That will provide an incentive to employers to conform with the requirements of the apprenticeship curricula.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill when first drafted was to provide for a levy to fund the new system and when first presented to me it was intended to be mechanical revenue raising legislation.  The officials and I knew that the Bill could not be so restrictive.  I could have left the Bill as it stood but I did not want to approach the <Col N="1175" /> matter in that way.  That technical aspect remains in the Bill but I realised most parties would want to have a say about the broader issue of apprenticeships, that they would want to discuss how the new system should proceed and what should be done to it.  This proved to be the case and I hope I was open to what people had to say, to amendments to the Bill and to a wider review.</P>
    <P>I knew it would not be right to confine the scope of the Bill.  Officials in the Department and I went to work and accepted many amendments so that the scope of the Bill was greatly enlarged. The system needs funding but it concerns apprenticeships for young people and giving them a proper place.</P>

      <P>The employers have to pay, and rightly so, because they are getting fine young people into their employment.</P>
      <P>The discussions within the central review committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> led to an agreement between the social partners on funding proposals in respect of four sectors of industry &mdash; construction, motor, printing and paper and engineering, excluding electronics &mdash; which employ the vast bulk of all registered apprentices.  The main provisions of the funding proposals are as follows. Apprentice payments while the apprentice is off the job and a contribution towards any associated travel and accommodation costs are likely to be met from an apprentice fund and matching EU support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is only a small amount of the total cost of apprentices which is funded by this country and Europe.  The apprentice fund is to be created by the introduction in the four industry sectors of a new employers' apprenticeship levy under which employers will pay 0.25 per cent of payroll to the fund.  The new levy should bring in approximately £4 million <Col N="1176" /> in a full year towards the total cost of £30 million in a full year.  With the introduction of the new levy the existing levy/grant system in the four sectors will be discontinued.  Under existing arrangements companies above certain payroll thresholds in the construction, engineering and motor sectors pay a 1.25 per cent levy, while the paper and printing sector pays 1 per cent.  Companies can recoup 80-90 per cent of the costs of approved training programmes depending on the sector involved.</P>
    <P>Under the new regime all registered companies in the designated sectors will be subject to the levy of 0.25 per cent, thereby ensuring that all companies which stand to gain from the availability of a skilled workforce will be seen to contribute to the cost of providing that skilled workforce.  It is a much neater arrangement and will provide a minimal amount towards the overall cost.  The new funding arrangement is aimed at ensuring that there will be no direct costs to the individual employer in those sectors while the apprentice is released for off the job training or education.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, which was concluded since Second Stage of the Bill in the other House, makes specific reference to the possibilities of increasing the numbers of apprentices.  In particular, it states that employers will be expected to maximise the recruitment of apprentices, that the potential for public sector bodies to contribute to the expansion of apprenticeship will be reviewed, and that the possibility of making it a term of public sector construction contracts that an agreed number of apprentices should be employed on such contracts will be examined by Government in consultation with relevant interests.  I specifically requested that the second and third parts of that and the other agreement be included in the section, because there are fine apprenticeship systems in the Army, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Bord na Móna and the ESB.  We will have a series of meetings with those bodies to examine how they can be encouraged to expand their apprenticeship systems.  It will probably <Col N="1177" /> be down to money, but I want to engage in that process and include the public system to try to get more excellent apprentices.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary to enable us to provide a mechanism to fund the off the job training of apprentices.  The main provisions of the Bill are as follows. Section 2 provides for the imposition of the levy on all employers in sectors which will be designated under section 3.  The section also provides that the employer shall not pass on the cost of the levy to the employee.  Section 3 gives the Minister power to designate the sectors which will pay the levy.  I outlined the agreed sectors earlier.  Section 4 enables the Minister to make regulations to provide for an equitable and fair system of recruitment for apprentices.  Section 5 provides that the proceeds of the levy shall be used mainly to cover payment of off the job training allowances.  Section 6 sets the levy at 0.25 per cent of reckonable earnings. Section 9 provides for the collection of the levy by the Revenue Collector General.</P>
    <P>I wish to summarise the main reasons for the introduction of the apprenticeship levy.  It is designed to fund off the job training allowances for apprentices in the apprenticeship system.  The general features of the new system are as follows.  It will be a single and national system.  It will be standards based, rather than simply time served.  Standards will be based on best international practice. Apprentices will be required to follow a specific course of training and to undergo a series of assessments towards the attainment of required standards.  Training and assessment will take place both on and off the job.  A national craft certificate, recognised nationally and internationally, will be awarded on successful completion of the apprenticeship.  A national craft certificate will be required for one to be recognised as a craftsperson.</P>
    <P>All Members of the Oireachtas know from their constituency work how often we meet young people, and perhaps their parents, who say that they cannot get an apprenticeship.  The main difficulty is that <Col N="1178" /> they cannot get an employer for the purposes of an apprenticeship.  I went to Germany for two days in early January and saw their system, which is considered excellent by many people.  I spoke to young people and employers.  It is a different market there.  Employers, despite their economic circumstances, are still urgently seeking apprentices. However, there is a different historical background to apprenticeships there. Employers value apprentices and the input of young people.  They have a strong professional belief that it is part of their job, for the future of their country and their industrial sector, to ensure that young people are properly instructed and learn their trade.  Perhaps it is related to medieval crafts and Members will recall the journeypersons of old who went about their business in Europe.  They recognised their trades and that was a strong European trend.  They also had an industrial revolution, all of which passed us by.  This meant that they had mechanisms in place and that employers clearly realised that apprenticeships are necessary, not just in the immediate sense but for the future of their business. This point came through from representatives of trade, employers and young people.</P>
    <P>When an apprentice goes to an employer, he or she signs a contract with that employer.  This is binding in the German courts.  If an employer reneges on it, the employee has redress.  If the firm closes or fails, the employer must, by law, place the apprentice in another firm.  In turn, if the employee absconds and does not fulfil his or her time, the employer can take the employee and his or her family to court for redress.  It is extremely strong and, of course, the Germans love regulations.  They are highly regulated in every facet of their lives. This comes from the German personality which succumbs to massive regulation, although I do not think we are partial to that in this country.  Our experience shows that this is the case.  However, I was impressed.  While recognising that we do not have that historical crafts background, nevertheless, we have crafts in a <Col N="1179" /> traditional sense, but not in a utilitarian sense.  That is the essential difference.  I also recognise that we have a long way to go before we reach that point.</P>
    <P>I have tried to use the carrot and stick approach with employers.  They read the Dáil and Seanad Official Reports and I urge them not just to think of the immediate future.  Firms are in a difficult economic climate, but the recent budget made good changes for employers.  I ask them to think not just of the immediate position but of the future of their business and sector.  The economic development of the country largely depends on having skilled people with vigour, knowledge, attainments, standards and the will to work in their country.  If they go away and come back with additional knowledge, it is all to the good.</P>
    <P>Regarding equity, in Germany there are empty apprentice places.  No matter how we go about it, there is an intense shortage of places here.  We should separate the two issues.  Equity in itself will not bring more places, but we hope the extension of the system will do this. However, equity will ensure that those who get places do so on merit.  At least people will then have the satisfaction of knowing that the restricted places are given on merit.  We all complain from time to time about systems such as the CAO, yet nobody denies that they are fair and just, even though they may be crude, rude, rough and ready.</P>
    <P>We are addressing private employers in this instance so it is necessary for constitutional reasons to be careful with the way matters proceed.  There is widespread knowledge about the difficulties in getting employers to take on apprentices and the evidence is too strong to ignore that would-be apprentices often get into the system through those whom they know rather than by merit.</P>
    <P>I had to undertake a lot of work to have the code of practice considered and I wish to advise those who want to take matters further immediately that there has been a huge leap forward, first, to get recognition of the fact that there was inequity and, second, to have this <Col N="1180" /> inequity addressed by having it processed through a code of practice.  If this does not work, then the matter will be taken further.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  She has spent some time addressing the problem of equity and the long term steps that will be taken to deal with this issue.  We all realise that heretofore equity was an issue in so far as all those concerned, including ourselves as public representatives, would have known that things were not happening in the presumed manner.  Will FÁS be able to deal with this issue effectively under these new proposals?  For example, will it be able to deal with the long list of people who apply for schemes at FÁS offices throughout the country but who do not get called?  The situation should develop in such a way that people are interviewed and are then short listed for the different jobs and the different types of apprenticeships that are available. That is not the position at present.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that the long register in the different offices will be brought to the attention of the employers on request. This is unsatisfactory as it is not intended that FÁS will sponsor apprenticeships under the new scheme.  This means that the traditional way for people who do not have a background in a particular trade or skill to attend FÁS and get an opportunity to compete for a place under an apprenticeship scheme is not included in this reform.  This is not acceptable, because FÁS should be engaged in the screening and shortlisting of applicants for apprenticeships and should then present a shortlist of suitable people for interview if the employers are to recruit people to apprenticeships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS would then be the organisation to decide, in real terms, the different apprenticeships which are suitable for its applicants.  It would enable it to control the factors referred to by the Minister, such as the 10 per cent intake of women, to which the Minister has committed herself. There is no guarantee that employers, on a random selection, will <Col N="1181" /> meet any quota regarding gender balance and so on.  In this respect the recent report by the Commission for the Status of Women makes clear that there should be a time scale in which targets will be achieved step by step, so that in each year performance in this area is measured against a set target.  Under this scheme the Government will have no control over the meeting of the targets unless it decides to subsidise employers to discriminate in favour of women.  This would add to the cost burden of the scheme for which the taxpayer is already providing substantial sums of money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change of emphasis to the attainment of standards in place of serving time and that there will be specified periods allocated for off the job training, phased throughout the period of apprenticeships.  However, I question whether the envisaged period for off the job training of 40 weeks is adequate, because it would not be sufficient that ten weeks per year be allocated to this.  An advantage of moving to a system of attainment of standards is that there would not be an obligation on apprentices to serve for a period of four years as their performance would be judged on the attainment of standards.</P>
    <P>As the leaving certificate programmes are being reformed to encourage students to take a vocational element in preparation for that examination, it is clear that in the future more young people will leave second level education with much of the prior work completed to equip them to complete apprenticeships quickly and effectively.  In this respect may I ask how the Minister proposes to combine the new leaving certificate qualifications for the vocational stream with entry into the apprenticeships?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate a response from the Minister.  It is interesting to note that the recent NESC report on education and training illustrated that currently only 20 per cent of our pupils take vocational options compared with 50 to 60 per cent in Denmark and the <Col N="1182" /> Netherlands.  This raises a question which we should all address.  I recall that when I was finishing school the priority of the majority of sons, as was the case then, whose fathers were working in the local factories was to join apprenticeships&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or a trade in the locality.  The reality today is that, unfortunately, one of the main industries in my county, Tara Mines Limited, applies for a small number of apprenticeships and the number of such applications is smaller again at Gypsum Industries Limited. People are not going into training or into the trades, and that is another reason so many people want an on-the-job-list the moment they leave school.</P>
      <P>In reforming the apprenticeship scheme we should consider the situation in other countries where more people take vocational modules in their basic training.  I appreciate the Minister's aim in proposing to extend apprenticeships to a wider range of trades, but will this unwittingly lead to loading an increasing number of our training occupations into an apprenticeship system which will ultimately be difficult to reform?  When the Minister has achieved her targets, will we, perhaps in five years, be attempting to reform the system so that it is flexible and responsive to the needs of the workplace?</P>
      <P>A system of certification is desirable so that qualified people can have a standard that will be useful to them in other countries, but it is wrong to reverse training opportunities in a wide range of occupations into a system where the employers control entry.  In a few years time this could lead to even more social exclusion as a result of decisions taken now and I ask the Minister to produce the evidence that supports the view that steps being taken now will not create errors which will have to be addressed in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme will be employer led, because unless a person can get an employer to sponsor him or her there is no way that they will be able to avail of the apprenticeship training.  We have <Col N="1183" /> been advised that the number of apprentices will be increased, but I cannot see this happening, given that the scheme will be employer led.  Also, irrespective of the way we might encourage companies in the interest of skilled entrants, which is of vital importance, companies will not be in a position to give a commitment to guarantee a minimum of three years, allowing for intermittent breaks to attend off the job training at FÁS centres.  Regional technical companies will allow this, but I cannot foresee the anticipated boom envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of some concern, as I am aware from representations made to me by people over the last 15 years seeking a place.  The only positive approach I can make in response to that as a politician, and I would not be fulfilling my duties if I did not take this approach, is to go to an employer to ascertain if there are any vacancies and, if so, to urge that such people may be considered on a trial basis.  Over the past five to seven years it has become harder than heretofore. Fewer companies take on apprentices, yet the number of applicants is substantial. At present this is employer led and it remains to be seen whether the changes the Minister is making will improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The levy is the core part of this Bill and I worry about that.  Although it is not a lot, 0.25 per cent is being added to employer costs.  I have friends involved in different businesses who tell me about costs.  For example, one often hears about the huge sums of money builders make.  A builder building on a green field site must construct roads, drains, etc. and before 1p is available to him and before the houses are built, the total tax, VAT, etc., on every house built is 34 per cent, excluding material costs.  These people are interested in taking on apprentices, but when one looks at the extra costs after everything is paid, including wages, taxes and materials, only a small amount of money is left.  I am not talking about large builders, but small ones who build <Col N="1184" /> a few houses each year.  Another 0.25 per cent will come out of profits.</P>
    <P>I recognise Ireland has a problem in that employers unlike those in other countries, have not been willing to make a commitment to training.  We have few instruments to encourage people to become involved in training.  The levy system plus the apprenticeship is like the levy and grant system available heretofore. I hope we are changing it around for the better.  The principle of it was attractive in that people paid the levy and were encouraged to draw down the benefit by recruitment.  The principle of this proposal is also attractive and businesses should see the value of taking on apprentices.  I encourage them to do so because the cost of having the required number of apprentices would improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to moneys available. We are delighted to hear the Minister's little cake is safe and that the money for the apprenticeship scheme will be left intact, despite the debacle regarding the £8 billion.  We will have the opportunity to discuss that later today.</P>

      <P>It does not say a lot for those who were supposed to secure the funds.  I ask the Minister about a report in a newspaper stating that funds for 11,500 places would be scarce.  This related to the placement of people on schemes this year.  Will the Minister guarantee that there will not be a shortage of funds in regard to the number of placements?</P>

      <P>The Minister did not give targets in respect of the different programmes. For example, will a target be <Col N="1185" /> set for places available to the multi-skilled? Will the 10 per cent which the Minister spoke about be reached in regard to the position of women on courses?</P>
      <P>The Culliton group and the Kerins group compared training here with that in other countries.  We do not come up to scratch in that regard.  The Minister mentioned Germany, which has a system in place for many years.  I had the opportunity to talk to people there on a number of occasions.  If we follow the system in that country perhaps we will have a successful new apprenticeship system in the future.  Employers and the Government must give a commitment in this regard.  I ask that we be given targets and that these should not be reviewed every five years but on a yearly basis.  It has taken 20 years to reach this point and the Minister may say five years is not too long to wait. However, it is for those who would like the opportunity to provide a system.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage in the Dáil the Minister made some welcome changes to the proposals but there are other areas of apprenticeship which should be considered. For example, we should work in areas of high unemployment.  I listened to Mr. Gay Byrne's radio programme this morning.  Three mothers were interviewed about their young children aged 13 to 15 who are in prison.  They do not have the opportunity to get help or work. I will be bringing forward proposals in the future suggesting how a substantial number of people could be brought into the apprenticeship system through local government.  When finalised, I hope the Minister and the Government will consider these proposals favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although few are being taken, many people are available and looking for apprenticeships.  We must look to areas over which we, as politicians, have control &mdash; for example, local authorities &mdash; to see what we can do to organise systems. Fully trained foremen could be employed instead of being paid to be unemployed and young people could be taken on apprenticeship schemes to build local authority housing.  There is no reason why this cannot be done.  Trade unions <Col N="1186" /> and the social partners may say it is cheap labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not have to be employed after five years when they may look for jobs.  They could build local authority housing at less than 20 per cent of what we pay at present.  I thought about this on Monday at our council meeting, when the manager informed us we had approvals for 60 new housing starts in County Meath and will build two houses on each of 17 sites.  I do not see a problem with this.  This proposal would benefit some of the young people talked about on radio programmes who have had no opportunity to start.</P>
      <P>Our budget is about £25 million to £27 million a year.  When the budget for building houses is added, the amount rises to £40 or £50 million.  We should provide places for young people and give them opportunities to acquire skills in trades.  We are paying them to stay at home; we should give them an opportunity to work.  I will have costs on this in the near future and I hope the powers that be will say this can work.  I will put forward this proposal to my local authority.  I have no doubt that nationally 3,000 or 4,000 people could be in apprenticeships with people who are fully qualified but are unemployed; they could be employed to ensure people on apprenticeships get proper training.  If we are not innovative enough to consider such a development, we will not get anywhere.</P>

      <P>The objective of the Bill is straightforward; it is to raise the payroll levy to fund the new apprenticeship programme of FÁS.  It is intended to pay off-the-job allowances for young apprentices.  The Minister has rightly broadened this issue.  Apprenticeship is an important feature of a much broader scene.  We are a small open economy and live from our exports.  We need to be more competitive.  Skills and training are of crucial importance.  We aim to reach the living standards of our European <Col N="1187" /> partners.  We can achieve a certain amount through public policy and expenditure but at the end of the day, the private sector is the engine of growth and offers the key prospect to increased employment, output and productivity. There is a constant need to search for a competitive advantage and this is where skills, crafts and the quality of our workforce come into play.  We need to be better and have an edge now that we have to compete internationally.  It is the international comparisons which count.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been in Germany, one of our EU partners and export markets. He touched on the esteem and recognition which should be given to crafts.  We have a problem in that parents and children have a preference for white collar occupation not according the same esteem to craft qualifications.  We are preoccupied with white collar employment. The Minister confirmed what I have been hearing for some time &mdash; that young people, parents and employers in Germany accord esteem to craft qualifications. There is a long standing attitude and stereotyping among young women and their parents about the type of jobs they should enter.</P>
      <P>I welcome the FÁS provision for women plumbers, electricians, brick layers, plasterers and so on.  As the Minister said in the Dáil, there is a fair amount of home conditioning in this regard as well as the broader environmental factors.  I was delighted to see a young woman carpenter work outside my office in UCD, Blackrock, recently.  She was the first woman craftsperson I saw doing such work.  This shows we are making some progress but there is a long way to go.  There are institutional and attitudinal factors to be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the off-the-job training support the levy will provide.  By international standards we are well below other countries in terms of such training. This was confirmed in the Roche Tansey study, which was part of the Culliton report.  It has taken time for the apprenticeship system to be put in place but the value of this time is that there is now a <Col N="1188" /> consensus in support of it.  It has been teased out in full and is leading to a national system with a national certificate based on standards.  We all know good crafts people who came out of the &ldquo;time served&rdquo; system in the past.  The great majority of them never sat final craft exams and do not have evidence, in a recognised or accredited sense, of the level of skill they have achieved.  In this day and age qualifications of an accredited and respectable standard are an imperative in finding jobs at home or abroad.  The levy applies to certain craft sectors and I am glad other sectors will be added shortly.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear figures on the number of apprenticeships.  I gather from the Minister's Dáil speech that there are 14, 000 at the moment.  The numbers entering the labour market each year, including great numbers of young people, average 23,000 to 25,000.  Many people are looking for opportunities in a variety of avenues, including apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>When I was chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment over a year ago, FÁS provided evidence to the committee on two occasions.  There was some criticism, on a general level, of FÁS.  As increased funds became available there was a tendency to add another scheme which was funded by the latest tranche of funds.  It seemed to me and others that there was a case for rationalising the range of schemes and courses available to have a more focused approach to the training schemes and, in particular, to value for money.  FÁS has a good track record on craft training.  This was acknowledged in the Roche Tansey study.  Employers in craft based companies when interviewed held FÁS in high regard.  It is important that where credit is due it should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I am glad there will be a structured, on going approach to assessment under the new apprenticeship system.  Concrete steps will be assessed at particular stages and the attainment along that continuum will be established.  In the UCD faculty of commerce, where I work, we can accord up to 40 per cent of the marks in individual subjects for continuous assessment. <Col N="1189" /> This provides the opportunity not alone for a test of attainment at a particular time, which is the essence of what we are saying, but to counsel and advise students who may not be reaching their potential and encourage and guide them to a better performance at the next testing stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister highlighted the important issue of equity.  She wants to have a transparent system which will show it is a meritocracy.  The practice up to now has been that who one knows is more important than the talents young people possess. It is important to tackle this.  I am encouraged by the Minister's concern with fair access to apprenticeships.  It is important to have balance.  It is one thing to have access but it must be for people with the talent to be placed.  We are relying on private sector employers to take on apprentices.  They must have a voice but they need to do more in terms of recognising the value of training, even in bottom line terms for their own companies. This is an investment in a human resource as opposed to a cost.  That is where the problem arises; there is too much emphasis on the cost of training as opposed to the value and contribution it can make, even in cold economic terms, to bottom line results.</P>
    <P>I urge employers to accept the code of practice into which the Minister has put so much work and to address this problem. It is at the discussion stage and it is important to follow through.  It is preferable that employers should do this voluntarily than that we would adopt a heavy handed approach to them later.</P>
    <P>The Minister aptly described the progression from apprenticeship as ladders of opportunity or a continuum building on existing success.  I can envisage a situation under the new system where people who attain craft qualifications would progress, for example, to certificate or diploma level in the regional technical colleges and go on to degree level in the regional technical colleges or universities.  In my faculty of commerce, not that I particularly want to plug it, we now have a well established transfer system for certificate holders in business <Col N="1190" /> studies from the regional technical colleges who can get exemption from first year commerce and transfer into second year.  I am glad to say that those students who have transferred from the regional technical colleges into second commerce continue to do very well in the B.Comm. degree and go on to do masters degrees if they wish.</P>
    <P>There is another dimension to this progression: where public funds are invested in educational institutions, there is a duty on such publicly supported institutions to assist with access and progression and to provide opportunities for those who are relatively disadvantaged.  We all know they must reach a particular standard in order to make these transfers which must remain in place.</P>
    <P>In the Oireachtas committee, we found that we do not have a skills shortage <i>per se</i> but a skills deficiency.  Craftsmen here have a lower level of skill than their counterparts in Europe.  To compete internationally we must close the gap if we are to be as good as our competitors and to win much needed exports.  The whole thrust of what the Minister said has to do with lifting skill levels to international standards, not only to compete but to cope with the additional pressures of the Single Market.  The general view is that we do not have a skills shortage at present but if we do not act now we will have one by the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Employers have a particular duty and need to be convinced of the added value of improved skills as a contribution to the output and quality of their production and to view training as an investment in human resources which will benefit results as opposed to being a cost.  There is a national contribution in that sense. As the Minister said, there is a vision in Germany that by doing a good job in one's industry one contributes to the national cake.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.  I urge employers to adopt that voluntary code of practice as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill. I am glad the Minister tried to broaden <Col N="1191" /> it beyond the narrow financial aspects. She has done an excellent job.</P>
      <P>One of the most important aspects of this Bill is the fact that it is raising the status of the apprentice.  I am old enough to remember when an apprenticeship was a sought after and highly valued job. However, in recent years many apprenticeships have slipped badly from the training point of view and quite a number of apprentices felt that, although they were lucky to be in a job, they were being unfairly exploited.</P>
      <P>It was essential to put the emphasis on certification.  From a national and international point of view, it is essential for people to receive a piece of paper at the end of their training course.  Nothing is regarded as relevant now unless one can produce a piece of paper to show that one successfully completed a training course. Many apprentices who were quick witted enough to know that got City and Guilds certification which gave them an edge on the national and international market.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrelly referred to fairness in recruitment.  While I am sure the Minister has been wise in leaving a two year lead-in time for private employers because it is these, after all, who will take in these apprentices, that will have to be very carefully monitored.  As we all know, the most important factor can be who one knows.  I can understand, in a way, how this happens because it is a personal thing to take someone into a firm, particularly a small one, and naturally a recommendation from someone one knows or who is already working in the firm is extremely important.  On the other hand, it is extremely hard on young people who are from disadvantaged areas, perhaps, with other members of their family unemployed, to manage to get one of these apprenticeships.  The Minister will have to be kind but firm in a couple of years time when this legislation is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the education system, Senator Farrelly rightly talked about the lack of study of vocational subjects in recent years.  I ask the Minister to ask the Minister for Education to have leaflets <Col N="1192" /> prepared in her Department telling parents about these new apprenticeship schemes because many parents will not know they exist or their value.  The Minister could begin with the career guidance counsellors in the schools but she will also have to reach parents.  In some areas, apprenticeships have got a bad name in that apprentices were used for a number of years and got nothing at the end of it. This urgently needs to be rectified and the Department of Education must contribute.</P>
    <P>The quotas for women were mentioned earlier and this was strongly addressed by the Commission on the Status of Women who said that unless women got into areas of employment which were predominantly male we would never see an increase in the income levels for women. There has not been an improvement in this area; the average industrial wage for women is still 70 per cent of that for men. I heard on the radio this morning that the hourly rate for women is only 80 per cent of that for men.  A good deal of monitoring will have to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>It was not clear to me from the Bill if discrimination against women getting apprenticeships could be taken up with the Employment Equality Agency.  I was not sure if these apprenticeships would be covered by the agency and I would like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>Positive policies will have to be implemented to get women into some of the more traditional male areas and I urge the Minister to do this.  It would also be a good idea to set targets, such as having women in 10 per cent of apprenticeships in traditionally male areas. There should also be a substantial number of women on the boards monitoring these targets.  The target of 40 per cent women on State boards set by the Government has run into difficulties, but it is important that there be a large number of women on the assessment boards.  The unions should also be involved to ensure they play their role. To date they have not actively encouraged the promotion of women in traditionally <Col N="1193" /> male areas and I ask the Minister to get them involved.</P>
    <P>Another important issue in the involvement of women in any area of employment is the lack of child care facilities.  The Minister has always been enthusiastic about the provision of child care.  I speak as president of Cherish, which encourages young single mothers to become economically independent.  It is essential to get them into courses like this, but if they are to be enormously financially disadvantaged by trying to become economically independent, there is little to urge them to become involved in apprenticeships.  The State has to be involved in this area because most of the employment opportunities will be in firms which will be too small to provide child care facilities.  Women constantly have to reconcile domestic and work responsibilities.  It would also be important in the context of encouraging mature women with families to re-enter the work force and get involved in skilled crafts. There are already many women employed in the printing industry but not in the higher levels.  It is important that the Minister consider child care for these women.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear more from the Minister on disabled persons.  A large effort was made to get disabled persons into mainstream employment and these apprenticeships could be very important. It is difficult, but again we could set a target for the number of apprentices being filled by various disabled groups. The forum for disabled people would be willing to help.  As the Minister knows, it has not been difficult to get disabled people involved in employment in the State sector.  Many of them have been readily absorbed into the State sector. If they are given counselling and career guidance as to the areas where it would be best to apply, we could make major efforts there.</P>
    <P>We should also do something for prisoners. There are training facilities in the prisons at the moment.  Printing is one I am almost certain I saw in Mountjoy.  I have great admiration for the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. John Lonergan. <Col N="1194" /> I am sure he would pay the levy if it would help those in prison training programmes to get involved in apprenticeship schemes.  The Minister could introduce a system whereby prisoners could start their apprenticeship in printing or another craft in prison and when they are released be placed at third or fourth year level of their apprenticeship in a firm outside.  There is little training available in prisons, but this would be a concrete effort to make this training useful.  The prisoners could see themselves making progress towards a certificate. If they are able to do courses with the Open University, I hope we could organise it so that they could work towards their apprenticeship as well.</P>
    <P>The State and semi-State agencies are in a position to take in trainees and apprentices, for example, in the health boards, the ESB and the local authorities. The Minister should encourage them to be in the vanguard of all improvements because she will be in a better position to monitor them.  I warmly welcome the approach the Minister has taken.  I would like to see targets set and some form of monitoring of these targets put in place.  It is easy for us to establish excellent schemes and in ten years time look at them and find with great disappointment that not as much has been done as one would have hoped or expected.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this Bill.  For many years we have heard much about the collection of levies. This is the correct approach to take in the present situation.  The Minister mentioned that we are behind other countries in the area of training apprentices.  This is the first time we have addressed the situation in other EU countries.  The Minister mentioned Germany, for instance.  We are starting to recognise that we have lagged behind for many years and for once we are approaching the situation in an organised manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the craft certificate.  Politicians receive many representations about the lack of recognition for craftspersons. <Col N="1195" /> People mention to me that their sons have done various courses but that there is no reasonable recognition of the work they have done.  When they look for employment they have nothing to show that they have benefited from a training scheme.</P>
    <P>One hears much hype about recruitment, but there is a feeling that there is a lack of fair play in certain areas.  As the Minister rightly stated, it is sometimes who one knows and not what one knows that matters.  We have to work to eliminate this.  With regard to the age profile of people looking for jobs, the person approaching 40 or 50 years of age does not want to think they are out of the job market.  It can become very depressing for such people and we have to ensure we do not discriminate against these people in the area of recruitment.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned small operations, which is an area about which I am concerned.  I have seen employers take on people from FÁS and other schemes and they have used it as an opportunity to make older workers redundant.  This has happened in a number of firms.  As a trade unionist I have had to work against it on a number of occasions to ensure that employers do not step out of line. People give 15 or 16 years to a firm and are regarded as being old because they are approaching 45 or 50 years of age and are possibly unable to do the job as quickly as a young person who is in the firm six months.  Redundancy is offered to the older person and the young person who started on a scheme is kept on.  I hope that type of thing will not happen.</P>
    <P>We must seriously examine the compulsory element in this.  It is not right that people should say they are not interested and are going to opt out.  The State is making a substantial investment of £30 million in the training and apprenticeship scheme and there must be some accountability. I accept that after what could be regarded as a two year trial period, we are going to examine the scheme.  We must seriously examine this at the end of the day.  I am sure we will learn as we go along but it should not be ruled out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> Senator Farrelly mentioned local authority housing as an area in which apprenticeship schemes could be utilised.  Since house improvement grants were abolished people find it difficult to get the money to improve their homes.  When the elderly or the socially disadvantaged applied for these grants they first got an estimate but when the contractor was paid there was not much left to pay for the finishing touches.  If that work had been done by somebody in the community &mdash; a carpenter or somebody who had served his time in the building trade &mdash; it might not have cost so much.  This is another area we must examine.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned child minding and creches.  There are many people in the public service who bring their children to someone else's house each day to be looked after.  There is no revenue in this for the State.  We should utilise the services of well trained people, such as nurses and ancillary hospital staff.  Maybe a training scheme should be considered because if there were proper creches in each local authority area we could provide permanent employment and we would be collecting taxes which would benefit the State.  Child minding is one area where people could be trained to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>The disabled is another group for whom more should be done.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has addressed many issues to help the disabled and other groups get work within the public service.  ICTU are doing a great deal of work for the disabled as well under the quota system, and we should do as much as we can to see that these people are given help.  Many of them are excellent people who are not able to survive in that kind of a world because of their disability.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill. Since the Minister took over this portfolio things have begun to move in the area of apprenticeships and about time. For years we have been waiting for somebody to pull together a system that had failed but nothing was happening.  There <Col N="1197" /> was a lot of thought and discussion but nothing was happening.  The system of apprenticeships was killed by bureaucracy, and we all recognise that.  Companies which traditionally took on apprentices refused to do so because it was too expensive.  A huge burden was placed on companies who decided to take on apprentices and in the mid 1980s when the scheme was modernised &mdash; it needed to be modernised &mdash; companies stopped taking on apprentices.  It is now 1994 and this is the first indication we have that something fruitful is going to happen.  It is an absolute disgrace that nothing has happened until today.</P>
      <P>The Minister set out a programme last year and this Bill will push it one step further.  I congratulate the Minister for doing something that should have been done years ago but I have to criticise her predecessors who did nothing in the intervening years.  It was plain in 1988 that the system had failed.  The small employer who took on one apprentice every year stopped doing so.  Bigger employers and the multinational companies who did not have any shortage of money stopped or cut down their involvement in the apprenticeship scheme because of the administration and the administrative costs involved.  Because the system failed many families whose children traditionally became apprentices have suffered.  Parents harassed employers and paid whatever levies were asked of them if that would secure apprenticeships for their children. Youngsters I know decided to work as apprentices for nothing because they wanted to acquire a qualification.  That practice has been going on for too many years, and there was no response from the Department or the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to today's Bill we can look back and criticise and the criticism has to be accepted but that does not mean this legislation is a panacea for all those ills. It is not compulsory under this Bill for anyone to take on an apprentice and it should be.  If a company is employing four electricians, it should be compelled to take on at least one apprentice electrician; <Col N="1198" /> if it employs four plumbers, it should be compelled to take on one apprentice plumber.  We could make a very strong case for compulsion in this area because a company which needs the services of experts of this kind now will need them in the future as well.  We have to force them to provide for the needs of the future.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the German system is great because the people there have the interests of the country at heart; I do not believe a great sense of nationalism in Germany is bringing about a good apprenticeship system.  The management is doing it.  The Minister might consider making it compulsory for companies which use qualified people to take on a quota of apprentices to meet their future. We should at least discuss this; maybe we would reach a consensus on it.  The system has been a failure for the past seven or eight years so there must be a shortage of qualified people at present and I imagine many companies are employing unsuitable people.</P>
    <P>No matter what anybody says about the old apprenticeship scheme, people spent four years learning from somebody who knew their job.  There were faults and failings in the scheme which was used by many employers as cheap labour. Small builders used to carry an apprentice because an apprentice, who did not have to leave the job for 15 weeks each year, was useful; an apprentice did a day's work and did not cost a small builder much money.</P>
    <P>Small builders stopped taking on apprentices when it became too costly. The Minister has an opportunity now to start a new scheme and I suggest it will function best if she includes an element of compulsion.  Now that the levies have been reduced and the cost will be spread across all sectors of industry, the compulsion will not do any damage.  Encouragement is not enough.  There should be a compulsory element in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's response and to a good discussion on this Bill and on the scheme in general over the next couple of weeks.  I congratulate the Minister for doing something that <Col N="1199" /> should have been done years ago.  She has grasped the nettle and we will support her efforts to produce a good apprenticeship scheme.  The country needs it and it is up to us to ensure that the finished product will be a good one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which, as other speakers have said, has been a long time in gestation.  For many years there have been problems in the industrial area because of a lack of apprenticeships in certain industries and a reluctance by employers to take on apprentices in other industries.  Many of the problems in taking on apprentices occurred because there was a downturn in certain industries, particularly in the motor industry with which I am familiar. As a result of that there was no need for training in the short term and, on the other hand, there was no money to subsidise long term training or apprenticeships. In addition, when people took on apprentices they found that if they were not kept on in the bigger firms they went &ldquo;on their tools&rdquo; as it was called. They stuck the tools in the boot of the car and did the jobs for which they had been trained, which cost employers a lot of money.  A large number of these people have still not been brought in from the black economy.  Unless they are, there is no point in suggesting there will be anything but reluctance on behalf of certain trades to take on apprentices.  It has been too easy for these people to work without getting into the PAYE/PRSI system and because of that legitimate businesses have suffered immensely.  It is very necessary to bring these people into the PAYE/PRSI system as well as providing incentives to take on apprentices to secure the future of certain trades and industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the word &ldquo;levy&rdquo; appears in the title of a Bill, people look carefully at it and wonder if this is another imposition on what is considered by business to be the already high cost of taking on people. The less costs you have the better both businesses and apprentices will get on in the long term.  There have been criticisms <Col N="1200" /> that this new apprenticeship scheme will be employer-led, as if employers are bad boys and should not be praised.  If you do not have employers you cannot have apprentices and, let us be quite straight about it, if you do not have employers who are willing to take on apprentices this Bill is going to fail.  People who criticise employers should think twice because without them there would be no need for apprentices in the first place.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that in the past there has been an insularity or an incestuous relationship between employers and those they take on, such as friends of friends, sons of friends or daughters of friends.  One must be careful before one criticises on that basis, because if you know the background of somebody who is coming to work for you there is a better chance of a good relationship between you and the apprentice or employee. That does not mean that there should not be a relationship between FÁS or the training operator and the employer, but it has to be on a two-way basis.  It would be absolutely impossible to run an apprenticeship scheme if an employer was forced to take on an apprentice whom he felt would not fit in.  The relationship between apprentices and the master or employer must be nurtured and protected.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see people go overboard and suggest that there has to be an absolutely open competition for apprenticeships because it just would not work. First impressions are often best, although that is not always so.  In many cases, however, if an employer feels that the person is being imposed on them as an apprentice, the relationship between them could break down and you would end up with a bad apprenticeship scheme for that person.  I would like to see if there is some way of marrying the goals of FÁS and the employers to ensure that square pegs will not go into round holes. This is an extremely necessary element.</P>
    <P>The changes being made to bring people into apprenticeship schemes which gear them towards technical and practical educational standards are good. In the past long apprenticeships did <Col N="1201" /> nothing for the apprentice in many cases, although there was a certain amount of floor sweeping and cleaning up in the first year which introduced discipline to the training scheme.  In the past also much of the training was done on a practical level with the material or job of the day.  No forward training was involved and so no skills were learned for the future.  Such people were being trained in the technology of the day but received no educational training to transfer to the next phase of technology.  It is essential to have a system where technical skills are learned along with the educational skills required to advance to the next phase of technology.</P>
    <P>The small number of female apprentices was mentioned.  That goes back to the reluctance of parents &mdash; not only in regard to apprenticeships but also to semi-skilled or unskilled work &mdash; to allow their children to work in a factory. People, especially in rural areas, thought for some reason that factory work was something to be looked down on.  This attitude was allied to the social mores of an area rather than the fact that there was anything wrong with factory work. The old image of the Industrial Revolution-style factory with muck and dirt all over the place has changed dramatically and modern industrial units are a pleasure to work in.</P>
    <P>We must have more contact with smaller industries.  In official circles, particularly in FÁS, small industries are thought of as employing from 50 to 250 people whereas 90 per cent of jobs in this country are provided by companies with ten employees or fewer.  The very small employer has to be taken into account. In a sense there was a contradiction in some of the contributions, because people complained about past standards in vocational schools.  It must be said that vocational schools did a tremendous job of producing well trained apprentices in the past, in association with the big central training schools.  I would like to thank the TUI and the vocational schools for what they have done in the past.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government's main priority is the creation of more jobs.  In this respect the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> does not stand alone.  We have also clearly expressed this aim in the Programme for a Partnership Government, in our approach to the National Development Plan and in the 1994 Budget. Indeed, the continuous process of change evident in so many aspects of today's society is embodied in the spirit of the new programme.  I will begin by referring to the economic background against which the programme was negotiated and in this context reflect briefly on prospects for 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospects for the Irish economy are improving significantly.  I expect GDP growth of at least 4 per cent, a rate which, when compared with the forecast for the European Union as a whole of about 1.25 per cent, is a healthy prospect.  Allowing for the tax and other changes which I announced in the budget, real personal disposable incomes are likely to increase by over 3 per cent.  Assuming some reduction in the savings ratio, which is currently at a high level in response to lower interest rates and greater confidence, there should be a strong recovery in the volume of consumer spending. Investment activity should also pick up this year as interest rates remain low and as the building related increase of over £120 million in public capital spending which I outlined in this year's budget takes effect.  This represents a very substantial boost to building activity and to jobs in this sector.  It should lead to an increase in the volume of building investment this year of at least 5 per cent, with <Col N="1203" /> total investment activity expanding in volume terms by about 3.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>With the outlook improving in some of our key trading partners, industrial exports should grow by over 7 per cent in volume this year.  As in previous years, the increase in exports will exceed the growth in Ireland's export markets. Although import growth is expected to pick up and the deficit on invisibles may widen, the balance of payments surplus should remain in the region of 6.25 per cent of GNP.  Despite recent successes in increasing the share of foreign markets, complacency must not creep in.  We must continue to make further gains through improved competitiveness and through improving our marketing strategies.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will greatly assist Ireland's competitiveness position.  I will return to this later.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement and the general Government deficit in 1994 &mdash; at 2.7 per cent of GNP and GDP respectively &mdash; will again be very low by international standards.  While our national debt to GNP ratio remains very high, it will resume the downward trend which was temporarily interrupted by the devaluation of the Irish púnt last year. Further progress in reducing the burden of the national debt has been recognised by the social partners as a key issue to inform fiscal policy on which implementation of the measures outlined in the programme depends.  Continued pursuit of these fundamental goals should also help to keep interest rates low and to enhance confidence of domestic and foreign investors alike in the sensible manner in which we are continuing to manage the economy.</P>
    <P>The recently published labour force survey for April 1993 confirmed what I had been saying last year: that the information available to me from tax and PRSI receipts indicated that the employment growth which I had predicted in last year's budget was holding up well.  While employment actually declined in every other European Union country except Luxembourg, the labour force survey <Col N="1204" /> results show that in the year to April last employment here grew by 7,000.  Taking account of the long run decline in the number engaged in agriculture, non-agricultural employment rose by about 16,000 or about 1.5 per cent.  At the very least, it can be said that we are converting output growth into worthwhile progress on employment, which has been the ultimate objective of policy in recent years. This year we can expect to see non-agricultural employment growth of about 24,000 which, after allowing for some emigration, should permit a modest fall of 5,000 in average registered unemployment this year.</P>
    <P>The proposed pay arrangements for the period of the programme are set out in the draft pay agreement which forms part of the document.  In the lead up to the pay negotiations the Government made it clear that any new agreement would have to address two important issues: employment needs and fiscal discipline. The Government considered that the broad thrust had to concentrate on improving competitiveness through pay moderation and on aiming for a settlement at a level which would enable resources to be allocated to employment creation policies.  I am happy that the draft pay agreement which has emerged satisfies these aims.  I will now comment on the main features of the new agreement.</P>
    <P>The pay agreement covers a period of three years and provides for general increases totalling 8 per cent over that period.  However, due to the arrangements for phasing in of these increases, the overall cost will be 7.5 per cent over the three years.  There is a provision for floor increases of £3.50 per week in both the second and third phases to protect the incomes of lower paid workers.  Modifications to the proposed agreement have been agreed for the public service and the construction industry to take account of their particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>The special arrangements in the public service are designed to ensure that &mdash; in cost terms &mdash; pay increases in the public service over the three year programme and the cost in the first year will be the <Col N="1205" /> same as those applying in the private sector.  The public service agreement is for three and a half years with general increases totalling 8 per cent.  The starting date in the public service is five months later than in the private sector, other than in the construction industry where there is also a five month pay pause.  Floor increases of £2.80, £2.10 and £2.10 per week respectively are provided for in the second, third and fourth phases to meet the needs of lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>The later starting date I referred to earlier, combined with the staggered starting dates proposed in the public service, are designed to provide the necessary space for dealing with outstanding claims or unfinished business under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Negotiations on this unfinished business will entail agreement on flexibility, improvements in efficiency and effectiveness and other offsetting measures, and the outcome of any claims will be implemented in four phases over the lifetime of the agreement as it applies to the public service; that is, three and a half years.</P>
    <P>There has been much loose talk about the special arrangements for the public service which I wish to dispel.  I wish, in particular, to say a few words about the handling of &ldquo;unfinished business&rdquo; in the public sector lest there be any confusion about these arrangements.  First, during the currency of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pay agreement many private sector employments concluded settlements with their workers under the terms of the local bargaining clause, clause 3, which applied from the second year of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for them.  Secondly, public service workers were specifically debarred under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> from making claims under clause 3 until the third year of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement; that is, starting from 1 January 1993.  Thirdly, while practically all groups of public service workers did lodge claims last year, only a very small minority succeeded in having the processing <Col N="1206" /> of their claims concluded before the expiry of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I am pleased that the terms of the agreement as it applies in the public service provide the necessary space to conclude negotiations on the outstanding claims within the cost parameters of the overall agreement in parallel with developments in the private sector.  The arrangements for unfinished business will entail the processing of outstanding claims in one of two ways &mdash; option A or option B as they are known.</P>
    <P>Under option A it will be open to the groups concerned to pursue their outstanding claims on what has come to be known as a restructuring basis: that is, a basis which involves meaningful negotiations on changes in overall structures or work practices or existing conditions. Under this option it is expected that these issues will be brought to a conclusion, including the timetable for implementation, by mutual agreement.  The taking of industrial action is expressly ruled out. Any such agreement must have regard to the needs for flexibility and change and the contribution to be made by employees to such change and must result in savings and in improved quality of service.  These are the criteria by which such negotiations will be judged.</P>
    <P>Under option B, which is an alternative to option A, each group may pursue a single cost increasing claim for an amount not exceeding 3 per cent of the basic pay cost of the group concerned in accordance with normal industrial relations procedures, including adjudication.  Negotiations in such cases must also take into account the need for efficiency, change and the contribution to be made by employees to such change.  In such cases, the draft agreement provides that the outcomes must be implemented in four instalments on 1 April 1994, 1 June 1995, 1 June 1996 and 1 June 1997.</P>
    <P>By any standard, an agreement which limits the outcomes of negotiations on outstanding claims for special improvements in pay or conditions of public servants to 3 per cent over three and a half years is a reflection of the genuine <Col N="1207" /> concern of the social partners for the special needs of the economy at this time, that is, the need to ensure that public servants play a real part in improving competitiveness, expressed in their case in the price or cost of the vital services they provide and in the efficiency and effectiveness of service provision.  While option A &mdash; the restructuring approach &mdash; permits the conclusion of agreements which may marginally exceed the 3 per cent figure, I am confident that the results, to be measured in the form of improved quality of service to the public, efficiency and effectiveness, will be judged to be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer specifically to the special agreement reached on the amount of 1 per cent which has been agreed for payment on 1 April next.  The agreement emphasises the full commitment of the Government and congress to approach the negotiations on our unfinished business on the basis that real changes involving savings and improvements in effectiveness and efficiency will be achieved.  In that context, and in that context only, the draft agreement provides for a payment of 1 per cent from 1 April next to groups whose <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> claims have not yet been processed to finality.</P>
    <P>As to how this will operate, the intention is that for each group of employees, their outstanding claims will be discussed and arrangements for processing them, on the basis of the options set out in the agreement, will be settled.  When that has been done, an amount of 1 per cent of the basic pay of the group concerned from 1 April of this year will be available either for payment then, if the group concerned so desires, or for use in any subsequent negotiations.  While the payment is available to every group pursuing an outstanding claim under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, it must be offset against the outcome of the subsequent negotiations.</P>
    <P>A significant feature of the draft pay agreement is that it debars the making or processing of any further claims during its currency both in the private and public <Col N="1208" /> sectors.  This will provide a period of certainty for both private and public sector employees concerning pay trends over the next few years and will contribute to the improvement of our wage competitiveness which, as I have already mentioned, is central to employment growth.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is an industrial peace clause which commits employers, trade unions and employees to promoting industrial harmony and continuing to resolve differences through the available industrial relations machinery, thus helping to achieve a high degree of stability in industrial relations during the period of the agreement.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, increases in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill well in excess of the rate of inflation, which has become the norm in recent years, cannot be continued indefinitely.  It has recently become necessary to critically appraise the whole system of public service pay determination and to devise a more appropriate system which better reflects the economic realities of life in Ireland in the 1990s and is seen to effect an improvement in the quality and cost effectiveness of our public services.  In the new programme, the Government and congress have reiterated their commitment to having changes made in the public service pay determination machinery. Discussions will be concluded shortly with a view to having new arrangements in place at an early date, hopefully by the target date of 31 March this year.</P>
    <P>The cost of pay increases in the public service over the period of the programme will increase the Exchequer pay and pensions bill by an estimated 2 per cent in 1994, 2.7 per cent in 1995 and 2.8 per cent in 1996.  There will also be a carry over of costs into 1997, arising from the special phasing of the public service increases, but this will be accommodated by the extension of the term of the public services agreement by six months to 30 June 1997.  It is a source of considerable satisfaction to the Government that the overall increases in the agreement in both the public and private sectors are generally in line with projected inflation over <Col N="1209" /> the period of the programme and are set at such a moderate rate.</P>
    <P>Over the past six years of centralised pay bargaining based on the consensus approach, our competitiveness, as measured in terms of hourly manufacturing earnings in common currency, is estimated to have increased against our main trading partners as a group, with even stronger gains being achieved relative to the United Kingdom.  The pay terms of the new agreement provide an opportunity to make further headway. The increases agreed between the parties to the new programme are in line with expected low inflation over its three year lifetime and can therefore be regarded as being moderate.  Furthermore, the basic pay increases are lower than those expected among our main trading partners as a whole.</P>
    <P>This does not mean we can relax our efforts.  The rate of pay increase in our main trading partners has been slowing for some years now, reflecting among other things the impact of recession.  The margin between gains or losses in competitiveness is narrow.  For example, because the last phase of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was not implemented by all employees on 1 January 1993 but instead, in accordance with local arrangements, was paid throughout that year, a carryover of this phase from 1993 will add to pay cost increases in 1994 in the public sector. Consequently, there may be little or no gains in competitiveness in 1994.  The reductions in employers' PRSI for the low paid which I announced in last January's budget will, however, contribute to a positive employment outcome not only in 1994 but in the following years.</P>
    <P>Competitive gains are expected in both 1995 and 1996 arising from the pay terms of the new programme.  This prospect depends on strict adherence to these terms.  Given the vulnerability of so many thousands of Irish jobs to price competition, particularly from the United Kingdom, we cannot afford to drift from the pay terms agreed by the parties to the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> The moderate pay terms proposed in the draft agreement provide the necessary certainty on wage costs to facilitate business planning over the next three years.  This must give Irish industry a considerable edge in this regard over our international competitors.  Furthermore, the good industrial relations resulting from the consensus first attained under the Programme for National Recovery, continued under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and now proposed under the new programme will continue to provide a stable industrial relations climate favourable to employment growth over the next three years.</P>
    <P>All of my colleagues on ECOFIN would dearly love to have such a climate. There are major strikes taking place in approximately two thirds of European countries.  We did not want to talk about our industrial relations climate in the past.  If we examine the figures over the last three years, we can feel proud of our position when compared to the major strikes taking place in Germany, France and the Netherlands.  All the social partners should be credited for creating this climate.</P>
    <P>Theo Vidal recently said that one can have figures that look good but if several million working days are lost through strikes &mdash; as we had for many decades &mdash; one is losing competitiveness and productivity. Some commentators dismiss this as a factor.  Obviously one must allow for the fact that they were either not aware of our industrial relations climate in the past or are seeking to ignore it. Those who know what bad industrial relations can do would be wise to take into account the cost benefits accruing from such an agreement.  To leave it out of the equation is similar to losing three days of a working week.  It makes no sense at all.  It amuses me to hear some people say this.  I suppose they will explain themselves eventually, but maybe they will never have to.</P>
    <P>The new programme spells out the aspirations of the Government and the social partners in relation to public services for the duration of the programme. These aspirations must be seen in the <Col N="1211" /> context of a need for significantly greater restraint on public expenditure than has existed for the past three years, particularly in relation to current expenditure. All the undertakings in the programme are subject to this requirement.  The areas where the most significant developments are to take place are employment generation, an area-based response to the problem of social exclusion, in agriculture and education.</P>
    <P>With regard to what has been said about the National Development Plan, I would like to explain again the present position.  Discussions are currently underway with the European Commission on the National Development Plan covering the period from now until the end of 1999 with a view to agreeing the Community support framework which will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies for the use of EU Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The system works as follows.  The national authorities decide the development strategy and, on the basis of this, put forward their proposals for expenditure in the structural area, including the use of Structural Funds and domestic resources in the development plan.  This plan is then discussed with the European Commission and on foot of those discussions the Community support framework is agreed.  The Community support framework will set out <i>inter alia</i> the development objectives, the priorities adopted for Community assistance and the indicative financing plan.  Following the adoption of the CSF the operational programmes are approved and these set out in more detail the objectives and measures for each of the main sectors. The programmes are the logical and the legal basis for the commitment of EU aid.</P>
    <P>In addition to expenditure proposals which will be aided under the Community support framework, our plan includes investments to be aided by the Cohesion Fund, to be aided under the Structural Funds Community initiatives programmes and the EFTA Cohesion Fund for the period.  These are governed by <Col N="1212" /> different administrative procedures from the CSF and are not part of the current negotiations.  The plan also includes eligible national structural expenditure not proposed for European aid and 1993 expenditure, including 1993 expenditure of European aid.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate that the Government is confident that it will prove possible to draw down the full EU aid projected in the national plan over the six year period up to 1999.  Our overriding economic and social objective is to resolve our critical unemployment situation.  This has been confirmed in the most positive way possible in the new programme.  Ensuring that taxation policy is pro employment is, therefore, essential.  This means continuing the process of tax reform now underway for a number of years, aimed in particular at increasing the rewards and incentives for working and reducing the costs of employing workers.</P>
    <P>This year's budget, which complements the new programme, made significant steps in implementing our taxation strategy.  It was specifically aimed at lightening the tax burden on earned income.  As well as abolishing the temporary 1 per cent income levy, the budget provided for substantial increases in the basic personal allowances and in the standard rate tax bands.  These measures will afford relief to all income taxpayers, including those on relatively low incomes.</P>
    <P>Moreover, additional measures targeted directly at assisting the low paid were also introduced.  Tax reform inevitably involves choices and trade-offs and we must recognise that it is not simply a matter of reliefs.  In the income tax and PRSI codes focusing reliefs and reductions on the lower paid inevitably involves some clawback elsewhere in the tax code.  It was necessary, for example, to look to the areas of excise and the RPT for some of the funds and we feel quite justified in doing so.  Without these trade-offs the real benefits of restructuring our tax and PRSI systems could not be realised.</P>
    <P>The central review committee, which has operated successfully during the lifetime <Col N="1213" /> of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, will continue to monitor the achievements of the targets and objectives of this new programme.  In order to effectively carry out this role the committee will oversee the development of effective regular measures to monitor the numbers at work and to undertake such analysis and review of domestic and international issues as it considers appropriate in order to identify further action in support of work.</P>
    <P>The new programme has a specific focus &mdash; tackling the unemployment crisis, a concern which is shared by the whole community.  The measures outlined in the new programme coupled with the complementary policies in the National Development Plan, the Programme for a Partnership Government and this year's budget, demonstrate the Government's total commitment to resolving this problem.  We must ensure that the policies in the programme designed to maintain and improve competitiveness and to increase growth are translated into real jobs.  That must be the main aim we must try to achieve.</P>
    <P>In 1987 we set ourselves the task of working on the ICTU report from the autumn of 1986 dealing with the jobs crisis.  That was the forerunner to the Government setting out in March 1987 to negotiate the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, which proved to change radically the country's finances.  The position then was that we had an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 13 per cent of GNP and we had so many difficulties in the economy they seemed insurmountable. With this programme we are now looking at an EBR of 2.5 per cent, 2.5 per cent inflation, pay increases at 2.5 per cent and a growth rate of 4 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I look at this document with interest.  This is the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the last few pages of the document contain the annexes dealing with agreements on pay and conditions, public service pay and co-operation at the level of enterprise. The Minister has informed us of and reiterated the Government's position regarding the programme, but I have no doubt that in real terms this programme is about pay.</P>
      <P>If the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is to reach the same pinnacles as its much vaunted predecessor the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, then we really are in trouble.  Let us look at the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and what was achieved.  The Minister spent a little time telling us about it before he finished his address.  There are 95,000 more people out of work, a 40 per cent increase, and the Minister hails it as one of the best things that ever happened the State. There were 40,000 more young people forced to leave our shores because our Government failed in its duty to provide them with a job and with hope to stay here.  More and more tax is being taken from the pay of those dwindling numbers fortunate enough to have jobs and to be able to afford to stay in Ireland.  We should remember that with this year's budget the Minister will collect £667 million from the people.  In the last month, although nobody realises it yet, petrol prices have increased by 9p per gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, to the House. I am disappointed the Minister for Finance is not here to hear the views of the main Opposition party in the Seanad and the main speakers in the debate.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> follows the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> left 95,000 more people out of work, which represents a 40 per cent increase, and 40,000 more young people were forced to leave our shores because our Government failed in its duty to provide them with work.  More taxes are taken from the pay packets of those dwindling numbers fortunate enough to have jobs and to be able to afford to stay in Ireland. That is the sad record the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> leaves behind and I am not sorry it has gone. Unfortunately, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is set to take its place.</P>
      <P>In common with its predecessor it was agreed in negotiations between those who are economically and politically powerful in the State.  It has been brought into existence at the expense of consumers, the owners of small businesses, those in vulnerable private sector employment, school leavers and other first time job seekers.  It also enshrines an economic doctrine which is fundamentally flawed.  According to the wise men who drew it up, it dictates that there should be equality of treatment between the private and public sectors.  That means that those employed in secure jobs in the public service should receive the same and sometimes more pay as those exposed to the fierce winds of joblessness, redundancies and company closures.  This is most inequitable as it gives more to those with no job fears while taking that money from the taxes of those who everyday face the desperate prospect of the dole queue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> There might be some argument for this if it was lower paid civil servants who were benefiting, although they do have job security.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> secretaries of Government Departments received an increase of 101 per cent, while clerical assistants and similar grades received only 36 per cent from a lower salary base. That is injustice on top of inequity.</P>
    <P>Lest I be misunderstood, every employee, whether public or private, should receive a just salary for his or her efforts.  When times are good they should receive the biggest pay increases possible. However, times are not good. Unemployment is hovering near the 300,000 mark and the Government has no feasible policy to reduce it.  The western bishops can testify to that, as they have asked the Government to formulate such a policy.</P>
    <P>On top of these problems, the Government has only two words in its policy vocabulary; &ldquo;spend&rdquo; and &ldquo;tax&rdquo;.  The proof is in this year's budget in which a further £667 million in tax is to be collected from the Irish people.  Does the Government not realise people are sick, sore and tired of too much tax?  Does it not know that this burden of taxation stifles all initiative and enterprise?</P>
    <P>This new programme will add to that burden.  Employers in industry will be forced to pay increases they cannot afford.  That will cause more companies to go to the wall, which means more unemployment benefit for the former employees and more taxes to pay for that. There is also the bill for public sector increases.</P>
    <P>The grandly named <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will live up to its title in some respects at least.  It will create competitiveness among the hundreds of thousands of people who will have to queue for job interviews.  They will have to compete with their friends and peers in an unseemly scramble to find work.  It will also create competitiveness among those unfortunates who will have to join the dole queues to get unemployment assistance.  It will create work for social welfare and tax officials, who <Col N="1217" /> will be busier than ever coping with the toll of human misery it will create and collecting the extra taxes to pay for its justification.</P>
    <P>This is another sad reflection on a Government which promised the earth at the polls and has delivered nothing in performance.  This programme is built on the £8 billion provided for in the national plan.  During the negotiations with the EU on the plan at a summit meeting in December 1992, the Taoiseach said the financial package for the plan had been agreed.  Shortly after Mr. Delors from the EU Commission totally denied this declaration.</P>
    <P>Since then the following statements have been made.  They should be noted because the plan will play a major part in the payments under the PCW.  In December of 1992 the Taoiseach informed us that £8 billion over seven years had been secured.  In May and June of 1993 the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste promised to use the veto if Ireland did not receive that sum.  On 20 July 1993 the Tánaiste announced agreement for £7.84 billion over seven years.  We were never informed that the figure for 1993 of £1.1 billion, which had been negotiated by the former Taoiseach as part of the previous plan, was included in the figure of £7.84 billion.</P>
    <P>On 1 October last the EU Commission announced the allocation of £7.2 billion over the period.  That also included the £1.1 billion, so the figure was really £6.1 billion.  In October, November and December of 1993, the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Government continually claimed the draw down from Structural Funds would be £8 billion because of the quality of the programme.  On 23 November in this House the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, denied the need to adjust the plan to take account of the £7.2 billion figure.</P>

      <P>On 18 February the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, abused a senior official and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, denied there was any problem with the plan.  The Taoiseach said in the Dáil that no new plan was required.  On 1 March the Tánaiste admitted on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the plan would have to be adjusted, with some programmes being dropped.  Those are the facts which relate to the overall thrust of the agreement with the social partners.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the proposal was dealt with causes concern.  The situation is serious and reports from our MEPs indicate they fear it has done serious damage to Ireland's relationship with Brussels.  It is right and proper, considering what was said over the period of months, that the Taoiseach should apologise to the President of the EU Commission about the way this affair was handled.  It has done nothing for our reputation in Europe, which was excellent and built up over the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the budget and its importance, given the way matters have developed since 1987.  He said that the GNP borrowing requirement at the time was 13.3 per cent.  I was in the Lower House for the four years previous to that &mdash; I am delighted that Senator O'Kennedy has arrived because he was there too as Opposition spokesperson on Finance &mdash; and the then Government could do nothing right as far as the Opposition was concerned.  However, the fact is that when we took office interest rates and inflation were at 22 per cent.  By the time that Government left office, even though the GNP requirement was 13.3 per cent, interest rates and inflation had to be <Col N="1219" /> brought under control before any decisions or spending in real terms could be reversed.  I recall the Opposition saying that if inflation was reduced, it would do nothing for the overall progress of the country.  However, until such time as inflation was substantially reduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was no credit given for the work that was done.  The party of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, was with us in trying to carry out that task.  This is what made it possible to do the things that were done at the time, and it was supported by the main Opposition party even though it was unpopular.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the decision in this year's budget, which has much to do with this programme, to abolish the 1 per cent income levy.  It should never have been introduced in the first place.  It was a further tax on work, which amounted in real terms to 2 per cent.  The disastrous probate tax was also introduced last year.  In 1973 the Government abolished death duties.  I attended a meeting last night and I had five questions about probate tax from people who were concerned for others who are elderly. The fear in relation to these policies is that they are introduced one year and changes then have to be made in the following budget because they were a huge mistake.  The Minister hailed the great changes that were made, but the measures should not have been introduced or supported by the Labour Party in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told the House that the actual unemployment figures will drop insignificantly this year and over the next number of years.  Given the changes that must be made to the National Development <Col N="1220" /> Plan &mdash; a plan which the powers that be did not even consider worth its while to show to the Members of Parliament before it was sent to Europe, for the obvious reason that the money was not there at all &mdash; we must be told soon of the schemes the Tánaiste talked about on 1 March on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that will have to be dropped and the effect this will have on employment and the work that will not be done as a result. We should be informed of this constituency by constituency or county by county.  We want to know whether programmes which have been announced will go ahead over the period of the plan. Nobody wants major increases in taxation to make up for the inaccuracy of the proposed plan that was sent to Brussels. The Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy E. Fitzgerald, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have all said that the plan will go ahead as proposed and that the shortfall will be made up from the national reserve.  Taxpayers are essentially the national reserve; if that is to be the case, the people should be informed now of what it will cost to implement the plan in full, although I do not think it can be implemented in full.</P>
    <P>In relation to the figures in the plan, the Taoiseach said that if we aimed low, we would have ended up low.  Given that approach, he must have spent Saturday nights watching Mike Murphy's programme, where people &ldquo;shoot for the stars&rdquo;, before the plan went to Brussels. It seems as if he continued shooting for the stars despite the negotiations, at which a different figure was agreed.  The figure is substantial and nobody is complaining about it.  However, people are complaining about the hype over the £2 billion extra that we will not receive.  The people of Ireland are not entitled to be misled in that way.  There is no reason why after the negotiations, where we got £6.2 billion to be spent over a seven year period, we could not have made the best of it, produced a plan and put it to work.</P>
    <P>The Minister has hailed this programme as one of the best things that has ever happened.  The various annexes, <Col N="1221" /> which deal with pay, sum it up.  This is what this programme is about.  The National Development Plan was the cornerstone of the programme and it has fallen apart.  The Minister again said today that we will draw down all the funds.  If that is the amount of funds required for the implementation of the plan, the Minister and the Government should state what amount of money will have to be collected from taxpayers to fulfil the Cabinet's dreams in this regard.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to vigorously support this motion. Work and competitiveness are inextricably interlinked.  Until we achieved a competitive environment <i>vis-a-vis</i> our main trading partners in Europe, the prospects of maintaining existing employment, much less of increasing it &mdash; although that is now happening &mdash; would not have been realisable.  It is important to recognise that we learn from our experience and mistakes and that we apply the lessons vigorously and effectively in the interests of the overall economy. This in effect is in the interests of workers and, more importantly, of those awaiting employment.  There were lessons to be learned.  I acknowledge that I was among those who were happy to see those lessons learned and applied when we came back into Government in 1987.</P>
      <P>At present, growth in GDP is 4 per cent, a level for which we had to continually aim.  The European average is 1.25 per cent.  It is well above the highest in the EU, which comprises our main trading partners and competitors.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement of 2.7 per cent of GNP is well below the level in Europe.  The inflation rate projection for this year is 2.5 per cent, slightly above the level for the last two years but well below the average in the EU; the same applies to interest rates.</P>
      <P>This achievement did not happen by magic or overnight.  The decisions which we took when we returned to Government in 1987 laid the foundation for the competitiveness which is now an essential element of the programme which I support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> It is important that we learn from our mistakes, and in this respect I regret that the Government, when I was Minister for Finance in 1980-81, was unable to adhere to the parameters that were set in the budget, especially in terms of public sector pay and special pay increases.  In this context I refer to the special pay increases that were subsequently demanded, and regrettably conceded, to teachers, gardaí, nurses and prison officers.  The consequence was a spiralling increase in public sector pay.  Those of us who returned to Government in 1987, and who had experienced the consequences of that concession, determined to ensure that from there on, irrespective of criticism from the Opposition, strong, effective decisions on all fronts would be taken, despite constant criticism in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>These decisions laid the basis for the sound economic condition in which this country now finds itself <i>vis-a-vis</i> its trading partners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that support as far as it went, and it was significant. Perhaps we were all learning at the time.  However, such support was not universal in the House and it was not consistent over that period.</P>
      <P>We must learn from our mistakes, and I hope our partners in Government today, the Labour Party, will learn from their mistakes and their traditional pattern of considering good Government as one which spends, and opposing any restriction or control on public expenditure as being a measure of an unconcerned and uncaring Government.</P>
      <P>The evidence suggests that both partners in Government are adhering to those strict, fiscal parameters which will lay the basis of competitiveness.  Any concession to this discipline will come back to haunt not only the Exchequer but those in employment, those seeking employment and especially our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest social democrat in Europe in recent times, Helmut Schmidt, former <Col N="1223" /> Chancellor of the German Federal Republic, whom I was privileged to know over a long number of years during my period on the General Council of Ministers and at the European Council, always claimed that the only guarantee workers and trade unions had was that of discipline.  Herr Schmidt believed, and I recall him saying this to the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch and myself on many occasions, that the important thing was that we would enter into binding commitments with the trade unions.  I am pleased to say that since 1987 these commitments have been an essential element of the success of the programme.</P>
    <P>The resulting discipline sought to ensure that there would be no more constant jumping, linkages, relativities and special claims.  In this respect I pay tribute to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, especially to the role played by congress when the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance in succession to Mr. MacSharry and the other Ministers responsible for the economy met congress and advised that we had to face realities together.  We advised that if we conceded on all the fronts where there were claims waiting to be paid, especially in the public service, we would all sink together.  I am happy to acknowledge that ICTU, under an enlightened leadership made a positive and disciplined response. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are evidence of that response.</P>
    <P>This is the programme that is being pursued at present.  I have some reservations as to whether our colleagues in Government would be capable of, much less enthusiastic for that kind of discipline, but I welcome the fact that the evidence now demonstrates that for them, as for all of us, there has been a belated recognition that security and competitiveness can only be achieved through the kind of control and discipline to which I have referred because external investment will not be attracted to a <Col N="1224" /> country where there is rampant inflation and spiralling interest rates.</P>
    <P>It is too easy for Deputies in their constituencies to complain that there is no investment when the reality is that the only basis on which investment will materialise is if foreign investors can see, not only in this year but in the years ahead, a secure base for the money they may invest in this economy.  If this is true for the external sector, it is even more so for the indigenous sector which must compete with conditions elsewhere.  The food industry, with which the Minister is involved, is competing with others on a wage cost criterion.  If our wage levels or demands are higher than the French, the Germans, the Dutch or the Belgians &mdash; much less higher than the hugely developing economic region comprising of the Asian countries of the Far East &mdash; then our competitiveness as an open economy is undermined immediately.</P>
    <P>Regarding the capacity of our young people and investment in education, I am, and always have been, a vigorous supporter of investment in education. The added value of knowledge and the application of that knowledge through research, processing and so on, are essential. I am not so vigorous in my support for the plethora of training schemes and administration because I cannot see the benefits in the same terms as investment in education.  If adjustments have to be made in the National Development Plan, I hope that there will be no compromise on the fundamental priority in the education sector.  That sector is the guarantee of the future and will equip our young people to compete with and beat the best of them, as they have proved they are capable of doing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the indications that small industry is being targeted as a priority because the experience in Japan, the USA and Germany has shown that this sector was the engine of growth in the economy.  This sector is the tight, cohesive and firmly rooted element in any community, especially ours.  It is part of the community, is committed and determined to ensure that its ventures are successful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> We are living in a world of mobile international investment and there is no sentiment in that world.  Multinationals will move to a more profitable climate if wage, interest and inflation rates are lower than here.  No sentiment or political appeal will influence them.  Our only guarantee is to maintain the level on which this programme is firmly based.</P>
    <P>Since indigenous industry has nowhere to go it is essential that we support it in relation to income tax levels because it cannot avail of the tax breaks which multinationals enjoy.  I welcome the steady reduction in income tax levels since 1987.  I will not make a virtue of this because nobody should proclaim themselves virtuous and attribute blame to the other side.  However, the controls we put in place in 1987 enabled us to reduce the top level of income tax from penal heights.  I am happy that strategy is being pursued and that the low income sector is being targeted.</P>
    <P>I could not make a contribution to this debate without referring to the agricultural sector.  No sector of the community suffers more from high inflation and interest rates than the agricultural sector; equally, no sector benefits more from low inflation and interest rates. Representatives of farming organisations criticised me as Minister for Agriculture &mdash; Senator Farrelly will remember this &mdash; when I volunteered to reduce the level of expenditure on ACOT and An Foras Talúntais &mdash; the two bodies were combined into what is now Teagasc.  I owed it to my colleagues in Government to be consistent with my views.  I was disappointed when criticised by the organisations which demanded that we set an example by controlling public expenditure. It is like a parody on St. Augustine, make us pure but not yet, or make the rest pure but not us, or do as we say but not to us.  In the Dáil I was constantly criticised about ACOT and charging farmers for services which had previously been free.  I said in the Dáil that a service worth getting is a service worth paying for, particularly by larger farmers.  Teagasc is allocated approximately £12 million less of taxpayers' money than if I had <Col N="1226" /> not taken that difficult decision.  I was a member of a Government which took difficult decisions.</P>
    <P>The banking sector must look at its role in this economy.  It is not a privileged establishment which descended from above, people in pinstripe suits whose motives will never and should never be questioned.  Profit is an essential component in the private sector but many things are done in the name of banking, nationally and internationally.  The Swiss banking system &mdash; I mentioned this more than once &mdash; encourages, through the safe haven concept, tyrants and pirates to put money made off the backs of suffering people.  No banking system has a right to secure itself in profit.</P>
    <P>The success of the German and Japanese economies was based on a partnership concept with the financial services. They did not see themselves as being there to draw profit on a good day or to make money from farmers when things were going well and to call them in when things were tight.  They saw themselves as part of a joint venture. They trained and equipped people as entrepreneurs and they took the risk and shared the profit with the customer, but they were also prepared to share losses with the company.</P>
    <P>No sector of the economy has a God given right to say their business must be in profit at all times.  I accept this sector must make a profit to maintain confidence, but there is no rule in the economic management of financial services or economies which sets the banking sector apart from others by saying it must be guaranteed profit.</P>
    <P>As we move towards this programme of competitiveness with Europe and the world, the banking sector must take a new approach to programmes the Government launch.  It must get involved, share and recruit expertise. The days of doing an administrative job are gone because one can now use a card outside a bank.  We need experts in the banking sector and in other sectors who will become involved, advise and share in the success or failure of a business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> This programme is well timed.  As the Minister, the Taoiseach and members of Government said, it is part of the overall comprehensive strategy which is the basis for the Programme for a Partnership Government, the budget, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  This is an essential component and is in line with the publication of the report of the task force on small business which the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, launched yesterday.  These are parts of a composite whole.</P>
    <P>The best laid plans, which are important, informed and researched in enterprise, will inevitably fall apart unless overall discipline, which is not easy to maintain &mdash; there are always demands for special interests &mdash; is adhered to.  In the confidence it will be adhered to, I am happy to support this motion.  We can look forward to the competitiveness <i>vis-a-vis</i> our European partners which we are effectively demonstrating each day and to employment opportunities, which is the key if not the exclusive priority for all our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. Despite comments from this side of the House, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> represents consensus, discussion and negotiation in the most democratic form and process of consultation I know.  The Government negotiated and consulted with representatives of the social partners, on both sides of the labour spectrum and those representing the public service, the private sector, workers, employees and employers.  All aspects of Irish life were represented.  It was perhaps the most wide ranging form of negotiation and consultation in which I have been involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> I support this programme even though I do not come from a principled position of being for or against national agreements. Times dictate different things at different times.  It is important to put on record what has happened since the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in 1987, followed by the Programme for Economic and Social Progress in 1990. In 1987 we had a debt GNP ratio of 137 per cent.  This was the worst in the EC. We had an Exchequer borrowing requirement of almost 13 per cent.  This was an impossible set of macroeconomic indicators to deal with.  At that stage we had the highest interest rates in Europe. Our growth was negligible after previously having had high growth.  Inflation was high.</P>
    <P>After six years of a disciplined approach to the economy from all the social partners, which was a consensual approach by people prepared to make a patriotic commitment to and invest their labour in the State, the debt GNP ratio is now well below 100 per cent.  The Maastricht Treaty requires us to achieve a ratio of 60 per cent by the late 1990s and we are well on the way to reaching this.  Our Exchequer borrowing requirement is about 3 per cent and is one of the lowest in Europe.  It is far lower than that of the UK.  Interest rates are as low as they are in Europe.  More importantly, inflation last year was 2.5 per cent.  It is forecast to be at a similar rate for the next two years.  This would exceed our most optimistic objectives of some years ago.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, last year Ireland had a growth rate of 4 per cent; average growth in the EU was 2 per cent.  These factors are significant.  Over the last four years our exports have grown each year despite all sorts of adverse circumstances. They even grew during the period of punting against European currencies in late 1992 prior to devaluation.  The prophets of doom were saying our level of exports would fall, but with a currency 10 per cent higher than we had after devaluation we still managed to increase our exports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> It is important that this is said from this side of the House.  That is not to say that everything is fine.  We have the great problem of 295,000 people unemployed. For the last two or three years we have asked how these factors will impact on the unemployment rate.  We have been looking over the last three or four years at the daunting prospect of unemployment exceeding 300,000 before the end of the century.  This can be easily forecast by adding to the unemployment figures the difference between the 25,000 people entering the labour force each year and the number of jobs being created each year, which is about 10,000 or 12,000.</P>
    <P>In the background to the budget document and in his speech today the Minister referred to the projection of the Department of Finance that this year the unemployment figures will be reduced by 5,000 or 6,000.  If I were the Minister for Finance I would be ashamed to say this publicly because I would be setting myself up to be knocked down.  However, I am not the Minister and I am looking at the situation from the point of view of someone who has been concerned about and involved with job creation schemes over the last three or four years.  I recognise when a corner has been turned and I believe that this is now the case.  I may be an optimist but the fact that we are hoping, even in a time of low or zero emigration, to reduce the number of unemployed this year is important.  With the single exception of Luxembourg, Ireland was the only country to have a substantial gain in the numbers at work during the last calendar year.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that a survey conducted by the Small Firms Association some weeks ago found that people working in small businesses were very optimistic and a substantial number expected to take on one or two extra employees during the next 18 months.  A problem associated with our growth in exports has been that most of it was in low employment intensive industry which was not indigenous and the profits of which were being repatriated or were not being reinvested in this country in the way we would have wished.  It is important that much of <Col N="1230" /> the growth is now taking place in middle tech and indigenous industry.  I welcome provisions in the budget which have been implemented to ensure that movement between being unemployed and employed becomes bureaucratically easier and is facilitated in income tax terms.  These are some of the issues which have brought a focus on the needs, demands and objectives of all the social partners.</P>
    <P>What is certain about a document like this, which represents a consensual position, is that no one is happy.  It represents wins and losses, depending on whether one thinks the bottle is half full or half empty.  Each of the partners involved in negotiating it can sell it as either being a loss, in the sense that it does not contain all of what they wanted, or a gain because it contains half of what they wanted and is, therefore, a move forward.  It is a matter of political expediency for others to decide whether or not they are for it. From where I stand, representing workers on the ground, I think it is a reasonable attempt to move forward.</P>
    <P>Nobody is ever happy with programmes like this.  From 1987 to 1990 trade unions felt they had been sold a pup, they had given too much and the pay awards were far too low in the context of the huge economic growth in that period. The facts proved them right.  Conversely, between 1990 and 1993 the employer bodies, IBEC in particular, sang the same song about their position.  They felt that increases in wages and costs in this period outstripped growth and that they lost out. We are all certain that it is better to have discipline in the economy and a concerted and consensual approach to growth and development than to have everybody trouble shooting on their own.  These programmes have contributed enormously to and have raised awareness of the importance of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy made a point about training and I agree completely with him.  I have sympathy with the &ldquo;mere civil servant&rdquo; in Brussels who questioned the amount of money we were putting into training.  We cannot train people who are not ready to obtain benefits <Col N="1231" /> from training.  If, for example, somebody cannot read or write, it is no use putting them into a major course.  I have always taken the view that we, and I, have failed to convince the powers that be of the close connection between investment in education and the creation of employment at a later stage.  If people do not develop in the education system they will not gain from training or employment opportunities and they will not be innovative enough to move forward.</P>
    <P>One of the great benefits of the salary agreement in this document is that it recognises it is imperative that change takes place and that flexibility be achieved before pay increases are awarded.  As a trade union general secretary, I applaud that move forward. Without flexibility, movement or openness to change we are going nowhere as a country.  I am particularly happy that within the public service the 3 per cent will be paid only on the basis of flexibility being offered by people such as those who pay my salary, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>One of the important aspects of this programme for workers on the ground is the elimination of the 1 per cent employment levy, for which there is a broad general welcome.  It was anti job, regressive and should never have been introduced. Similarly, I want to mention some of the improvements proposed for the education area.  We have recognised the various changes which have taken place in the macro economic indicators.</P>
    <P>I regret that I failed to get into the programme, despite trying time and time again, the question of access to third level education, which is something on which we are all agreed.  At present people can covenant a certain amount of money toward third level fees.  However, because it is 5 per cent of salary it is a regressive tax in the sense that the higher one's income the more one can gain from it, which is not attractive to Government, trade unionists or people who are seeking equity in the taxation system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> If this country cannot afford to give free third level education access, what could at least be done &mdash; and I ask the Minister to raise this with his Cabinet colleagues and my colleagues on the opposite benches &mdash; is to move towards it by allowing for tax purposes vouched receipts for third level fees and costs. That takes us half way there in that those who can afford to pay third level costs could at least set it against tax.  It is fairer in many ways than the raising of the threshold because it means that only those people who are paying taxes can gain from it and it is very attractive from that point of view.  Access to third level is critically important.</P>
    <P>Having got the macro economic indicators correct and having seen growth in exports, employment and so on, I will be looking forward to improvements in the future in the educational area.  The primary sector has now brought forward proposals to reduce class size, increase the numbers of remedial teachers, give more access for people in disadvantaged areas, in particular investment in special education, and the possibility of eliminating substandard school buildings, which is very attractive.  I do not have time to go into the details of that now but I will at another time.</P>
    <P>The movement of taxation is in the right direction.  However, the residential property tax is a disaster, not because of what it seeks to do but because it is directed at and focused on the same people who have been paying tax all the time.  The reaction to it is not to the amount of money but that people feel they are being steamrolled once again.</P>
    <P>Finally, I make no apologies for saying that during the course of these negotiations, as the only Member of the Oireachtas present, I insisted at all times that the awards of the Gleeson report should be implemented.  It has been indicated to me that will be done.  I feel that elected public representatives are entitled to this, like every other worker. If they are afraid to shout for themselves, I do not mind doing it for them.</P>

      <P>It is hard to follow that. The document before us is so long and has so much meat in it that I had difficulty in trying to decide what to focus on.  I will focus on one aspect of this broad subject, which is what I see as the missing link in the document between performance and reward.  My hopes were raised when I read the title: <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  It is clearly saying that competitiveness comes first and work second, which is the crucial point.  Similarly, I was interested to see that last year's new Department of Enterprise and Employment put enterprise first and employment second.  Work depends on competitiveness and employment depends on enterprise.  That is the missing link which concerns me here.  The central reality in the business world is that we must recognise that employment depends on competitiveness.</P>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Senator O'Toole said, but I do not agree that that link has been established.  He described all of those marvellous measurements which show how well Ireland is doing, except for one.  I suggest that there is a link, that as long as we continue to pay ourselves above the odds and over the rate of inflation we damage and weaken the chance of creating work.</P>
      <P>Today's business is about competition. Companies which do not compete successfully go out of business, and nowadays they go to the wall more and more quickly.  The world owes no company a living and no company is able to offer or maintain jobs unless it stays in business. To be honest, the promise of the programme's title is not carried through fully in its content.  It is almost as if the title was put in as an afterthought rather than being the natural outcome of the programme itself and the discussions to which Senator O'Toole referred.  I do not find the programme to be infused with the philosophy which the title suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> The pay element of the programme is not driven by the reality of the connection between competitiveness and work but by that abstract across the board approach which characterised the two previous agreements and a whole generation of national pay agreements before that.  The pay element is not related to the market place in which each individual company must fight for survival. The result is that all companies, whatever their circumstances, are expected to pay out at the same level of increase whether they are making that extra profit.  In other words, their inability to fund it is not taken into account.</P>
    <P>I have been arguing for some time that we should drop that across the board approach in favour of one which relates the amount of extra reward which people get to the performance of the company for which they work.  Such an approach would be good for employees, companies and the economy as a whole.  We did something similar in our company last year where we offered the employees the opportunity to participate in a profit sharing programme in return for foregoing part of the last phase of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It worked very well because everybody who put in the extra effort knew that they would show a reward for their hard work at the end.  It worked successfully and enthusiastically and is the sort of approach which needs to be taken if we are going to succeed.  It meant that our company paid far beyond the level which we otherwise would have had to pay, but we did so because we earned the extra profit.  We are fairly certain that much of that extra profit would not have been made if we had not had that arrangement.  People worked together much more effectively because they knew that they were going to share in the fruits of the efforts.</P>
    <P>This approach is important because it recognises the fact that people who work in a company can have a direct effect on the amount of success which the company enjoys.  A company's success always depends on its own people.  However, <Col N="1235" /> beyond that general truth there is an extra measure of success which can be achieved, depending on how personally motivated each individual is.</P>
    <P>An element of this approach should have been included in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The lack of it is the missing link in the programme.  The principle involved is that instead of paying in advance for what we have not yet delivered, we should concentrate on paying out what we achieved &mdash; but only after we achieve it.  That would harness a tremendous amount of motivation around the task of helping the company one works for to do better.  It would produce bigger dividends for people working in companies which do well and encourage them to ensure that companies do well.  Companies who did not make the extra profit needed to fund the increases would not be lumbered with the extra cost, and this is critical for employment. It is when costs run beyond profit that companies stop being competitive and are soon on the road to ceasing to exist altogether.  The blanket approach to pay increases we have favoured in recent years does not increase companies' competitiveness but actually undermines it.  Whenever competitiveness is undermined, jobs are threatened.</P>
    <P>I met a businessman while in the United States last month.  He said that Ireland was a wonderful country in which to holiday but as a board member of a number of companies he made a point of advising them not to invest in employment in Ireland.  He said this was because, as a nation, we did not recognise that one needs success to create jobs. He said that we make it too difficult to employ people, which I can understand. I say that as someone who was partially responsible for some of this.  Last year during the passage through the House of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, I encouraged and had accepted an amendment which made dismissal on grounds of age automatically unfair. Every step this nation takes to make ourselves <Col N="1236" /> less competitive is unfair on the 300,000 people who are out of work.  We must rethink this approach.  The time to do it is during programmes such as the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  I am glad to see this agreement was reached.  Many parties were involved, including the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC, CIF, IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme. Submissions were received from the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, the National Youth Council, the National Parents Council and the Combat Poverty Agency.  All these submissions were taken into account and an agreement was reached: the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>This is about keeping people at work. We need stability in the workplace, because irreparable damage is done when industrial relations break down and there are industrial disputes, strikes and so on. There is a loss of wages to the workers concerned and a loss of profit &mdash; and often markets &mdash; to companies.  It also results in an unfortunate development of hostility between the workers themselves and between workers and their supervisors which can last for generations.  If the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> continues on good lines and keeps people working, it will eliminate that hostility or prevent its development.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the establishment of the new enterprise boards throughout the country.  I compliment the county development teams which existed in some parts of the country before the establishment of the enterprise boards and the tremendous work done by their officials.  They existed along the west coast of Ireland and in the half of County Cork in which I live.  Their work over the years created tremendous opportunities for employment in small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> If there are 20 small firms each employing two people, there are 40 people at work.  That can often be much better than a company which will set up and employ 100 initially but later closes down, due to a lack of market or other factors.  If one small company fails, only two jobs are lost and there may be another small company to replace it.  If 20 small businesses are operating properly, there are 40 people at work, and in rural communities this is of great importance.  If one person sets up a little business on their own and comes off the live register and later employs another person in a small project, tremendous work is done.  This spirit is embodied in this document.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the people who were involved in the Leader programme.  I live in an area where the Leader programme operated and did tremendous work.  The people involved carried out their work with diligence and efficiency.  Many small projects were started and studies done which will be of great benefit and which will be continued by Leader II or the enterprise boards.  The setting up of IDA (Ireland) and Forbairt is an important part of this programme.  The native industry dealt with by Forbairt will be on a greater scale than that being handled by either the Leader programme or the enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>Since the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> deals with the National Development Plan, the setting up of new regional authorities will play a big part in seeing that the money is spent effectively to create employment throughout the country.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> takes many aspects into account.  As somebody already mentioned, it is a long document. The provision of £100 million in the enterprise fund for small and medium sized businesses will go a long way towards the provision of employment and keeping people at work.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the points made in the programme on the marine sector. Fishing, which is often regarded as a cinderella industry in this country, deserves full and proper promotion under this programme. I come from a constituency <Col N="1238" /> which stretches from east of Kinsale to the Kerry border and takes in places such as the Beara peninsula, Castletownbere, Union Hall, Schull, Courtmacsherry, Kinsale and other seaports.  There is a huge resource off the coast which can provide a substantial amount of employment if it is developed properly.  I am glad to see that a significant section of this programme deals with the marine sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey has replaced Deputy O'Shea, who was here a few minutes ago.  I hoped he would be here when I mentioned agriculture and food, but he seems to have known I was going to raise it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>The food sector can be developed fully under this programme. The food industry is very wide ranging. When coupled with horticulture there is a great reserve in this country, only the surface of which is being scratched at the moment.  A properly developed food industry can provide worthwhile employment. Vegetables and other food can be produced in this country and, if marketed properly, could provide worthwhile small employment units throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The agricultural sector encompasses the development of forestry which was also considered a cinderella industry in the past.  In areas where there are few other resources, forests can provide a good worthwhile employment and a resource for the development of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Combined with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is tax reform. We cannot talk only about wages when we are talking about any programme; we must talk about tax, etc. as well because if a person gets a percentage increase, PRSI, tax and pension contributions will be taken from that percentage.  I was glad to see in the budget that tax reform as well as the programme was taken into account.  The abolition of the 1 per cent levy, higher personal allowances, the widening of tax bands and other tax <Col N="1239" /> reforms are very important for job creation and wages restraint.</P>
    <P>The areas we talked about most are those which deal with cash but this programme covers many other areas, some of which were hammered out in very fine detail.  I am very glad agreement was reached between ICTU and the employers' organisation on a 2 per cent pay increase for the first 12 months of the agreement, with 2.5 per cent and 1 per cent increases in the second and third years.</P>
    <P>A £3.50 per week increase in basic pay in phase 2 and a similar increase in phase 3 were also agreed.  In the public sector the agreement is slightly different but, here too there are two phases of 2 per cent increases, two phases of 1.5 per cent, and one phase of 1 per cent with an increase in basic pay of £2.80 per week in the second phase, £2.10 in the third phase and £2.10 in the fourth phase.  A similar deal was agreed for the construction industry.  All these deals took a lot of bargaining and I compliment the people involved in reaching agreement because when it comes down to figures very often a percentage point can lead to a breakdown in the talks and many more long hours of renegotiation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's wide ranging speech today.  He wants to keep interest rates low and to enhance the confidence of domestic and foreign investors alike by the sensible manner in which we manage the economy.  That is very important for work creation.  The agreement covers a three year period and overall pay increases will amount to about 8 per cent of basic pay over that time.  I already mentioned the increase of £3.50 per week in the second and third phases of the main agreement.</P>
    <P>We must always take into account employment needs, fiscal discipline and competitiveness.  If we are not seen to be competitive we will be swallowed up.  We do not have a protected market, we have an open economy and we see the European Union expanding every day.  We have to be on guard all the time against foreign competition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> Very often when we hear different groups interviewed they seem to say we are spending too much on the public sector.  People in the public sector are doing vital work.  People in the private sector sometimes say that people in the public sector are getting too much; they are not.  I worked as a teacher before I came into the Seanad and the money earned by teachers when tax is deducted would not make anyone rich.  Well heeled people in other organisations should not use this as an argument.</P>
    <P>Following the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there was unfinished business in the public service and I am glad to see it has been taken care of in a flexible and efficient fashion.</P>
    <P>We need industrial peace.  We do not want strikes or disputes.  Strikes lead to loss of wages for the worker and profit for the employer, but very often the hostility that can develop as a result of an industrial dispute, especially a prolonged dispute, can lead to ill will that takes many years to forget.  If this programme does no more than avoid industrial disputes, it has done a tremendous job.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's speech.  The National Development Plan deals with matters which will take us into the next century and will have a profound effect on this country.  A programme like this, whether it is confined to wages or work or is a total programme to develop our country properly, is of the utmost importance. Coupled with tax reform and the provisions in the budget, our country will gain substantially from the National Development Plan and the Structural Funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this programme and recognise that a number of groups have done much work together in producing it.  However, I have to question the necessity of this programme compared to its predecessors.  This programme deals with many issues, but I question the worthiness and necessity of it because it <Col N="1241" /> is centred around what is fundamentally a pay deal.</P>
      <P>One has to question whether much of what is talked about in the programme would not go ahead anyway in the various areas it addresses.  It is full of worthy aspirations, statements and desires which the Government hopes to implement over the next few years, but does the Government really believe all these proposals are worth doing?  How many of them would have gone ahead in the absence of a pay agreement?  If many of them would have gone ahead anyway, is the Government not a little dishonest in presenting them as being the trade-off for a pay agreement?  The Government should now state which of the proposals or plans in this document would have proceeded on their own merits even if no pay agreement had been in question.</P>
      <P>We ask why there is a need for a pay agreement.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> some workers received increases greater than those negotiated because they worked in companies that increased profitability and output and the workers benefited from that.  In other instances, companies found themselves in difficulties and workers got increases lower than those recommended by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Only the public sector got the full benefit of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  One has to wonder whether this is of any benefit to the workers in the private sector.  The same applies to this programme.  On page 10 of the document it is stated that:</P>
      <P>Improved planning of such costs facilitates the freeing-up or better utilisation of resources needed for the improvement of the cost-effectiveness or efficiency of the operation of the economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this improved planning increases costs, what is the benefit of the improved planning? The same situation arose in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Pages 9 and 10 of the document are particularly interesting in view of the developments last week in relation to Structural Funds and the National <Col N="1242" /> Development Plan.  One wonders what effect this entire section of the programme has when we are talking about a substantial reduction in Structural Funding in the overall national plan.  That area of the programme is up for consideration and discussion as is the European Union dimension, which is not as relevant as one might have thought two or three weeks ago.  Its relevance must now be addressed by the Government in the light of new developments that have occurred over the past week.</P>
    <P>On page 11, section 1.21 deals with the environment, yet there is no evidence that the Government recognises that Ireland on its own cannot and will not be able to pursue an environmental strategy outside a joint European dimension. Environment is a transnational problem and we can be seriously affected by what happens in England, as THORP and Sellafield have made clear.  There is no evidence that that has been taken into account by the Government in this programme. We have a national responsibility to concern ourselves with environmental issues within the confines of Ireland, but our position on the international front is even more important as is the attitude being adopted towards the environment by other countries.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the cost of fuel, particularly crude oil and petroleum, and their use as raw materials. Their cost in competitive terms can be high, yet the only way to deal with their environmental effect is by taxation.  It is not possible to do that, however, unless it is done by other countries as well. Without international agreement to take similar action the competitive question will not be dealt with properly and we cannot afford to take that type of action in isolation.  The Government does not address the issue in any shape or form in this programme, which is unfortunate because we can only succeed with some type of international agreement.</P>
    <P>The same applies to industrial employment. We can only deal with the issue of international companies coming here if this programme deals with the international dimension, but it does not.  For <Col N="1243" /> instance, it does not recognise the fact that the Maastrict Treaty's social chapter is not being dealt with uniformly across Europe because Britain, our nearest neighbour, has not accepted the social chapter.  That issue is not addressed in the employment and industry section of the programme although it will greatly affect our competitiveness in securing foreign industry.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that some companies have chosen to leave or not locate here in the first place &mdash; opting for Scotland or England &mdash; because of more attractive conditions and less restrictive labour laws.  This matter has not been addressed in the programme. The fact that Britain has not accepted the Social Charter while we have is a fundamental issue.  Unlike Britain, we are bound by that charter which puts us at a serious disadvantage in trying to attract international companies to this country.  It is a question which the Government should address strongly yet I do not see any evidence of it being tackled in this report.</P>
    <P>I would like to join previous speakers in complimenting the work being done by county enterprise boards and the Leader programmes.  In County Clare we have a good Leader programme in place which has done unique work in retaining people in jobs that would otherwise have gone. It has also managed to generate employment in new small businesses and industries. While the county enterprise boards are getting off the ground and providing some basic assistance, hindrances remain at national level.  Unless the Government seriously deals with these &mdash; particularly in the area of small and start-up businesses &mdash; we will not generate the type of employment numbers we need to halt the terrible tragedy of so many people being unemployed.  I appeal to the Government to recognise the amount of red tape that gets in the way of those trying to start up a business.  It trips them up and eventually &mdash; in most cases within two years &mdash; many are forced out of business because of the bureaucracy that is choking them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> Fine Gael has repeatedly said that it is vitally important for people to be left outside the system in the first two years of operation and not to be drafted into the bureaucratic tax net.  They should be provided with an opportunity of getting their businesses off the ground, on the road and established.  If they are still going after two years they will then be in a position to come into the net and become part of the system.  In the long term, the Government and the Central Exchequer will benefit considerably more from that situation because such people, if they get a decent start, will remain in business and increase their output.</P>
    <P>Announcements have been made by the Government about securing loans from the lending institutions, but I find very little evidence on the ground that people are finding it easy to get loans at a decent interest rate.  A definite approach needs to be adopted to provide people with the type of interest-free loans required if jobs are to be created.  I am sure many Members of this House would think twice before employing somebody because of the overall costs involved. Phenomenal costs other than wages are involved for small employers who are trying to survive.  These costs are a total hindrance to employing additional people.  We need to encourage people to employ workers and recognise the value of that.</P>
    <P>Even if the Government was never to draw a penny from the employers there would at least be fewer people on the dole to whom the State must pay social welfare benefits.  No co-ordinated strategy is being adopted across the board by various Government Departments, lending institutions and the industrial promotion agencies to address this serious problem.  Until concrete action of that nature is taken we will never overcome the huge problem of unemployment.  We have the ability and talent to generate jobs but there needs to be a clear commitment and direction from Government. The obstacles to generating work need to be removed and unless that is done we will face a very serious unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> Many issues could be addressed in this programme but the fundamental one is that of competitiveness.  We can only compete successfully in the world economy if we are able to produce goods at a cost which is competitive or lower than our competitors, and that means great efforts on the part of the employees. Many companies should seriously consider involving their employees in a more fundamental way in their company operations. Some years ago a number of companies introduced employee share ownership.  It was a very successful scheme and we should encourage more companies to operate it.  Employees have responded positively where such a scheme has been introduced.  They have involved themselves more effectively in running the companies.  They have produced more and that has benefited not only the companies but also the employees.  There is greater co-ordination between the personnel concerned and such co-ordination is very important. Greater employee participation in the company can work to the advantage of the company, its shareholders and the employees.  Such participation, therefore, should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Other fundamental issues have not been addressed in the programme, but I hope the Government will address those matters outside the context of this programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  I approve the programme.  Like its predecessors, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, it is different from earlier efforts to establish a centralised arrangement. The new feature in the three programmes since 1987 is that the national agreements have been based on detailed studies by the National Economic and Social Council.  The NESC is an independent organisation which represents the widest span of opinion.  NESC reports have given an authority and confidence to the three programmes which did not exist previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> There is no doubt that the first two programmes, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, served us well during the last six years.  Net employment grew by 56,000 in that period although we have a long way to go due to the huge annual increase in our labour force.  Economic growth has averaged almost 5 per cent, which is substantially ahead of that in many European countries.  Average take home pay since 1987 in, for example, manufacturing and construction has increased by between 8 per cent and 20 per cent net.  The pay agreement, which is central to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, will continue to put more money in peoples' pockets.</P>
    <P>The overriding concern and objective of the programme is work.  Work is mentioned in the title and that has a certain symbolic value.  Moreover, the central objective of the programme is a concern for job retention and job creation. Despite the fact that we have had very respectable economic growth rates by European standards there has been a mismatch between economic growth and the number of jobs created.  It is disappointing that growth has not translated into jobs to the extent that we would like. It requires a singlemindedness of purpose and an exceptional commitment to keep the focus on jobs.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> combined with the National Plan and this year's budget constitute a step in that direction.</P>
    <P>Pay is an important component of this and previous programmes.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and this programme are deliberately designed to put more money in peoples' pockets.  The previous two programmes achieved that.  It was achieved through a flat increase for workers earning below a certain level of pay.  There is every indication that this programme will continue to focus on the lower paid.  The pay agreement in the programme is sensible and moderate.  It will undoubtedly continue to enhance our competitiveness. Ours is a small open economy.  We <Col N="1247" /> live by our exports and it is of vital importance that we be competitive in the international marketplace.  The more competitive we are, the more jobs we can retain and the more jobs we can create.</P>
    <P>The large number of long term unemployed people is an ongoing problem. They must be dealt with in a sensible and practical manner.  I welcome the provision in this year's budget for 40,000 places on the community employment programme this year.  They are not new placements but they represent a 50 per cent increase in the numbers on social employment and other schemes which it will replace.  However, there is an ongoing need to look closely at expenditure on employment schemes.  We must be focused and careful in how we spend public money.  I had the honour to chair the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment &mdash; on which the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, served effectively &mdash; which examined the employment schemes.  Representatives from FÁS gave evidence to the committee on two occasions and they told us that there was a need to rationalise the number of FÁS schemes.  They said there was a tendency to add schemes as additional funds became available.  As FÁS indicated, there is a need for rationalisation in that sector.</P>
    <P>There is an important link between the tax system and job retention and job creation.  On the one hand one wants to give the incentive to work and on the other hand one wants to give the incentive to employ.  The tax reform measures which have been implemented in the recent past favour the lower paid.  In this year's budget people on salaries of under £9,000 per year will be exempt from the health and employment levies.  It is worth remembering that almost 500,000 workers earn less than £10,000 per year, so there will be clear benefits for a sizeable portion of the labour force.  In addition, taxpayers in general and the lower paid in particular have benefited under the budget from the abolition of the 1 per cent levy, the 7 per cent increase in the tax bands and the increase in personal <Col N="1248" /> allowances.  The clear target of this programme, of which the budget is one element, is to continue to improve the lot of the lower paid.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment has been succeeded by the National Economic and Social Forum. Despite the short existence of the committee, we conveyed our views in advance of the negotiation of this programme. I am glad that our views were taken into account.  We sought, in particular, income tax reform with a focus on the lower paid.  There is concrete evidence in the programme and this year's budget that Government policy is taking that direction.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of incentive to employ.  Ours is a country of small businesses.  We have 157,000 firms which employ under 50 people.  Nearly half of private sector employment in this country is in enterprises employing fewer than 50 people.  I welcome the publication this week of the report of the task force on small business.  Among its important recommendations &mdash; some of which have already been implemented &mdash; is the question of access to finance for small business. That is a pressing issue which also arose during our work in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment.  It is an obstacle to the existence and development of small businesses.  I am happy to note that £100 million in cheap loans is available for small business through the Industrial Credit Corporation at 3 per cent below the market interest rates.  We often think of small business in the context of grants or equity injections.  The interesting fact that emerged from the deliberations of the task force on small business is that small businesses are more interested in low cost finance, so that they can plan their financial arrangements for a particular period, rather than in grants or equity.</P>
    <P>Another area that requires continuous monitoring and which must be tackled is bureaucracy.  Excessive bureaucracy can clearly get in the way of administration affecting small business.  The number of hurdles to be overcome is staggering.  I am glad to see that, reinforced by the <Col N="1249" /> findings of the report of the task force on small business, that matter has gone to the top of the agenda.</P>
    <P>State agencies are not good at paying their bills in time to small businesses. That is a real problem and has implications for the funding of these bodies by the State.  The United States have a Prompt Payments Act to ensure that small businesses are not left with this unpaid debt for too long.  Reasonable credit terms are afforded to agencies who pay them for services rendered.</P>
    <P>Obviously, much of the focus of this discussion will be on pay and economic issues.  The word &ldquo;social&rdquo; has been deliberately put into the title of the National Economic and Social Forum.  There is a social concern.  Indeed, the social policy committee is one of the key committees. That raises the question of social equity. However, some people are not doing as well as others under these programmes. The programme does make a positive commitment in regard to action being taken to achieve social balance.  Before this agreement was concluded, the National Economic and Social Forum clearly stated that they would like to see the benefits of growth shared more equitably and that there should be a more equitable and caring society as a result.  I am glad to see certain specific measures in the programme in relation to, for example, education and housing; and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, has made an excellent contribution to the latter in his present portfolio.</P>
    <P>There is a close relationship between employment and educational attainment. There is an ongoing need to target more resources for those who are disadvantaged educationally.  I am especially glad to see that the allocation for second chance and continuing education in the budget has increased by 10 per cent for 1994 alone.  The vocational training opportunities scheme, which is specifically focused and targeted at the long term unemployed, will immediately provide an additional 2,500 places.  The vocational and training opportunities scheme offers mainstream education for <Col N="1250" /> the long term unemployed to improve their knowledge and skills.  A number of them did not stay in school long enough and now want, for example, to sit the leaving certificate.  There are other courses available, such as starting one's own business or entrepreneurial skills.  This programme is working well.  I am delighted to see those 2,500 places being made available for the long term unemployed, who are typically made up of those in their early twenties.</P>
    <P>In the area of housing &mdash; and I have already paid tribute to the Minister of State in this matter &mdash; before the negotiations on the programme concluded, the National Economic and Social Forum called for a fairer distribution of resources for the least well off.  Under the programme local authority housing has got a substantial increased capital provision.  There is also increased funding for substandard public housing.  Those local authority houses that do not have bathrooms, for example, have been targeted for this additional facility under the programme.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the heading of industrial relations.  In this programme there is a subhead titled &ldquo;Industrial Peace&rdquo;.  It says: &ldquo;This agreement commits employers, trade unions and employees to promoting industrial harmony.&rdquo; Another paragraph under the same heading says:</P>
    <P>This Agreement precludes strikes or any other form of industrial action by trade unions, employees or employers in respect of any matter covered by this Agreement, where the employer or trade union concerned is acting in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</P>
    <P>The pay agreement contained in the programme is to be ratified later this month.  It is not, of course, legally binding under our voluntary system of industrial relations.  However, there is a strong moral commitment to it and a serious disciplined approach by the trade unions, the employers, the Government and the other social partners to stick to the terms of the agreement.  The proof of the pudding <Col N="1251" /> is in the eating.  Our industrial conflict record and number of strikes has dropped dramatically when compared to the 1960s and the 1970s.  This new, more peaceful regime has distinct advantages. It gives stability to managers, unions and employees in the course of their business. It certainly helps to promote the image of the country for international mobile investment.  Productivity, obviously, is secure and hopefully will be enhanced; and the financial losses that employers will suffer through shut downs, as well as the losses to employees through strike action, are avoided.</P>
    <P>In my professional capacity as a professor in industrial relations in UCD, I would have been holding countries such as France and, more especially, Germany, as models of stability in the industrial relations field in the past.  Ireland is currently more peaceful in the industrial sense than either of these countries. There is no need to gloat over that.  It is a welcome change and a reversal of the situation of previous years.  The consensus approach and the co-operation, so suited to a small country like ours, between Government, unions and employers and the other social partners is of critical importance.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum is glad to have the opportunity to focus on ideas for employment measures on future policy.  Indeed, we are currently actively exploring new ideas, consulting international opinion as to what is successful elsewhere and examining current schemes.  Our next major report will be in May of this year, when we hope to make a substantial input into policy on the employment question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible to welcome this agreement almost unreservedly if it was simply a national wage agreement, that is if one believes that such agreements are worth having at all. From that point of view the Government's negotiators did a good job in achieving these results, which are contained in the appendices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> Having said that, it is difficult to express a view on the rest of the document, partly because it does not contain the evidence which would allow one to assess the quality of thinking that went into it.  That may be unavoidable if the size of the document is to be kept to a reasonable level, but partly because the quality of expression and presentation in it is unacceptably inferior, even by what has come to be the acceptable level of official documents.  If there is high quality thinking in this document, the drafters have failed abysmally to do justice to it. I will give a few examples from the first pages in connection with this.  It extends beyond expression; I fear it goes back to content.  If confidence is an important factor in stimulating economic activity, it extends beyond confidence in the calibre of businessmen.  It involves confidence in the calibre of Government and in the planners to plan reasonably and effectively in an uncertain world.</P>
    <P>I will begin by taking a few presentations and sentences of the report and ask what on earth they are supposed to mean.  The first sentence is clear enough. In paragraph 1.6, we are told that:</P>
    <P>This action must harness the same national determination in dealing with work as was the case in 1987 in restoring financial stability.  There is one essential difference in approach.  Success in the area of work will come only through more specific, more focused, more local and more business-oriented approaches.</P>
    <P>That may all be true, but the essential difference is that in dealing with the national finances the main requisite was the political will that directly lay within the compass of Government directly to control the national finances.  That is simply not the case in terms of job creation or employment.  Government could get everything right if we knew what was right and still the task might prove beyond the country.  Political will alone does not suffice here, even though it is important.</P>
    <P>A sentence in paragraph 1.8 raises serious questions.  It says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> A small increase in a reasonable percentage of the 100,000 small businesses in Ireland, a bridging of the gap between Ireland and other countries at our stage of development in the area of start-up enterprises and a strong performance in new areas of the growing services sector, will give the improved employment performance necessary to reduce unemployment to more acceptable levels.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too pedantic but I repeat &ldquo;A small increase&rdquo;.  Dare I ask the Minister how small is &ldquo;small&rdquo; or how large is &ldquo;large&rdquo;?  It continues &ldquo;in a reasonable percentage of the 100,000 small business in Ireland&rdquo;, what would &ldquo;a reasonable percentage&rdquo; be?  I was glad to hear Senator Hillery quoting the figure of 157,000, a figure that emerges from the report of the Task Force on Small Business.  To be fair the task force admits that what is involved is a guestimate because we do not apparently have reliable figures.  Nevertheless, the difference between 100,000 and 157,000 is substantial.  Have 57,000 small businesses emerged from the woodwork over the past three or four months?  On what concepts are the planners in these two documents working?  If one insists on proclaiming that small businesses will be the salvation of the country, to be 60 per cent out in one's estimate of the number of small businesses suggests there are elastic criteria involved in the concept of planning among the planners.</P>
    <P>The paragraph continues &ldquo;a bridging of the gap between Ireland and other countries at our stage of development in the area of start-up enterprises&rdquo;.  The Task Force on Small Business says that the number of start-ups on a <i>pro rata</i> basis is around the European average. The European average may not be identical with other countries at our stage of development, but what is the average in other countries at our stage of development? What is intended there?  With whom are we being compared?  How rigorous is the comparison?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in the report of the Task Force on Small Business that the <Col N="1254" /> argument that was copiously advanced last year by the Minister, by IBEC and by university presidents that we were grossly lacking in enterprise on the basis of start-up figures given for Germany, Italy, the United States and ourselves, and the badly researched and grossly inadequately supported figure, are no longer accepted.  That assumption is exploded and it is now clear that the real problem confronting us is not start-ups or a lack of enterprise but the ability for small and medium firms to grow.  This means it is more a lack of management skills than a lack of enterprise as such.  That has considerable implications for the area in which I am most interested &mdash; the education system.</P>
    <P>A chapter in the Green Paper on education referred to an enterprise culture which was based on the assumption that we were grossly deficient in enterprise and made any number of suggestions about turning the education system upside down in order to remedy this defect.  It would now appear the diagnosis was, at the least, inadequate.  It is disturbing to see on the second page of this document a number of assumptions which, to say the least, are highly questionable. I could phrase it more adversarially than that.  It raises questions about the data being used or about the coherence of thinking among the planners when something like that is put down at the beginning.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 1.12 we have the assertion that: &ldquo;Ireland's experience shows that successful convergence [within the European Union] is fully compatible with, and indeed, a necessary foundation for healthy growth.&rdquo;&ldquo;Successful convergence&rdquo;?  What is unsuccessful convergence in the context of the thinking here?  Even having resolved that, what does the sentence mean?  I do not know.  I hope the drafter knows &mdash; assuming there was only one drafter. Maybe the second half of the sentence was written by the back end of a horse and the first by the front end of the horse. I would like to know what it means.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> I do not wish to be derisive about this but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being restrained compared with how Senator Ross might be.  It would be nice to be able to welcome a document which states clearly and coherently, based on reasonably accepted evidence, what is in the minds of the drafters.</P>
      <P>More seriously and substantively, paragraph 1.15 refers to &ldquo;policy guidelines...designed to deliver low interest rates as the basis for increased investment, output and employment&rdquo;.  Low interest rates are to be welcomed, but they have never been, to the best of my knowledge, in the economic history of any country I have studied, the basis for increased investment, output and employment.  They can make a significant contribution if other factors are in place, they can be a basis, but to say they are the cornerstone of our economic policy would make me sceptical about the likely outcome of that policy.</P>
      <P>It continues: &ldquo;the GATT negotiations will constitute a decisive step forward&rdquo;. We do not know that; we hope the results will prove to be as satisfactory as the projections suggest, but to say that it will constitute a decisive step forward is pure prophecy.  It further states: &ldquo;the growing trend towards decentralisation in today's world, reflecting the increasing importance of the local level&rdquo;.  How many mandarins in Merrion Street believe in the growing trend toward decentralisation in today's world?  How often have we been told that Ireland is too small for decentralisation? Has Ireland suddenly silently grown in size overnight that now it reflects a world trend of which we will become part?  I do not believe any of these people have changed their minds on the undesirability of decentralisation however much they may have to quote or ape the rhetoric that makes it fashionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcomed Senator Taylor-Quinn's references to the environmental dimension, <Col N="1256" /> and her criticisms of the lack of an international perspective were correct. Having said that, I welcome paragraph 1.21.  However general the rhetoric may be, it is at least going in the right direction. Whatever one's reservations about rhetoric, it is nice to have it going in the right direction.  It may turn into something concrete in due course.</P>
    <P>A weakness in the report is the relative lack of emphasis, except at the rhetorical level, on marketing.  There is a reference at the beginning to market led growth but there is little on exporting as such. On page 16, paragraph 1.37 refers to what An Bord Tráchtála is doing to assist exporting particularly by indigenous industries.  An Bord Tráchtála is a worthwhile organisation &mdash; I am not criticising it &mdash; but the performance of indigenous industry in the past year when it increased market share in difficult circumstances was impressive.</P>
    <P>The conclusion in paragraph 1.37 is that &ldquo;It is projected that this development support will yield an increase of an average of 9 per cent per annum in exports by indigenous industry.&rdquo;.  The implication is that but for this development support there would be no increase; that the increase in exports will be solely due to the increase in development support. Much though I welcome State support for exports and much though I deplore ideological distinctions between public and private, because we need excellence in both in this country, it seems to me to expose a cast of mind that the total increase in exports will be due solely to State assistance.  That cast of mind is unfortunate but is exposed by the phraseology used here, however welcome the general thrust may be.</P>
    <P>I also note in paragraph 1.44 that where we are talking about importing industry and multinational industry, it states: &ldquo;A range of sectors will be targeted but pharmaceutical, health care, electronics, precision engineering and software will continue to be the subject of a special focus.&rdquo;  They are exactly the growth industries we have at present which suggests to me that there are no <Col N="1257" /> new ideas around about developments. Since much of the activity in plans and reports in the last number of years, including the Culliton report, was supposed to identify new sectors for development and develop clusters in new areas, it is disappointing to see nothing new on that subject.</P>
    <P>I have some comments on education. There is a section on innovation through research and development which is admirable but vague.  Most of the comments on education are similar.  They are unexceptionable but difficult to put in concrete terms.  Paragraph 6-41 reads: &ldquo;Third level facilities will be expanded to provide additional student places&rdquo;.  I am not sure how one translates that into something one can either praise or criticise.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is here.  The official mind is largely uncomprehending of the relationship between third level education and economic development.  I welcome the concern of the official mind for the role of third level education in promoting such development because that sector has an important part to play.  However time and again I am perplexed by what seems to be its incomprehension of realities at third level.</P>
    <P>I echo the earlier call for a serious examination of possible tax reliefs for the parents of students at third level education. While there may be a danger of privileging a sector of an already privileged class, there is now scope to look at this in the interests of social justice.</P>
    <P>I also make a strong plea for the vigorous implementation of the also rather general commitments to adult and continuing education.  That is justified on educational grounds and for social equity.  In addition to the class and gender inequalities we have increasing age or generational inequalities now emerging as one of the worst inequalities in our society.  Many of those adults who have been deprived of the opportunity for higher education in an earlier generation deserve a second or third chance if that can be devised; undoubtedly it can be arranged if the political will is there.  The <Col N="1258" /> commitment to adult, second chance and continuing education should be taken seriously and not left at the level of rhetoric. Concrete steps should be taken to implement it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government and the social partners for securing agreement on another national programme.  The benefit of centralised pay bargaining is obvious.  The consensus approach is always preferable to conflict in all areas, especially in relation to work, the provision of jobs and industrial matters.</P>
      <P>This programme makes clear that the Government's overriding priority for economic and social policy is the creation of more jobs.  We have seen two previous programmes, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  This one is called the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>; even the titles of the programmes are appropriate.</P>
      <P>The approach towards securing agreement with the social partners has served the economy well in the last six years. Undoubtedly the financial crisis we faced in 1987 could not have been reversed without the agreement to these programmes. At the time of the first programme there was undoubtedly a need for national recovery and to turn the financial position around.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> tackled the spiralling debt, inflation and our balance of payments deficit.</P>
      <P>Reference has already been made to some of the concrete achievements during the period of the first two programmes. Net employment has increased by 56,000 over the six year period; economic growth has averaged close to 5 per cent; income as measured by GDP <i>per capita</i> has grown from 60 per cent of the EU average to 74 per cent; farm incomes have risen in all but two years of the programmes; and average take home pay in manufacturing and construction had increased by anything from 8 to 20 per cent in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who calls into question the need of or benefit from such programmes <Col N="1259" /> or plans should look at the position in 1987.  We have tackled the national debt and our finances and made progress.  It would be unfair to describe the previous two programmes as merely pay deals; the benefits which accrue from such centralised bargaining would be lost if it was left to each group to fight its corner.  The plans provide a balanced policy framework based on consensus with continuous input by the social partners through the central review committee.</P>
    <P>It is also pleasing to see &ldquo;work&rdquo; in the title of this programme.  The first programme put us on the road to national recovery and provided jobs, but that was not reflected in a reduction in the numbers unemployed, certainly in the area I represent.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> did much to curb inflation and tackle our balance of payments deficit.  As the Minister knows, areas in my constituency have unemployment rates of over 60 per cent.  Those people think these programmes are fine for employers or employees but the unemployed feel excluded and think they have lost out.</P>
    <P>This programme ensures that we look after the long term unemployed but its central purpose is to provide jobs.  I am not an economist but I have had huge difficulties explaining that while our growth position has greatly improved this has not translated into jobs.  We will suspend judgment on this programme until we see at the review stage or at its end whether growth has led to jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment has left the House.  I wished to tell him that previous settlement strategies from both central and local Government have meant the unemployment problem has been concentrated in the suburban new towns.  As I said, some of these areas have unemployment rates of up to 60 per cent.  It may be possible to tackle a national level of unemployment of 15 per cent but it will need a huge impetus for the programme to have an impact on the crisis in suburban Dublin.  When the Minister replies I hope he concentrates on the <Col N="1260" /> provision of jobs under the programme as that is my priority.</P>
    <P>The title also contains the word &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo;. An article appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> today about an ESRI study. It states:</P>
    <P>Irish women earn 20 per cent less than men, and half of this wage gap is due to sex discrimination, according to a study of men's and women's earnings by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).</P>
    <P>I am always concerned when times are tough that the automatic suggestion is that married women should return to the home and leave jobs for young school leavers or when we see the results this type of survey produces regarding the need for competition.  The Minister's speech and the contents of the programme hammer home the fact that we must be competitive and be in a position to produce goods that are at least as competitively priced as those of our partners. I agree with that to a point but I draw the line when a particular segment of society is exploited, whether it is young people employed at £1.50 per hour in fast food chains, etc., or women in certain industries.  The study reflects the fact that women are being discriminated against and indicates that their earnings are 20 per cent lower than men's.  This is where I have grave worries about the detail of the programme as agreed with the social partners.  Perhaps the hidden agenda is that certain unscrupulous employers are paying women less, as this study clearly shows.  It states:</P>
    <P>On average, women earn £4.27 per hour for every £5.33 earned by a man, with the largest wage gap among service workers, where men are paid over £2 more per hour than women.</P>
    <P>The other programmes got our finances right, inflation down and helped growth. The new buzz word for this programme is competitiveness and we need to be careful and ensure that this type of discrimination is discontinued and does not become its focus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> A benefit from the previous two programmes which could be a benefit from this programme provided my earlier point does not become a feature, is the position regarding industrial conflict.  We have industrial peace when there is an agreed programme and a consensus approach with the social partners.  Every Member would agree that it is in nobody's interest to have strikes; it is not in the interest of workers or the country and a bad reputation regarding strikes does not attract industry.  The two previous programmes enhanced the position of Irish workers in the eyes of potential employers from abroad or people setting up businesses here.</P>
    <P>This programme differs from the previous programmes in a number of areas. It states:</P>
    <P>...the development of small business and start-up enterprises where a comprehensive range of measures involving lower interest loans, removal of &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;, focused incentives for equity investment and support services at local, community level are being and will be put in place...</P>
    <P>It also states that there will be the further development of jobs in the service sector where Departments and agencies working with private sector promoters will take new and positive steps to create new jobs.  It was evident in the area I represent that the previous focus of industrial policy was to attract multinationals; it was the be all and end all.  Although it has a part to play in industrial policy and in the programme, it cannot start and end there.  Those two aspects of the programme are an attempt to ensure that the jobs we create are home grown.</P>
    <P>The programme further states:</P>
    <P>...the development of community-based work, with work experience and training, to a level where before the end of this Programme 100,000 people will through work experience, education and training, be working to improve their prospects of access to sustainable employment and enterprise and, in the process, participating <Col N="1262" /> in the development of the areas in which they live.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in this matter because this is the area which will improve the position of the people I represent. The Minister is aware that schemes, such as the Tallaght Partnership, have been hugely successful. When communities have been empowered to take their future into their own hands, it has proven highly successful. I look forward to the development of community based work.  If it is successful it will be evident in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the central review committee formed part of the previous programmes but it is welcome.  Sometimes we set ourselves on a particular course and there is a reluctance to reexamine it or to admit that perhaps it is not the direction we should follow.  There is nothing wrong with saying that we should change course if we have made a mistake.  If we discover midway or during the course of this programme that the directions we are taking are wrong, the central review committee will ensure that we take whatever action is necessary to change course.</P>
    <P>I welcome the programme but my interest is in increased employment and the generation of jobs, particularly for the people I represent and the 300,000 people who are unemployed.  I am optimistic that this programme will work in the interest of those people.  Ultimately, the unemployed will be the judges and will let us know if we progressed from the areas of the two previous programmes which dealt with getting the figures correct and increasing growth, in the third programme through the creation of jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to discuss the programme.  On the opening page of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, it is acknowledged that a key component to increase the productive capacity of the country is the National Development Plan.  In other words, the plan is rightly accorded an integral and essential role in underpinning <Col N="1263" /> the job targets and development strategy of this programme.</P>
      <P>This begs the fundamental question: where do we stand in relation to the National Development Plan now that the double talk, double counting and the double dealing by this Fianna Fáil/Labour Coalition is finally unveiled in all its sorry and shabby detail?  This included bitter rows in Cabinet and Commission officials in Brussels being unfairly pilloried.  Saddest of all, communities throughout this country who were led to believe that vital social and economic projects were in the bag are now left wondering if their project will ever get the go ahead.  Last week, the Taoiseach said on RTÉ that nothing had changed. The Minister for Finance went on to insist that the plan would be implemented in full and that there was no intention or necessity to revise it.  When are the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues going to cop themselves on and stop treating the Irish people as if they were fools?</P>
      <P>This Government is characterised by big publicity splashes.  Glossy documents and reports are launched and the weaker the content, the greater the fuss that is made of them.  An example is the launch of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The programme is nothing more than an ill advised pay deal for the public and private sectors, or rather for those private sector companies that can afford it, dressed up as a would be social and economic programme.  It is simply a rehash of the now badly holed National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree that unemployment is the most serious problem facing this nation. The Minister said that this Government's main priority is the creation of more jobs. That has been high on the agenda of every Government since the foundation of the State.  With the exception of the 1960s, no decade has shown the promise that we might actually be able to solve this enormous problem.  What was it about the 1960s that gave rise to a sense of hope?  That was a time of low taxation <Col N="1264" /> and zero budget deficits.  Today we see little of the pioneering spirit of the 1960s.</P>
    <P>A good example of the prevalent negative thinking is the reluctance to open up our telecommunications industry, despite the fact that it results in Irish industry being put at a cost and service disadvantage to its European competitors. Let there be no doubt that this is what is happening.  To prove it one has only to recall what happened within weeks of Telecom Éireann reducing the cost of international calls last year in what was misleadingly termed the rebalancing of telephone rates.  The then IDA and various Ministers were running around announcing hundreds of jobs and new telesales businesses.  Without the reduction in telephone charges none of these jobs would have been created.  The lower charges are also helping other companies who are engaged in international trade, enabling them to become more competitive and therefore better able to maintain and create new jobs.</P>
    <P>Despite these tangible benefits we continue to seek delays in the introduction of liberalising measures in Europe regarding trade and telecommunications, rather than seeking to be out in front, as we sought to be in the 1960s.  It is interesting to note that even after last year's reduction in the cost of international telephone charges, large Irish companies who can gain direct access to British Telecom can still save approximately 50 per cent of the cost of their telephone charges to other countries. However, other Irish companies, and by this I mean small and medium sized locally owned firms, continue to be at a major cost disadvantage to their competitors in respect of telecommunications charges.</P>
    <P>We appear to be about to witness at last another turn by the Labour Party regarding the privatisation of Telecom Éireann.  In changing its view, the Labour Party is to be congratulated on at last facing up to reality.  We are told, of course, that this is not privatisation but rather a strategic alliance.  May I ask how the Tánaiste, and the Labour Party would <Col N="1265" /> describe this if they were the Opposition to the Government?</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is a national plan with one new piece of information.  This new information is not contained in the main section, but rather in an appendix which covers the draft terms of the pay deal. The programme will do nothing new about solving our unemployment problem and will not result in the creation of a single real job which has any chance of being sustained.</P>
    <P>In the introduction to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, the Taoiseach states:</P>
    <P>The Government's clear objective... was to make work at all levels the cornerstone of development action, in the next three years in particular.</P>
    <P>What new thinking emerges from this document?  None; but should this be surprising? What is happening in this country at present is a clear case of paralysis through analysis.  More glossy documents and new Government quangos are not what is required, rather what is required is action which will help businesses generate real jobs and not more jobs in the vast bureaucracies which we have created and which must be funded by an already overtaxed work force.</P>
    <P>In the Introduction to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, the Taoiseach also states: &ldquo;The short-run outlook... of our main markets is slow and uncertain.&rdquo;  He goes on to refer to the degree of competition to which Irish producers are exposed to as increasing; yet we are able to offer ourselves wage increases of a minimum of 8.5 per cent, despite the real increases we have enjoyed over the last few years.  The Taoiseach goes on to state:</P>
    <P>We must ensure that this [growth] will have benefits for the whole community. In particular, I will be taking steps to ensure that the impact of the Programme on equality is monitored on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>However, what does this programme hold for the 300,000 who are unemployed? <Col N="1266" /> Nothing.  Indeed, to the extent that we have increased the cost base of Irish industry through awarding those at work wage rises, despite the uncertain economic climate and the increasing levels of competition on both the home and foreign markets, it makes the position of the unemployed worse.</P>
    <P>Far from having something for the whole community, this programme worsens the position of the unemployed.  Yet the unemployed were the only section not present at the table when the programme was being negotiated.  Let us not forget that in terms of numbers there are more than twice as many on the live register as the total number of farmers, and the latter had three organisations representing them in the talks.  It is only fair to state that I do not agree with central wage agreements and that my party is against them in principle.  We believe that wage negotiations should be at company level and not at national level.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that the Cold War is over.  The Berlin Wall has come down and, whether we like it or not, businesses based in eastern Europe are gaining freer access to our markets.  These countries are not populated by uneducated, unenterprising masses.  If anything, some of them have a greater depth of technical knowledge than we have in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of competition that we, as a nation on the edge of Europe, must tackle head on if we are to get the jobs that are so desperately needed. However, nothing in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> could give any confidence that this harsh reality is fully understood by those who drafted it.  If real jobs are to be created it will be by businesses providing services and products to Irish and foreign consumers in terms of quality and price which they find attractive.</P>
    <P>In considering the present state of the Irish business community we find there are, unfortunately, precious few truly successful indigenous companies that have been built up over the last 30 years. This failure is all the greater when we compare ourselves to the other less developed countries who were similar to <Col N="1267" /> the stage of development we were 30 years ago, countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore.  These countries have today many leading world companies among their corporate ranks.</P>
    <P>One success that this country has produced is Patrick Campbell of Bewley's Cafes Limited.  Mr. Campbell foresees many Irish businesses selling out to foreign companies because of the obstacles put in the way of small Irish companies. High on his list of these obstacles is excessive taxation, payable both by employers and employees.  Mr. Campbell said in a recent article in <i>The Sunday Tribune:</i></P>
    <P>This Government is over-managing the economy through the introduction of restrictive regulations which have undermined competiveness....  Today the Revenue [Commissioners] have more power of entry and search than the gardaí have to fight criminals and drug dealers....  Today, the self employed taxpayer is a suspect.</P>
    <P>What does the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> do to address these issues which are sapping the enterprise out of the very people we should be holding up as the real heroes of today's Ireland?  The answer is nothing; indeed it goes in the opposite direction to what business people are seeking.</P>
    <P>In the article Mr. Campbell indicates that while IDA Ireland and other such grant giving agencies are held out as the providers of part of the badly needed funds small and medium sized companies require to build up their businesses, he would have to advise any young entrepreneurs not to waste their time looking for help from them, because, he remarks, in practice their help &ldquo;all too often turns out to be as elusive as the Halloween snap apple&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To be an Irish entrepreneur today is to be a second class citizen in many ways. First, because he is Irish such an entrepreneur gets paid a smaller grant for each job he creates than his foreign counterpart; second, he will be asked for a higher percentage of the overall grant package <Col N="1268" /> to be repayable than his foreign counterpart; and, third, he will be asked to give up equity in his company so that Forbairt can make a profit if the business is successful. It is unacceptable and makes bad business sense that Irish companies are paid less than foreign companies simply because grant giving agencies believe that the Irish company has no choice but to locate here.</P>
    <P>I am not critical of the efforts being made to get foreign companies to set up in Ireland, but I am calling for fair play for our native business people.  An effort must be made to help Irish owned companies to develop, expand and create wealth, which for the most part will remain in Ireland rather than be repatriated abroad.  We should be paying grant levels per job on a more equitable basis than is presently the case.  To implement this proposal I call for more funds for Forbairt and An Bord Trachtála.  I am convinced that these funds would be better spent than many of the training schemes planned for in the National Development Plan.  In this respect, and bearing in mind the latest controversies regarding the spending plans of the National Development Plan, it is interesting to reflect on what Mr. Campbell said in the recent article in <i>The Sunday Tribune:</i></P>
    <P>It will be impossible to secure £8 billion from the EC without spending between £2 billion and £4 billion ourselves. We do not have that type of money and it would be suicidal to increase the national debt.  The alternative is a hefty increase in income tax, which would also be unbearable, or some deft footwork by the Government to enable us to use a major portion of that £8 billion to support ourselves on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>It would appear that even the &ldquo;mere civil servant&rdquo; as the Minister, Deputy Quinn, called him, far from being too removed from the problems of Ireland to know what is required, is far closer to seeing what a shambles the National Development Plan and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> Last November, Mr. Maurice Doyle, the Governor of the Central Bank, said that the problems besetting the economy are more structural than cyclical in nature.  He went on to say that &mdash; this must be alarming for us to hear &mdash; 50 per cent of the rise in unemployment is due to domestic policy factors.  These factors can be identified as the continued existence of the large tax wedge for those at work and the need for reform of the social welfare and taxation system to improve incentives to work and the promotion of a more flexible wage bargaining process. The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> fails in respect of these two tests. Old restrictive work practices must be abolished and European Union competition law must be speedily introduced. Unfortunately, this programme does nothing to quicken the pace.</P>
    <P>When reviewing the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, Dr. Kieran Kennedy, director of the ESRI, indicated that they did not have the flexibility needed to deal with events such as the currency crisis and did not adequately contain public sector pay. The current programme clearly fails in this regard.  The programme also fails to achieve anything in respect of a key target set by the Government, that of getting agreement on how pay levels within the public sector should be reviewed in future and how disputes should be resolved.  Dr. Kieran Kennedy also indicated that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> failed to fundamentally address Ireland's major structural problem, unemployment.  To do so, he believes, a question must be asked &mdash; what pay cuts can we reasonably ask workers, a privileged class, to take in order to help get to grips with those currently excluded from work?  On this test the current programme is a hopeless failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  It is aptly named, because we must be competitive. When manufacturing or producing goods it is important to sell them.  We are operating <Col N="1270" /> in an open market and we must be able to compete.  The programme reflects the full range of operating costs for the whole economy, private and public.  It requires that inefficiency and rigidity should not be allowed to threaten the long-run viability of Irish employment.</P>
      <P>I am glad the unions and others were involved in this because we had reached a stage where there were too many demarcation lines.  If something went wrong nobody could repair it, except those in a specific category.  That caused many problems, including strikes; it was costly and cost jobs.  I am delighted we are adopting a more flexible approach.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the programme highlighted the need to support indigenous industry and attract overseas investment because they go hand in hand.  We hear a lot about indigenous industries, and rightly so, because they create a lot of jobs.  Many are dependent on large industries which have come into this country. By and large, indigenous industries are service industry subcontracted to do work for larger industries.</P>
      <P>The problem with small industries is they do not have sales people.  Such industries can be innovative and manufacture products, but they do not have the wherewithal or the personnel to travel abroad to sell these goods.  Selling is the name of the game.  Overseas factories and businesses here have sales networks on the Continent, America and elsewhere. These large industries and the subcontractor I referred to &mdash; the indigenous industry supplying parts to the large industry &mdash; go hand in hand; one cannot survive without the other.  I am delighted service industries are being recognised because for too long they were neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with small industries does not relate to start-ups or know-how, but to job losses.  We are not doing enough research on why jobs are being lost.  It is easy to say we cannot sell products because of overproduction.  Given the fact that Ireland is a small country with only 1.5 million people to employ from a population of 3.5 million, there is no reason why, we should not have full <Col N="1271" /> employment.  The EU provides us with a huge market, so does the US.  If we increase sales by .0001 per cent, we could create a sufficient number of jobs to keep people here.  We need a task force &mdash; it seems to be the operative thing at present &mdash; to research why we lose jobs. Although new jobs are great, it is important to try to keep existing jobs; otherwise we are only replacing them and that does not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad money is being made available to small industries at 3 per cent less than the normal rate.  There is, however, a snag and I ask the Minister to look at it.  I believe one may only get this money in order to expand or extend one's business or to create new jobs.  I appeal to the Minister to be more flexible, because many small industries are struggling to survive.  If they could avail of this money at a cheap rate they would not have to let people go or cut back.  We must consider industries which are going or have gone through a tough period.  I am delighted to see so many small industries.  Some 25 years ago when I began to promote small industries in my village it was a joke, because people were talking about amalgamations and conglomerations and they believed small industries could not survive. We have returned to the idea that small is beautiful and I am delighted.  I have experience in this regard and I ask the Minister to help small industries struggling to keep above water.  It would be great if this money was available to them.</P>
    <P>We spent a lot of money on the tourism sector, which is progressing.  The former EC Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, told me at a chamber of commerce dinner that we need to increase the number of tourists from Britain by only 1 per cent to fill our tourism potential.  Only 0.75 million tourists visit from America and elsewhere each year, yet two million tourists come from Britain.  We should look at what is near to us.  When I first became involved in the tourism industry, a lot of Scottish people visited my village. They came to Derry by boat.  As a result there was a great deal of tourism business <Col N="1272" /> in the area.  In our young days we looked forward to the Glasgow holiday week or fortnight when many Scottish visitors came.  We should go after this market again.  Tourism is very important.</P>
    <P>The programme estimates that the introduction of a car-testing system will give rise to 300 jobs.  This system should not be similar to the one introduced for trucks.  It should be done by an independent body.  Trucks have to be tested by certain garages and as a result smaller ones are being put out of business.  When a truck goes into a garage with a Department of the Environment licence, small garages are short of work.  The large garages say that small ones cannot do a good job.  This is not right.  We have created a monopoly for large garages.  If we introduce compulsory car-testing it should not be done by private individuals or, if it is, they should not do any repairs but only examine cars and say what is wrong with them.  For them to engage in repair services would militate against small garages. I say this as somebody who ran a small garage and was the only one-handed mechanic in Ireland.  I was reported in an American magazine for my ability to repair at a late hour in the evening a tourist's car which had broken down.  If motor testing is introduced, small businesses like the one I ran will be closed.  Such businesses create jobs. Although car-testing may create 300 jobs, we may lose a thousand other jobs.</P>
    <P>I doubt if such testing will make roads or cars safer.  One sees few bangers involved in accidents and being towed by AA wagons.  It is mainly good cars which are involved in accidents because they can put down the boot and go.  I am sure there are many like me who drove bangers.  We had to drive slowly because we could not drive fast.  We are over-emphasising the need for testing.  I am not against it but it will have far bigger repercussions on small garages than the truck business has.  The Minister should look at this aspect.  Such testing should be done through local authorities, or the task should be given to private individuals who would be paid a certain amount for testing cars.  They would say <Col N="1273" /> what is wrong with cars and the owners would take them to be repaired wherever they like.  This would provide work for both repair shops and garages.  It would not create a monopoly or give a person with a licence to test cars the opportunity to take all work at the expense of smaller garages.</P>
    <P>The support for enterprise and starting businesses provided for in the programme is wonderful.  Many small industrialists have told me they would prefer cheap loans to grants and these should be provided.  A certain amount of loans will never be repaid, but around 95 per cent of them will be paid.  A loans fund would be revolving, whereas money paid in grants does not come back, and no jobs other than those resulting from the initial payment of the grant are created. It is important to provide loans and keep the money revolving.  This would create jobs.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that we have not spent more time doing surveys of our unemployed and setting up co-operative movements consisting of unemployed people. Many of them are not able to start businesses on their own.  If we could encourage groups of five or six craftsmen to start up on their own we would get to the heart of our unemployment problem and create many jobs.  There are many people with expertise, but we are not harnessing their talents and helping them to form co-operatives.  We should encourage cooperatives and there is no better way of doing this than through community based industries and employment.</P>
    <P>Insurance is a big problem.  I am glad the programme proposes to deal with the problem of high awards for pain and injury.  Insurance costs are crippling businesses. I used to run a restaurant and garage in Grange, County Sligo, but now I only have a restaurant.  The public liability for the garage and restaurant used to be £20 a year.  My daughter paid £1,200 this year for public liability for the restaurant. It is very difficult for small industries to pay insurance.  In my opinion, many people are deliberately tripping in order to seek compensation.  It is happening all over the country.  Awards for <Col N="1274" /> pain and injury represent one of the biggest rackets of all.  I am delighted something will be done about this.  Insurance costs will close down small businesses, regattas, shows and pony jumping facilities. Amenities in rural Ireland are being crippled by insurance costs.  I appeal to the Minister to work hard to deal with this problem because insurance costs are becoming the biggest stumbling block to creating jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>This topic is very interesting. Competitiveness has different meanings for different people.  If one lives in Dublin one has a certain understanding of what it is about, but if one lives in the provinces, particularly at this time of year one might have a different understanding of it.  I am speaking of people who provide services in the country, particularly in a county like Monaghan, where there are many small industries and delivery and collection services in rural areas.  The cost of servicing machinery used to maintain vehicles using rural roads is incredible. Senator Farrell talked about the overheads, particularly insurance costs, which businesses have to bear now compared to what they used to be.  We are inclined to close our eyes to this.  Every week somebody rings me to complain about having to carry out repairs on springs and shock absorbers on lorries and even bigger repairs, which cost a great deal.  This winter industries in Monaghan have spent about £5 million trying to keep collection and delivery services going.  They would not have had to spend this money if the roads were kept in good condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are fed up listening to us talk about roads but when one speaks about competitiveness and trying to keep industry going, roads are important.  I want to bring home to the Minister that roads must be looked at in the context of job creation and the development of rural Ireland.  There is no doubt that the Government has some good ideas about rural regeneration but these ideas must be based on a good framework.  If the roads are not good how can rural tourism be developed when people cannot travel <Col N="1275" /> comfortably to get to an area?  This is one issue on which we must continue to focus or there will be a rural rebellion one of these days.</P>
    <P>In the legislation this House passed yesterday, the Minister proposed that the Garda will have the power to seize vehicles if tax is not paid on them.  It is amazing that that should happen at this particular time because the people in rural areas are talking about the relationship between vehicle tax and the condition of their roads.  They are discussing the possibility of not paying their motor taxation.  Many of them will be amused to find that that legislation was passed yesterday.  However, that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>Overheads account for a growing percentage of turnover in industry.  When times are good an ESB, telephone or insurance bill is just another bill and a cheque is written.  However, in tight times, which we have had for a long time, the overheads industry has to bear are disproportionate to turnover.  The Government must do everything possible to reduce overheads for industry and allowing employers to make a profit which will enable them to keep people at work.</P>
    <P>Employers regularly quote figures to me, for example, if they employ 100 people they must pay £150,000 insurance. For the ordinary person who knows nothing about business, that is a huge sum.  Insurance is an incredible cost to industry.  It is a disincentive to employment. It reduces the profit margin thereby reducing the ability of business to employ people.</P>
    <P>Employers in every industry are talking about trying to replace people with machines.  Everybody is of the opinion that it is too difficult, costly and awkward to employ people.  They say that they would rather not employ anybody.  With such an ethos it will be very difficult for the Government to increase employment. That trend must be turned around. I do not know how the Government will achieve it but confidence will have to be put back into the economy.  Profit <Col N="1276" /> margins must be increased because profit is the deciding factor when it comes to creating employment.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a person today who said that if a person makes the right effort, organises himself and uses all his skills he can get a business off the ground. However, that person was from Dublin. I said that was possible in Dublin where there are many people and a great deal of activity.  In that context, if a person has the proper skills and the money to set up a business it may be successful.</P>
    <P>However, so many people are leaving rural Ireland that it is almost impossible to set up a business there.  Many people are using various schemes to set up businesses but in 12 months time they will probably be out of business because they cannot get into a market which does not exist.  The rural market place is getting smaller because the economy of an area is created by the activities there and on the amount of money people have to spend.  However, the fewer people there are, the less activity there is and the more difficult it is to establish an enterprise.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned that existing industries will become outmoded over the next 25 or 30 years and we will be left with nothing but tourism.  Those of us who live in counties which are not tourism oriented are worried that there will be nothing for people in the future.  In Leitrim, for example, tourism is fairly good; it is far better than in Monaghan or Cavan.  At least they have that as a base because the population there is decreasing at such a speed that the ordinary industrial activity in the area does not have a local market.  It is a vicious circle.  People in the retail trade and those who provide the kind of services one finds on the high street &mdash; such as banking, schools and so on &mdash; are disappearing from certain areas in County Leitrim because there are no customers.</P>
    <P>The population of Monaghan has also decreased by 5 or 6 per cent since 1986. If that trend continues, we will be in the same sort of a trap with banks leaving the towns because it will be unprofitable for them to stay there; there will be amalgamation of schools and all the other <Col N="1277" /> indicators which point to dying communities.</P>
    <P>This idea of competitiveness and work has a different meaning depending on where one lives.  If the Minister wants to put forward programmes for the development of rural Ireland they should have a sound base.  She should ensure that, if rural tourism is being described as the saviour of rural Ireland, people can at least get in and out of these areas.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to this debate.  This is an important agreement, which is one of the central parts of the Government's economic strategy over the next three and a half years.  Unlike Senator Honan, who professes her party to be opposed to centralised pay deals, I believe in the value of a consensus approach to solving our economic problems. It is important that we would have stable industrial relations, work in a constructive ways with the social partners and together face our shared problems with realism.  That is what has been done in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>In the preparation of that programme a very good report was prepared by the National Economic and Social Forum. When I set up the forum I ensured that there would be representatives of the unemployed, women's groups, people with disabilities, the elderly, youth organisations and environmental interests to ensure that this third strand of Irish life would be in a position to make an input into public policy and, specifically, the discussion of this <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> That report was a very valuable and responsible one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach taken in the programme is a responsible and modest pay settlement which will improve our competitiveness over the next number of years.  It creates a climate of certainty in which people can do business and will improve <Col N="1278" /> and maintain Ireland's competitiveness <i>vis-a-vis</i> our trading partners and the markets we need to sell our goods. Ireland exports 70 per cent of its produce and at home many of our goods and services are competing with goods and services from other countries.  It is only by maintaining competitiveness that we can ensure employment and the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>Our economic future is very good.  All the independent economists and economists working in private sector organisations say we are set for a year of strong output growth.  Last year when European economies in general lost 2 per cent of national output, Ireland was one of the few countries which bucked the trend and showed economic growth.  We now have low interest rates in real terms and an increase in confidence.  Last year's labour force service figures show an increase of about 8,000 in the number of people at work.  There has been a fall in the unemployment figures.  The Irish economy is poised for growth.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan criticised the National Development Plan.  Over 95 per cent of the £20 billion plan is not in dispute.  We were disappointed that, in the statement of 20 October, we did not get the full amount we sought.  However, over 95 per cent of the money from the European Union, our own resources and from the public and private sectors, will be spent and we hope to get the rest over the period of the plan.  There will be a significant injection of cash and spending into the Irish economy.  More importantly, money will be spent wisely to ensure long term and lasting economic return for the country when the last ECU has been spent.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan criticised the scale of the pay deal that was on offer.  When her party was in Government it negotiated a pay deal with its then partners which left us, when we came into Government in year one, with a £350 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a £250 million pay bill.  That pay deal was agreed, in Government by the Progressive Democrats, the so-called party of low spending. I believe in centralised pay bargaining and when a deal is made, one should finish it, which is what we have done. The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has not only created a stable climate and a moderate pay deal for the private and trade sectors of the economy but it also has dealt in a very good way with the public sector.  The increase in public sector pay is the same as in the private sector, a basic 8 per cent increase which will be spread over three and a half years.  There are arrangements in place which create a ceiling on the cost of outstanding special pay increases.</P>
      <P>A major achievement in terms of the certainty of planning future public expenditure and public programmes has been a commitment by the partners to this agreement &mdash; the unions, the employers, the farmers and the Government &mdash; that there will be no new special pay increases for the three and a half years of the agreement.  This gives us an environment in which we can plan the public finances and the future of the economy with certainty. It also puts us in a good position in terms of delivering jobs.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance's economic model estimates that every 1 per cent improvement in competitiveness <i>vis-a-vis</i> our trading partners leads to an extra 4,000 jobs for this country.  There is a clear link between the elements of economic policy under our domestic control, such as the rates of pay and inflation, and the number of jobs we can create.  In a responsible manner, the social partners have acknowledged that reality and have devised a responsible level of pay increase in this deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has matched that responsibility by offering, in this year's budget, £330 million in tax reductions. <Col N="1280" /> From next April people will see substantial tax reductions in their take home pay.  Looking at take home pay has enabled us to secure a moderate and responsible pay agreement.  If we had a free for all, we would not have been able to plan the next three years with the same degree of certainty.  We have a pay agreement which respects the economic position of the country and puts tackling unemployment at the top of the political agenda.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which follow from the provisions I made in the National Development Plan for focusing on unemployment black spots. Senator McGennis referred to the work of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area based partnerships. I visited a number of these partnerships and I am familiar with their work.  They have done enormous work in giving heart to areas that have been blighted by chronic unemployment.  We need to focus on the needs of the long term unemployed. People who lose their jobs and do not get work within a year are unlikely to work again.  Unless we have specific measures that focus on rebuilding the economic potential of the long term unemployed, our unemployment problem will remain with us and these people will be effectively outside the economic system.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell talked about job maintenance in small businesses.  I respect the concerns expressed about preserving existing jobs.  However, we must ensure that we do not spend public funds, whether it be through subsidised loans or grants, allowing people to do what they would do anyway.  We must avoid making 95 per cent of economic activity eligible for subsidies under the heading of job maintenance.  That is why we have traditionally ensured that subsidies go to new projects which would not happen without them.  The focus of grants and soft loans has always been on new activities and new businesses.  We should be slow to go down the road, in the name of job maintenance, of subsidising projects in which people would have invested <Col N="1281" /> their own resources anyway.  There is a real danger of dead weight and a wasteful use of public money.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis referred to women at work and the difficulties for women highlighted by the ESRI report which was published yesterday.  One of the more heartening things in the recent labour force statistics has been the extent to which women's participation in the workforce has increased and the extent to which new jobs have been taken up by women.  Women's economic independence is central to equality for women.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the question of insurance overheads and cited the horrific figure of public liability insurance increasing from £20 to £1,200 in his own business.  The Government is preparing proposals in the insurance area.  I agree that the amount of fraudulent claims being made is costing jobs.  People with the compensation mentality are depriving their fellow citizens of jobs by making the cost of employment and the cost of doing business prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell also raised the question of car testing.  I share his scepticism about this being a job creation measure.  If, instead of spending money in the local chip shop on Irish potatoes, we have to spend the same money getting cars tested, jobs may be lost in the chip shop and the potato growing industries and <Col N="1282" /> created in the car maintenance industry. However, no net jobs would be created. We are simply shifting expenditure from one area to another.  I share his scepticism about the job creation element.</P>
    <P>The future for the Irish economy is very good.  We have the highest growth rate in the EU at the moment; we have growing confidence in the economy and interest rates which are conducive to investment; we have had a very good budget which lowers the cost of employment to employers, a national plan coming on stream which will be very important with investments of the order of £7 billion in the Irish economy geared to giving a lasting return in terms of improving the quality of our education, training, productive infrastructure and targeting the unemployment black spots.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is an important element in the Government's economic strategy; it sets a moderate tone that will put jobs at the top of the agenda and help us win those vital export markets.  Through selling our high quality goods at a price that people want, we create jobs for the Irish economy. The framework for that has been set by the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and it is up to us to ensure that we maximise our opportunities.</P>

      <P>It should be given fair recognition. The original motion congratulated the Labour Party's death-bed conversion to privatisation.  I wish to recognise this tremendous shift of opinion within the Labour Party and the fact that it is prepared to make it public. I also congratulate the Minister on his realism in not saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the approach from Cable and Wireless last week.  We have seen a striking clash of cultures between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil on privatisation.  Nowhere has it been more apparent than in the State-sponsored bodies sector.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party and this Government received enough warnings about semi-State bodies.  We have had the Aer Lingus problem; we had the problem with TEAM Aer Lingus last week; Irish Steel, Bord na Móna and virtually every semi-State company has been in trouble and the Labour Party never learns until the last minute.  The Labour Party learns when it is confronted by crisis.  Their answer to the crisis is always the same &mdash; keep costs high and throw State money at it as fast as possible to keep it going for another year or so.  This was about to happen to Telecom.  However, Cable and Wireless must have presented some difficulties for the Labour Party because the company actually offered to take Telecom out of a hole.  It is always difficult for those&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, Cable and Wireless made what the Minister described as a unilateral proposal &mdash; that is the Minister's way of denying initiating the proposal and the Government will have to consider the proposal.  Unfortunately for us and fortunately for the Labour Party the proposal will remain secret.  The reason it will remain secret is apparent to everybody involved.  It is not because the Government is frightened that competitors will discover the content of the proposal, because there are no competitors <Col N="1286" /> at present; but because the Government does not want to tell the Labour Party backbenchers who will get difficult about it.  It also does not want Mr. Begg of the Communications Workers' Union to see the proposal.  If he does, he will make life very difficult for the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We have a wonderful scenario.  People are trying to help Telecom which is in awful trouble.  The Labour Party says that is all right, but do not let the backbenchers or Mr. Begg see the proposals which must be kept secret and they will be called something else; they will not be called &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;.  The Labour Party warned Cable and Wireless against calling the proposals &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>What will we call it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Labour Party call it?  It calls the proposals &ldquo;strategic alliances&rdquo;.  If one does not like to call them that, one can call them joint ventures. Cable and Wireless are prepared to pay amounts the Minister will not reveal to the House.  It may be approximately between £200 million and £450 million.  This is privatisation, but it will be called a strategic alliance.  Cable and Wireless are a shrewd bunch of people, which is possibly one of the reasons the Labour Party do not like the organisation. It will not pay £450 million for nothing.  What it will get is control over the biggest asset Telecom Éireann has to offer its overseas market.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann is up for sale. Senator Magner, the Minister and everyone in this House knows that, but cannot say it.  The Minister specifically said that all options must be considered.  All options, I presume, include privatisation. Maybe not.  Maybe the Minister should have said that all options except privatisation will be considered, but he did not.  The reason he did not is because it is privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the House of the Tánaiste's statement on this matter last May, which was a masterpiece of ideology, considering the difficulties which he found himself in at the time, <Col N="1287" /> because there was some difficulty from the Labour Party backbenches.  This was an unusual problem for it to have, but it could always get over it by issuing a statement.  It issued such a statement on Monday, 24 May.  I shall now read from it because it is reasonably amusing and, frankly, ridiculous when one considered what happened over the last week.  It refers to the Programme for a Partnership Government containing an explicit guarantee.  The sort of language being used nowadays is ridiculous. Senator Magner will no doubt tell the House the difference between an explicit and inexplicit guarantee.  There is no such thing, but it makes it sound stronger to the troops.  That statement also referred to the main strategic utilities.  The word strategic has a great virtue.  It is the most devalued word in the English language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; appears in every paragraph of this statement bar one.  It is there every time some strength needs to be put into the sort of flat, meaningless statements it usually makes.  It goes on to say that the utilities and enterprises will remain in the ownership of the Irish people.  This has a ring of where, Senator Magner?  Eastern Europe.  Remember them?  Senator Magner's comrades of former days.  They used to talk about the ownership of the Soviet people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This statement refers to the ownership of the Irish people while having the freedom to enter joint ventures with the private and co-operative sectors.  This is a wonderful paradox.  The Labour Party is in favour of State ownership and private enterprise at the same time.  Mastery of language but nothing about ideology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste then said that if Telecom Éireann wishes for strategic reasons to set up a joint venture with another company, <Col N="1288" /> that can be considered by the Government in due course on its merits.  That is a totally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

That is the distinguishing paragraph and it does not have the vital word &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; in it.</P>
      <P>I hope Senator Magner did not write this statement for the Tánaiste, because he will not do it again.  It goes on to say that it is the intention of the Labour Party to keep strategic State companies strong. What is a State company which is not a strategic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is one of our most important assets and the Government would be failing in its duty if it were to be seen to be looking for a fast buck by selling off part of such an important strategic asset.  That was a ridiculous holding statement by the Tánaiste nearly 12 months ago.  That is no longer an operative statement because both the Tánaiste and the Labour Party <Col N="1289" /> are currently considering the privatisation of the firm.</P>

It has approximately 4,000-5,000 surplus employees.  The Labour Party cosily refers to too many employees as a rather high cost base; wonderful stuff.

I see equal access for all citizens, regardless of where they live, to the services of Telecom Éireann as highly important.  It provides a social service to our rural areas. A person can apply for, and obtain, a telephone regardless of where they live. Telecom Éireann ensures that there are adequate payphones throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Government must also ensure that services to industry &mdash; information and other services &mdash; are provided throughout the country.  There are services provided by Telecom Éireann, especially in my own area of the mid west, which a private operator might base in the capital with its greater population. In privatising the organisation agreements must be made with the private operator to ensure that services are not removed from rural Ireland and that employment is maintained by providing the services, the information and data processing services which require the services of Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>We must also ensure that the experiences in the UK when its Telecom services were privatised do not happen in our economy or affect our people.  We can learn from what has happened in the UK and ensure it does not happen here.

      <P>Service quality in British Telecom collapsed after privatisation.  So much so that the company invested £60 million in a new logo to improve the image.  We must ensure that the service is maintained once privatisation occurs. In March 1992, 24,000 job losses were announced by British Telecom, profit figures reduced for that period by 12.5 per cent and further job losses took place subsequently.</P>
      <P>I also wish to recall what happened when C&amp;W moved into Hong Kong and took over the Hong Kong based telecommunications service.  It immediately announced the redundancies of over 1,000 people.  It refused to negotiate settlements, it would not meet the unions for negotiation and it presented a <i>fait accompli</i> to the unions.  Obviously, the workers in Telecom Éireann are extremely concerned about the developing situation.  They have voiced those concerns to many politicians around the country and I am sure the Members of the Government parties here are aware of their concerns.  In any situation the concerns of the workers must be looked at.  As somebody who has experience of takeovers and was made redundant after a takeover, I can fully empathise with the workers in the circumstances.  I urge the Government in any negotiations to ensure that the workers are protected and that they have proper conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When C&amp;W took over in Hong Kong they issued new conditions of employment to all the workers and refused to negotiate.  The workers had a choice of accepting those conditions of employment or leaving their employment.  That was an unfair choice for workers who had served for ten, 20 or 30 years.  In the case <Col N="1293" /> of privatisation we must ensure that the customers are protected, that the services to all areas of the country are protected and that the employees are treated fairly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has a tradition of an ongoing commitment to semi-State bodies and to their employees and Telecom Éireann is no exception to this.  It is this commitment that guides the Government's approach on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remind the House of the commercial and technological realities that form the context of this debate. We live in a time of radical technological change on a par with the Industrial Revolution. At the heart of this change is the revolution in information and telecommunications technology.  Our newspapers are now referring to the information superhighways that will transverse the globe.  Ireland must be part of this superhighway and, above all, we <Col N="1294" /> must not be left stalled on the hard shoulder.</P>
    <P>Coming from the world of business, I would say that information technology, which this industry is about, is an invaluable asset and it is vital that Ireland be part of this new revolution.  Put bluntly, if we do not keep pace with this process and these proposals to progress this company, it will perish.  Future generations would not thank us if we sat idly by and did not help Telecom Éireann to develop and prosper into the next century and beyond.  However, the Minister is determined to ensure a prosperous future for Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The organisation of telecommunications worldwide is faced with major technological and regulatory changes which are creating a global realignment in the industry.  The telecommunications market is becoming increasingly aggressive. In this challenging context Telecom Éireann has rightly been examining how best to position itself to ensure a strong future for itself and the Irish telecommunications sector.  It has had contacts with many possible business partners.  However, any such linkages can only take place in line with the clear policy laid down in the Programme for Government, to which I would refer my Opposition colleagues.  It states: &ldquo;The main strategic initiatives and enterprises remain in the ownership of the Irish people, while having the freedom to enter joint ventures with the private... sector.&rdquo;  This, as we all know, is the bottom line.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications industry cannot operate on the level of the local corner shop.  Telecommunications is a worldwide industry.  Inevitably this leads to new alliances, mergers and acquisitions between competing companies and groups.  It is not in the national interest that Telecom Éireann remains detached from these developments.  As shareholder, the Government has recognised this fact.  It has also been recognised by the board and staff of the company. However, this reality seems to have gone over the heads of the Opposition parties, who seem content to remain in a commercial <Col N="1295" /> fairyland where the market can be ignored.</P>
    <P>It is in this context of global change that Cable and Wireless has submitted a proposal to enter into a strategic alliance with Telecom Éireann through a joint venture between the two companies in which Cable and Wireless would hold a minority stake.  Despite what the Opposition seems to think, there is nothing especially unusual about this, rather it is a reflection of the current commercial atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that Cable and Wireless is only one of the overseas telecommunications companies expressing potential interest in a linkage with Telecom Éireann.  The Minister has also asked the board of Telecom to consider options from other companies and has drawn up a list of potential partners.  This will provide a corporate identikit to decide which company would fit best with the strategic mission of Telecom.</P>
    <P>As we all know, any decision will be taken by the Minister and the Government as shareholder in the context of the aforementioned commitment to the Programme for Government.  In any event, potential partners need to know the EU terms under which they enter into an alliance for a joint venture.  Regarding Cable and Wireless, the Minister has already made abundantly clear that the views of Telecom Éireann will be obtained before any detailed consideration is given to any proposals that might arise from the approach.</P>
    <P>The stance taken by the Minister and the Government is in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that the main structures, utilities and enterprises will remain in the ownership of the Irish people, while having the freedom to enter joint ventures with the private sector.  It is a positive and constructive approach, far removed from that of other parties.</P>
    <P>What exactly is the approach of the other parties to this matter?  We know the stance taken by the Progressive <Col N="1296" /> Democrats towards semi-State companies. Their motto is: &ldquo;If it moves, privatise it.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil does not subscribe to this shortsighted attitude.  We believe our semi-State companies are an invaluable resource, not goods to be sold off to the highest bidder.  As in so many other policy areas, it is hard to discern what Fine Gael policy is on the matter.  Their approach seems to be purely reactive, attacking Government policy without offering a viable alternative.</P>
    <P>The Opposition should adopt a more constructive approach within the context of the commitment under the Programme for Government.  The future of Telecom is too important an issue to be used as a political football and I am glad of the opportunity to put this amendment before the House.  It represents a positive response to the challenges faced by the telecommunications industry.  We have an able young Minister of great mettle and I have every confidence this Government will carefully guide Telecom towards a prosperous future.</P>

      <P>My apologies to Senator Roche.  I welcome the Minister and I welcome the debate because I hope it will provide an opportunity to debate the long term interests of Telecom, its customers and the economy as a whole.  To do that we should remind ourselves of a few facts of business life today, and I was glad to hear Senator Cassidy speak from a business standpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see here an important trend which has relevance far beyond Telecom Éireann.  This is the trend towards the internationalisation of service industries, which have traditionally been sheltered from foreign competition.  Increasingly <Col N="1297" /> those industries are being opened up to competition from outside.  We cannot do anything to stop this trend and in the case of Telecom it is being actively encouraged by the EU.</P>
    <P>There are two ways we can react to the trend.  The first is the ostrich approach; we can put our heads in the sand, hope the problem goes away and act in what would have been the protectionist manner.  We can desperately refuse to face the new reality and continue calling for public money to be poured into every enterprise to keep it viable on its own.</P>
    <P>That is the shortsighted thinking which put us in so much trouble with Aer Lingus &mdash; the Minister has had experience of that.  No one should be in any doubt that Telecom could turn into another Aer Lingus if we fail to face the real world at this time.  The same factors are in place: a company that is too small to compete on its own internationally and a cost structure that is out of kilter with the present marketplace.</P>
    <P>The other way to react to the irreversible trend towards internationalisation is to embrace it, prepare ourselves for it properly and do the utmost to create the greatest possible national advantage from it.  We should not whine about possible foreign involvement in Telecom, as if our telephone service was an entity whose racial purity was to be preserved at all costs.  Instead we should encourage Telecom to set up whatever strategic alliance it needs &mdash; and I have no problem with the phrase &ldquo;strategic alliance&rdquo;.  Such alliances must be made quickly because time is running out.</P>
    <P>Not long ago, when the Aer Lingus controversy was at its height, the issue was not the ideological one of whether Aer Lingus should or should not be sold to a foreign party.  One central problem which remains troublesome is that Aer Lingus could not find a partner.  No one could be persuaded to come to the altar because the bride was not attractive enough to any potential suitor and the parent did not have a nice dowry to endow the union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In traditional countries dowries are still given and, whether it is sexist or not, it is needed to sell off the bride.  In this case, if one takes that traditional and perhaps sexist attitude, then Aer Lingus did not have the dowry and the bride was not sufficiently attractive. The parents could not find a suitable partner in life for her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We should now concentrate on making Telecom Éireann attractive to a potential partner in a strategic alliance.  That cannot be construed as sexist.  The partner will not come in to bail out the company but to provide it with the means to make the most of what could be a bright future.</P>
      <P>Telecom has two major disadvantages at this point which reduce its scope for manoeuvre.  The first is the question of costs, which has been mentioned by Senator Ross.  Telecom has reduced its costs but not by enough to ensure it will have a healthy future; nor has it reduced them quickly enough.  It has dodged and prevaricated on this issue.  The main reason is that reducing costs mean increasing redundancies and that is not a pleasant thing to do.  People refuse to face up to the need for that until disaster faces them.  The sad thing is that by postponing such a cost issue, it makes for far greater human misery at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If cost reductions are planned early, rather than having them forced on us, it can be done in an orderly way and at a much reduced cost in terms of human misery.  If we wait until impending disaster has forced our hand, then we end up losing more jobs more brutally.  Take the example of Aer Lingus again.  If that <Col N="1299" /> company had tackled its cost problems much earlier, it would now be employing more people.</P>
    <P>Costs are only one side of the coin. The other thing that Telecom Éireann has not yet got right is a proper attitude to customers, who are its bread and butter. They could also be the jam if Telecom Éireann got its attitude right.  The health of our telecommunications system into the next century will depend crucially on the extent to which the Irish people become above average users of telecommunications. This will affect the overall health of our economy because the potential for economic expansion, through the development of Telecom based industries, is enormous.  Irish people should be making more use of the telephone system.  The way the company behaved last year with the increase in charges, or the rebalancing of its charges as it called it, was a good example of how it seems to regard the customer, as somebody who can be cosseted when there is competition but exploited where there is not.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be big enough, and realistic enough, about the future to appreciate the urgent need for Telecom Éireann to find a foreign partner in a strategic alliance.  I also hope that issue will not divert us from the equally urgent fact that there is a need for the company to get its cost structure right now.  Telecom Éireann urgently needs to develop a totally new attitude to its customers, an attitude that could help the company to grow and underpin its profitable expansion into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate arises from the proposal by Cable and Wireless which was received by my Department last week.  I said in the Dáil last week, and I am happy to repeat it now, that I have asked the Board of Telecom Éireann to consider, as a clear priority and urgently, the options for the future of the company and in particular what type of arrangement or strategic alliance would in their view best fit the <Col N="1300" /> strategic mission of the company and the interests of the wider economy, of consumers and the employees of the company. I have asked the board to draw up a full list of potential partners which would represent a good balance with Telecom Éireann itself and fit its mission. I expect a report within six months.  Telecom Éireann must also take on board the views and legitimate interests of its staff in this process.</P>
      <P>The Board of Telecom Éireann and the senior management are engaged in the business and they are in the best position to consider in detail the strategic options.  It is not for me to predetermine the choices in advance of receiving their considered views.  It would be equally inappropriate to deal with such an important question in a precipitate manner or indeed, to accept the advances of the first suitor without evaluating other options.  Nevertheless, any ultimate decision is a matter for me as the Minister responsible and for the Government.  I expect to get full information on all possible options and not just a single recommendation or limited preferences.</P>
      <P>It is important not to understate the complexity of the telecommunications business, where the regulatory environment and the strategic objectives of Government in relation to the sector have critical influence on the value of the company.  We cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that Telecom Éireann is a very valuable asset owned by the State on behalf of the people.  We have a clear duty to optimise the value of that asset arising from the significant levels of investment, notably by the State, put into the company to bring its infrastructure up to the best modern standards.  This is a duty to the wider economy and to economic efficiency, and to the taxpayer who financed so much of the basic grid. The role of the major utilities is aptly described in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> wherein they are charged with &ldquo;the delivery of services which are efficient, effective and able to compete in the markets they serve&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such is the pace of technological advance in the telecommunications <Col N="1301" /> sector that the investment requirement will continue to be quite high in the medium term.  The right decisions and strategic choices must be made to take account of changes in technology and the business environment.  Since vesting day, and throughout the major investment programme of the 1980s, Telecom Éireann as a company and its employees demonstrated competence and flexibility in the face of necessary major change. I am confident that these qualities will continue to serve the company and the country well.  My intention is to facilitate any necessary change in such a way as to ensure the long term success and well being of the company and its employees, as well as its customers, the general telecommunications sector and the wider economy.  As I said earlier, the views of staff representatives should and must also be canvassed in a consultative way.</P>
    <P>On the international scene, there are significant, indeed major, changes in the structure of the telecommunications industry, particularly on both sides of the Atlantic and on a trans-Atlantic basis. Alliances, mergers and acquisitions are occurring at such a pace that it is difficult to stay in touch with them.  This activity is driven by a variety of factors, some of which are related to advances in technology in the telecommunications sector itself and moves to create very large dominant alliances.  The second major factor at work is the technology merger between computing, communications and the entertainment and information industries.  These factors can bring exciting opportunities for this country.  Given this background, it is reasonable to assume that other telecommunication companies, in addition to Cable and Wireless, would be weighing up prospects for investment in markets such as ours.  The liberalisation agenda in the European Union is also moving ahead apace.  This will make it easier for new companies to enter the market to capture existing and new business.</P>
    <P>The international background raises serious questions for and about Telecom Éireann.  Can it survive and thrive in isolation? What is its future given that the <Col N="1302" /> liberalisation of the European market is now not only inevitable but proceeding apace?  What would be the consequences if we were to ignore the realities and take no strategic decision?  Unfortunately, it is no longer tenable to take the complacent line that Telecom Éireann is trading profitably and paying regular dividends to its shareholder.  It is critically important that the telecommunications sector go forward in Ireland with increasing momentum.  Given its infrastructure, staff expertise and customer base, it is unthinkable that Telecom Éireann would not continue to be the major player.  The bottom line is that this country must have efficient, wide ranging and competitive telecommunications services as a crucial element in economic development and job creation, both directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>The Government will consider the full range of options that will emanate from the directive I gave to the company last week, and which I outlined in detail in the Dáil.  I have a clear determination to ensure that we make conscious strategic decisions after appropriate analysis and consideration.  We cannot afford the consequences of policy drift in this area no more than in any other area.  Neither should we look exclusively at the first offer that is made.</P>
    <P>Given that a liberalised market in telecommunications is inevitable, I am pressing ahead in accordance with EU requirements with the determination of an appropriate regulatory regime.  The procedures I have outlined, and which I have now put in place, are a pragmatic and realistic approach to ensure in a changing world that the interests of Telecom Éireann, its staff, customers and the public as owners of the company are best served by the solutions which will emerge.</P>
    <P>When we are considering issues such as this, it is important to adopt a pragmatic approach based on partnership.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> clearly outlines the challenges of a modern economy.  Thankfully there is the basis for economic stability and future progress in this country.  There is also the basis for a partnership arrangement, <Col N="1303" /> where the social partners, those who have the interest of the economy at heart, whether they be employers, trade unions, Government or the farming representatives, have come together on the basis of trying to ensure that over the coming years and the years of the plan, parameters will be clearly set down and are available to everybody concerned, including those in indigenous industry and those from outside who wish to invest in this economy.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for the commercial State sponsored sector, I believe we should never forget the huge contribution this sector has made and is making to the development of our economy. We must also be aware that the disciplines of the Single Market mean that we now have competitive challenges which we, as social partners, have agreed are the main issues with which we must contend and are the main challenges we must overcome.  We will do that through partnership, which is the essence of what we are about.</P>
    <P>The people involved in the telecommunications sector in Ireland are aware of international developments. They are aware of the realities; they have legitimate interests to protect and to represent and I have no doubt they will do so responsibly and in the long term interests of the company and the employees.</P>
    <P>It is for management, and the Board of Telecom Éireann, who is the shareholder's representative on these issues, to enure that as far as we, the representative of the Irish people, are concerned, we have the full range of options to make proper, informed decisions which are likely to be in the strategic interests of the company in the years ahead.  When that full range of options, of which there are many is considered and analysed, and once consultation with other potential interested parties is conducted, we will consider the situation in an informed, calm and collective way.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that all facts are friendly.  I believe everybody must own the idea if the idea is to work.  I do <Col N="1304" /> not believe in old, outdated, hierarchical structures which are no longer relevant in modern industrial relations or in modern industrial democracies.  Once those facts are available to everybody, once everybody's interests have been put on the table and certain realities confronted, it is only by the application of common intelligence that certain solutions will emerge and these solutions will have the support of those who have the strategic interest of the company at heart.</P>
    <P>This is something to which not only my party, or the parties in Government are committed; it is something to which all who have a stake in this economy have agreed.  Under a social partnership, the issues of competitiveness will be confronted in a collective way.  Any attempt to seek to invoke division or confrontation will not succeed because I can assure the House that in the discussions I have had in the past week with people in the telecommunications sector who represent both the interests of employers and employees, I am satisfied I have outlined the parameters and the framework within which we can work in principle over the coming months.  This work can take place while recognising that there is an urgent agenda and a national agenda. The whole idea is to ensure that the corporate agenda and the strategic long term future of the company coincide with the national agenda, based on full information and consultation between all the partners who have a legitimate interest in the strategic future of this company.</P>
    <P>That is not to say there are easy, pat decisions to be made, but I am satisfied, and based on my experience as a Minister for Labour in the past and now, as the Minister with responsibility for the commercial State sponsored sector, that it is only through the approach I have outlined that we can seek to solve the problems which are emerging.  Whatever the hype or hysteria which Members may see to heighten, we are not in a crisis, but it is in our interests to confront these issues strategically, collectively and calmly.  In doing so we may arrive at intelligent decisions which I believe will ensure that Telecom Éireann will continue to be a <Col N="1305" /> major player in Irish telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Such decisions will, more importantly, also ensure that we have the kind of technology fit that is required for the wider economy, for industry, agriculture, the food industry and business generally to compete with others in the markets we serve, which is now not only a common market but a single market.  It is a market which has huge opportunities for us which we must grasp immediately and in the coming months and years ahead.  It is a market which has potential dangers, which we must have the courage to confront.</P>
    <P>I believe the telecommunications sector understand this.  I can assure the House that over the coming six months, while these issues are being dealt with, this will be the up front, open agenda of this Government.  I will act on behalf of the Government and in compliance with the Programme for a Partnership Government and with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, upon which we are all agreed not only to complete but to enhance for the benefit of future generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but it will not prevent me from quoting the amendment.  I find myself in an unusual situation this evening, because, apart from one exception I agreed with everything the Minister said.  This is a new phenomenon for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> The proposed amendment by Senator Honan and me proposes to add to the motion the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Additionally Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to seek bids from a number of companies for part of all Telecom Éireann's business and not just its overseas business which is already subject to competition; calls on the Government to make a decision on such sale within a month of receiving bids and to arrange that after such sale the proceeds be used to reimburse the Exchequer for the heavy public investment made in the telecommunications system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no quarrel with the Minister's approach and he is to be commended upon it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has many options but the worry is that, as time goes by, there will be fewer options and then, as in the case of Aer Lingus, there will be no options at all, following which, it will become another charge on the State to bail out an ailing company.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged that the Minister advises that those in the telecommunications industry accept the realities; this means that everybody in the country accepts these realities, but does this apply to the Labour Party?  I ask this as I am confused about its position on this issue.</P>
    <P>In the last Seanad, the people who occupied the benches on this side of the House spoke vehemently and with commitment and passion of their resistance to the idea of privatising Greencore and Irish Life.  I respected their position although I frequently disagreed with it.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the Tánaiste made it clear that privatisation was ruled out by the Programme for a Partnership Government. The Tánaiste went on to state:</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Government and the two parties working together, it is just not on the agenda, and it is not going to be on the agenda.  If Fianna Fáil insist on including it, they will not be in government with the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> That is a remarkable statement and is consistent with everything we have heard.  However, what is the position now?  The Tánaiste's spokesperson, a faceless person who brings the message said &mdash; we shoot the messenger rather than the person who wrote the message &mdash; the Government is not considering privatisation; it is considering strategic alliances which are provided for in the Programme for a Partnership Government. We are back to the question of semantics when privatisation becomes strategic alliance.  I do not know what &ldquo;strategic alliance&rdquo; becomes &mdash; perhaps it becomes &ldquo;joint venture&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We would have no difficulty agreeing on figures if we knew <Col N="1308" /> what they were.  The monopoly will go in nine years and I endorse remarks made by Senator Quinn in that regard.  Many countries are privatising their telephone companies.  If this country is to progress and if the telecommunications industry is to make the contribution it can to international telecommunications and communications in the EU, the unions must live in the real world.</P>
      <P>I fear Telecom Éireann will turn into another Aer Lingus.  Whatever attraction there is for outside investment in the company at present, it will disappear if we continue down this road.  Now is the time to seek investment.  One aspect of the Minister's speech with which I disagreed was when he said he would get a report in six months.  He said he asked the board to draw up a full list of potential partners.  I agree this should be done, but we should look at not only one partner, Cable and Wireless, but at all potential partners.  Why will it take six months to compile this report?  I believe I know the reason.  It relates to 9 June; I do not know how the Labour Party can face the electorate in a European election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was about to agree with what Senator Cassidy said about technology, but I am reviewing my position on that matter.  This report will arrive after 9 June in order to avoid embarrassment for the Labour Party on door steps.</P>
      <P>The Minister should allow a stake in the overall company, not only a 25 per cent stake.  Whatever happens, the company should repay the Exchequer the £1.1 billion invested in 1979 &mdash; it would amount to approximately £2 billion today &mdash; which it borrowed and guaranteed. What is the status of the pension fund? What is the State's liability in this regard? How secure are those in that pension fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> I agree with Senator Cassidy about technology.  The world is changing, we are now involved in fibre optics and we will shortly be able to make telephone calls from airplanes in the sky &mdash; perhaps this can be done now.  Technology is advancing at a considerable rate and if we are not part of that, we will be left behind.  We must find partners because in 20 years I guarantee European telecommunications will be controlled by three or four companies and Telecom Éireann will be wiped out.</P>

On each occasion State companies are examined in the House, Senator Ross arrives with a black cloak and a shovel to bury the company and its employees.

Senator Neville said the facilities enjoyed by the people, a telephone network and a telecommunications system of a high international standard, should be maintained and people in the west and in Kerry should have a good telephone system.  That is something with which the Government agrees.  On the other hand, Senator Ross said, if it does not pay, cut it out.  That is what is done on the Stock Exchange.  What kind of a strategic alliance was it when Senator Ross used <Col N="1310" /> that expression, which has not been lifted by the Labour Party?</P>

      <P>Our rebalancing of Telecom's charges was not easy or publicly acceptable for a while.  Opposition to it was aided and abetted by Members on the other side.  This was one of the first necessary steps to ensure Telecom remained in business in a competitive way but the move was totally and utterly derided by the Opposition.  Senator Ross trooped through the division lobby with his head low because he did not believe in this stand.  I do not blame him for this, we all have to do it from time to time but at least he does it with style.</P>
      <P>In referring to Cable and Wireless, Senator Neville gave the example of Hong Kong of all places.  The Chinese are outside the door and will be taking Hong Kong back.  If I owned anything in Hong Kong I would be open to selling it and taking off.  The idea that the conditions in which Cable and Wireless went into Hong Kong would apply to Ireland is nonsense.

      <P>Obviously there are difficulties in the Government about this and no wonder because the Labour Party has a long record of putting its ideology before the people on this issue; until recently it did not harbour such ideas.  It is incredible to watch its gymnastics.  It says some of the company will be sold to private enterprise but this does not constitute privatisation.  A whole new vocabulary will be developed over time and Labour will create a new political ethos in their efforts to paper over the cracks.  The debate is interesting from this point of view.  It gives Labour an opportunity to squirm further and to prove it is not in breach of the national plan or its ideology but it will fail on both counts.  Most people can read and know exactly where Labour stands on issues like this and what is included in the Programme for a Partnership Government. Fianna Fáil is well practised in the affairs <Col N="1314" /> of Government, is well able to shift its ideology when it suits it and has got Labour into a serious position.  Labour has added to this by not facing up to it. The intention is to sell a slice of Telecom into private hands.  This means privatisation. We can call it all sorts of other names but it still means privatisation.</P>
      <P>This debate gives us an opportunity to look at the semi-State sector, why things go wrong, why the public is convinced that it and the Civil Service are failures and that productivity is not possible at this level.  This is a commonly held view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>By people in general. Those who say this is not so are talking through their hats.  One reason for this is that the Civil Service has to hide behind Ministers and politicians and never gets a chance to show its worth.  It should be given this chance.  We were promised open and a different approach to government. This should include allowing top civil servants to speak out on issues and options and to show they are intelligent beings, which they are.  People never see or hear them.  This is why people denigrate the Civil Service and the public sector in general.  Civil servants are invisible, they are not able to put their personalities, views or options before the people and as a result, they come in for much criticism.  It would be interesting if they were able to elucidate -</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The other element of the debate which was truly interesting was the wide gulf which now exists between the provisional and official wings of Fine Gael, to which I will return in a moment.</P>
      <P>Whenever we come to this or the other House to discuss State enterprise it seems we continuously lose sight of why this nation got involved in State enterprise. It is worth reminding ourselves why from time to time.  There is a whole variety of reasons.  There is the failure of the private sector in the cases of ACC, ICC and the ESB; the need to develop resources with companies such as Bord na Móna; the need to give employment with companies such as the sugar company; to save employment with Irish Steel; to overcome the excesses of private capital, as in the case of NET.  There is the lack of interest from the private sector, which was the reason we got into Aer Lingus; strategic considerations in the case of Irish Shipping; wealth distribution &mdash; and I could go on.</P>
      <P>Pragmatism has always been at the base of this State's involvement in public enterprise.  We have never been involved in the State sector for ideological reasons. I cannot understand why we should get excited about the prospect of a State company either involving or ultimately being sold to private capital.  The relationship between this State and the commercial State enterprises has always been an <i>ad hoc</i> one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State enterprises have been undermined by three major considerations. The first was the control relationship between central Departments and the State sponsored bodies.  It was never clearly established exactly how we were <Col N="1318" /> to handle our relationship with these strange beings.  This confusion is seen nowhere more clearly than in the relationship between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the State sponsored bodies.  We have a committee on State sponsored bodies and, as I understand it, we have discussed a report on only one occasion in the last 15 years.  That is how much interest we take in the State-sponsored sector.  Of course, we debate State-sponsored bodies when there is an opportunity for one party to embarrass another.</P>
    <P>The second reality which the State-sponsored bodies have always had to deal with, particularly the commercial ones, are their historically poor financial performance. For most years the performance has been abysmal and over the last 15 or 20 years the contribution from our State-sponsored sector has been negative.  It is time that we had a cold, hard, dispassionate look at this sector.</P>
    <P>The third and most difficult reality which the State-sponsored sector has ever had to deal with is the appalling lack of a financial structure.  We have always failed in this regard.  The State and all parties have been willing to pat the State sponsored sector on the back but we have never been willing to give them the capital to get the job done.  As a result we have State-sponsored bodies which are grotesquely over borrowed, with a huge burden of debt, and are capitalised in a way which is bizarre and could not exist if they were not under the State flag.</P>
    <P>In the case of Telecom Éireann it is vital that alliances &mdash; or whatever other word we wish to use &mdash; be sought if the company is to hold its own, let alone enter competition when that becomes a reality because of EU interventions.  If Telecom Éireann is to gear itself up to new technologies, let alone defend itself from competition, it is vital for it to look for strong partners.</P>
    <P>We all know that Telecom Éireann can only get the money from one of three sources: its own resources &mdash; and we can imagine the screams and protests here if we tried to give Telecom Éireann a billing system which would allow it to build up its own resources &mdash; or borrowing from the marketplace and, as other Senators <Col N="1319" /> have said, the company is so heavily over borrowed that that is not a reality.  Therefore, the only available option is capital injections.  I would not go as far as Senator Dardis and suggest that we sell the lot, because that would be a fundamental mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear correctly.  I thought that the Senator said &ldquo;part or the lot&rdquo;, but I accept that he said &ldquo;part of the lot&rdquo;.  He said &ldquo;the lot&rdquo; at one stage, but we will leave that.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the only option which anyone approaching this in a sane way sees as workable is to involve some form of outside capital in this company.  A joint arrangement with a major player such as Cable and Wireless or some other player in the international communications industry is clearly an attractive option for Telecom Éireann.  It is wrong, given that we do not know how this will ultimately pan out, that Members of this or the other House should try to scaremonger, cloud the issue and conjure up ghosts and ghouls which do not exist.  It is a grave disservice to the nation and an even graver one to the people who work in Telecom Éireann because, as we all know, it is difficult for people to take a challenge to their position or security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole approach to this debate has been not just ludicrous but mean spirited. All we have witnessed here tonight from the Opposition parties is an attempt to conjure up difficulties for Telecom Éireann which do not exist.  The reality is not that they want to look after the interests of Telecom Éireann but that they want to embarrass a political party. Fine Gael's motion speaks of confusion. Nowhere was confusion more visible than in the first two contributions from that party.  Senator Ross on one hand is quite willing &mdash; it is on the public record &mdash; to chop chunks off Telecom Éireann.  If it is <Col N="1320" /> required, he suggests we should let 4,000 people go.</P>

What I did hear and what anybody who cares to read the record will see was confusion heaped upon confusion &mdash; state of the art confusion from that side of the House.

      <P>The reality is that the motion put forward by Fine Gael is pure humbug.  We have to live in the real world and accept that companies like Telecom Éireann have to look for alliances.  They have to look for strategic arrangements, otherwise those companies will go to the wall.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to my constituency colleague, Senator Roche, who nearly gave me a heart attack at the beginning of his speech because he started by being constructive.  He actually began by talking about semi-State bodies and for the first time in this Chamber he spoke a few lines of sense, which will jump out from the pages of the Official Report when people read the history of this session. Senator Roche talked about pragmatism. I admire Senator Roche and his pragmatism. <Col N="1322" /> There is a case for pragmatism in semi-State bodies.</P>

      <P>If they believed in the pragmatic approach on which Senator Roche was lecturing them and to which they did not listen, they would not have an ideological hang up about semi-State bodies.  They should note that semi-State bodies have had, what Senator Roche correctly called, a negative performance throughout the history of this State and act accordingly.  Unfortunately, all we had from the Government side was an attack on the Opposition, because there is no Government policy on this.  All we have from the two parties is the complacency which has existed in the semi-State sector since time immemorial.  It is no good for either of them to say that we are contriving difficulties which do not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Magner has realised that Aer Lingus was making a profit three or four years ago.  Telecom Éireann is making a &ldquo;profit&rdquo; but it is doing so because it is paying off so little of its debt. If it paid off more of its debt, it would immediately go into a loss making situation. We have not considered the almost terminal situation which exists at Telecom Éireann.  I was disheartened by the fact that Senator Roche was prepared <Col N="1323" /> to put his woolly head in the sand throughout the debate, as were all the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say <i>touché</i> to that, Senator Roche, but I will give you that. The complacency is disheartening.  We have not faced the bare figures at Telecom Éireann which are so discouraging. Last year Telecom Éireann made a £50 million profit which could easily, with its figures and turnover, have turned into a loss.  It apparently intends to pay no dividend to the Government, which should not make those who believe in State investment particularly happy.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann excuses its small profit last year by saying it had to write off over £40 million following foreign exchange losses during devaluation.  Why did Telecom Éireann not sell its Irish pounds like anybody with any sense did? The reason is simple.  Telecom Éireann was not allowed to because it was under Government pressure, as are all semi-State bodies, to behave in a certain way. It was not allowed sell Irish pounds because that was what the Labour Party would have called unpatriotic.  One has to sit on £40 million losses in order to be patriotic and the taxpayer pays the bill. That is not a commercial way of running a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecom Éireann is competing in what the Labour Party calls the market place with others who do not have to behave in that way.  That is not a tolerable, commercial or viable way to behave in the commercial market.  Telecom will have to mend its ways.  It is also running a current problem which I have not seen properly addressed by anybody.  The company admits that to keep up with modern technology, it has to make <Col N="1324" /> between £160 million and £200 million a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Convent of Mercy's Holy Family primary school in Ennis is one of the largest schools in County Clare.  It is situated in the county's principal town and provides hundreds of children with an education.  The Holy Family school hall &mdash; the assembly hall for the school &mdash; was built over 30 years ago.  Now the entire premises needs to be rewired and the electrical equipment replaced.  This work needs to be done urgently because the safety standards are below par and do not comply with required standards.  The school manager, the board of management and the principal have made a submission to the Department for grant assistance towards re-equipping and rewiring the hall.</P>
      <P>I wish to impress on the Minister the importance of this facility, not just for education in County Clare but also for recreational, artistic, and entertainment purposes.  The Holy Family school hall is not just used as an assembly area for the school itself but is also available to groups doing voluntary work, including drama and musical societies, the fleadh cheoil, etc.  You name it and the Holy Family school is prepared to accommodate such activity.  If the school was not available, many cultural activities would not take place in Ennis.  It is because the school is there, and the board of management is prepared to make it available to the public, that such entertainment facilities can proceed.  In fact, as we speak, the curtains are about to be drawn on the Ennis Musical Society's show <i>South Pacific</i> which was playing for ten days. The society is very successful and puts on a musical every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again wish to convey to the Minister the importance of the school hall facility not just for educational purposes but also for all sorts of community activities.  I am <Col N="1327" /> sure eputy Aylward, in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Education, recognises the importance of such facilities to the broader public. There is between £30,000 and £40,000 worth of work to be done and the board of management is not in a financial position to meet this expense.  It is important that the board receive assistance from the Department of Education and I am requesting the Minister to prioritise this matter at a high level because unless the Department comes up with the necessary finance the school will not be in a position to undertake the necessary work.  It would be regrettable if this hall was not available to the public, and the school authorities, for recreational and assembly purposes.  I ask the Minister to look on us favourably and to come up with the necessary funding.  The Minister has been very co-operative concerning many issues in the county in the past and I look forward to his co-operation and support on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for affording me the opportunity to speak briefly on this matter.  I also wish to thank the Minister of State for coming here.  This question has already been raised with the Minister and there has been a negative response from the Department.  I can understand the reasoning behind the Department's refusal to deal with this application. Nevertheless, in view of the case that has been made by Senator Taylor-Quinn and others, including the management of the Holy Family school hall, the Minister might reconsider the decision and make a small allocation to improve and replace some of the electric equipment in particular which is a cause of anxiety for those holding events in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the school's location is not far from the GAA facility to which he recently granted in excess of £100,000 for its development. While the Minister deserves congratulations for that, he will agree that the facilities in the Holy Family hall are a necessity.  Although there are financial constraints on the Minister, it might be <Col N="1328" /> possible to find some way in which financial assistance might be provided for this hall.  It is most desirable that this work be carried out as the facility is of great value to Ennis and the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>The Minister administers an amenity grant scheme.  Perhaps he would consider an application under the amenities scheme because this hall is an important amenity in addition to being an asset to the educational establishment in Ennis. I understand that the closing date for applications under that scheme is past but the Minister might consider an application for a small amenity grant at this late stage.  We would be satisfied with funding from either the primary education budget or the recreation and leisure grant scheme as long as the work is completed.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for giving me the opportunity to make my point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Daly for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to explain the circumstances in which the question of grant aid towards the cost of replacing the lighting and electrical fixtures at the Holy Family school hall, Convent of Mercy, Ennis, County Clare, is being considered.</P>
      <P>The application for grant aid relates to the school hall which I understand has stage and dressing room facilities, can cater for large audiences and is used by many professional and community based groups in the county.  Further to the receipt of the school's application, the Department's professional advisers inspected the school hall and furnished a report which indicated that the electrical and lighting fixtures were part of stage lighting.  The provision of a stage or stage lighting is not a normal facility in general purposes rooms or school halls and has not been included in the planning and design of such buildings for primary schools.  Consequently it has been the policy not to grant aid such additional facilities where they have been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> The moneys available under the primary school capital programme are targeted towards the provision of necessary additional classroom accommodation and towards the upgrading of sub-standard premises generally.  The Senators will appreciate that the need for fair and equitable allocation of scarce resources will dictate that this general approach should be continued.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, while I recognise the importance of the school hall as a community facility, I regret that financial assistance for the work in question may not be made available under the Department's primary capital programme. Consequently, financial assistance towards the cost of building or maintaining such a facility in the Holy Family primary school hall is not available from the Department's primary school buildings grants scheme.</P>
    <P>However, I have noted the Senators' comments and particularly Senator Daly's reference to the recreation and sporting amenity grants scheme. Although there are thousands of applications in the Department as the closing date was last Friday, I would consider an application for this community based facility.  Perhaps we could talk together about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter on the Adjournment. There has been a major problem during recent years in the south Galway area due to flooding.  The flooding in south Galway is unusual in that most other <Col N="1330" /> areas of the country which are noted for heavy flooding have not experienced it to the same extent as south Galway.</P>
      <P>The problem in south Galway arises due to the karst limestone geology of the area.  There are many underground water courses and swallow holes, the most famous being the lake in Coole which found fame in the poem &ldquo;The Wild Swans of Coole&rdquo; by W.B. Yeats.  The water level of the lake rises in the winter as a result of underground water sources. Four years ago and this year the water level was much higher than at any time in the past.  It is difficult to understand why the level has increased, although a number of reasons have been put forward. One reason offered is that as a result of the drainage of many thousands of acres of the Slieve Aughty mountains by Coillte for forestry development, water gets to this part of the county more quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have seen the effect of the flooding on television.  Thousands of acres have been covered in water and people have had to leave their homes. The Geological Survey Office has issued a report on the flooding and has given an indication of what must be done to alleviate it.  I ask the Office of Public Works to take that report on board and to initiate a development proposal.  The proposal would, in the first instance, open the swallow holes to allow the water to travel faster into the underground caverns. Second, the Office of Public Works could look at the possibility of cutting a channel which would be piped from the Coole lake to the sea in Kinvara, a distance of about five miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will probably say this is not the responsibility of the Office of Public Works under the 1945 legislation. However, it is not the responsibility of any other Department because it does not come under the heading of arterial drainage.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has informed me that it is not that Department's responsibility.  The Department of the Environment and the county council have also disclaimed responsibility.  It is a major problem.  The Taoiseach's involvement is also being sought.  In that context, I hope the Office of Public <Col N="1331" /> Works can be allocated extra money to open one of the swallow holes on a trial basis.  That would not cost an enormous amount of money.  Second, a plan for a piped channel between Coole and Kinvara should be drawn up and costed.</P>
    <P>Unless remedial action is taken, roads, houses and thousands of acres of land will continue to be flooded.  People have to travel as many as nine miles further than usual to avoid flooded roads in the Shanaglish area in Gort and in the Peterswell area.  The national primary road near Kiltartan was flooded for a period during the recent rains.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for listening and I hope my comments will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fahey for raising this matter. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is unable to attend this evening and he asked me to reply on his behalf.</P>
      <P>As you are no doubt aware, the Commissioners of Public Works are the statutory authority charged with responsibility for arterial drainage pursuant to the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  In their endeavours since the passing of the Act, the commissioners have provided substantial improvement in conditions to more than 650,000 acres of land previously subject to periodic flooding or waterlogging.</P>
      <P>Schemes carried out to date, which number well in excess of 40, are geographically widespread and cover most of the Twenty-six Counties, not least Galway.  However, the south Galway area is fairly unique in its geological formation. Limestone in the area has been subject to a process called Karstification with all its inherent distinctive and unusual features, such as swallow holes, sparse and intermittent streams, bare rock, large underground caves, springs and turloughs.  Most of the rainfall in this particular area disappears underground shortly after the numerous streams flowing down from Slieve Aughty reach the cavernous limestone where it must flow underground to Galway Bay as there is no surface outlet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> A report prepared by the Geological Survey of Ireland in 1992 shows that the underground drainage system consists of swallow holes where the water enters the ground, caverns and conduits in which the water flows and risings or springs where the water re-emerges.  The capacity of the underground drainage system depends on the size of the conduits and caverns and the degree of clogging of the conduits.</P>
    <P>While the report refers to a number of possible ways of alleviating flooding, it concludes that the construction of extensive drainage channels or tunnels is not a viable option.  The cost is likely to be enormous as virtually all the work must be undertaken through rock and the impact on the environment is likely to be excessive.  The report also concludes that such a scheme would be difficult to undertake successfully.</P>
    <P>With regard to the environment, it will do no harm to point out that the area contains many areas of scientific interest or national heritage areas, a number of wetlands of national and international importance and, of course, the extensive nature reserve at Coole.  Any scheme for the improvement of drainage or the relief of flooding in the area would need to have the strictest regard for the serious adverse effects it would most likely have on these areas.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Dunkellin and Lavally rivers in the extreme north of the area in question, which have not so far been treated under the 1945 Act, none of the rivers or streams flowing through this limestone region is included in the national arterial drainage programme of the Commissioners of Public Works.  In all circumstances, the Minister has no power to provide for works in the area in the commissioners' 1994 Estimate.</P>
    <P>I will inform the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Dempsey, of Senator Fahey's points and he can discuss them with him directly.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.13 p.m until 10.30 a.m on Thursday, 10 March 1994.</P>
