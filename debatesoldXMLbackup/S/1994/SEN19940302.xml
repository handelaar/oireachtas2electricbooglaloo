      <P>I have notice from Senator McDonagh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to declare the parish of Moycullen, County Galway, a common school transport area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The negotiations currently being conducted between the Irish and US Governments in relation to immigration pre-clearance in Ireland, and, in particular, the present facility at Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, the Committee Stage of the Road Traffic Bill until 6 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Item 33 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  The Adjournment Matters will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the Order of Business.  In view of the developments over the weekend and statements by the Ulster Unionist Party, I ask for an early resumption of Item 9, Statements on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also ask for time tomorrow or early next week for a discussion on the National Development Plan and its redrafting in view of the crisis which has arisen.  One paper this morning described the Government as occupying its own version of cloud cuckooland in relation to the allocation of Structural Funds.  I ask the Leader to provide time for an early debate to clarify the situation and allow the House to express its views on the redrafted national plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the need for a debate on a number of issues, including the Programme for Competitiveness and Work and a commitment was given that this would take place, probably late this week or next week.  I wish to have this confirmed.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a discussion on Bosnia.  It is interesting that the major players around the world are now welcoming the proposals for a federated state in Bosnia.  Of all countries, we should recognise that the partitioning of a country on a sectarian basis can never be welcomed and reflects nothing but defeat on the best efforts of the world.  I ask for an early discussion of this issue and for a recognition that we sought intervention by the UN, not by NATO. Bosnia has been ignored by the West and the situation there is getting worse.  We should have learned from our history that partition on a sectarian basis does not work and creates a problem worse than the existing one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time at the earliest opportunity to debate the National Development Plan.  My state of confusion on this matter is such that I am in urgent need of clarification &mdash; if that is the word one may use in this context.  It would be useful if the Taoiseach came to the House and told us exactly how much is in the bag, having <Col N="843" /> previously told us there was £8 billion there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful if we could establish how much is involved; it would be a useful beginning in terms of submitting the plan.  I also support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on Item 7 which refers to the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  I was under the impression we were to debate it this week.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland given the change in circumstances and, given the fact that over the weekend it seemed that people who have only 2 per cent of the national vote could command so great a percentage of our national airwaves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for an early debate on the upsurge of violence over the weekend in the Middle East. This has put back the peace process.  The Leader should make overtures to the American Ambassador in Ireland urging the Americans to put pressure on their citizens in Israel.  Everybody involved in the attacks on the Palestinians in Hebron carries American and Israeli passports. It is necessary to have an early debate on that matter.  Every pressure should be put on the United States to try to resolve the problems in that area.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville referred to cloud cuckooland and the redeployment of money in the national plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Does the Senator have a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume there has been a certain redeployment of figures in cloud cuckooland on the other side of the House also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished and distressed by Senator Dardis's accusations of &ldquo;baggery&rdquo; against members of the Government which I am sure are misplaced. With regard to the situation in <Col N="844" /> the Middle East, I agree with Senator Lanigan and would support a debate on that subject.  I fully agree with him about the identity of the attackers.  As soon as I heard of this outrage in Hebron I felt it was a member of Meir Kahane's grouping.</P>
      <P>The Leader kindly gave an undertaking that we would have a discussion of the situation in East Timor.  Could he give us a date?  I understand there may be some news on that issue for the House, particularly in light of the criminal involvement of the Australian Government in this genocide.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader inform the House whether the Government intends to be represented at the St.  Patrick's Day parade in New York, which has been declared by a court in the United States to be a sectarian event controlled entirely by the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New York&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in again requesting the Leader to arrange an early debate on the problems in the North.  We have passed a few markers, such as the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis and the unionists have issued a document. This House should have an opportunity to respond because Members are aware that the situation on the ground has not been improving.  While negotiations are going on and the Downing Street declaration is being considered, lives are being lost.  The movement of the population in the North is very restricted. <Col N="845" /> Business is not coming to the North; even my county is being seriously affected by the trouble in the North.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to put this item as high as possible on his agenda because there is no other issue on this island which merits discussion more.  I am prepared to support the Taoiseach in saying that we will wait if we believe there is a hope of peace at the end of the road. However, every sign indicates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has had a great deal of leeway and has put his question which I am sure the Leader will take on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe a debate on this topic would be helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Chair that I will not make a speech but I strongly support Senator Neville's appeal for another day of statements on Northern Ireland in the near future.  The position is deteriorating by the day, and not just in Northern Ireland.  The weekend's news from Tallaght in itself demands a debate in this House.  I urge the Leader to put it on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already evidence in my area of plans for the development of roads or sanitary services being shelved.  In view of that, it is urgent that there should be a debate on the revised National Development Plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Union of Students in Ireland are currently protesting outside the gates of this House about the appointment of a receiver to pay the SPUC legal fees, which come to £29,000. This matter cannot be ignored.  The union brought this issue to the attention of the public.  Any test case that does that deserves credit.  We had a referendum as a result of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Well said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the view of the public or the Members of the House, the Union of Students in Ireland provide good services for those coming from the country by helping them get their grants, to find accommodation, etc.  I am concerned for the future of the union if it is forced to pay that money.  Therefore, I ask for a debate on the benefit of test cases and how they are to be funded in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my colleagues will join with me in wishing Senator Neville well in his new position as Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader agree to a debate on the Structural Funds so that we can lift the Celtic mists of depression, as expressed by Senator Dardis and Senator Sherlock?  Any help this Government can get to spend over £7 billion will be more than welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I urgently ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on the Structural Funds.  If the Taoiseach cannot attend, I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy E. Fitzgerald will.  This reminds me of the film &ldquo;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&rdquo;; in this case it should be &ldquo;honey, she shrunk the billions&rdquo;.  There is an urgent need for a debate on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked for a debate on the enlargement of the European Union on a few occasions.  As the process is now almost complete, perhaps we could have this debate as soon as possible. I am surprised a Senator from the Progressive Democrats does not even know about it.</P>
      <P>The protest by the Union of Students in Ireland was raised by Senator Gallagher. It would be better for those students if they studied and stopped wasting their parents' time and taxpayers' money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader give time to debate the Structural Funds débâcle?  Senator Dardis said he does not know what is left in the bag.  Maybe the Government is using large nets which are letting all the fish through and this may be where the money went.  It may be of benefit if the Tánaiste brought a monofilament net with him.  He might then at least be able to catch and hold all he has got.  It was obvious that £1 billion was lost when Senator Magner was away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I add my congratulations to Senator Neville on his appointment as Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>A debate on Northern Ireland will be held as soon as possible; it is currently under discussion.  This side of the House would welcome an opportunity to debate the current state of the National Development Plan but I am sure the Opposition will have Private Members' time to arrange for such a debate.</P>
      <P>The Whips will arrange a debate on the PCW and on Bosnia for next week. Many other issues were raised which could be taken up at other times and I will come back to them.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 28 and 30 are consequential on amendment No. 2 and may be discussed together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 provide for the deletion of paragraph (c) of the definition of &ldquo;reserved functions&rdquo;. Amendments Nos. 28 and 30 are consequential changes to sections 35 and 36 of the Bill.  They are purely technical drafting amendments and they are being moved on the advice of the Attorney General's Office.  They do not involve any change in substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was this requirement not recognised when the Bill was being drafted?  On Second Stage I complimented the Minister's willingness to make a number of changes and to accept amendments during the passage of the Bill through the other House.</P>
      <P>A number of amendments were introduced by the Minister during subsequent Stages in the other House and today he has also introduced a substantial list of amendments.  This indicates &mdash; and I would like the Minister's observation on it &mdash; that, even in his own mind, there must be large question marks over the manner in which the Bill has been drafted. It will now be necessary, on the acceptance by this House of these amendments, for this Bill to return to the Dáil. By the time the Bill is approved by the Dáil, it will be a different Bill in most respects to that introduced in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As somebody who has considerable reservations about the implications of other parts of the Bill, I ask the Minister if the Bill was conceived, drafted and <Col N="849" /> produced in such haste that it is now necessary to make major changes?  If he has found that to be necessary I suggest that he also approach the amendments from this side of the House with an open mind in view of the manner in which the Bill has been so radically changed since it was first introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject Senator Howard's contention that this Bill has been changed dramatically.  As he knows, it is part of my task in the Dáil and in the Seanad to take account of Members' views.  If one was to carry his argument to a logical conclusion, he is saying indirectly that I should not take account of those views but should leave the Bill as it is.</P>
      <P>I hope the changes I adopted in the other House on foot of amendments put forward by myself and Members of the Opposition, together with amendments which I am putting forward here, will produce a much better Road Traffic Act. The Senator will appreciate that for a long time there has been a war of attrition in terms of what was happening in the courts in relation to road traffic legislation. A number of very technical matters were raised in the courts which allowed people who had obviously transgressed the law to go free.  We have closed off a series of these loopholes and, in general, the Bill has been welcomed by all sides of both Houses.</P>
      <P>We are now ensuring that when the Bill is finally passed all those necessary technical drafting amendments and any other substantial changes which we deem to be necessary at this stage are put in place.  It is not a question of rushing the legislation or of bringing it in without due thought; it is simply the due process of public representatives in their capacity as Members of the Oireachtas having a natural input into what is happening. Members should be complimenting the Minister for the Environment for being open and reasonable and for listening to their views rather than criticising him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague Senator Howard.  His general comments <Col N="850" /> are as relevant to this amendment and this section as they are to the Bill in general.  This Bill has been through the other House, through a Special Committee and through Second Stage here, yet we are still getting amendments.  In the light of what has happened in recent times &mdash; we will not go into the National Development Plan here &mdash; it would appear that this Government is rushing into various announcements and putting forward legislation without doing the groundwork.  I do not know whether this is to do with difficulties with the Attorney General, who has already come to the fore in relation to legislation which has been tested and fallen foul in another quarter.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been brought forward and many of us support the intent behind many aspects of it.  Whether some of these matters needed a new Road Traffic Bill must be questioned.  There must be something wrong if, under the law muggers, rapists and murderers have rights but under this legislation, it appears those same rights will not be granted to individuals.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be examined in detail again.  Several months have passed since we debated the Bill in this House, yet various amendments arrived as recently as yesterday as to what is probably a technical part of the Bill.  In this legislation many tried and trusted practices have been changed.  Is the balance wrong in relation to various crimes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments refer specifically to this amendment which is part of a section of a Bill which is being introduced in haste and has not been properly thought out.  The comments I <Col N="851" /> make on this section will also apply to other sections in the Bill.</P>
      <P>When did the Minister get his advice because this Bill has been in circulation for some time?  Did the Attorney General only wake up last week to the various issues in this legislation?  This Bill was dealt with by a Select Committee on 29 September and in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  Did the Attorney General advise the Minister about this section in the latter stages or after certain people spoke to the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response to my contribution because he now accepts that this Bill must return to the Dáil.  The Minister also indicated that many changes were made in response to points raised during the debate.  This indicates a willingness to look at the amendments which a number of Senators will be putting forward in the course of the debate.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the other side of the House to the Bill is extraordinary. The Minister has been accused of not wanting to listen to arguments, yet, he has been complimented by judges on his attitude to this Bill.  He is listening and he has made it clear to those on the other side of the House that amendments will be looked at.  The tone of the debate has been extraordinary from the beginning. We should try to make progress.</P>

      <P>This amendment is reasonable and we are happy to accept it.  Amendments have been tabled by various Senators, including Senator Henry, ourselves, and the Government and we are able to accept many of them.  Most of this Bill will be beneficial.  We have been helpful and co-operative in relation to this Bill and that should be borne in mind by the Minister and by Senator Wright.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 provides for the repeal of an additional subsection of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, that is, section 118 (7).  That subsection provides that proceedings for an offence of making a false declaration in connection with an application for a licence or a certificate may be instituted within 12 months and is inconsistent with the provisions in section 48 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 33 and 35 are amendments to section 48 of the Bill. Summary proceedings must normally be instituted within six months from the date <Col N="856" /> of the offence in accordance with section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  While six months is the standard time limit for taking prosecutions for summary offences, existing road traffic law provides for an extended period of 12 months in respect of offences involving fraud in obtaining a policy of insurance or for making false declarations.  The period of 12 months allowed in those cases is frequently insufficient particularly when the fraud or false declaration is not detected for some time.</P>
    <P>Section 48 of the Bill was designed to allow a longer time period in such cases. It provides that proceedings must be instituted either within six months of the offence or within three months from the date the necessary evidence of the offence was obtained, whichever is the later but subject to a maximum period of three years.  During the debate in the Dáil concern was expressed that this provision could be used to take proceedings up to three years after a standard motoring offence.  That was never the intention of the Bill and I undertook to consider the point.</P>
    <P>In my contribution on Second Stage in this House on 14 December 1993 I raised this issue and undertook to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to clarify the issue.  This group of amendments gives effect to that commitment. The amendments specifically state that the only circumstances in which proceedings can be instituted after six months are offences under section 64 of the 1961 Act involving fraud in obtaining an insurance policy and offences under section 115 of the 1961 Act involving false declarations in obtaining a licence or certificate.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to return to what I said on Second Stage as I fear that keeping my commitment to fulfil the promises I gave then will cause problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this issue on Second Stage and I compliment the Minister for acting on it.  It will be a cause for relief for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not read the amendments in conjunction with the Principal Act but I <Col N="857" /> accept the Minister's explanation that the three year provision can only relate to the fraudulent offences to which he referred. Many people had a problem with the idea that a parking or similar offence could come back to haunt them three years after committing the offence.  I gave some lurid examples on Second Stage.  I welcome the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment and the Minister is aware of the level of concern about this matter.  It strikes me as wrong that summary proceedings could be brought up to a period of three years later.  At that stage the witness in the dock would have considerable difficulty remembering the events of the time and, even from that practical point of view, the six month limit is to be welcomed.  John Boland made the point in an article which I imagine was influential in amending this law that justice delayed was justice denied.  That is a sound principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify if there are offences for which there is up to 12 months during which a prosecution can be taken or if summary proceedings are now limited to six months.  The Minister mentioned a 12 month period in his opening remarks, and I am not clear as to the precise conditions under which summary proceedings could be taken.  I <Col N="858" /> understood it to mean a period of six months but I was not clear on the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this amendment, an insurance policy is totally void if there is fraud involved or where wrong information of any type is given, or if wrong information is furnished in obtaining a driving licence.  The investigation of such a fraud can take some time.  The Minister has pointed out that there are occasions when it may take some time to discover that such a fraud has been perpetrated.  This amendment and the idea behind the Minister's proposal are worthy of support.</P>
      <P>I was concerned about the extension of the time and there was a proposal to limit it to three years in which to bring summary proceedings.  That would have been of concern to everybody because it is almost impossible to recollect an event after such a long period.  A person might not have been aware that an offence was being committed and may suddenly find they are facing a summons.  That would have had a serious detrimental effect on the system of procedures as we know it; it would have clogged up the system. This amendment relates specifically to offences of fraud in relation to insurance or driving licences and is to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>I can readily understand reservations about extending the time period for ordinary motoring offences.  I was not and am not now proposing that, but I want to put beyond doubt that we are dealing with offences of fraud or false declaration.  Proceedings must be instituted within three months after the evidence is produced.  The period for producing the evidence could be as long as three years.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult to cover every contingency in this Bill. However we should place an onus on insurance companies when accepting certain <Col N="859" /> applications for insurance.  An examination should be made of the registration number of the vehicle, the type of vehicle and, perhaps, the chassis number.  On occasion, insurance companies accept insurance applications but if they discover an error, they disclaim responsibility. I will raise this issue again but I ask the Minister to give it attention.  This can happen through no fault of the individual.</P>
      <P>Question agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 reads: &ldquo;&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; includes any operation used in determining the concentration of alcohol in a specimen of breath, blood or urine....&rdquo;  I am concerned about the use of the words &ldquo;includes any operation&rdquo;.  That is open ended and it should be possible for the Minister and his Department to be specific about the operation or operations now available to establish what is required.  I ask the Minister to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Analysis is defined as any operation used to ascertain the concentration of alcohol in a specimen of breath, blood or urine and any operation used to ascertain the presence of a drug or drugs in a specimen of blood or urine. This definition differs slightly from that in section 9 of the 1978 Act in that it has been extended to include the testing of blood for the presence of drugs.  I take it that Senator Howard has no objection to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue because this section contains the first mention of designated doctors.  I hope a plentiful supply of doctors is found because one of the main reasons many drunk driving cases fail is the lack of available designated <Col N="860" /> doctors.  The Minister may not be responsible for this; it may fall within the remit of the Department of Justice. Nonetheless, this is a serious problem, especially in country areas and someone must address the matter.  The training of such doctors is also important.  The medical profession have sought the appointment of a sufficient number of properly trained doctors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In important legislation such as this it is necessary to secure all components to the maximum possible extent, whether Garda activities and medical involvement.  Over the next few years as evidential breath testing evolves, some of those pressures will be reduced. In the interim it is essential to have a guarantee of the greatest commitment to ensure we bring people to court and to justice when they are obviously breaking the law.</P>

      <P>Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill refer to breath specimens.  Is the Minister in a position to comment on the success of the breath testing procedure which was used as the final evidence, as regards procedures in Britain?  My understanding of the situation in Britain is that there have been thousands of cases thrown out because of the unsatisfactory nature of convictions with regard to breath testing.</P>

Would they lead to an automatic disqualification for a two year period and the necessity to sit a driving test subsequently? The section refers only to the fine and the imprisonment period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to appear to be nit-picking but I refer again to the words I mentioned earlier, analysis &ldquo;includes any operation&rdquo;.  I presume this means a mechanical or a chemical test, or something of that nature.  I am happy for this legislation to validate the existing processes.  However, it may be that we are giving open season to a type of testing that might emerge in the future.  I want to draw a line at the methods and type of testing that exist at present.  If this legislation is required to give legality to that, that is fine.  However, this provides validity to any future method of testing that may emerge.  This is a dangerous precedent to include in this or in any other legislation.  I require clarification from the Minister on this point.  Will including these words in this section have the effect without further examination by the Oireachtas, of giving legitimacy to different methods of testing that may arise in the future?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> Some have argued that it would be better to implement more stringently the current regulations, which is a strategic rather than a principled position. However, under this legislation somebody who has taken two pints of Guinness and is driving home will probably be over the limit and will be found to be in breach of the law.  There can be no argument about this straightforward, strategic political and principled decision by the Government.  The person can be fined up to £1,000 and imprisoned for up to six months, although some element of discretion is allowed.  However, there is no element of discretion in the provision whereby that person will automatically get a two year suspension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that this is a mandatory offence under the Second Schedule and that a disqualification is required for a given period.  The Second Schedule to the Bill lists the &ldquo;Offences under the <i>Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1993</i>, involving Consequential Disqualification Orders&rdquo;. Among the offences listed is &ldquo;An offence under section 49 of the Act&rdquo;.  This is dealt with in the section the House is currently debating.  This in turn refers back to section 26 of this Act which deals with disqualifications.  Section 26(1) states:</P>
      <P>Where a person is convicted of an offence specified in the Second Schedule to this Act, the court shall make an order... declaring him to be disqualified for holding a driving licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This appears to be mandatory on the basis of an offence under the Second Schedule which would include an offence under section 10 of this Bill, the section the House is discussing at present.  This person will therefore incur the same kind of punishment as somebody who is three, four or five times over the legal limit.  It is similar to playing Pontoon, where 22 is the limit, 22 is a million and so on, but it appears to be inherently wrong to administer the same level of punishment to somebody who is marginally over the <Col N="863" /> limit and to somebody who is grossly, obviously and five or six times over the limit, which is a level far beyond that contained in the section which the House is currently debating.  A person with 85 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood is going to be treated in the same manner as somebody who is 300 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, a situation which I often read of in the newspapers.</P>

      <P>This deals with alcohol, where an analysis is undertaken.  However, breath is included and this also pertains to section 10.  There must be a blood and urine test carried out to determine if there are drugs in the body.  This is something which is understandable and which we support.  I have reservations about the inclusion of breath in this context because of the factors involved in section 10.  I ask the Minister to consider these reservations.

      <P>Senators will be aware that evidential breath testing was first legislated for in the UK in 1981.  There was a long gestation period in which to have it successfully tested and in the meantime technological and scientific advance has been quite phenomenal. This has meant that by 1989 it became the normal process.  This legislation provides the necessary legal framework for its introduction in due course, but it now appears that there is little scientific doubt that the newly designed apparatus for evidential breath testing is phenomenally accurate.</P>

The overlap between sections can be confusing and I apologise, a Chathaoirligh, for my earlier remarks which were addressed to section 10 as I understood it was the <Col N="865" /> section then being considered.  I will defer my remarks on this matter until the House considers Senator Howard's amendment under section 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of provisions in section 10 which I support. The section reads:</P>
      <P>The following section is inserted in the Principal Act in substitution for section 49 of that Act:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;49.&mdash;(1) (a)  A person shall not drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while he is under the influence of an intoxicant...</P>
      <P>(b)  In this subsection &lsquo;intoxicant&rsquo; includes alcohol and drugs and any combination of drugs or of drugs and alcohol.</P>
      <P>These measures are welcome.  All Senators share the concern with efforts to minimise drunken driving and to rid the country of people who are drinking to excess and causing carnage and injury on the roads.</P>
      <P>From inquiries I have made regarding the situation in the UK, my understanding is that in the UK and across Europe there have been considerable problems regarding the breath test.  A driver is stopped and invited to blow into a breathalyser.  On the basis of this test alone, and without any urine or blood sample being procured, the person can be convicted of drunken driving.</P>
      <P>Following a conviction on a breath test alone, the person involved will lose his or her licence for two years, can be fined up to £1,000 and can be suspended from driving for that period.  Following this he or she must then undertake a test and until the test is passed will not hold a licence.  This will prevent the person concerned from driving for an indefinite period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into a disagreement with Senator Finneran. Section 10, which amends the Principal Act, will be the basis for further sections. As Senator O'Toole said, we are talking about someone who has had two drinks and may be marginally over the limit. Two breath tests are given and the lowest is discounted or used as a guide in court. If a person takes this test, it is used as evidence in court.  Once a garda gives evidence that the breath test exceeds a concentration of 35 microgrammes of alcohol or 100 millilitres of breath, the judge has no discretion in this regard.  He must automatically suspend the person's licence for two years and he may impose a fine of £1,000 or otherwise.  The person must pass a test before his licence can be returned.  A person who is a borderline case will be suspended.</P>
      <P>As this is such a serious offence carrying serious penalties, the normal procedure where a blood or urine sample is taken should be applied.  I do not oppose a situation where a blood or a urine sample is taken and tested or where a person is afforded that opportunity. However, when a machine, which may be right or if there may be a slight margin of error, decides, the defendant has no way of proving it was wrong.  Humans err, but so do machines.  I ask the Minister consider this matter.</P>
      <P>This is a fundamental change in the law where one test by a machine may decide a person's livelihood by leaving them without a driving licence.  We must weigh a person's right in this regard.  The Minister will know from my views on other issues that I am not a liberal. However, I ask him to carefully consider this matter.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the necessity for safety on the roads and commend the introduction of measures which will help to reduce the number of fatalities and serious injuries which occur, I had hoped the Minister would have addressed this problem in a more comprehensive manner by examining various factors, including drink, which contribute to tragedies on the roads.  Everyone condemns <Col N="867" /> drink driving and every Senator will support measures to curb it. However, there must be a distinction between a person drink driving and a person driving a car after a couple of drinks.  Section 10 removes that distinction and sets out to penalise the majority of drivers who have been reasonable and sensible in their approach to drinking and driving.</P>
      <P>When passed, this Bill will bolster the enforcement statistics through increased detection, prosecutions and convictions. It will reduce or, perhaps, eliminate the social life of many people in rural Ireland, particularly those in remote areas.  In many cases rural public houses will be put out of business.  This may lead to a disturbing development &mdash; drinking in the home.  There would be no limitation on drinking hours or on consumption and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker, I will try to keep within the confines of the section.  In case earlier comments may have been misconstrued, legislation exists which we are trying to improve, but it must fair and it must deal with the relevant issues.  The Minister mentioned that evidential breath testing in the UK, which was first legislated for in 1981, has been successfully tested.  This will be a third option.  What time scale does the Minister have in relation to this option and specimen and breath testing? Although this may be confused with blowing into a bag, it will be a specific third option on a par with blood or urine <Col N="868" /> testing.  What regulations will be introduced? What guidance will be given to gardaí and medical practitioners?  If this option is adopted, we should know all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing the previous section, the Minister made a statement with which I agree.  He mentioned the accuracy of the equipment and said that with advances in technology, the ability to analyse is becoming more sophisticated.  In some areas in science we may now analyse for parts per billion, previously it was parts per million and 50 years ago it was parts per 1,000.  The equipment's ability to do the job is not the problem.</P>
      <P>I agree that objective standards should be defined in the legislation.  The argument about what those standards should be is virtually over and they are established. The difficulty is that the Garda officer handling this highly sophisticated equipment, which does the analysis on the spot, may not use the equipment in the way it is intended and inaccuracies may occur.  Section 12 says that a member of the Garda may indicate the manner in which a person is to comply with the requirement.  For how long does a person exhale?  What is exhaling?  Government amendments refer to exhaling.  If the equipment is to do its job properly, it must be used under conditions which the makers of the equipment will specify.  We are depending on the garda on the spot to do this job properly and on the person being instructed by the garda, who may not be confident or sober enough to do so, to exhale in the prescribed manner. There is a large capacity for an absolute bags to be made of this procedure.  That is the problem I have with this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fine to establish standards and this should be done but their implementation will cause difficulty.  Having established standards and decided a person is in breach of them, we come to the point where the Judiciary has an obligation to impose penalties, which in my view is wrong, but I will wait until section 26, which is the appropriate one, before I discuss this.  I was a little worried about <Col N="869" /> something Senator Bohan said.  I had the impression that he thought people who were drinking in the privacy of their own homes should be restricted as to the quantity they drink and the hours in which they do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not labour the point further except to re-emphasise what has been said.  It is a major concern of mine that we are introducing a third method by which people can be prosecuted.  It has seemed to be obligatory for most speakers to say they do not agree with excessive drinking.  Neither do I but I will not repeat this every time I stand up.  I made my position clear when we discussed this on 14 September 1993.</P>
      <P>Heretofore, when a person driving a vehicle was stopped by a garda, they were asked to blow into a breathalyser, or the bag as it is known.  If this indicated a certain level, the person was taken to a Garda station to have that level confirmed. On the basis of a sample of blood or urine, it was established whether they exceeded the limit.  There was one great safeguard in both of these methods in that the person was given another sealed sample which he or she could send for independent analysis.  This does not apply to the new option.  Senator Finneran felt that it might apply under section 17.  However, this is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement will be issued by the machine, a docket will emerge from it. A garda will give this to the person concerned, who will be obliged, under a certain penalty, to sign a receipt for it.  The possibility is there that the machine will err.  Senator Dardis referred to the capacity of the person to use this machine properly.  If there are around 9,000 members of the Garda Síochána, there are 9,000 possible operators of the equipment. One can calculate the margin of error which may occur.  The Minister is introducing, as he acknowledges, a third <Col N="870" /> method, which, from the point of view of the person concerned, will not be as objective or safe or as protective of their rights as the other two methods.  There will be an absence of separate independent samples which individuals can have analysed themselves.  This right which existed until now is being removed totally.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Enright referred to penalties.  They omitted to mention one of the most significant ones, which is that a person convicted under this section, in addition to the penalties they mentioned, will be saddled with the costs of the prosecution.  As far as I am aware, this penalty is unparalleled in the criminal courts at the moment.  I will be raising three other queries about this section but now I just want to emphasise that we are removing a safeguard which has existed until now under the other two methods.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The taking of breath tests to be used in evidence in drink driving prosecutions is now the norm in many European countries and is gradually replacing blood and urine tests.  It is controversial wherever it is introduced.  It was controversial in the UK and gave rise to many legal challenges in the beginning. When blood and urine testing was introduced in Ireland, there were numerous legal challenges on procedural and accuracy grounds.  The current procedures for blood and urine testing were developed in the light of experience over a number of years and are now accepted by the courts.  The procedures involve the giving of a portion of the specimen to the arrested person who has the option of obtaining an independent analysis.  Each specimen is tested twice by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and the mean of the two results is taken.  A tolerance of 6 per cent is deducted from the mean and the reduced figure is the official result of the analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> In the case of the introduction of breath testing, it is my intention to have a trial period of at least two years, during which breath testing will be carried out in addition to the testing of blood and urine specimens.  This will provide a good representative sample over a number of years and we will develop confidence in the system if we see the simultaneous use of both systems produce coincidental results.  There is no intention to depart dramatically from proven experience. We want to introduce the new system in a way which will be acceptable and in line with European experience.</P>
    <P>There are ways of detecting whether there are drugs in a person's body and we must continue to develop them.  The points made by Senator Bohan have been made consistently about this legislation. There are certain fears, as there have been on each occasion a new Road Traffic Bill was enacted, going back to 1933 when we had the first phase.  Road Traffic Acts were also enacted in 1961, 1968, 1978 and 1984, and now we have this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of this which I wish to place on the record so that the House will be clear about my approach.  The effects of alcohol on a driver's performance are often understated and misunderstood.  When blood alcohol levels exceed 80 milligrammes, which is the level proposed in this Bill, the normal reaction is overestimation of ability and impairment of peripheral vision and the reaction of eyes to light and dark. Judgment of distance and speed of oncoming vehicles, impairment of ability to react and a tendency to take risks can all set in at the lower levels.</P>
    <P>There have been arguments here on a number of occasions on the exact statistics in Ireland.  I must confess, as I did before, that we need to boost our statistics. We depend considerably on statistics which have been compiled in other parts of the world.  A variety of international studies have all concluded that alcohol is a factor in a significant number of road accidents.  These analyses vary between attributing a minimum of 25 per cent of <Col N="872" /> all road accidents to alcohol to a high of 50 per cent.  I have taken a position for Ireland of 33 per cent which is at the lower level of those international statistics on the relationship between drink driving and accidents.</P>
    <P>Data recently available in the UK, which strongly substantiate what I have been saying, show that approximately 30 per cent of drivers killed in road accidents had some alcohol in their system.  Twenty per cent of those killed had blood alcohol levels of over 80 milligrammes.  It would be difficult to prove that the extent to which alcohol is a factor in Irish road accidents differs substantially from the position in many other countries.</P>
    <P>A study carried out in the last two years on behalf of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport stressed that in most countries there is a strong underestimation of the exact number of alcohol-related accidents, especially where fatalities are concerned.  In many countries, as in Ireland, the police cannot take blood specimens from accident victims and official data do not totally reflect the real situation.  Unfortunately, our statistical data are incomplete for which there are specific reasons.  The main difficulty at present is that specimens for analysis cannot be taken from people admitted to hospital.  The Bill sets out to rectify that.  We also need regular analysis of data from coroners which I intend to address.</P>
    <P>We would be ignoring the reality if we were to think that the only problem is the driver who is obviously drunk.  The days of &ldquo;two will do&rdquo; are gone.  The approach of this Bill is based on the best international practice.  I have given this House before some of the other statistics in relation to studies which have been carried out in America, France and the Netherlands.  In the Netherlands, 25 per cent of road accidents involve people who exceed the 50 milligramme limit.  Studies in America show that at 100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood one is twice as likely to have an accident as with zero alcohol, and at 200 milligrammes one is 25 times as likely. That is the rate at which that graph rises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> To put it in simple but very traumatic and obviously unacceptable terms, more people have died on Irish roads in the last 25 years because of drink driving than died in the trauma in Northern Ireland during the same period.  My office receives heart-rending letters which leave me in no doubt that there is dramatic room for improvement.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to water down the essential features of this Bill.  I have listened, brought forward amendments and made changes but it is incumbent on all of us to face the realities.  All of the international statistics reinforce my strongly held view that we will be unable to reduce the level of carnage on our roads unless we try to deal seriously with offenders.  It is not true that only those who drink to excess are involved in road accidents.  All of the evidence shows that while they may be much more likely to have accidents, many who consider themselves safe drivers are, regrettably, also involved.</P>
    <P>We will deal later with specific aspects of this but a question was raised as to why one person who is just marginally over the limit must accept the same penalties as somebody who is much more over the limit.  As I said, we are providing for minimum sentencing, disqualification or whatever.  It is always a matter for the courts to decide whether penalties should be increased in a particular case.</P>
    <P>Senator Bohan and many others have expressed concerns about the statistics and whether we can prove this case. There are many people who would like, for genuine reasons, to be able to say that the story is different.  However, the reality is that considerably more than 100 people are killed each year on the roads and up to 3,000 are seriously injured. There are many people who will lobby for their own particular interests but there is never a strong lobby for victims in cases such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a couple of questions in the light of what the Minister has said and I hope I will not incur the wrath of the Chair in making a Second Stage speech.  The Minister mentioned <Col N="874" /> various statistics and data, most of which are international although I suppose it is all relevant.  How much information was there in relation to the difference between consuming 80 milligrammes of alcohol and 100 milligrammes?  The Department has changed from the &ldquo;two will do&rdquo; campaign to a stark message that one should not drive if one is drinking, which would happen in an ideal world. Could he give some statistical information on the difference between a person who has consumed 80 milligrammes and one who has consumed 100 milligrammes of alcohol?  Neither amount would normally be considered excessive.  I also wish to refer to reducing the permitted alcohol level from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes.  Perhaps the Minister could roughly indicate how we compare with other European countries. Are there many countries with levels below or above us?</P>
      <P>We all support the Minister's goal to reduce the levels of carnage on our roads and some of these provisions may help. Since the previous Act was brought in there are many more cars on our roads. There are other factors which should also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Minister's overall intention of cutting out driving if one is drinking, I have not heard him refer to the drinking limit &mdash; apart from reducing it from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes. The Minister, when replying, might give us statistical evidence from other European countries that show these reductions have brought about a corresponding reduction in accidents. The previous legislation has been in place for some time.  It could have been more strictly enforced, but it did work well, although some of the older Acts were challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>One can take it as read that no Senator on either side of the House would defend drunken driving, although it may have been taken this way because it was not referred to up to now. I do not disagree with the Minister's general observations.  He is correct when he says that the days of &ldquo;two will do&rdquo; are <Col N="875" /> gone.  He also spoke about the victims, and we all share those sentiments. However, there are dangers in using statistics and we must be cautious with them.  I say that as someone who has training in this area.</P>
      <P>If the Minister states that 20 per cent of the population have a blood alcohol level of 85 milligrammes per millilitre of blood in terms of accidents caused, it is conceivable that 20 per cent of the population driving on the roads have a blood alcohol level of 85 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.  It would then come as no surprise to see that level of accidents being caused.  That would represent the population as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the observation is still a legitimate one in terms of the caution that needs to be exercised with statistics.</P>
      <P>In relation to scientific matters, we do not dispute the ability of the equipment to detect or measure accurately.  We are also aware that the Garda are well trained and are competent in using this equipment. However, even they can make mistakes, especially in the case of breath testing, which involves exhaling, the length of time, etc.  The equipment is only as good as the quality of the sample; it can only measure that sample.  If the sample is defective so will be the result.  The consequence of that could be that certain people, because of the mandatory nature of the sentence imposed, could be disqualified in circumstances where they might not have been under the earlier legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect involves the question of enforcement.  It frequently comes back to the legislation we pass in this House. While we pass legislation to ensure that law abiding citizens on our roads are protected, our capacity to enforce that law frequently does not match our commitment in introducing it and I am sure <Col N="876" /> the Minister is as aware of that as anyone else in the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister said this form of breath testing is now the norm in the UK and in Europe.  If this is the case and the Minister accepts the norm in Europe on how prosecutions arising from these tests are dealt with, it would be easier for many of us to agree with him.</P>

Once the Minster has introduced the norm in Europe he should not pick and choose in order to dismiss contributions from this side of the House. There is discretion for the courts in European countries and higher penalties and if the norm was taken as a whole, we would be closer to agreeing with the Minister.</P>

    <P>I also want to refer to the statistics the Minister stated were available to him. As a legislator, I am disappointed he is concealing the source of that information. In my contribution on 10 December I asked him to make available to me and to other Members of the House <Col N="877" /> whatever statistics were available to him. They have not been made available to me up to now and I do not think he intends to make them available.  The Minister is only selecting certain statistics that suit his argument.  That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the Minister's contention, if I understood him correctly, that 20 per cent of drivers killed have an alcohol concentration of between 80 and 100 milligrammes.  If that is the case, that information came to the Minister since 10 December.  He is on record as telling me then that he did not have that information available to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>I withdraw that statement but that was my understanding.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister where this information came from?  The information given stated that 20 per cent of drivers killed have an alcohol concentration of between 80 and 100 milligrammes.  Is that the information which has been given to the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not, I withdraw it but I understood that to be the case.  The statistic mentions cases &ldquo;in excess of 80 milligrammes&rdquo;; 400 milligrammes is in excess of 80 milligrammes.  How many cases are in excess of 100 milligrammes?  I asked for details of the number of people killed who have an alcohol concentration between 80 and 100 milligrammes for the purpose of seeing what justification there is for reducing the limit from 100 to 80 milligrammes.  It is a smart use of statistics to say that 20 per cent of drivers killed have an alcohol concentration of above 80 milligrammes.  Of course it is above 80 milligrammes; if it is 400 milligrammes it is above 80 milligrammes. What is the number of cases with an alcohol concentration between 80 and <Col N="878" /> 100 milligrammes?  I asked for that information in December.  It was not available then and I can only assume it is not available today either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we are going to have agreement on this because the Minister is going to proceed with this new addition and use the breath test alone.  My understanding of the breath test as it works on the Continent and in Britain is that a person is stopped, he steps into a van and blows into a machine. He gives two breath samples and the lower one is chosen.</P>
      <P>I listened attentively to what the Minister said about the different procedures that have developed over the years.  He said that up to now an independent analysis of the blood or urine sample was carried out; it was tested twice and there was a tolerance of 6 per cent and so on. This separate and independent analysis is carried out in the bureau.  There is also the added safeguard where a person can have their blood sample analysed in their own hospital or elsewhere.  The testing of the urine sample is also a separate and independent procedure.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that the breath test is now the norm and is replacing blood and urine sample testing across Europe.  If this becomes law, the courts will become rubber stamps.  The garda will give evidence that the sample was in excess of a specified level, the judge would have no discretion and he would have to suspend the person's licence for two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the Matrimonial Home Bill which has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. I made the further point with regard to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill that the President felt it necessary to convene a meeting of the Council of State yesterday and will decide on Thursday whether it should be referred to the Supreme Court.  When court decisions were challenged or appealed to the High Court and Supreme Court in the past, the Supreme Court made every effort to be fair and to ensure that every loophole was closed off.  Many people have taken <Col N="879" /> an active and positive interest in this. When any challenge was heard by the Supreme Court, in their wisdom and judgment, they did everything possible to eliminate all loopholes.</P>
    <P>If one machine will decide whether a person should be permanently deprived of his livelihood, the Supreme Court will deem that to be unconstitutional.  I forsee the President, who takes her duties seriously and who has done an exemplary job, calling together the Council of State and this legislation will also be deemed unconstitutional.  I do not like saying that but the courts are being treated as a mere rubber stamp.  Under section 26 a person can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the past, there was all party agreement and co-operation to ensure that drunken driving, dangerous driving and misconduct on the road were not tolerated.  There will still be co-operation but we do not want a Bill to go through this House and then have it referred to the Supreme Court because all the legislation we have passed will be put in jeopardy.  I do not think the Minister wants that, and I certainly do not.  We should be careful because our courts have been exemplary to date in enforcing these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to improve the law and we can achieve that with co-operation.  I am as anxious as the Minister is to improve the legislation.  The Minister said there are lobbies for particular interests.  I do not think anybody here is lobbying for any particular interest.  I am not and I do not think this is even worthy <Col N="880" /> of mention but it has been commented on by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We should take account of the structure of this country which has a widely dispersed rural population.  A social outlet is part and parcel of life.  We are introducing a breath test where the decision on a person's future is left to a machine.  A husband and wife may be out celebrating their anniversary and have one bottle of wine between them.  On their way home they may be stopped and breathalysed and the husband may lose his job; people go out for a game of cards or a drink or two.  Legislation must reflect common sense and it is essential that we keep this in perspective.</P>
    <P>We can cite examples from Europe or Britain until the cows come home but we achieved independence many years ago. Europe has its own way of dealing with matters; as Senator Howard pointed out, the Judiciary can exercise discretion in Europe but there is no discretion here. We should be careful about allowing a machine to decide a person's future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad because, despite the difference of opinion that has emerged on the section, there are no amendments requesting me to change the limit from 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres to 80 milligrammes per 100 millitres.  I welcome that because in the other House I was asked to increase it from 100 milligrammes upwards; to come from 100 milligrammes to 50 milligrammes, and to go from 100 milligrammes to an absolute ban.  Members here are proving to be more solid in terms of accepting that we <Col N="881" /> have to make changes.  We are making changes and there are good reasons for doing that.  Apart altogether from European and international experience, we know the realities.</P>
      <P>Inadvertently or otherwise, a campaign has developed saying that this Minister for the Environment is bringing in mandatory disqualifications.  The first time we had mandatory disqualification for drunken driving was in 1933.  There has been a careful orchestration in recent times to suggest that this measure is something new.  Some of the aspects of mandatory disqualification were suggested in a recent article by an eminent member of the judicial profession to be something new, although they were first introduced in 1968 and have gone unnoticed by some people in the legal profession since.</P>
      <P>Let us put one thing straight.  I am not introducing mandatory disqualifications. They have been part and parcel of the law in this area for a very considerable time and the effort on the part of the illustrious member of the legal profession, the honourable Senator from Birr, is not going to change that.  It is very nice to talk about these circumstances in which people find themselves and to try to get me to prove there is absolute evidence to move from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes.  I have said publicly, and I say it again here, that neither I nor anyone else can prove the exactitude of these figures beyond making a judgment that in the circumstances and having regard to the available evidence we have to strengthen the law.  There is no safe limit and if we are to be guided by international experience and some of the statistics we have, there is little or no choice but to take that action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked where we are in the league of the other European countries. Before these changes are made we are the only European country with a tolerance of 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.  When we move to 80 milligrammes, we will join Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.  A lower limit of 50 milligrammes applies in Greece, the <Col N="882" /> Netherlands and Portugal.  In a number of eastern European countries the level is 20 milligrammes per 100 millilitre of blood and one or two have zero rating. At present we have the highest level and when this change is made we will be in the group with the highest level.</P>
    <P>With regard to evidential breath testing, I disagree with Senator Enright.  He seems to be of the opinion that we are making a dramatic change here which will change the position as far as the courts are concerned.  The existing system will continue.  Side by side with that the evidential breath testing system will be developed.  Assuming that after the initial test period that system, from which no prosecutions can be made, produces evidence of its accuracy, the legal framework to continue with the process which is now being instituted will already be in place.  I have no doubt that this will happen but if, in the meantime, anything should happen to disturb that in terms of its clinical accuracy, that will be a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>We are not making a dramatic change or bringing a lot of uncertainty into this area.  The new system will join the existing one and will go through its trial period.  If it meets all the criteria and stands up to a rigorous test in any examination of being as accurate and as fair as the existing system, then there is no reason to continue the old system because of the nature of the test, the difficulties associated with it and the involvement of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard is asking me to adopt the same kind of laws that are in force in Europe in relation to this matter.  I do not seriously think Fine Gael are proposing that we would weaken existing laws on road traffic offences involving drink and driving, hit and run, etc.  That is not really what he would want but that is the implication.  I am not bringing legislation to this House to deal with what is a stubborn problem as far as a hard core of individuals is concerned which would weaken existing laws.  We have to strengthen those laws to make them more effective.</P>

      <P>The Minister may, by regulations made by him, vary the concentration of alcohol for the time being standing specified in subsection (2), (3) or (4) of this section, whether generally or in respect of a particular class of person,....</P>
      <P>It is this particular class of person I am concerned about, because a totally new dimension is being introduced here. Heretofore the same concentration applied generally but now we will have a particular class of people treated differently from others.  I would like an explanation. Subsection 6 (b) reads:</P>
      <P>A person charged with an offence under this section may, in lieu of being found guilty of that offence, be found guilty of an offence under section 50 of this Act.</P>
      <P>There are eminent members of the legal profession here as the Minister said, but I always understood there was a fundamental legal principle dealing with double jeopardy.  The Minister is asking us to charge a person with one offence and if he is not convicted of that offence, they can convict him on another offence with which he has not been charged.

Subsection (5) allows the Minister to vary by regulations the levels of alcohol permitted in a driver's blood, urine or breath.

      <P>Section 11 of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978, states:</P>
      <P>A person shall be guilty of an offence who, when in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place with intent to drive or attempt to drive the vehicle (but not driving or attempting to drive it), is under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>I will not play with words or pretend that this legislation comes down to explaining what a person's intentions are when they are obviously in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while intoxicated.  That reduces the debate to a level I would not have expected.  This provision has been in place for a long time.  One could ask if the gardaí, in the interests of safety, should take no action in such circumstances.  Should they pretend that somebody who is obviously intoxicated may not get the vehicle to start?  What should they do?</P>
      <P>I am not introducing a new provision. I am endorsing an existing provision which is working.  I fail to see why it is necessary to attempt to make that appear to be anything other than a genuine effort to deal with a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that we were playing around with words.  I asked the Minister to establish to the satisfaction of the House how to prove that there is an intention to drive.  The Minister did not answer my question.</P>
      <P>The new section 50 (6) (b) of the Principal Act refers to a matter I raised when discussing the previous section.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person charged with an offence under this section may, in lieu of being found guilty of that offence, be found <Col N="889" /> guilty of an offence under section 49 of this Act.</P>
    <P>During the discussion on section 10 I told the House I was unhappy with a provision where a person who is charged with one offence and found not guilty can apparently be found guilty of another offence, although he was not charged with that offence.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with the implications of section 50 (7) of the same Act which states:</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, shall not apply to an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>We will return to this issue when discussing later sections of the Bill.  I will oppose provisions in this or any other legislation which interfere with the independence of the courts.  It makes a judgment in relation to future cases and indicates, on the part of the Minister and the Government, a lack of confidence in the capacity and independence of the Judiciary to discharge its specific functions as outlined in the Constitution.  If we talk, as we did earlier, of what is the norm in Europe we should be as attached to it when it comes to the discretion of the courts as we were when we discussed other aspects earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with my question as to how to prove intent to drive, but it is his prerogative if he does not want to deal with it.  I am unhappy that a person can be charged with one offence, be found not guilty but be found guilty of another offence with which they have not been charged.  I oppose and reject the interference with the independence of the courts.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate what is legally meant by being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle?  We could take the example Senator Howard gave of someone who has a few drinks, is over the limit as prescribed in the Bill and sits in the passenger seat of a vehicle.  According to the legislation would that person be deemed to be in charge?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained, I have no intention of weakening the existing law relating to people being in charge of mechanically propelled vehicles while intoxicated.  The provisions which are being argued here by Fine Gael are of long standing in our legal system.  It is clearly a matter for the discretion of the garda, from his or her training, and from our legal system to act in accordance with what is best practice. It would be absurd for this House to try to detail the circumstances which might be involved.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard raised a question with regard to my party or the Government not having confidence in the courts.  This seems to subscribe to the recently stated view that this legislation has aspects to it with regard to mandatory disqualification which are new.  Mandatory disqualification for drunken driving was first established in 1933 and has been enshrined in subsequent Acts in 1961, 1968 and 1978.  It is not new.  It is a matter which was dealt with in the High Court and the Supreme Court some years ago. When it was sought to be established that the question of disqualification was a punishment which should be a matter for the discretion of the courts, the Supreme Court decided that disqualification was not a punishment; rather it was the exercise by regulation of a statutory right in the interests of public order and safety.  That is how the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, dealt with this issue.</P>
      <P>We should refrain from making suggestions which seem to attack the Government or, in this case, the Minister for the Environment, for introducing something new but which is already enshrined in legislation, or saying that it takes discretion from the court when the Supreme Court has already adjudicated on the matter.  It should also be taken into account that the Houses of the Oireachtas consider this such a serious matter that, in order that there would be a level playing field, that nobody could argue that they could be exempt because of financial or other resources, everybody was to be treated the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> I am satisfied that in the context of this legislation re-enacting those successful parts of previous experience is the right thing to do.  The worst possible signal this House could attempt to put out is that we are weakening in our resolve to deal with this issue or that we are trying to find a way to weaken existing law, not to mention the provisions we are trying to improve.  I am not saying anybody in the House is setting out to do that deliberately, but if we seek to reduce in status or to amend or weaken what is already established successful legal practice in this area, we are not going down the right road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take issue again with the Minister on what he suggested the Supreme Court implied by its decision.  The Supreme Court decision to which the Minister has referred established that it was not unconstitutional for the Houses of the Oireachtas to bring in mandatory sentences.  That is not my argument.  My argument is that because the circumstances of each case vary it is the judge or jury, hearing all the evidence, who are best equipped to make a judgment.</P>
      <P>If we were to accept the line the Minister is taking we could eliminate the entire judicial system and prescribe mandatory penalties for every conceivable offence.  There would be no need for courts, judges or the legal profession. If the Government wishes to go the whole way and take that course of action, if it is prepared to accept that in most circumstances the facts of each case are for adjudication by a judge or by a judge and jury, if this is applied in one set of circumstances it should be applied in all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of suggesting that the Supreme Court said the Oireachtas was right to do this in relation to drink driving offences.  The Supreme Court said it was permissible for the Oireachtas to decide on the imposition of mandatory sentences.  The sledgehammer approach is being used here.  We are saying this is the one sentence to be applied without the prevailing circumstances in any case <Col N="892" /> being taken into consideration.  That is in conflict with the principle and understanding of the judicial system as we know it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Howard is not giving the full picture because there is discretion in the court, although not on all aspects, of what the maximum penalty could be in a particular case.  He has identified the area of disqualification but it does not stop at that; there is discretion in certain circumstances.  Under the section: &ldquo;A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.&rdquo;  That means the fine can be less than that figure and the court and the judge can play their part and have an independent say.  Senator Howard may not be giving the full picture and in a debate such as this it should be given.</P>
      <P>To say that new provisions in this Bill are being introduced by the Minister now is to mislead the House to some extent, because some of those provisions have been on the Statute Book for up to 30 years.  We should be given the full facts. The discretion of the courts is allowed in certain circumstances.  Therefore the Senator's point that there is no need for a court or a judge does not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make sure that what I have said is understood.  I am not weakening the legislation by going back over well travelled ground.  This has been understood and operated by the courts for a long time.  It is now suggested I change that.  It is unfair of Senator Howard to suggest that even if we do make changes that does not leave a discretion with the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran has reminded us that if a garda comes across circumstances outlined in this provision, that is not the end of the matter.  That case has then to go to court and be argued.  It will be dealt with on its merits and there will be an opportunity for the person involved to defend himself.  It stretches credibility to suggest the court has no discretion in circumstances where it has to hear the <Col N="893" /> full case and decide, and where both sides have full freedom to make their cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with this House reviewing law, no matter what its standing.  This legislation upgrades existing law and if we find a defect it should be debated.  My concern is not with the provisions on mechanically propelled vehicles, it is with subsection (5) (a) which states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by regulations made by him, vary the concentration of alcohol for the time being, standing specified in subsection (2), (3) or (4) of this section, whether generally or in respect of a particular class of person...</P>
      <P>What is the point of establishing these criteria if the Minister is allowed to alter them almost at will?  In the Minister's view, what would be a particular class of person subject to a modification of the regulations on the concentration of alcohol? Would it involve ill people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Senator Dardis's comments.  Those of us taking the legislation seriously are entitled to examine it and ask questions.  I hope no one would deny us that right.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Minister to clarify subsection (5) (a).  In the Dáil a party colleague of the Minister asked that there be a two tier system, one in Dublin and other urban areas and a different one in rural areas.  That should not be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate there are difficulties involved.  Much of this legislation has stood the test of time.  However, like some old legislation and some more recent Bills, there are problems now and further ones may arise.  I ask the Minister <Col N="894" /> to clarify what is intended in the regulation under this subparagraph.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Senator Dardis is that this is not an unfettered freedom.  These regulations would have to get the prior approval by confirmation of both Houses of the Oireachtas; this means they would have to be debated. We will have to think about which classes may be subject to change and resolve the matter to our satisfaction.  One which immediately comes to mind is persons in charge of dangerous substances where the nature of their work and the consequences of an accident would be horrific should they be under the influence of alcohol.</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Cosgrave, there is no relation between this provision and a proposal made in the Dáil to have different regimes in rural and urban areas.  My task up to now has been similar to Solomon's.  I have been asked to reduce the figure and to increase it; I have been asked to safeguard rural social life and undertake many other matters.  I make no pretence to having such capacity.  We have tried to reach the best balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have misheard the Minister on the monitor but he seemed to say this provision was similar to section 50 of the Principal Act.  It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>What precisely is not the same?  The question I was dealing with was the intent to drive or being in charge of a vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change of the intent to drive but there is a variation in that under section 50 of the Principal Act the judge had discretion whether to impose a suspension but there is no discretion in this Bill.  Senator Howard said someone could be attending a function in a ballroom and not feel well and he might sit in a car before returning to the function. Someone might approach a car with the intention of obtaining something from it.  There are many examples that could be given.  There was tolerance and <Col N="895" /> when a person was not actually driving the judge had discretion whether to suspend. In this instance, the judge has no discretion.  Subsection (8) states that in a prosecution &ldquo;it shall be presumed&rdquo;. After a presumption, a person goes before a court, having been breathalysed, and they are automatically suspended. The Minister should not proceed with an automatic mandatory disqualification. This section extends this area considerably. I agree with a great deal of what is in the section but it should not be mandatory.  A judge should be able to make up his mind taking the relevant circumstances into account.  A person may be approaching a car to get some item from it.  This Bill takes matters a gigantic step further because it presumes a person will drive, they will be breathalysed and then disqualified.  I am against subsection (4) and I am against a mandatory disqualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will again go over the ground I have already covered.  It is incorrect to assume, although there is power in the Bill in circumstances outlined by Senator Enright, that the courts have no discretion.  As I explained a case revolves around a garda coming upon certain circumstances.  In turn the case ends up in court where there is an opportunity for both sides to state their positions. The court hears both sides and then makes up its mind which course of action to take.  If the court decides to convict, it does so on balance and on the basis that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that the person was definitely in charge and intending to drive.  It is at the total discretion of the court.  It decides on the evidence.  If it decides on a conviction, the automatic disqualification then comes into play; it is not automatic <Col N="896" /> until the court has heard the case.  Do we trust the courts to make decisions on the basis of the evidence put before them?</P>

      <P>This is a re-enactment of existing, well operated, established and recognised legislation.  For the umpteenth time, in my own defence, the fact that this is before the House is nothing to do with any wisdom of mine. It is the tried and true position which is accepted on all sides.  It provides that a person charged with an offence under this section shall, not in relation to the same offence, be liable to be charged under section 12 of the Licensing Act, 1872.  Section 12 of that Act makes it an offence to be intoxicated on a highway or other public place while in charge of a carriage.  We can give the Senator a copy of this section if it would help him.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 (1) states: &ldquo;Whenever a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place....&rdquo;  If a garda does not have the breathalyser equipment with him, the person is obliged to remain at that spot for one hour while it is sent for.  Will the Minister clarify that after one hour the person is free to drive the vehicle?  What is the position in regard to a person a garda considers to be under the influence of alcohol or an intoxicant after one hour has elapsed and the equipment has not arrived at the scene?  Perhaps the Minister will explain subsection (4), which states:</P>
      <P>In a prosecution for an offence under this Part or under section 49 or 50 of the Principal Act it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that an apparatus provided by a member of the Garda Síochána for the purpose of enabling a person to provide a specimen of breath pursuant to this section is an apparatus for indicating the presence of alcohol in the breath.</P>
      <P>Are we speaking about the same instrument we spoke about in section 10 which could provide evidence to obtain a conviction under this legislation?  What is the position if the apparatus does not arrive within one hour despite the fact a garda is of the opinion a person is under the influence of alcohol and unfit to drive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In reading the history of road traffic law I was surprised at the extent people will go to avoid conviction or prosecution.  The case which Senator Howard touched on, where a garda was unable to get the breathalyser equipment in a period of approximately four minutes, went all the way and it was decided the person concerned was unlawfully held for that time.  In this legislation I sought to ensure it would not be possible for somebody in charge of mechanically propelled vehicle while intoxicated to avoid or evade lawful prosecution and conviction &mdash; if a court so decides &mdash; by giving a longer period in order to facilitate a garda in circumstances where it is deemed necessary to provide a breathalyser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> There are circumstances where a garda may not have the apparatus.  I do not want to say what would happen after one hour because if the security system and the garda system are working well no such circumstance could be brought before me.  As far as this section is concerned, I am not sure if a person may go free after one hour.  Obviously, further steps may have to be taken if it involves time.  We must face the determination of some people to avoid prosecution.  I have sought to avoid a situation where a person could be deemed unlawfully detained during the period the garda gets the apparatus.</P>
    <P>This should not be compared to or should not be interwoven with the problem Senator Enright raised in regard to evidential breath testing.  In those circumstances the breathalyser is used at the side of the road, for example, and the person concerned is then brought to a Garda station for urine or blood testing until the new facility is being put in place. These should not be linked together. Although I am not a legal expert, I am entitled to change this if a person is intoxicated while in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle, but a court decides that person has been unlawfully held while a garda gets the apparatus to prove it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this section. This situation may arise where an off duty garda comes across an accident where somebody is obviously drunk, but he does not have the apparatus to test this individual.  This section is reasonable and one hour is a sufficient period of time, because most incidents occur close to a garda station where this apparatus may be obtained.  This section will improve and strengthen the situation when it is obvious to a garda that a person has consumed alcohol.  I would not like to see the one hour limit extended to two or three hours because it could cause problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A specimen must be provided within three hours of going to a Garda station. Perhaps the Minister will clarify this. <Col N="900" /> Does this include the one hour period while a person waits for the apparatus?  I do not raise this in a contentious way because we support this section.</P>

Is there a provision in this legislation to bring this person to the Garda station to carry out the proper test with a breathalyser, etc.?  I am not anxious to become involved in circumstances where a garda notices a problem and an hour later has not put anything into execution.  I would lose faith in the system if this were possible.</P>

I send every good wishes to the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, and hope he has a speedy recovery.</P>
    <P>I know fishermen well.  They are an unusual breed.  It is hard to make them understand that conservation is necessary. Around 15 years ago it was difficult to get fishermen to agree to any cut backs or quotas.  The herring fishing industry in the Celtic Sea was suffering badly.  The Department took cognisance of this and brought in measures to conserve stocks. This conservation has led to a great herring fishing industry over the last four or five years.  The Irish box was created to conserve fishing stocks and protect the indigenous Irish fishing industry.  We have done our part but the EU will have to act responsibly as far as conservation, the Irish Box and the 200 mile limit are concerned.</P>
    <P>It appears that certain EU countries, mainly Spain, could not care less and are breaking the rules.  It is in their interests, and the interests of every EU country with fishing boats, that conservation in this box is protected.  If there is conservation in an area, fish will spawn and develop and will spread out from that box.  This is the reason for the creation of the Irish box.  We are a small nation with a small fleet.</P>
    <P>I was in La Coruna in Spain about three years ago.  There were as many boats fishing from that port as there are in the whole of Ireland.  The Spaniards have been blatant in breaking the rules. A friend of mine in La Coruna pointed out to me a 200 foot boat leaving for west of the Blasket Islands.  He said it would be back the following day loaded with fish.  I said this was impossible but he said there were two identical boats with the <Col N="902" /> same name.  One fished at sea while the other was in the port.  One returned a day after the other went out.  The two boats were operating under the same licence.  The Department of the Marine is very strict and their laws are very stringent on Irish fishermen, but the Spanish and other Governments are not as strict on their people as we are on ours.  This can be seen in La Coruna and other ports. The Irish box must be protected and the Minister will have to stand his ground and say that under no circumstances is he giving in on this.  He has done this to date and I know he will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is worth £98 million. This has grown enormously in recent years.  Serious mistakes were made in the past.  Our gross tonnage at the moment is around 58,000.  In 1985, when we were not in Government, the EC decided that every country had to provide a figure for the gross tonnage of their fleet.  The Government at the time greatly underestimated our tonnage.  I know that in the other countries anything that could float and a great deal of what could not float&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have followed the fishing industry very closely since one of its first agreements, the London Convention agreement of 1964.  I thought that I would go crazy when I heard what was happening: that a Spaniard or a Frenchman could fish lobsters off Slea Head, which I think is still the case today.  The fate of the fishing industry is in the Minister's hands and I know he will not let them down.</P>
      <P>I have many questions but there is not enough time to go through them.  I read in the newspaper yesterday that the grain farmers are going to receive millions of pounds &mdash; to which they are entitled &mdash; because they could not grow their grain last year.  The Donegal potato growers are getting money because there was a bad crop.  What about the poor fishermen? What about the man who has to tie his boat to the pier and cannot go out fishing?</P>
      <P>The inshore fleet cannot go out if there is a storm on Monday but if Tuesday is a fine day they can go out because they come back again that evening.  This contrasts with those who go on long distance trips for ten, 12 or 14 days.  It costs them between £6,000 and £10,000 to travel the 140 to 200 miles between fuel, ice and food.  They will not head out 150 miles if bad weather is forecast but have to wait. There was a time when the big boats in Dingle did not go out for two months. There should be a scheme to compensate fishermen when they are prevented from going out due to bad weather.  For example, if they are fishing for hake and the hake quota is filled in the middle of August, what can they do?  It might be suggested that they should fish mackerel, but we do not tell the grain farmers to set potatoes or the potato farmers to do something else.  Fishermen have no political clout.  There are between 6,000 and 8,000 fishermen around our coast, which is not enough to elect one TD.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to second this motion, which is proposed by a man who has considerable personal experience of the fishing industry.  When the Government was reconstituted two years ago, understandably I had some misgivings about the consequences for <Col N="905" /> myself.  However, the blow was more than softened by the fact that the Minister for the Marine, who is in the House this evening, was appointed to the responsibility of Foreign Affairs, because in his attitude, experience and conviction he was uniquely qualified to represent the interests of Ireland in that role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was he not left there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>His all too short period in that office demonstrated clearly the respect which he had won for us around the world.  If I had a reservation about the change because of the status and nature of his achievement, I have to say that experience since has also softened that blow, because we never before had someone of such real political clout and status, at home and abroad, to vindicate and defend the interests of this important element of our economy.  For that reason I am privileged this evening to second this motion, because this Minister has effectively and vigorously defended the interests of the Irish fishing industry since transferring from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Minister's political standing is there now to win us further respect in the role he is now pursuing on behalf of the Irish people.  His clear and vigorous statements have impacted very positively on our fellow members of the European Union and, uniquely among Ministers for Fisheries of recent years, he has the support of the entire fishing industry in his efforts.  His efforts to ensure the protection of the Irish box, particularly from the huge Spanish fishing fleet, is essential as the Spanish fleet constitutes over one third of the entire European Union fleet and has the capacity to grossly overfish in the very lucrative fishing grounds off the west and south west coast of Ireland. An influx of Spanish fishing vessels could have a devastating effect on stocks and on the coastal communities whose economies rely so heavily on the fishing industry, as has been underlined so clearly be our spokesman, Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> This is where a problem arises, because under the terms of the Spanish accession Act, which predated this Minister's responsibility for the Marine, the Irish box is due to end after 1 January 1996.  It is vital for Ireland that Spain is not allowed unlimited access to Irish waters from that date.  The Minister has fought the Irish case so vigorously that while a review of the 1986 accession Act for Spain was due to be concluded by the end of 1993, negotiations were not concluded at the Council of Fisheries Ministers on 20 December 1993 because of his strong and effective opposition.  In that sense, therefore, it was a blessing that he, with his political clout, took on a role which has not normally been assigned to someone with his political experience.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the Spanish fleet is far greater than the stocks allocated to them in the exclusive economic zone for Ireland.  As a result of this over-capacity, the level of illegal activity by the Spaniards in Irish waters has been extensive. While fewer than one-fifth of all boats boarded at sea by the Naval Service were Spanish vessels, every second one of them was arrested for major fishery offences.  It is not acceptable that a country like Spain, which has such a bad record of compliance with European Union fishery regulations, coupled with the huge capacity of its fleet, should have further access to our waters where the precedent suggests that they would not adhere to regulations that would be introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine has a difficult task, but he is correct when he expressed his dissatisfaction at the suggestion to remove the Irish box at this time.  In fact, he is on firm ground when he argues that existing controls need to be strengthened rather than relaxed.  Our fishing community, and people generally, are greatly indebted to the Minister for asserting his determination not to accept the proposals currently being put forward by the Commission and the Presidency of the European Union, as effectively it would entail a free-for-all for Spanish and Portuguese vessels in our waters.  Ireland is not, and never has been, opposed to <Col N="907" /> the full integration of Spain and Portugal into the Union, but it is insisting that before that can be implemented, the capacity of the Spanish fleet must be in line with the stocks allocated and the Spanish level of compliance with the European Union fisheries regulations is greatly improved.</P>
    <P>Because of his immense experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for the Marine is uniquely qualified to make every effort at diplomatic, political and technical levels to ensure a fair deal for the Irish.  The Minister, not surprisingly, has been in constant contact with the Presidency, the Commission, other member states and the Spanish authorities to press upon them the importance of this issue for Ireland.  I understand that in advance of the next Council meeting in April the Minister will have political discussions with the Greek European Union Presidency, as well as with fishery Ministers of a number of other member states.  That is how one wins understanding, support and goodwill. We are fortunate to have a man of the Minister's standing and experience protecting our national interest in this vital area.  This House is privileged to give its full and total endorsement for his vigorous and effective negotiation policy. For that reason, I am privileged to second this motion in support of that policy.</P>
    <P>I also wish to give my appreciation to the positive response the Minister gave to the recent tragic events in Castletownbere. I am sure the fishing community are greatly heartened by the Minister's immediate and positive response.  I am also sure the actions the Minister will take to follow up on that tragedy will be vigorously supported by them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the motion: &ldquo;and calls on the Minister:</P>
      <P>(1)  to implement an aid package for the Irish fishing fleet to stave off bankruptcy, create new jobs and safeguard existing livelihoods; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> (2)  to outline the findings of the sea trout task force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I, too, wish to be associated with the sentiments expressed with regard to the tragedy in Castletownbere.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Government Senators are not aware of the serious problems existing in the Irish fishing industry at present, especially those our fishermen are confronted with on a daily basis.  Our fishing industry is currently facing an unprecedented crisis.  Never have Irish fishing vessels been tied up for such a long and continuous period due to extreme weather conditions as during the winter of 1993-94.  The Minister is well aware of this because he has had meetings with and representations from the Irish Fishermen's Organisation on this matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the large vessels, the rest of the fleet has been tied up at port for approximately 14 weeks.  Where vessels did put to sea during a short break in the weather, the amount of fishing carried out could be disregarded as the prices subsequently secured were so low that they did not count.  The end result is that there is a severe financial crisis among fishing personnel.  It was interesting to note that the proposer of the motion, while praising the Minister for what he was doing for fishermen, also said that they did not have any political clout.  It is no wonder we have got a little seasick from the ups and downs of those remarks. If the Minister has that clout, I hope he has been using it and will continue to use it.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Government should seriously consider this matter with a view to providing proper financial assistance for the fishermen at this time of crisis.  The Irish Fishermen's Organisation put proposals to the Government for an aid package of £13 million.  The Government should seriously review its position and grant financial aid for the unusual events that have occurred over the past six months.  It is easy for the Government to establish which vessels were tied up and for what period.  There should be no difficulty in distributing financial aid accordingly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> The growing disparity that exists between the fishing industry and the type and level of assistance being given to the other sectors must be stopped.  It is grossly unfair to expect our fishermen to compete successfully with French fishermen, who are getting cash support for the second successive year from their Government in the form of an aid package of £36 million.</P>
    <P>I also wish to address the issue in relation to vessel categorisation.  It raises the fundamental question of the right of Irish citizens to property.  I suggest that the Minister would view this matter carefully. Our fishermen are extremely unhappy at the Department of the Marine's proposals relating to categorisation and have rejected them.  Some of those concerns include:</P>
    <P>The masters of community fishing vessels, fishing for a stalk or group of stalks, shall keep a log book of their operations, indicating particularly the quantities of each species caught and kept on board, the date and location of such catches and the type of gear used.</P>
    <P>....</P>
    <P>The master of a community fishing vessel who wishes to utilise landing locations in a member state other than the flagged member state must inform the competent authorities in that member state at least two hours in advance of the landing locations and estimated time of arrival there and the quantities of each species to be landed. Also, the master of each community fishing vessel, having an overall length equal to or more than ten metres, or his representative, shall after each trip and within 48 hours of landing, submit a declaration to the competent authorities of the member state where the landing takes place.  The master shall be responsible for the accuracy of the declaration which shall indicate as a minimum, the quantities landed of each loggable species and the area where they were caught.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> The Department has more flexibility and could use greater leeway in its interpretation of Union regulations, as they apply to this issue.  Fishermen's rights should not be superseded by other rights. It is important that the Minister understands and respects the rights of fishermen.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, we have an old and substandard fleet which compares very poorly with our European competitors.  The Government must provide assistance to the fishermen in the form of low interest rates, tax rebates and other incentives to encourage them to do the necessary work.  The overwhelming majority are not in a position to make the necessary investment themselves and require some incentive.  I hope that when the final proposals are drafted for implementing the commission in aid there will be full openness as to who qualifies and the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>The record in the area of employment in the fishing industry leaves much to be desired.  In 1988 a programme was lauched by BIM and the Government which promised 2,000 jobs by 1990.  That did not happen either.  It is a shame that the full potential of our fishing resource is not explored, thereby generating employment and establishing strong Government support for the fishing industry.  I ask the Minister to formulate positive proposals in this area in the near future.</P>

In saying that I am not pointing the finger directly at the Minister, because Deputy Andrews has inherited quite a bag of problems in the Department of the Marine which were not of his making but that of many of his predecessors.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in his capacity as Minister for the Marine in the 1980s. Everybody recognises that there is a <Col N="912" /> serious crisis in the Irish fishing industry. Senator Belton has properly outlined that the crisis has been compounded this year by the severe weather and sea conditions, which have resulted in boats being tied up for an average period of over 14 weeks.  That is a long time for anyone to be out of work and out of pocket.  The crews on the ships have suffered a serious loss of income, but the owners of the ships have also suffered serious loss of income.  In many cases it has been extremely difficult for them to meet annual repayments on boats.</P>
      <P>Given this unique situation, the area deserves special treatment.  There is a crisis and many people may be forced out of business if some financial aid package is not provided.  It is right that the fishing industry look for assistance.  Other sectors have been provided with aid when unusual crises have occurred and it is quite normal that this group should be entitled to special assistance in these unusual circumstances.  I join with Senator Belton in asking the Minister to seriously examine that situation and the individual position of a number of boat owners who need assistance at this time.</P>
      <P>We have a fleet which is underdeveloped. It is generally recognised that it is substandard when compared with our European counterparts.  There is a proposal about providing assistance to upgrade the fleet and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the maximum possible assistance is given to these people.  Unless it is given, more people will go out of business and fewer people will be employed in the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of our difficulties may stem from what occurred when we entered the EEC and the agreements that were signed at the time.  We got a bad deal and despite the fact that we are an island country, we seem to have few rights on our waters. This is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed and it can only be addressed at European Council level by the Minister and indeed by his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In light of the fact that Deputy Andrews was also Minister for Foreign Affairs he has every knowledge and competence to deal with <Col N="913" /> this area.  There is a real need to sit down at this stage and put a special case in relation to Ireland's rights and the need to extend our current limit.  It is unacceptable that we have such limited control over our own waters.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the treatment to which our fisherman are being subjected, particularly by the Spanish fishermen in our waters.  As the Minister is also Minister for Defence, he is in the unusual position of being able to use every opportunity and asset he has to ensure that the blackguarding of Irish fishermen by Spanish fishermen stops and that every action, including court action, is taken to ensure it stops.  The Minister must, at European level, use every opportunity to highlight the conduct of members of the Spanish fishing fleet.  They have superior boats and Irish fishermen's lives have been put at risk.  It is an appalling and intolerable situation and does not warrant any lenient treatment.  I ask the Minister not to be lenient because we have suffered at the hands of the Spanish fishermen for many years and it is time to call a halt.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton already dealt with the issue of employment in the fishing industry. In 1988 &mdash; we now come to the then Minister, Senator Daly &mdash; there was a grand launch of a BIM plan where 2,000 jobs were to be created by the year 1990. We witnessed the greatest publicity and hype ever given to any launch.  We hoped there would be great developments in the fishing industry but, unfortunately, we have not seen any additional employment generated either directly or indirectly in the fishing sector since then.  It is necessary that we make the greatest possible use of our natural resource and develop it to its full potential to ensure both direct and indirect job creation.  The Minister is in a position to bring together all the agencies and the personnel involved, to use them to the benefit of our fishing industry and for employment in general. I look forward to him doing something in that area in the near future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed <Col N="914" /> to this debate, particularly the Fianna Fáil spokesman.  Senator Tom Fitzgerald, for his very kind opening remarks in proposing the motion.  I am particularly touched by Senator O'Kennedy's remarks, which were deeply appreciated.  Senator O'Kennedy and myself have been on the road a long time and he was a former Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is very gratifying to hear a predecessor in office make such complimentary remarks about a successor, in all the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald paid tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, and I, too, wish to once more send messages of goodwill and my best wishes for a speedy recovery to the Deputy who has made heroic efforts to return to the Department. We look forward to seeing him there very shortly.</P>
      <P>Castletownbere has been mentioned. I represented the Government on two occasions there, on the Thursday night and on the Saturday.  Once more I pay tribute to the relatives of the deceased and the local community for their composure and heroism in the face of a most appalling tragedy.  In relation to the tragedy itself, it is of course something that can never be comprehended.  Two investigations are ongoing at present, one conducted by the marine survey office of the Department of the Marine, headed by the deputy marine surveyor, Mr. Séamus McLoughlin, assisted by a couple of his associates.  That investigation will be very thorough and transparent.  I hope it will be completed in the not too distant future and that the results will be in the public domain, subject, of course, to whatever constraints are placed upon it by the Attorney General.  I understand, too, that the Garda Síochána are taking an interest in the matter so there will be no whitewashing and no witch hunt.  I wish to make that very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the amendments, I will take them <i>seriatim</i>, I anticipated the first one in a sense.  I realise that those working in the fishing industry, particularly between October and January, experience hazards and hardship from the <Col N="915" /> elements.  They are probably among the most courageous people in pursuit of a livelihood on this island or, indeed, any other island.  In anticipation of the first amendment I have taken a number of steps, and if I may say with as much humility as politicians have at their disposal, I have taken quite a number of initiatives in the Department of the Marine since my arrival there.  This initiative incorporates three elements. The first is in relation to the possibility of compensation for those fishermen who cannot fish because of the weather and I have been in touch with the Minister for Social Welfare to arrange all possible assistance to alleviate the hardship suffered by these fishermen.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second element, I asked BIM to conduct an in-depth review of the problems arising because of the weather.  I asked them to prepare a report which came to hand yesterday or the day before, and I am now addressing that report with a view to preparing a package for the Minister concerned to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The third element in the package of proposals to address this issue is that I have written to the Commissioner with responsibility for Fisheries, Mr. Paleokrassas. Mr. Paleokrassas and I have had a very good relationship since I became Minister for the Marine and I have had an immediate response from him.  He will investigate the possibility of putting together whatever elements are available to him in the context of the proposal addressed by this first amendment.  While I am not suggesting that the Deputy withdraw the amendment, which is a matter entirely for himself, the issue is being addressed in a very thorough fashion.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second amendment, the question of outlining the findings of the sea trout task force, I simply cannot do that, because the task force has yet to report in full.  As the Senator will be aware, the interim report of the task force was published some months ago and is in the public domain.  The task force met in October 1993 and the interim report was published in November.  Quite a number <Col N="916" /> of its proposals have already been acted upon.  The task force will publish its findings shortly after Easter.  Therefore, the amendment in its spirit has already been addressed.  I understand that the task force's report will be published.  I have seen part of it and those who are concerned about the survival of sea trout will be as happy as one can make them in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to Dr. T.K. Whitaker for accepting the chairmanship of the task force.  I am deeply indebted to him for trying to solve this problem.  He has given tremendous service to this country in the recent and distant past.  He saw it as a duty to perform the function I asked him to perform and he willingly accepted the job.  I deeply appreciate his chairmanship and leadership in this area. The two issues proposed in the amendments are in an embryonic state.  If the Senator wishes to raise these matters again, I would be delighted to make myself available to him and to the Seanad to discuss them.</P>
    <P>The debate comes at an opportune time.  Our fishing industry faces serious issues at home and new challenges at European Union level.  It is vital that we face up to these challenges.  Through debates such as this and through every other means, it is important that we get across to everyone in this country the seriousness of the challenges we must face.  This is an important industry which, as Senator Fitzgerald said, employs up to 15,000 people, mostly in the peripheral regions of our country.</P>
    <P>I have made my determination clear at every opportunity and at every level in Europe to protect this sector and encourage its further development.  We must get the best results for fisheries both at national and European level.  However, as Senator Belton said, I need the united support of everyone involved if we are to achieve anything.  That is why a debate such as this is welcome.  It gives the Senators and the Oireachtas an opportunity to express a point of view, and it gives me as Minister for the Marine an opportunity to respond positively.  I am grateful to the Senators who proposed <Col N="917" /> the motion and I thank the Leader of the House for giving me the opportunity to respond to it.</P>
    <P>The Irish box is an area of 70,000 square miles around our coast.  It was defined in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the then European Community in 1986.  The purpose of the Irish box is to conserve fish stocks and preserve the indigenous fishing industries along our coastline.  It does this by providing for only limited access to the Irish box for Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels. Under the Iberian Act of Accession, this box is due to lapse at the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996.  That is how close we are to the problem we are now addressing.</P>
    <P>The European Union had set the end of last year as the deadline for a review of the measures governing Spanish and Portuguese access to fisheries to see what measures might be necessary following the lapsing of the Irish box.  The European Commission was proposing a free for all for Spain and Portugal in our waters from January 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Although legally Spain was entitled to a decision on this issue at last December's Fisheries Council in Brussels, I opposed an agreement because I was not satisfied with what was proposed for our country.  The issue now comes before the next Fisheries Council in April.  I commend the fishing industry for the unity they have shown and I look forward to that continuing, as I believe it will, in the run-up to the next Council meeting so that our fellow Europeans will understand that this time we are serious about protecting our fishing industry and the thousands of families who depend on that industry for their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I opposed agreement on a free for all because the Spanish track record of compliance, so ably outlined by Senator O'Kennedy, is extremely poor.  In 1992, for example, one in five of the vessels boarded by the Naval Service were Spanish. However, they accounted for more than half the detentions.  In this context, <Col N="918" /> I want to pay a heartfelt tribute to the courage and tenacity of our Naval Service in protecting these waters and to the professional support they receive from the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the Spanish fleet is far greater than the fishing stocks allocated to them in the Irish economic zone and the fleet is poorly controlled by their authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not properly controlled. As we know, the Spanish fleet is situated in north-west Spain, in Galicia. It appears that the Spanish Government has no control over that part of their country.  I do not have any argument with the Spanish Government or the Spanish people, but with the manner in which the Spanish fishing fleet conducts its business. The Spanish and the Irish have been good friends for many centuries and long may that continue.  I do intend to stop Spanish armadas, but I want to protect our vital national interest from threats by any country, for example, Spain and, to a lesser extent, Portugal.</P>
      <P>Against that background, any proposals to drop the Irish box and discontinue special controls on Spanish vessels would make management and conservation impossible and fish stocks would be seriously threatened.  I have consistently maintained Ireland's opposition to such proposals.  At the Fisheries Council last November and December I took the unprecedented step of presenting the Presidency, the European Commission and my fellow Ministers with a dossier setting out in graphic form the level and persistence of Spanish infractions. They finally got the message that illegal Spanish fishing activity in our waters is not just an Irish problem, but a European Union problem as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay special tribute not only to the unity of the fishing industry, but to the unity of purpose by an unfairly criticised Department of the Marine.  I have never seen such dedication from officials over the last number of months on this and other issues.  They have been <Col N="919" /> exceptionally professional and I am deeply grateful to them because they were a great help to me as I only had the portfolio for less than a year.  I want to make it clear that I have not just been engaged in negative opposition or what I might call &ldquo;spoiling&rdquo; tactics at European level.  On the contrary, I have consistently put forward a clear set of proposals that would protect Ireland's vital interests, be fair to Spain and Portugal, and would look after the European Union interest.</P>
    <P>The Irish proposals call for the continuation of the Irish box until alternative and equivalent control and conservation measures have been agreed and put in place; acceptance of the full integration of Spain and Portugal into the Common Fisheries Policy management framework, provided that framework includes adequate controls; and an improvement in the Spanish level of compliance with EU fisheries regulations.  In essence, we are arguing that the controls which currently exist need to be strengthened rather than relaxed.  This issue requires vigilance.</P>
    <P>As I said, I have argued Ireland's case on the Irish box within the European Council of Fisheries Ministers since I took office.  I have met the EU Fisheries Commissioner, Mr. Paleokrassas, on the issue as well as the Danish and Belgian Ministers when they held the Presidency. The Danish and Belgian Ministers have a difference of emphasis and approach to ourselves.  It is something we have to be careful of because we are in the European Union, a club, and are meant to accept the rules set down by the club.  Sometimes I feel that we are far too <i>communautaire</i>, far too much into the club and too committed to clubism rather than nationalism and the national interest.</P>
    <P>In advance of the April Fisheries Council it is likely that I will have bilateral meetings with ministerial colleagues in a number of other member states.  It would be my intention to meet with the current President of the Council of Fisheries Ministers, my Greek colleague.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Last December, before I left for the Fisheries Council, I received the wholehearted support of my colleagues in Government for the stance I am taking. I think the House will appreciate that I am making every effort to resolve this issue by political and technical means within the Council of Ministers.  I am also watching very carefully the legal basis which may be used to bring about any changes in the provisions of the Iberian Act of Accession and have inferred a very strong legal reserve.  On this issue, nobody will be able to say that we have not tried every means to get a fair deal for Ireland and for its fishing communities.</P>
    <P>The issue of illegal fishing in our waters is one that has underlined the merit of combining the portfolios of Marine and Defence, because the Naval Service and the Air Corps are at the cutting edge of the defence of our interests.  As Minister, I am ensuring the maximum co-operation and synergy between the two Departments in tackling this issue.  In this context I am pleased to tell the House that work is at an advanced stage on the drafting of a Fisheries (Amendment) Bill which will provide for greatly increased penalties on conviction for illegal fishing. The fines will be increased and we will close off a legal loophole which allowed vessels to escape confiscation until after their second offence or if ownership of the vessel has changed.  My intention is that the offence should attach to the vessel itself, irrespective of changes of ownership, and that confiscation could apply even for a first serious offence. This is a very significant departure and is making new law to the advantage of the fishing industry.  If all goes well, I hope to be going to Government fairly soon with the text of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the enlargement of the European Union, a number of countries are signing up for membership of the EU, including Finland, Austria, Sweden and Norway.  By definition, the people who deal with enlargement negotiations on behalf of this country would be the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and his Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.  I would like to <Col N="921" /> pay a warm tribute to these men for the manner in which they have conducted negotiations to date on the fisheries element of the enlargement negotiations. The Tánaiste has been in constant touch with me personally as has the Junior Minister at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt.  During the course of all the negotiations they have been in touch with me on the fisheries aspect. They have responded very positively to my attitude that when there is a vital national interest we should protect it, not at the cost of our membership of the EU but within the context of the rules and regulations which other countries operate very effectively and which we have been operating effectively under the leadership of these two gentlemen.  I am grateful to both of them for what they have done, and will do.  Finland, Austria and Sweden are effectively on board the European Union wagon, and Norway remains to be brought on board in the next number of days; they have a problem with fishing.  We have a very good association and a close relationship with Norway.  As an example of how a fishing nation should be run, Norway is a model. I do not think we will have any Spanishtype problems with the Norwegians because they control their fishing fleet in a very thorough way and with an integrity we must admire and appreciate.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are continuing between the EU and Norway on the terms of its accession to the Union.  The Irish Government strongly supports Norway's application to join the Union and, hopefully, an agreement can be wrapped up next week which will be ratified in due course by Norway.  Norway is a powerful fisheries nation and the Norwegian fisheries industry is a major competitor of the Irish industry, particularly in the salmon, herring and mackerel markets.  I foresee no threat to fish stocks in Irish waters from Norwegian entry to the Union as Norway's access will be strictly limited. Norway already had rights of access, including access to the Irish box, but we have never had any difficulties of an enforcement nature.  Irish fishermen, particularly the mackerel fleet, have an <Col N="922" /> interest in gaining access to Norwegian waters and ensuring a fair share out of the overall mackerel allowable catch &mdash; the TAC or total allowable catch &mdash; between the Union and Norway.  These issues are still being pursued.</P>
    <P>The major tariffs that apply at present to Norwegian fish exports will, of course, no longer exist once Norway has entered the Union.  We are seeking appropriate transitional measures to ensure the orderly development of the markets. Once the negotiations are finalised the Department of the Marine will be working with the industry and the State agencies concerned to map out an appropriate strategy for the industry in the new situation. It is clear that I have been and &mdash; with the able assistance, on his return, of the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan &mdash; will continue to be extremely active in defence of our fishing interests in the Councils of the European Union.  We will soon, hopefully, welcome new members into the Union.  Ireland and Norway in particular share many common goals. Norway is a country to be admired for its commitment to its fishing interests.  I would like to see more of that kind of approach on our part.  Recognising the vital importance of fisheries to jobs and to a way of life in our coastal regions, maintaining our people in sound, well rewarded employment around our coasts and recognising the force for community welfare and cultural development that this entails, have been part of the political philosophy I have long espoused and pursued and will continue to pursue.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate as an earnest of our seriousness and unity in defending and promoting our fishing industry.  The next step is to turn our words into action &mdash; to start acting like a maritime nation and not just talking like one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support this motion and join wholeheartedly in commending the Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Andrews, for his stewardship of that portfolio.  It is interesting that in the last line of his speech he says it is time Ireland started to act like a maritime nation instead of just talking like one.  I suppose when the history of this island comes to be written, the lack of exploitation of our waters will probably be seen as the biggest mistake we ever made.</P>
      <P>When Ireland's interests are at stake abroad there is no room for party politics or the normal ebb and flow of inter-party disagreements.  Every Irish man and woman shares the same burden of responsibility in securing that interest.  I have no doubt that the Minister's tactics when dealing with the Spaniards and defending Irish interests has paid off, and will pay off.  The Spaniards consider our waters to be their waters in every sense of the word and they systematically set about plundering them.  No other word can be used &mdash; it was sheer plunder.  The value of the catch and gear confiscated in 1993 was £556,000.  What amount of stock was taken from Irish waters in that period?  We do not have the figures but it must have been huge.</P>
      <P>It is not an act of a friendly nation when its nationals construct ships with secret holds.  While the Minister must be diplomatic in his use of language by using the phrase &ldquo;poor management&rdquo;, the Spanish Government must have been aware that these activities were taking place and that the landings at Spanish and other ports far exceeded the quotas permitted to Spanish fishermen.  Much as one regrets saying so, the Spanish Government was, in a way, an accessory to this plunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> I am glad the Minister envisages removing the first offence provisions &mdash; one was allowed one offence before one's vessel could conceivably be confiscated. That penalty will now be available for the first serious offence.  That was inevitable. We tried to be decent but they took advantage and constructed the secret holds.  They left us with no option.  We would be slow to take possession of a person's livelihood by confiscating his vessel.  However, they have left us with no choice but to act in this manner.</P>
    <P>I understand &mdash; and I am open to correction &mdash; that when catches and gear are seized by the Irish authorities the gear is put up for auction.  There is a type of gentleman's agreement that no one other than the original owner will bid for the gear.  That is akin to rewarding the person.  Why not destroy the gear if it is to be auctioned and nobody other than the original owner will bid for it?  I have no doubt that we have sent Spanish vessels back to sea with the same gear that was auctioned in Bantry or Castletownbere. That makes no sense.  If we do not achieve the market value of the gear and the offender can get it back with an offer of £100 or £200, there is no penalty to prevent the offence being repeated.  If the gear is confiscated and we cannot realise its true value, which may be many thousands of pounds, can we destroy it? If we had done so in the past, skippers may have been dissuaded from raiding Irish waters.  I agree with the Minister's actions on this issue and I wish him well in future negotiations.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the establishment of a group to review the marketing strategy, requirements for the fleet and so forth. That is vital.  On examining the allocation of Structural Funds I thought some allocations would have been better utilised in the Department of the Marine than in some other Departments to which they were allocated.  The potential for employment in the Department of the Marine is probably far greater than in many other Departments.  I told the Junior Minister at the time that I was disappointed because we would have got greater value from the funds if we had used them to <Col N="925" /> deal seriously with the potential of the fishing and associated industries.</P>
    <P>I join the Minister in sending greetings to the Minister of State, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan.  The Minister of State has been singularly fortunate to work for somebody as understanding and supportive as Deputy Andrews.  The Labour Party is happy to publicly acknowledge that fact.  I also acknowledge the comfort the Minister gave to the people of Castletownbere through his presence there for two days.  It was deeply appreciated.  It is easy as politicians to be blasé and to believe that nothing counts; we can be so cynical that we believe nothing matters. However, some things matter and it mattered to that community &mdash; as my colleague Senator Calnan knows because it is his constituency &mdash; that the Minister was present on that sad occasion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on his work.  As Senator O'Kennedy said, the Minister's experience in the Department of Foreign Affairs has enhanced his negotiating skills with his counterparts in Europe. He deserves to be complimented on how he has protected our fishermen since his <Col N="926" /> appointment.  I also thank him for his response to the recent tragedy in Castletownbere. His presence in the area was greatly appreciated.  I hope we will not see any other tragedies.  We must keep an eye on our ferries to ensure that proper safety standards are implemented.  I will put a motion to that effect in my local authority in Kerry to avoid similar tragedies.  I sympathise with the families of Castletownbere who were affected by that tragedy.</P>
      <P>The Minister told the House about the necessity of protecting the Irish box. Many people did not know what the Irish box was until recently when they saw from a map of the island what it entailed. It is a lifeline for the people in the fishing industry.  The box was established in 1986 when Spain and Portugal acceded to the EU.  There was a two-fold purpose for establishing the box: to conserve the fish stocks which were in grave danger and to protect the indigenous fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister admit that the fishing industry is vital to peripheral regions.  We are currently debating the Developing the West Together report entitled <i>A Crusade for Survival.</i>  If this is not a crusade for the survival of the west to save the 15,000 jobs in the fishing industry and the £98 million earned from that industry, we are only wasting our time.  The Minister has grasped the issue with his introduction of new legislation to curtail those who continuously abuse our waters.  The protection of our waters is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Spanish fleet has been mentioned a number of times this evening.  That fleet comprises over one third of the entire fleet of vessels in the EU and it grossly over fishes in the lucrative fishing grounds to the west.  In 1985 I was on a number of European committees on fishing.  The Spanish and other Europeans regularly spoke about the rich waters of west Kerry.  Their fishermen would head for the south-west coast of Ireland and come back with their boats heavily laden.  In half the cases of vessels being boarded the culprits seemed to be the Spanish; they seem to ignore the Irish authorities. The authorities have to be complimented <Col N="927" /> for the work they are doing with existing resources and the Navy and the Air Corps also have to be complimented.  Offenders will have to be taken to task, especially for catching undersized fish and the use of secret holds.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his remarks about changing the legislation as it affects people who commit offences and the fishermen being able to buy back their gear at a knockdown price.  Looking at the fines and closing off the legal loopholes is a good idea.  Imposing the fine on the vessel rather than on the captain, or whoever operates the vessel, is the right approach.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs to better develop its fishing industry and the entry of other countries, particularly Norway, into the EU will benefit Irish fishermen greatly. Due to developments over the years the Irish fishermen will be able to take advantage of this in slack times &mdash; for example when a quota is reached.  Now they will be able to travel to other waters for their catches.  Fishing is limited and depends on weather conditions; it can be dangerous on the high seas.  Over the last few months our fisherman have not been able to use their vessels as they wished and compensation should be set aside for them.  However, they might be well compensated by the new grounds they will be able to use if Norway enters the EU.</P>
    <P>The tone of the Minister's speech has to be welcomed.  It is time for us to start acting like a maritime nation and not just talk like one.  Those words will go down in history because it is time for action.  I compliment the Minister on the action he has taken, the way he has handled the portfolio and the way he has protected this important livelihood for the people of the west and the fishing industry as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and support this motion regarding the conservation of the Irish box.  I come from Cork South-West, a constituency which stretches the best part of 100 miles from Kinsale to the Dursey Sound, and taking into account all the <Col N="928" /> inlets, harbours and islands, there would be a couple of hundred miles of coastline. Fishing is of the utmost importance to the people living in that area.  In my constituency there is a lot of land set aside, there are poor, disadvantaged areas and quota restrictions on agricultural produce.  The sea is of vital importance and we need to protect and promote the fishing industry not only for the fishermen but for the onshore jobs in areas riddled by unemployment and emigration.</P>
      <P>On 1 January 1996, the European Union can abolish this protection of the Irish box and we could be left with a free for all.  The Minister said that sometimes we do not think of ourselves as a maritime nation and we want to start acting as one.  In the past particularly, there was as much interest in the sea in Switzerland, a land locked country, as there was in Ireland.  That was unfortunate because of the enormous resource we have offshore.</P>
      <P>I am aware from speaking to fishermen and councillors who live nearer to the sea than I &mdash; I live 14 miles from the sea and I am aware of the prevailing situation &mdash; that Irish vessels are sometimes pushed out of their own waters; they are virtually rammed by foreign vessels.  That is unacceptable. For example, large Spanish vessels come up beside the Irish boats and, if they do not get out of the way, they could be sunk.  This ongoing problem will have to be taken in hand.  We will have to do something about it quickly at domestic or EU level.  It is bad enough that overfishing and confiscations are taking place but there is a danger to the lives of Irish fishermen.</P>
      <P>Fishing is a hard and dangerous life and dealing with the sea is a dangerous game.  We saw that recently in Castletownbere. The grief felt by the whole community was heartfelt.  My sympathy goes out to the relatives and friends of Vincent and Treacy Moriarty of Castletownbere, of Patrick Maguire from Castletownshend and of Patrick O'Neill, an employee of Cork County Council of which I am a member.  It is tragic when such an event happens in a small community and it is never forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> I want to pay the deepest respect to the owner of the vessel, Colm Harrington, who has been most obliging and helpful to all in providing the ferry service from the mainland to the island.  I have travelled on it on different occasions and he is especially helpful to all.  There is no restriction, day or night, on his work.  I am sorry for him that this tragic event should have happened and I know that every consideration will be given to him and his skippers.  Unfortunately, accidents happen at sea; familiarity can breed contempt and lives are lost.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his work for the marine and I join in the good wishes to the Minister of State, Deputy G. O'Sullivan, and hope he will be back in action in the not too distant future. Protecting and promoting fishing is of the utmost importance for employment because along the coast we have people directly involved in fishing, aquaculture and mariculture.  We must not forget that there is a big link between fishing and tourism.  Protecting our fishing and conserving stocks will lead to a development in tourism which is an important money spinner.  Definite steps must be taken along our coast or some fish species will vanish, as they have in the North Sea. We have a duty to work on this.  The Minister is doing his utmost in Europe in conjunction with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring.</P>
    <P>No stone will be left unturned to achieve the objectives the Minister mentioned: the continuation of the Irish box until alternative and equivalent control and conservation measures have been agreed and put in place; acceptance of the integration of Spain and Portugal into the Common Fisheries Policy management framework; and that Spanish level of compliance with EU fishery regulations be improved.</P>
    <P>The last objective is extremely important because if matters continue as they have been we will be returning to the days of the Jolly Roger with ramming, endangering of life and various acts of piracy from those who roam our seas. That must be stopped, and the sooner the better.</P>

      <P>Like other Members, I welcome the vigour the Minister has brought to his portfolio since he became &ldquo;the Minister for fish and ships&rdquo;, in his own eloquent phrase.  His closing comments struck a resonant chord with me. It is extraordinary that we are the most maritime of European nations and yet we have a strange relationship with the sea. We have never seen it as a resource or a way to improve ourselves economically. We have never seen it for what it is; an untapped, rich potential source of employment and wealth for this nation.</P>
      <P>It is astonishing that for many years this State was dependent on foreign vessels to carry the bulk of our cargo and that with the sad and reprehensible loss of Irish Shipping we descended back into that abysmal position for a period, that we as an island nation did not have the same traditions as the Greeks and did not develop small inshore fleets, out of which to grow large deep sea fleets; that until recent years we have had a primitive and underdeveloped fishing fleet and that only in recent times did we began to expand that fleet, when constraints had been imposed on the way we could use the fishing and maritime resources of our sea area.</P>
      <P>It is equally amazing that we as a maritime nation have accepted what has been happening in Irish coastal waters, and particularly within the oddly named Irish box, the 70,000 square miles of sea we won in 1986 and retain until 1996.  What has been happening in that area is criminal in every sense of the word.  A member nation of the European Union has turned a collective blind eye on criminal activity which should not be acceptable in the civilised world.  Whatever difficulties Spain may have in Galicia and with civil administration in the north east of the country, that nation assumed a responsibility when it joined the EC and it has failed abysmally in that responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Magner put it well.  Anyone who casts even a casual eye on the tonnage of landings in Spain must know that Spanish seamen and the owners of those vessels have behaved in a predatory and criminal manner in cynically ignoring the <Col N="931" /> EU Common Fisheries Policy.  The Minister referred to his stance, for which I commend him.  I also commend him for the clear language he used tonight.  The Spanish record of compliance is not just extremely poor, it is appalling and unacceptable and we should not be shy about saying so.</P>
    <P>The Spanish fleet is far greater than the stocks allocated to them.  Yet the full fleet is active and can only be active if it continues to operate on a criminal basis. The Minister rightly pointed this out and one wonders what the EU Commission is prepared to do about it.  I am pleased to support the Minister when he says we will fight this issue as one of vital national importance.  We will take this to the wire and not support the extraordinary proposals of the Commission.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that access to this vital area should be eased for Spanish fishermen as of January 1 1996.  That is equivalent to saying that people who have been burgled should take the locks from their doors and welcome the burglars. The EU is supposed to be based on the observance and appliance of the rules of law; and the Commission has a responsibility, which every member swears to uphold, that it will operate in a way which supports the legal framework of the Union.</P>
    <P>It would be a travesty and a disaster for the Irish economy if the Spaniards, predatory and criminal as they have been, were to be allowed untrammelled access to the waters currently in the Irish box area.  It is time for the other member states to make clear to Spain that in addition to the considerable benefits that country assumed on joining the EC, it also assumed responsibilities.  From this remove one has no way of knowing whether the Spaniards observe the other rules it signed in Europe.  Be that as it may, they have shown disregard for the rules of fair play, legal behaviour and law of the sea in the way they have operated off our coasts.</P>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned the danger not merely to the livelihoods of Irish seamen but to their lives.  I was born and <Col N="932" /> still live within sound of the sea; my car shows signs of my proximity to the shore. The Irish coasts are redolent with stories of unbelievable attitudes taken by Spanish crews and skippers.  It is clear from these that Spanish fishermen have shown a blatant disregard for the lives and safety of other seamen and that is not tolerable.</P>
    <P>We face a major threat.  It is important that the House as a whole should show its unanimous support for the line the Minister and Government have taken. Senator Magner made two important points.  First, he said we must penalise these criminals who have been bound, brought into our courts and found guilty of criminal activity.  His suggestion that we should not allow the sale back of equipment and catch the criminals is a good one and should be followed. Second, a vital national interest such as this is above party politics.  It is incumbent on everyone in political life to unite on this issue, because it is too important to let go by default.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, who is a colleague of mine in Dún Laoghaire.  I support the amendment. Fishermen, the fishing fleet and related industries deserve our full support.  I hope the Minister will not take any prisoners in negotiations, particularly at EU level.  I also ask him to try to ensure that certain other nationalities do not write their own rules which would prevent the industry here benefiting as it should.  We are aware of the importance and great potential of the fishing industry and related industries, such as fish processing, fish farms and other areas.  Although these perhaps are not at the centre of this motion, I am sure the Minister will take some of my comments on board.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the fishermen of this country did not receive the due attention they deserved down through the years.  They have not obtained the same benefits as other sectors.  There is need for improvement in the facilities that fishermen are entitled to and should receive.  As the Minister mentioned, there is also the question of difficulties at certain times of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> I ask the Minister to take my comments on board.  We support him in his endeavours. I ask him to try to ensure that the difficulties are minimised.  In common with other Members, I extend my sympathy to the Castletownbere area and particularly to the bereaved families following the recent dreadful tragedy.  I wish the Minister well in his endeavours in the coming months and I hope Irish fishermen will be the winners after his negotiations.</P>

      <P>I have been most impressed by the debate and by the Minister's response.  It is amazing that every contributor spoke of incursions by the Spanish fishing fleet and the way they conduct their business.  The message to the Minister regarding his ongoing negotiations with the EU is clear.  Incursions and law breaking by not only the Spanish fleet but by any other country will not be tolerated by this country from now on.  I have no doubt that the Minister will receive great support on that.</P>
      <P>Spanish boats are brought to task by the excellent fisheries protection role carried out by the Naval Service.  The Minister praised this work and the Naval Service comes under his jurisdiction as Minister for Defence.  They are out in all types of weather.  I had an opportunity at one time to go on board for a short period to see how they conduct their activities at sea.  Recently, the Minister was on board a navy vessel to see how it operated. The dangerous work they carry out in tough conditions of high seas and large swells is most impressive.  It also became obvious in the debate that the Opposition agrees with what the Minister is doing.</P>

      <P>The Minister is around longer than I, but I trust this Opposition. I was delighted that the Minister spoke about getting a package in place that would help fishermen through some form of compensation.  It is an important move by the Minister to introduce social welfare <Col N="934" /> and to approach BIM to see what can be done in that regard.  He has also gone to the EU to point out the difficulties of Irish fishermen and to request some form of compensation.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with all of the Minister's responses.  He has been positive throughout. The Minister is correct in stating that it is time we started acting as a maritime nation rather than just talking as one. Senator Roche also referred to this.  We have said a lot about fishing and there are many books and reports, but we are still almost at square one.  If one was to visit any small port tomorrow morning, one would see the same men in their oilskins and Wellington boots as they head out to sea.  The technology of fishing has improved, but we have not improved at all on our way of thinking.  Fishing is a good livelihood, although a dangerous one.  Fishermen are tough.  They have big, friendly hands; when they shake your hand you know there is friendship there. They are that type of people.  We must protect them and ensure that both their rights and our rights are protected.</P>
      <P>This is what the debate has been about. It is has been most positive and I am delighted with the Minister's response and with the action he proposes to take in the forthcoming Fisheries (Amendment) Bill regarding penalties and so on.  Let us be honest, if the Minister includes a provision regarding the confiscation of boats on a first offence, there will be no need for confiscations.  All people have to do is comply with a simple law.  People will know there is a line and that that is where they can fish.  There will be no more hiding of illegal fish in false holds or in funnels.  In common with the Minister, I have friends in Spain, and there is nothing personal in this but they have to obey the law, as we must.  I thank the Minister and I am sure that when the fishing community reads his response, they will look favourably on it.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), to delete lines 2 to 19, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Garda Síochána station, at his discretion, do either or both of the following&mdash;</P>

      <P>This group of amendments deal with the question of choice of specimen. It is an element of drink driving legislation which has given rise to a series of legal challenges, many of which were based on procedure.  With a view to removing known difficulties and the potential for new challenges, the Bill, as initiated, transfers the choice of specimen to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>During the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, I pointed out that my primary concern in introducing such changes was to remove the potential for those technical challenges.  I have no desire to introduce unnecessary requirements and, accordingly, I decided to look again at this aspect of the Bill to see if it was possible to leave the choice of specimen with the individual concerned, while at the same time eliminating possible loopholes which may be exploited.  I have been advised by the Attorney General that such a course of action is feasible, particularly in the light of the Supreme Court judgment delivered before this Bill was published.  The amendments are designed to retain the practice under existing law whereby the arrested person is allowed the option to decide whether a specimen of blood or urine is taken.</P>

      <P>I am worried about circumstances where a doctor is unwilling to take a specimen on medical grounds. An objection should not be made orally <Col N="937" /> and &ldquo;states so in writing&rdquo; should be included in the Bill.  In such situations it is important that there is a record of what happened.  Who will record the doctor's objection?  Will gardaí fill in a form?  Will the doctor have to sign anything and will it be a conclusive statement?  Could someone object to the fact the doctor said he or she would not take a specimen? I do not like this because it is too vague.</P>
      <P>If a case is challenged, it would be better for the common good &mdash; for the person to be tested and the doctor &mdash; that provision is made for the objection to be in writing.  If a certificate was conclusive nobody could argue about it and the casualty officer could not say that the said doctor could not take a blood sample on medical grounds.  This is not right.  Unless there is some sort of certificate or written evidence, preferably which can be considered conclusive, we will have problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Henry's point, a refusal to give a specimen of blood or urine is sufficient to charge a person with committing an offence.  If a person is suffering from a medical problem, the doctor decides on medical grounds whether he wishes to take a blood sample or if the person is unable to provide a urine sample.  If the doctor declines to take a sample, the person may be asked to provide a specimen in hospital.  If he refuses, is convicted of an offence, is disqualified from driving and loses his job, is the doctor open to a subsequent action for negligence for not having taken a blood sample?  On the other hand, what would be the Minister's view if the doctor takes a sample under pressure, because of the way the Act is worded, and causes harm to the patient? This is serious.  It is essential that it is written into the Bill whether a doctor in the casualty department of a hospital to which a person was brought is responsible; whether the senior surgeon, who may be on duty elsewhere in the hospital is responsible or whether the Garda Síochána can bring in an outside doctor. This problem must be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> There is support for what the Minister is trying to do.  Fine Gael are anxious to ensure that people who go to hospital are not allowed to frustrate the Garda Síochána who are doing their duty when a person is drunk and incapable of driving a motor vehicle.  We need to devise a proper procedure as was raised by Senator Henry.  This problem may not be resolved tonight but on Report Stage we will be open to co-operate with the Minister on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Government amendments are reasonable in their generality but I support Senator Henry and Senator Enright, particularly in relation to section 15, to which amendment No. 7 relates. This amendment differs slightly from amendments Nos. 4 and 5 in that it deals with a person who is admitted to the casualty department of a hospital rather than a person in a Garda station.  In those circumstances it is easy to envisage very strong medical grounds as to why a sample might not be taken.  In case confusion might arise in such a case, there should be something in writing.  There would be several medically trained people there and there may or may not be a garda beside the person who is admitted.  Senator Henry is right.  This will lead to terrible confusion.  Court cases will arise and we will not know with certainty who was responsible and for what.  I can see circumstances arising where people who should be convicted in the courts will get away with what appear to be crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised in the Dáil debates and in the Second Stage debate in this House.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association expressed concern.  We have begun discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the IHCA with a view to devising the best administrative arrangements to secure convictions, but also to make sure the changes we are making in the law are operated efficiently to achieve the best possible results.  It is not be possible to detail what we will include in the regulations to achieve this because the <Col N="939" /> consultations are ongoing and the people directly involved wish to have the best say as to how this should be achieved.</P>
      <P>We are in the course of enacting primary legislation to tackle the problems associated with road accidents.  A reduction in the number of such accidents reduces the load on hospitals, and we all subscribe to this aim.  This would benefit not only hospitals but potential injured parties.  We look for co-operation from hospital consultants to achieve this national goal.  So far, this co-operation has been given willingly.  I expect to have the discussions between my officials and the consultants concluded in good time before the law is brought into force and everybody is certain of what their role should be.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about significant numbers.  Since the question arose many years ago, there have been few problems of either individuals refusing to give a specimen or potential situations where doctors refused to co-operate.  We are not dealing with the generality of problems but with a minor part of this area. Arising from the discussions which are taking place, we must introduce regulations so that we have the best way of dealing with the potential but minority range of problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it very unwise to have a situation which does not involve the doctor putting something in writing. Medical defence organisations constantly urge us to put things in writing.  This could cause a great deal of trouble.  In parts of this Bill the doctor will be designated but in other parts we have not said whether the designated doctor will be the senior house officer in the casualty department, the orthopaedic registrar, the consultant on casualty duty that night or the person to whose ward the patient is admitted.  The word &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; is not adequate.  A patient could trawl around a hospital until they found someone who refused to let them give a blood sample on medical grounds.  Could they call in their own general practitioner?  We must have something in writing.  I do not know <Col N="940" /> if the Irish Hospital Consultants Association or the Irish Medical Organisation would be against this.</P>
      <P>This is always a problem in litigation in this country with medico-legal cases involving accidents and so forth.  Was it Joe who is now in Saskatchewan who said this happened or was it so and so who is in Tralee or has gone back to Pakistan? It is a serious problem.  I will not be pressing my amendment because there is no point but I urge the Minister to look at this before Report Stage and talk to the various medical bodies again.  There has to be some provision where the doctor's name is given and something is signed so that his opinion cannot be challenged.  This is a serious situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not anxious to make this a contentious issue; we are trying to be as reasonable as possible. The Minister said he is having consultations with the hospital consultants and senior registrars and he made a point about what will happen before the law is enforced.  However, the problem is that the law will be passed by the Dáil and Seanad at that stage and it will be only a matter of time before it is brought into force.  It is our duty and solemn obligation when passing a law of this significance to ensure that it is clearly defined.</P>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator Henry and I would strongly support the Government's amendment provided that a doctor who is unwilling on medical grounds to permit the taking of a sample is allowed to furnish his reasons for refusing in writing.  That is a reasonable request.  A doctor can later find himself involved in contentious litigation in which his professional standing may be questioned.  The Medical Defence Association will be concerned about this clause because a case may arise three, six or eight months later where the defendant has lost his job, had to move house and so on.  I hope the Minister realises the significance of this.  If a doctor refuses permission on medical grounds, he should be obliged to furnish his reasons along the lines proposed by Senator Henry.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not established to my satisfaction that the hospital consultants would be opposed to Senator Henry's proposal.  It would improve the legislation significantly and it is in that light it is being suggested.  The Minister, earlier this afternoon, talked about the undesirability of allowing lobby groups to dictate how legislation should be framed.  This would appear to be a case in point.  It would be undesirable for us to say that hospital consultants should determine what the regulations should be or what the law should be.  That is not to say that there should not be consultation; of course there should be and the Minister is right to consult with them.</P>
      <P>The Minister also made the point that he hopes, as we all do, that this legislation will result in fewer people being injured and admitted to hospital casualty departments. That reinforces the argument that there should be something in writing because this will not happen daily.</P>
      <P>We are all anxious to eliminate bureaucracy from the system.  However, this is not a question of introducing bureaucracy but of ensuring that subsequently there is at least some empirical, independent, verifiable evidence to endorse what has been done and to show who the practitioner was.  Regulations are not adequate to do this as they involve too much discretion.  It is up to us to frame the law to the advantage of society rather than the Minister at his discretion, however good that might be, deciding what the regulations should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is flawed legislation which could possibly get through the UK courts where they have a different court system.  However, in the Irish court system where the line of evidence has to be followed step by step, the history of the forerunners to this legislation has been that if there was a gap in the chain of evidence the legislation was flawed and it was levered out of existence.  The flaw here is that somebody can say their doctor said they were not to give a specimen. The doctor does not have to be named, it could be any one of a team of doctors, and there is an immediate gap <Col N="942" /> in the chain of evidence which cannot be bridged.</P>
      <P>The Minister said at the beginning of this discussion that he would be open to looking at things.  Even if he disagrees with the points we are making here, it is true that the amendment tabled by Senator Henry closes this gap.  It does not take from what he is trying to achieve. It does not weaken the legislation but clearly strengthens it and bridges an undeniable gap in the chain of evidence because it will have to be proven in the confrontational context of the Irish court system.  I urge the Minister to accept Senator Henry's amendment.</P>

      <P>My amendment comes later but I spoke on the Government amendments because I think it is so important.  The Minister said we want to get hold of those who want to avoid or evade lawful prosecution, with which I totally agree.  I see this as a major problem not only for the patient but for the doctor.  A designated doctor, especially in smaller areas, could be the general practitioner of the person involved.  It is most important that at least he could tell the patient he had to sign a document to say that on medical grounds he did not feel the patient should have blood taken. It makes the giving of permission or refusal to take blood much more important. I commend this legislation but I see this as a problem.  I do not think the medical profession will find the giving of written permission or refusal a problem because we are constantly warned by the medical protection organisations to ensure that we have put things in writing.</P>

      <P>As has been the case all day, and it has always been my experience of this House, a number of amendments have been taken together, even those which are not directly associated with what we are discussing.  It is probably as well that we have rambled into Senator Henry's amendment, No. 9. Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 7 deal with the Garda/doctor taking the specimen and amendment No. 9 deals with the role of the hospital doctor.  It is not, as Senator <Col N="943" /> O'Toole said, that I want to disagree.  If the discussions conclude on the basis of a written statement, which is what the consultants desire, my proposals allow for that situation.  If the discussions lead to doctors vetoing the taking of specimens without giving any reason, not being challenged on this and presenting none of it in writing, my proposals also allow for that result.</P>
      <P>I am not pre-empting the outcome of these consultations and discussions.  I take Senator Henry's point that in light of liability and other associated problems, many doctors may prefer the written way because it is the safest.  However, that has not clearly emerged in the discussion so far.  In fact, the opposite would seem to be the case, in that doctors do not seem to be anxious for a statutory obligation which involves them in a lot of form filling.  It will not be consultant doctors but the Garda doctor &mdash; and Senator Henry rightly said this could be the practitioner for that individual &mdash; who will be taking the specimen.  Taking all of those factors into account, I am trying to achieve a result which allows the balance to tilt either way after the conclusion of these discussions.  Senator Henry is asking me to confine myself to one conclusion. That may well happen; if it does, that result can be totally facilitated in my proposals.  If they are retained in their current state, they could also facilitate a different result, which could be reached by consensus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>What if a defendant in a court case claims the reason he did not give a sample was because he was advised against it after discussing the matter with one of the team of doctors?  How is that simple statement to be dealt with at court level?  There are two possible outcomes. First, that decision is accepted and that would be the end of the matter.  Second, it is not accepted and is challenged as being untrue.  There is then a process where it will have to be proven or disproved. It is bringing a cumbersome procedure into the case; whereas if there is written evidence of this medical procedure <Col N="944" /> being approved, that is the end of the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister says in another part of the Bill that the Garda's signature shall be acceptable as evidence.  The same thinking is behind this as well.  The only reason I can see why the Minister put that in the Bill is to stop someone from going to court, wasting a day to say &ldquo;Yes, that is my signature.  Thank you very much&rdquo; and going home.  I would like to see a similar provision written into that kind of situation so there is incontrovertible evidence if a case is being brought to court.  It makes the legislation tidier, more operable and effective.  I cannot see why the Minister cannot put a provision like that into the Bill.</P>

      <P>Following on from what Senator O'Toole has said, I would be grateful if the Minister could look at this matter again before Report Stage.  As Senator Dardis said, lobby groups are lobby groups.  The Minister will not have too much difficulty with the various medical organisations.  The last sentence contained in amendment No. 9: &ldquo;such certification of refusal to allow for the taking of a blood sample or a specimen of urine shall be conclusive and shall be evidence of the fact described in it&rdquo; would avoid having to bring people in to certify their signature.  I would have also put this sentence in amendments Nos. 4 and 5, but I did not see them until today.</P>
      <P>There is no major rush in the matter. It would take only a week to consult with the two medical bodies.  I urge the Minister to look at this matter carefully. I know how casualty departments are run and who is supposed to be taking responsibility.  Under this section we are not even clear who the doctor is, and that is dangerous.  It is considered highly serious in medical litigation cases in that one must sign everything they do.  This will end up causing the same sort of trouble.  The Minister did say that there would be few cases.  In that event, the medical practitioners cannot then complain about a great increase in bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>It concerns amendment No. 4.  As a lay person listening to these contributions, I do not understand what the Minister is trying to achieve with this amendment.  Neither did I understand what was in the Bill as it emerged from the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 deals with the situation in the Garda station, where the person is required to exhale into the apparatus.  The garda may &ldquo;permit a designated doctor to take from the person a specimen of his blood&rdquo;, or &ldquo;at the option of the person, to provide for the designated doctor a specimen of his urine. The amendment continues:</P>
      <P>If the doctor is unwilling, on medical grounds, to take from the person or be provided by him with the specimen to which the requirement in either of the foregoing sub-paragraphs related, the member may make a requirement of the person under this paragraph in relation to the specimen other than that to which the first requirement related.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister is talking about in this amendment.  I do not know what the requirements are or the limits as to the requirements a member of the Garda or of the public can make in a Garda station in this situation and I want it clarified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter can be approached from two angles.  The Supreme Court judgment in the case of the <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Swan</i> was delivered in May 1993.  The judgment confirmed that the obligation in relation to providing a specimen is to permit the doctor to take a specimen of blood, that the person has an option to provide a specimen of urine and if that option is exercised, it relieves the person from the obligation to permit a specimen of blood to be taken.  The judgment clarified that if a person declares that he wishes to avail of the option to provide urine but then finds he is unable to do so, the obligation to permit the taking of a specimen of blood is revived.  One also has to take account of past challenges <Col N="947" /> and problems which arose where an individual suffering from a medical ailment gave permission for the taking of a specimen on which he is unable to deliver and then informed the doctor that he suffered from an ailment.</P>
      <P>I originally gave the Garda doctor the right to specify whether a urine or blood sample would be taken.  Having listened to discussion on the Bill and consulted with the Attorney General, I decided to leave it to the individual to decide whether they would give a specimen of blood or urine.  Where a person fails to give a specimen which he or she has volunteered, the option to give the other specimen is then revived as per the court judgment.  Am I clear?</P>

      <P>For the person in the Garda station, whether we are brief or not can be a matter of considerable importance.  This is my difficulty with the section as I read it: a person has two choices, either to give a specimen of blood or a specimen of urine.  The doctor may say that because of a medical condition, he is not prepared to take a blood sample.  The person then says he is willing to provide a urine sample but for some reason cannot provide it.  If the doctor has already stated that, for medical reasons, he is not prepared to take a blood sample, how then can the garda be in a position to require the person to give a blood sample?</P>

      <P>Does the amendment not state: &ldquo;If the doctor is unwilling, on medical grounds, to take from the person...&rdquo;? My intention here is to assist the Minister. My concern is that a situation may arise where the Garda have arrested somebody and taken them to the station. The person under arrest has been given the choice of providing either a blood sample or a urine sample and is prepared to do either or both but the doctor is unwilling, for medical reasons, to take the blood sample.  The person is prepared to give the sample but the doctor is not prepared to take it.  The person is quite happy to give a urine sample but is unable for a medical reason to give it.  The person has attempted to comply with both requirements.  How does one deal with that difficulty?</P>

      <P>Where an arrested person chooses to give a urine sample and is subsequently unable to do so, the option to take a blood sample could be revived only if the doctor was satisfied to do that.  The circumstances detailed by Senator Howard arise where the doctor is not satisfied to take a blood sample. The matter then has to go to court on the basis of that stalemate situation and the court will decide on the basis of the available evidence what action should be taken.</P>
      <P>Where a garda suspects that an arrested person has been in charge of a car while under the influence of intoxicating drink, refusal to give a sample in itself is an offence from which severe penalties may follow.  There are a minority of cases in which this may happen. I appear to have misunderstood Senator Howard initially.  He has a point and it leads to a number of difficulties but they can be resolved in court.</P>

I agree with Senator Henry's point that the medical profession have complied with the Road Traffic Acts and all the procedures involving blood and urine samples in a most exemplary manner.  I have heard little or no unfavourable comment about doctors not complying with the regulations.  They have gone out of their way to be helpful.  It is seldom that a doctor is unwilling, on medical grounds, <Col N="950" /> to take a blood sample.  It may arise in one case in 10,000.  What is required here is that the doctor will be able to record his reasons in writing.  The Minister said that he will carefully examine this matter before Report Stage.  Opposition Members will table amendments before then.</P>

      <P>I will be happy to await what the Minister suggests with regard to the signature.  The difficulty in understanding how paragraph (b) operates arises from the language used in the section.  To require a person &ldquo;to permit&rdquo; is a contradiction in terms as is requiring a person to &ldquo;opt&rdquo;.  It is difficult to follow but I think it is clear what is meant by the provision, although people might argue about the language used.</P>
      <P>In regard to two samples being taken is it laid out in the main Act that both measurements are added and then averaged?  The average is then reduced by a tolerance level of 6 per cent.  That is where the figures come from.  I wish to know whether that is in the legislation. In this section, the garda may require a person to give two breath samples and one sample of either blood or urine.  In the event of three different measurements, I presume that the two breath measurements are in some way added, averaged and a tolerance level taken from them.  How is one type of measurement compared with the other?  Does the State run with the best evidence, or the most damning evidence?  If one is over the limit and one is below the limit, how is that dealt with?  I want to know the practicalities of it.  It is not written into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I explained earlier that as far as the evidential breath testing was concerned we would go through an initial two year period, or perhaps longer.  It will be long enough to make sure that the taking of representative samples which involve the evidential breath testing as well as blood or urine testing has gone on for a sufficient time to demonstrate conclusively that evidential breath testing is as reliable, accurate and implementable as the traditional system.  The breath tests would be taken but in the intervening period, between now and the evidential testing being proven and put into effect, the blood or urine will be the dominant factor in determining the case one way or the other.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I have a satisfactory answer here.  Let us be practical about it.  We are introducing a new phase to the armoury of legislation that we have in road traffic law which covers a number of items, but primarily the question of dealing with road traffic accidents <Col N="952" /> caused by drink driving.  It would make no sense whatsoever, having used a tried and tested system of blood and urine specimens being used as the criteria to determine whether a person was over the limit or not, to change it without being absolutely certain that what was replacing it was equally effective, scientifically, clinically and administratively. We have to go that distance.</P>
      <P>In terms of international experience, the system has been in use for a long time, from 1981 to 1989 in the UK, for example.  There have been quite a lot of challenges to that system.  They appear to be very happy with it at present.  We have to go through that phase of experience here so it would be nonsense to battle away as we have been doing in both Houses of the Oireachtas for the last number of months to improve the situation and then take risks with what we want to use to achieve that result.  I assure the House that no steps will be taken to depart from the principle of using specimens of blood and urine until we are absolutely happy that it is being replaced by at least an equally satisfactory and reliable way of convicting people who break the law.</P>

      <P>Under the circumstances, because of the problems of drugs and having given the matter great thought, I agree with this section.  This is a new concept in Irish law.  Care should be taken because of the necessity to control drug abuse.  It is a new development for a member of the Garda Síochána to request a person to accompany them to a Garda station without being arrested. This is a departure from existing law and I agree with it.  A garda can request a person to go into a Garda station, but the person is not obliged to do so and an arrest cannot be made.  I agree with this new development because of the drugs problem, but I would not support it in a general situation.  It happens in practice, but this is a statutory matter.

The way we deal with drugs is not a new phenomenon, but it is always changing.  I will answer the Senator from what I learned in the science room at school.  An analysis shows exactly what is there and it is not a question of doing it in many different ways. One is looking for the components or for the alcohol level, which is a drug.

      <Col N="956" /> This amendment has been tabled so that people cannot avoid or evade lawful prosecution. Admission to hospital means admission to the wards.  Many people who are brought into hospital and who may be charged with drunken driving will get no further than the casualty department. Some people use the casualty department as a method of escape because they are not in a position to have blood or urine tests taken.  I ask the Minister to accept these amendments which mean people will be in the casualty department of a hospital.  I fear that if we just have admission to hospital it may mean that one must be admitted to the wards because anyone who goes into a casualty department is not described as having been admitted to the hospital.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (3), to delete all words from and including &ldquo;the person&rdquo; in line 20 down to the end of the subsection, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the doctor under whose care the patient is, refuses in writing, on medical grounds to permit the taking or provision of the specimen concerned. Such certification of refusal to allow for the taking of a blood sample or the provision of a specimen of urine shall be conclusive and shall be evidence of the fact described in it.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> I talked about this issue before and the Minister said he would consider it.  It is important to give something in writing.  I draw the Minister's attention to the last part of the amendment which states that &ldquo;such certification of refusal to allow for the taking of a blood sample or the provision of a specimen of urine shall be conclusive and shall be evidence of the fact described in it.&rdquo;.  This is to avoid people being called back from Pakistan, Canada or wherever in order to appear in court to verify signatures.  This is an important point.</P>
    <P>We have not said it is conclusive if a doctor says a blood sample cannot be taken on medical grounds.  The designated doctor could say that a person is capable of giving a blood or urine sample. This must be conclusive, otherwise the designated doctor could say he has no idea why the person said the blood sample could not be given.  There must be something which the doctor who refuses to allow the sample to be taken can stand over and which the designated doctor must accept unless he or she is the one who is refusing to collect the sample. This is important because it could result in legal problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Procedures for operating this section will be developed and agreed with the various interests and, as I have said earlier, discussions have already taken place.  The intention is that the hospital doctor will have the right to veto the taking of a specimen, that he can do so verbally, that he will not be required to state reasons and that his decision will not be challenged.  It will be the hospital doctor's decision in each case.  If the organisations concerned would prefer the procedure to involve a written statement of refusal, then we can develop an administrative procedure along these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated earlier that I was quite happy to look at this general area between now and Report Stage.  I suppose that having subconsciously reflected on it since then, I can see problems. There is merit in taking the course that Senator Henry outlined.  However, if it <Col N="959" /> should evolve that the consensus is not for a written statement, then the primary legislation prevents that from happening. Therefore, while I am quite prepared to reflect on it, I see a problem in not having enough flexibility if circumstances were to arise in a different way to those outlined by Senator Henry, however genuinely they were presented here.  As I said earlier, I undertake to look at that general area again.  If it can be phrased in a way that takes account of a different result from those discussions, then perhaps we can have a meeting of minds.  At the moment it would appear difficult for us to find an agreement here, but I am not going to pre-empt what I may decide when I have reflected on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry's amendment is quite specific and refers to:</P>
      <P>Such certification of refusal to allow for the taking of a blood sample or the provision of a specimen of urine shall be conclusive and shall be evidence of the fact described in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry's approach to this is that in the event of a doctor who is unwilling on medical grounds to take a sample, that doctor shall give the evidence in writing and it shall be conclusive.  On the other hand, the State's certificates from the medical bureau are conclusive and cannot be contested in any respect.  They are now 100 per cent immune from any challenge following a number of Supreme Court decisions.  Senator Henry has skilfully outlined the position.  If the person later loses his or her driving licence, serious consequences can arise for a doctor if the certificate is not allowed as conclusive proof, or the doctor may have been transferred to another hospital or area and thus may not be in a position to give evidence in a court case.  Where a person is charged and convicted and the doctor has not submitted a medical certificate, serious consequences can also arise for the doctor.  The Minister himself has admitted how happy he has been to date with the way the medical profession has co-operated with the procedures <Col N="960" /> involved.  This amendment, which will arise only on rare occasions, is something that will be to the benefit of the defendant in some cases and certainly to the advantage of the doctor and the State.  I strongly advocate that the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has said that he is prepared to look at Senator Henry's amendment, I fail to understand Senator Enright's evaluation of it.  He uses the example of where the doctor refuses to allow the sample to be taken on medical grounds and yet the person is convicted afterwards.  I find it hard to understand how that could happen, because there would not be any evidence to convict the person when the sample has not been taken and no refusal is involved.  I do not follow the argument there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to clarify the point, the individual concerned might or might not have been in a position to give a sample.  Supposing that, being aware of their own medical history, the person declined to give a blood sample and because of that they have already committed an offence.  Do you follow me on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not have very much to add here.  I have no wish, as the day moves on, to listen to myself any more than is absolutely essential for the purposes of answering the questions I am responsible for.  I indicated that I would be having a look at this between now and Report Stage.  I can see difficulties in making any change, because my proposal keeps the flexibility for the different options which may ultimately be desired by the medical organisations going either orally or by way of a written statement. So far those discussions have tended <Col N="961" /> towards having a situation where the doctor would act verbally.  I want to make sure that I provide for that.  Nonetheless, strong arguments have been made and I want to see to what extent I can accommodate the House, though the only wisdom I have is that I would find it very difficult to deliver.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 15, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few problems with the section and perhaps we can get them cleared up.  It is a minor point but the first lines of the section state:</P>
      <P>Where, in a public place, an event occurs in relation to a mechanically propelled vehicle...</P>
      <P>Is there some reason for using the word &ldquo;event&rdquo; as against &ldquo;an accident&rdquo;?  &ldquo;An event&rdquo; seems to be a much broader term than the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;.  I will leave that and I am sure the Minister will come back to it.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about section 15 (1) (a), which states:</P>
      <P>the person was driving or attempting to drive, or in charge of with intent to drive or attempt to drive (but not driving or attempting to drive), the mechanically propelled vehicle...</P>
      <P>The first part before the brackets is clear enough, but the phraseology within the brackets appears to be contradictory.  I would like to have it clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the evening is moving on, I would like to make all my points in the one contribution.  I am also concerned about the sequence of events when the matter of taking a blood or urine sample from an injured person in hospital arises.  As I read section 15, the consent of the doctor only arises in subsection (3) and is preceded by subsection (2), where the matter of the refusal or failure of a person to give a sample first occurs.  It is only subsequent to that refusal or failure that the opinion of a doctor would arise in the sequence of events as outlined in the <Col N="962" /> section.  I am concerned that a person, by virtue of their condition, might be disorientated and may be suffering from the effects of a crash that would impair their judgment or understanding.  They would have given their refusal in a state that would not be one of full consciousness and would, therefore, have committed an offence.  The opinion of the doctor as to whether or not the specimen should be taken would not arise until after that refusal had been given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It has already been said that I would have to be Solomon with all his wisdom, although without his glory, to solve those problems.  We do not use the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; because if we did we would have to prove that it was an accident.  It is not necessary that there be an accident in order to create the circumstances to which this part of the law would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not go into details and circumstances which are not necessarily accidents and which would warrant these provisions.  If the Senator wishes to do so at this stage I must regard him as the patron saint of hopeless cases. I am not in the mood for considering myself to be anything like St. Jude.</P>
      <P>The second question was about a &ldquo;person driving or attempting to drive, or in charge of with intent to drive or attempt to drive (but not driving or attempting to drive), the mechanically propelled vehicle...&rdquo;.  That is the exact provision contained in the 1978 Act, as Senator Enright can confirm.  These words have withstood the test of time. The explanation of them, in simple language, is that one phrase reinforces the other.  It puts the meaning of one part of the sentence into context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final question could only be answered by somebody from County Clare whose experience in this area is such as to convince them that there are a number of people who have psychological, <Col N="963" /> psychiatric or other problems of that nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Howard pointed out that this section applies to a person who has been taken to hospital for treatment. He said it is obvious that this section refers to an accident, although the word &ldquo;event&rdquo; is used.  It should read: &ldquo;Where, in a public place, an accident occurs in relation to a mechanically propelled vehicle&rdquo;.  Otherwise it refers to &ldquo;or in charge of with intent to drive or attempt to drive (but not driving or attempting to drive),&rdquo;.  That is an event, although the person is not driving or attempting to drive.  We should clarify this.  The Minister is introducing many new measures and penalties in this Bill. The penalties involved in this section will apply in the other sections.  It is therefore <Col N="964" /> important that we clarify the situation as Senator Howard requested.</P>
      <P>The point made earlier regarding a person who fails to provide a specimen and when the doctor is unwilling on medical grounds to take such a specimen should also be clarified.</P>
      <P>The Minister was somewhat jocose in his reply.  Senator Howard's question is serious.  It refers to the use of the phrase &ldquo;or in charge of with intent to drive or attempt to drive&rdquo; and the use of the word &ldquo;event&rdquo;.  What event is likely to occur if a person is sitting in a car and not driving it?  That is not an event and nobody is likely to end up in hospital if the car is not driven.  It is important that this provision be more specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be frank about these matters.  Senator Enright is presenting the proposition that this provision is new and that due to the changes being made in the law, it will present a problem. The word &ldquo;event&rdquo; has been used since 1961 in a range of offences.  It has never been challenged or found wanting.  I will not get into a legal debate with Senator Enright.  However, what is a hit and run? Somebody might claim it is an accident. I might claim it is something different when somebody takes charge of a vehicle when intoxicated to the extent that he cannot drive.  Whether one can call that an accident or an event could be the subject of a long argument.  We will not get into such an argument.</P>
      <P>This is a tried and trusted word to describe events and it cannot be challenged. The problem with this law has been the number of times it has been successfully challenged on the tiniest irregularities in wording or definitions. This word has stood the test of time and is used for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already discussed subsection (1) (a).  The words in brackets reinforce the meaning of the phrase.  I treat this matter very seriously.  Senator Howard, who is well able to defend himself, and I have battled for a long time in this House.  He is totally at ease about putting me in my place and on the rare occasions when I <Col N="965" /> can pull 15 or 16 inches above the ball I delight in doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that many sections of the Road Traffic Acts have on occasion been challenged on serious grounds.  I also accept that they have been challenged on the flimsiest grounds. However, the Supreme Court has successfully rejected the challenges.  These matters have become streamlined because of the way the Supreme Court handled them and the way legislation has evolved.  The Minister, his predecessors and the Department of the Environment have played a major role in making certain that the law we have is a safeguard for road users and pedestrians.  I go along with the provision as it relates to the person who is driving but the point I raise relates to the person who is in charge of the vehicle but is not driving or attempting to drive.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in his defence of these measures.  I want to return to the point I raised about the sequence of events for a person arriving at hospital following an accident when they are required or requested to provide a blood or urine sample.  They may refuse to do so without having full knowledge of the consequence by virtue of their medical condition after the accident.  The input of the doctor as to whether the sample can or should be taken has not arisen at that point.  The request or the requirement has first to be made and a refusal may issue, which may be the result of the person being confused following the accident. I want the Minister to accept that in this section there is no provision which will take account of the medical condition of the person in an accident which may <Col N="966" /> affect their understanding of the requirement made of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share Senator Howard's or Senator Enright's difficulty with this.  Let us take the word &ldquo;event&rdquo;. If I am driving down the road, a bird flies into the windscreen and I have an accident there is an element of chance involved.  However, if I am driving down the road and I see someone I do not like and drive for that person and hit them, that is not an accident it is an event &mdash; it may be attempted murder but it is an event.  The meaning of paragraph (a) is crystal clear although the wording might be a little complicated.  It means, on the one hand, a person is driving or, on the other, in the opinion of the policeman, they are attempting to drive.  That is all there is to it.</P>
      <P>We need to keep the taking of the blood sample in perspective.  The amount of blood required for a blood sample is minimal; it is a couple of millilitres obtained by means of a quick injection, a pinprick.  A pint is not required.  We need to keep this in perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation which Senator Howard outlines cover a tiny number of the overall cases.  He has not said that but I think he would accept it. He is right when he says that because of the nature of the accident and the consequent effect on the individual, they may not be able to co-operate.  We assume that the person, in whatever state of mind following the accident refuses and it is not possible to take the sample. The garda makes a written report of what has taken place and the matter goes to court and the court decides how responsible the person was for the accident in the first instance, whether it is of the opinion that they had taken drink, etc. All that will be put forward in evidence by the prosecution and will be defended by the legal representatives of the defendant and the court will ultimately decide on balance what course is to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no circumstances in which the court will be frustrated.  If the samples <Col N="967" /> are given they are analysed and there is a result.  If the samples are not given that is reported to the court.  In some cases, a refusal in itself is an offence.  However, in the case outlined by Senator Howard, I am not so sure because it moves into a grey area and there are many circumstances that would have to be dealt with by the court.  It is for the court to decide where, on balance, the blame rests.</P>

The person may want to leave the Garda station and go home and the gardaí feel he is not capable of driving home or going home on foot. Where a person is detained in a Garda station for that period of time it should only be done on the opinion of a doctor. Only a doctor should make that decision.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that the power for a garda to detain an intoxicated driver for up to eight hours can only be exercised on the advice of a designated doctor.  This section requires that the arresting garda must be of the opinion that the person being arrested is under the influence of an intoxicant.  The thrust of the amendment would transfer the onus of forming the opinion that the person was intoxicated to the designated doctor.  I do not feel that this would be welcomed by or acceptable to the medical profession.</P>
      <P>For the last hour we have had a discussion about the difficulties experienced by the profession from samples taken in a hospital.  Now Senator Enright seeks to extend the role of designated doctors to decide whether someone should be detained. The sole purpose of this section is to allow the arresting garda to detain an intoxicated driver whose release could be a threat to the safety of themselves or others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reassure Senators that the section has a number of specific safeguards to protect the rights of the driver so detained.  The maximum period of detention is specified as eight hours, special provision is made for minors and the garda will be required to inform a relative or other nominated person of the arrested person's detention and release when the relative arrives.  If the Senator considers more carefully he will agree this would be a departure from our present experience in these matters. <Col N="969" /> It would ask the medical profession to be involved in an area in which they would be reluctant to intervene.  To the extent that this matter is currently dealt with by the Garda authorities I am sure the safeguards and our proposals for the future would be a more satisfactory way to handle the matter.</P>

      <P>The majority of Senators here tonight are from rural areas.  The Garda have been commendable in dealing with people who have consumed an excess of alcohol.  After the person has been arrested and has given a blood or urine sample, in most instances gardaí either arrange for a taxi for the person or drive him or her home themselves.  Their attitude and co-operation in these matters is praiseworthy.</P>
      <P>I note and appreciate the safeguards provided by the Minister, which involve informing relatives and imposing age limits.  In most instances, perhaps 70 per cent, the people involved will be found guilty following the taking of samples, etc.  However, a person may not be guilty and for whatever reason a garda is of the opinion that the person is incapable of driving and detains him or her in the station.  Perhaps the garda is unable to contact a relative because they do not have a telephone.  A doctor will already have attended at the station and taken a blood or urine sample.  If the garda has a doubt about the person's ability to drive the vehicle home, he would be wise to ask the doctor for his opinion as to whether that person is capable of doing so.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to put additional pressure on the medical profession and I have listened with care to what was said by Senator Henry, other Senators and the Minister.  To detain someone in a station for up to eight hours is a significant matter.  At the same time, one knows how dangerous pedestrians walking at night can be if they have consumed an excess of alcohol, so gardaí must be careful before allowing them to leave the station.  The opinion of a doctor should be obtained before they should be released.</P>

      <P>This provision has significant civil liberties implications which cause concern.  It gives wide discretion to the garda involved.  As Senator Enright said, the doctor will not be specially summoned for this purpose, he will be summoned to take the samples in any event. His opinion is more expert than the garda's, although that is not to say the garda's opinion is not valid.  Wide powers are given to the Garda and it is possible to conceive of circumstances where those powers might be misused.</P>
      <P>To compound the matter, section 16 (2) (a) says if the person involved is over 18, the informing of other parties will be done &ldquo;as soon as it is practicable&rdquo;.  When precisely is that?  Could it be up to eight hours?  Circumstances could be envisaged where the garda decides a person must be detained and then decides it will be eight hours before it is practicable to inform the people who should be informed.  In the event of the person not wishing them to be informed that would not happen.  Where the person is under 18 there is also an onus to inform others as soon as practicable.  This is dangerous from the civil libertarian standpoint.</P>

      <P>Drug taking may become more common if we follow European trends and, if so, circumstances can be foreseen where gardaí might be anxious to have the opinion of a member of the medical profession.  A person in Garda care may be in such a condition that he or she may need to go to hospital to be detoxified.  It might be in the best interest of the garda on duty that he receive the backing of medical opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Another issue arises. Senator Kelly's point is relevant because, while alcohol remains a problem, drugs are causing more difficulties.  A period of eight hours has been mentioned but it is almost impossible for a garda to know what effect a drug may have, whereas it is relatively simple to decide what effect alcohol will have because it wears off after a time.  It would be prudent to have the opinion of a doctor available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> This amendment does not put more pressure on doctors because they will not have to call a second time.  At the earlier stage, the doctor's opinion should be sought by the garda.  The decision whether to detain the person can then be made.</P>
    <P>A person may initially have volunteered to give a sample.  He or she may then wish to leave the Garda station and may not be permitted to do so.  I have received considerable correspondence on the point raised by Senator Dardis.</P>
    <P>I will not put this matter to a vote if the Minister undertakes to give the matter some thought before Report Stage.  I have given the Garda the credit to which they are entitled and I have also men tioned the medical profession.  Circumstances vary and sometimes differences can arise between individuals.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> The current situation which prevails in Moycullen is the cause of deep anxiety and concern to parents and students.  This year the problem, which has been ongoing for approximately 14 years, finally came to a head when a number of students failed to get bus tickets to attend schools in Galway city that they traditionally attended over the years.  Some students on the Barna-Moycullen road are living approximately six miles from Galway city and 15 miles from Indreabhán vocational school, which is the school within their catchment area.  The fact that Moycullen is effectively in the suburbs of Galway city makes it unique as a catchment area.  It is natural, given the location of the parish of Moycullen, that many of the parents there are anxious to send their children to schools in Galway city.  It must also be noted that all of the villages in Moycullen parish are not in the Gaeltacht area.  It would be completely unfair in any system to force children who are not brought up in a Gaeltacht environment to attend an all Irish school.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, students from the Moycullen area attended second level education in Galway city, as schools in Spiddal and Oughterard were not co-educational. There are two all-Irish second level schools in Galway city for children who wish to attend such schools and these are both co-educational.  One is run under the vocational education system and the other is run under the religious system.  The option is there for students to attend all-Irish schools in the city or in the Gaeltacht.  At present, students from Moycullen parish attend second level schools in Galway city.</P>
    <P>The area is in the hinterland of Galway city, which is the fulcrum around which the west of Ireland revolves.  It is a major thriving city.  It was to be expected that many families would move into Moycullen in recent years because it is a beautiful place to live and convenient to the city.  Many of these people work in Galway and, therefore, it is understandable that they would like to have their children attend school there.  It could not be more natural for parents <Col N="973" /> who are working in the city to meet their children at lunch time and break times and perhaps dine together.  The choice of schools and options in Galway city is far greater and there is a wide range of subjects.</P>
    <P>The matter, which has been ongoing for 15 years, came to a head this year when 37 students did not get bus tickets. As a result of efforts by the authorities and after various representations, 17 of those students eventually received tickets, but 20 children were left without them.  This situation arises every year and half the year is gone for the children without tickets before the matter is resolved.  A situation can develop where some members of a family have tickets and others do not.  It becomes most complicated and frustrating for parents and children.</P>
    <P>We are asking for freedom of choice. This is all that is required by a large suburb of Galway city which does not have a second level school of its own.  It is now incumbent on the Minister for Education to agree to this motion to give the parish of Moycullen common school transport catchment area status.  It would be much appreciated by the parents and children.</P>

      <P>Senator, I cannot say what the reply will be, but you can definitely tell the people of Moycullen that you got preferential treatment from the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I reply on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward.  The Moycullen area is at present located in the Spiddal-Aille Thiar post primary centre for school transport purposes.  As an area lying within the Gaeltacht, it was decided that it was appropriate to assign it to a Gaeltacht post-primary centre when the school transport scheme was started in the late 1960s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two post-primary schools in the Spiddal-Aille Thiar catchment area, a Mercy secondary school in Spiddal, <Col N="974" /> Colaiste Chroí Mhuire, and a vocational school in Aille Thiar, Gairmscoil Cholmcille.  In the parish of Moycullen there are four national schools, those of Moycullen, Tooreeny, Tullokyne and Newtown.  It appears that the majority of children coming from these schools travel to schools in Galway city for post-primary education.  At present Moycullen children are eligible for full school transport entitlement to Spiddal or Aille Thiar.  For travelling to Galway city they are entitled to the catchment boundary concession only, which is that they can, for a fee, avail of spare places on buses operating within the Galway catchment area if these are available.</P>
    <P>The demand for such spare places now outstrips their availability.  Arising from this situation the Department has received a proposal from the Moycullen district bus users group, representing parents in the area, to the effect that the four national schools in Moycullen parish be shared between Spiddal, Aille Thiar and Galway city catchment areas.  All children attending those primary schools would then become eligible for full transport entitlement to either post-primary centre.  The normal practice where such requests are received is that the managements of the post-primary schools likely to be affected are informed of the proposal and asked for their views.  In this case, the views of management of the post-primary schools in Spiddal and Aille Thiar were sought and these have now been conveyed to the Department.</P>
    <P>In many such cases the Department has the difficult responsibility of having to weigh up on the one hand the wishes of a large body of parents in an area as against, on the other hand, the fears of school managements that pupil numbers may decline and as a consequence that teaching posts may be lost if changes are made in the area of school transport entitlement.  I assure the Senator that the Department of Education has given full consideration to all aspects of this case. It is hoped to communicate a decision on the matter to the parties concerned within a matter of days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me permission to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  I was alerted and somewhat concerned by a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Monday which stated that there was a danger to the customs pre-clearance, naturalisation and immigration facility at Shannon.  It was stated that this threat arose due to an application by the Government to the United States authorities to extend the customs pre-clearance facility to Dublin Airport.  It went on to say that rather than welcoming the proposal of the Irish Government, the US authorities were considering the whole issue of maintaining pre-clearance in Shannon and in Ireland and that there was a cost factor involved which may prompt them to make a negative decision.</P>
      <P>I was concerned to read this report and many people in the area contacted me regarding the veracity or otherwise of it. The Minister will agree that the customs pre-clearance at Shannon has worked successfully for almost a decade.  Indeed, the then Minister for Transport, Deputy J. Mitchell, the Department of Transport officials and the Aer Rianta management at Shannon had the foresight and the savvy to recognise that if this facility were introduced to Ireland it could be used to Ireland's advantage.</P>
      <P>The facility was successfully located at Shannon and the figures that have operated to date have justified that service. In this respect there have been various discussions over the past one or two years to the effect that any diminution in the facility would not justify maintaining it. I am apprehensive that if the facility were to be divided, following its proposed introduction to Dublin, neither airport would benefit in the long run in so far as the US authorities might decide that the figures would not justify having the facility in both airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great concern in Shannon. The region has been threatened and has suffered sufficiently already, having its sole transatlantic status removed from it. <Col N="976" /> To minimise the status of Shannon any further would be a serious course of action.  This service should and could be used to far greater advantage in Shannon. For example, it should be used to operate Shannon as a hub for other airlines from different parts of Europe and should be promoted as part of the attractions of having Shannon as a hub airport.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position to assure this House this evening and the people of County Clare and Shannon that this service is not under threat, that the pre-immigration, naturalisation and pre-clearance facility in Shannon will be maintained, not only in the short term but also in the long term.  It was an excellent facility, implemented by people of foresight almost a decade ago.  To hinder or minimise it would be a serious development.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, I will not have to condemn in this House at any future date a situation which might develop because of the action the Government has taken. In this instance the action has emanated from the Government requesting the US Government to extend the facility to Dublin.  In taking this course of action the Government is minimising and reducing the status of Shannon, because it is taking from Shannon Airport something that was unique to the airport, to Ireland and the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give a firm assurance to the House this evening that what we have in Shannon will be maintained and that nothing will be done to further threaten, minimise or undermine this. Shannon is based in the west of Ireland and is the focus of regional development in the surrounding area.  We have put up with sufficient threats and nonsense from the Government regarding Shannon Airport. Any further action which threatens Shannon would be unacceptable.  I ask the Minister to give an assurance to this House that this will not happen and that, whatever else, the pre-clearance facility in Shannon will be guaranteed and that priority will be given to maintaining it at Shannon, whatever about extending it elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The pre-inspection facility operated at Shannon Airport by the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service is governed by the terms of an agreement concluded in 1986 between the Governments of Ireland and of the USA.  This agreement provides that it will continue in force indefinitely unless it is terminated by either Government on giving 12 months' notice to the other.  The agreement also provides that either Government may at any time request consultations concerning the interpretation, application or amendment of the agreement, and also that pre-inspection may be conducted at additional locations in Ireland with the agreement of both Governments.</P>
      <P>The Government regards the pre-inspection facility at Shannon as of great importance.  There has been positive reaction to the facility since it was set up in June 1988 and market research has shown that it is highly valued by passengers.</P>
      <P>Before renegotiation of the Ireland/US air traffic rights agreement last year, I asked my Assistant Secretary to arrange discussions with the Immigration and Naturalisation Service staff and inform them that it is Government policy that the pre-inspection service should continue to be based in Shannon and service Dublin Airport as required.  At these discussions the INS staff were supportive of the retention of the service in Shannon and its extension to Dublin.  The Government's decision on the new transatlantic traffic arrangements was influenced by these favourable signals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to this a joint report by the Offices of the Inspectors General, Audit Division, US Department of Justice and the Office of Audits of the Department of State recommended closure of all US pre-inspection stations abroad.  This joint audit report found that although passenger facilitation is the main objective of pre-inspection, individual passengers arriving at US airports gained only a maximum of six minutes as a result of pre-inspection.  The report concluded that with advances in technology, less <Col N="978" /> labour intensive alternatives should be considered to facilitate the movement of passengers through US entry airports.  In summary, the joint audit report's finding was that the present pre-inspection arrangements did not provide value for money for the US Government.</P>
    <P>Immediately on becoming aware of this report I arranged for strong high level representations to be made to secure retention of the pre-inspection facility at Shannon and its extension to Dublin.  Ireland's Ambassador in Washington has made approaches in a number of quarters, stressing the benefits of pre-inspection for passengers and airlines and expressing the Government's deep concern about the possible ending of pre-inspection at Shannon and its non-extension to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government is firmly committed to maintenance of the Shannon facility and its extension to Dublin and is doing everything in its power to bring this about.  I am hopeful that the high level approaches to the US authorities in which our Ambassador in Washington is engaged will have a positive outcome and that we will be able to commence formal consultations shortly with the US, as provided for in the 1986 agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister why he considered it wise to proceed with a request for an extension to Dublin in view of the fact that he was aware of the negative suggestion contained in the joint audit report?  Would the Minister not agree that at that stage it would have been more appropriate for him to make a firm, constructive bid regarding the retention of the facility in Shannon and to fight to ensure that it would be maintained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's question is based on a false premise.  There was no question of closing any of the pre-inspection facilities when application was made for the extension to Dublin.  The fact that an application has been made for an extension to Dublin is irrelevant to the US position as outlined in the joint audit <Col N="979" /> report.  The formal proposal by the joint audit report of the US Department of Justice and the US Department of State at that stage, subsequent to the new transatlantic arrangements being put in place, was that all pre-inspection facilities should close.  This proposal was made because of advances in technology and the undertaking of a cost review of the pre-inspection facilities, among other facilities that are held overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government became aware of this, which was subsequent to any application made for an extension to Dublin, it has proceeded on the basis outlined in my reply to the Senator and I am hopeful of a positive outcome.  The application for an extension to Dublin has no relevance to the independent conclusion arrived at by the joint report which was carried out independently of applications for extension to Dublin or any other airport where pre-inspection facilities apply for US entry airports at present.  It is a different issue.  It is wrong to suggest the application for an extension has brought about this situation.  It is a decision which has been made by the US and it is a policy and a cost review <Col N="980" /> matter.  We value the pre-inspection facilities in Shannon, we are working for their retention and we hope there will be a positive outcome as a result of the excellent work done by the ambassador in Washington, who has proved to be influential in these matters.  There is a requirement under the 1986 agreement that consultations must take place before any change in status.  We are satisfied those consultation will now begin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

The US is aware of the importance we attach to this issue and I expect negotiations will take place in a matter of days or weeks.  Given the goodwill engendered by representations made by the ambassador, I hope there will be a positive outcome.</P>
