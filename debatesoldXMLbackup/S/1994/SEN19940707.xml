      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline his attitude to Aeroflot's application for pick up rights at Shannon to New York and Boston.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to amend the terms of the local government officers widows and orphans contributory pension scheme, 1984, as extended to female local authority and health board officers, to take account of circumstances involving separation of spouses arising subsequent to them joining the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to support Resolution 47/19 of the United Nations General Assembly, entitled necessity of ending economic, commercial and financial <Col N="2254" /> embargoes imposed by the United States of America against Cuba.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to take note of the difficulties facing both the settled population and itinerant families because of the very poor conditions at the halting site outside Castleblayney, County Monaghan, and the danger of a complete breakdown of inter-community relationships.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to outline if the Government intends ratifying the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, of 10 December 1984.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Taylor-Quinn's and Senator McGennis's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Neville, Cotter and Henry may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Items 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Items 1 and 2, by agreement, will be taken without debate.  With regard to Item 1, the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, this unanimous report has been circulated to all Senators and deals with amendments to Standing Orders.  It simply puts in a Senator to chair the sitting when the Cathaoirleach is being elected.  The present system where the Clerk chairs the meeting with no powers to confine the debate was found to be unsatisfactory.  A further amendment removes the restriction of the sitting at 2.30 p.m. after the Seanad adjourns <i>sine die.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2255" /> With regard to Item 3, Statements on Northern Ireland, it is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that those who have already contributed may make a further contribution. I suggest ten minutes per spokesperson and seven minutes thereafter. Item 4, the Heritage Council Bill, Second Stage, will start at 1 p.m.  I suggest 20 minutes per spokesperson and 15 minutes thereafter.</P>
    <P>As today is the last sitting day for this session, in deference to the Tánaiste &mdash; the Kerry beaches are calling &mdash; I thank the staff, the press, my colleagues in this House and you, a Chathaoirligh, for making this sitting such an effective and satisfactory one.  I wish everybody a happy summer holiday.</P>

      <P>Maybe this House is better than no House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Members' decision to make provision for an exchange of views in Seanad Éireann on the situation in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, I am grateful the House has given me this opportunity so that, on behalf of the Government, I can share with Members some reflections on the present position on Northern Ireland and our hopes as regards future developments.</P>
      <P>Indeed, there have been many days of horror and grief since the outbreak of violence 25 years ago.  However, the recent killings in Louginisland touched a particular and deep chord among the Irish people.  The victims were ordinary people from a quiet rural community watching Ireland's opening match in the World Cup.  Their killers did not even have the courage to face them directly. They shot six innocent people in the back, one of them 87 years of age, for no reason any of us can understand, except perhaps simple malevolence and evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every political leader on this island, North and South, knows of the deep yearning of our people for peace and for <Col N="2257" /> an end to the sickening cycle of carnage and death.  All of us know, because we hear it every day, the demand of our people that those of us in positions of leadership meet the challenge of achieving peace in Ireland and so end the corrosive and poisonous violence that has brought so much suffering.</P>
    <P>Escaping from the shackles of the past is not easy, but that is essentially what will be required if we are to achieve a measure of consensus, however limited, acceptable to both traditions in Ireland. Such a consensus cannot be sought on expectations of sudden conversion of unionists to nationalists, or <i>vice versa.</i> The different perspectives on core constitutional and political issues are very deep.  We must instead take our diversity as a reality and a potential enrichment and seek to devise a framework that, for the first time, adequately manages the absence of constitutional consensus through new and imaginative political structures.  Such structures, if they are to succeed, must ultimately win the acceptance of both communities in Northern Ireland and both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>The task of creating a new beginning for relationships is no easy one.  The perceptions and aspirations dividing the two communities in Northern Ireland are, after all, of the most fundamental kind. As Richard Rose wrote at the start of the troubles:</P>
    <P>...for almost a century, a choice between alternative constitutions and national loyalties has been the central choice facing the voters of Northern Ireland...elections have been concerned not so much with which party should govern but rather with what country Northern Ireland belongs to...</P>
    <P>It is well to face these issues clearly for it is this stark and emotion laden disagreement from history which we must confront and try to resolve if we are to devise new arrangements that one or other side will not reject as unworkable or unacceptable or both.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration agreed between the British and Irish Governments last December confronted this reality directly <Col N="2258" /> and clearly.  The Declaration sought to take the language of potential victor or vanquished out of the vocabulary of Irish politics by defining a clear and unambiguous set of principles that safeguard the fundamental rights and aspirations of both traditions.  It recognises that the future of Ireland is for the Irish people to decide without external impediment, but it also recognises that this right of self-determination must be exercised with and subject to the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is because extremes of constitutional doctrine bequeathed by history to both sides continue to be dangerously at play on our island that paramilitaries in Northern Ireland claim the right to kill and destroy.  The principles in the Declaration were designed to transcend and supersede rigidities of traditional doctrine and dogma on either side.  For that reason they will retain their lasting validity, regardless of whether the paramilitaries accept them.</P>
    <P>The Government has, nonetheless, felt it right to do all in its power to answer any genuine points of misunderstanding or confusion concerning the Declaration held by either republican or loyalist movements.  The choice is now theirs as to whether to put away their weapons of death or to continue poisoning and infecting this island with a culture of violence generating a destructive and uncontrollable dynamic of its own.</P>
    <P>We are promised that the Sinn Féin Party will soon make a decision on the Declaration.  There is not a great deal more I can usefully say at this stage to the republican movement, other than to again ask that they ponder well and deeply the choice before them.  The president of Sinn Féin has said on several occasions in the past that he accepts that the unionist community cannot be coerced into a united Ireland.  It would be a black irony if nationalism, which suffered so much from coercion in the past, were now to become advocates of it against another Irish tradition.  Even if such were to come about, it would never get beyond the stage of being an <Col N="2259" /> unworthy doctrine.  To speak of achieving a united Ireland by coercion is a contradiction in terms.</P>
    <P>If that is so, does the republican movement now truly accept that the consent of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland will be required and must be freely given before there can be a change in the present status of Northern Ireland? Above all, what possible alternative can there be to a free partnership between both traditions in Ireland on terms which are honourable to both and do not violate the basic principles of either?  It is on that fundamental question that the republican movement must make a decision.</P>
    <P>If the answer accepts the need for consent, then the use of violence for political ends becomes utterly without purpose or meaning.  If the answer is no, then the republican movement will doom itself to even further isolation and continuing rejection by their fellow Irish men and women who in their overwhelming majority wish to enhance, and in no way diminish, the role of consent in our relationships.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland problem is rooted in the fundamental reality that the strict adherence to past constitutional doctrines on either side allowed each community the opportunity, and in many ways the incentive, to ignore the reality of the other.  Each built walls and barricades of strongly held but, in the end, deadly certainties revolving essentially around the supreme but ultimately simplistic issue of whether the Border should remain or go.  Each tradition in Ireland too often saw the other only in ways compatible and convenient to its own myths.  From this failure of the unionists and nationalists to address fully and realistically their relationships with each other sprang the nightmare of the past quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>In the Joint Declaration the Government agreed that it would, as part of a balanced constitutional accommodation, put forward and support proposals for change in the Constitution which would fully reflect the principle of consent in Northern Ireland.  Constitutional principles <Col N="2260" /> are not abstract or general statements existing in detached isolation from the lives of those to whom they are applied.  They uniquely embody beliefs and hopes and, as in Northern Ireland, can become symbols and codes for aspirations and convictions, either strongly cherished or deeply rejected.</P>
    <P>The challenge and the hard task facing us in both parts of Ireland remains how to accommodate the constitutional viewpoints and political aspirations of two differing sets of identities and to do so in a way that is acceptable to all.  We must transcend the false notion that one tradition can have the substance of its aspirations endorsed while the other should remain content with only an abstract or theoretical acknowledgement of its legitimacy. To seek to build a new way forward on such foundations would be a profound self-deception on all our parts and would be foredoomed to failure.</P>
    <P>Both Governments are at present making every endeavour to agree a framework of possible new arrangements which we hope might be acceptable to all sides as an honourable and fair accommodation. The role of the two Governments is central to this task of charting a new path for change for, as I have recently stressed, anything that is unacceptable to either Government is, by definition, unlikely to command support across both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, ultimately be up to the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland as to whether agreement on new structures can be completed and successfully implemented.  I hope and believe that we can succeed in taking advantage of our common, overriding interest in peace by making common cause to reach an honourable accommodation that advances the welfare and prosperity of all the people of Ireland, and, above all, that enables the two traditions that share this island to live in harmony.</P>
    <P>The two Governments cannot force or coerce the parties to agree a new set of arrangements and, in the end, it will be their decision as to whether we in Ireland <Col N="2261" /> can succeed in transcending past fears and uncertainties.  What the two Governments can and must do, however, is to use all the resources at their disposal to seek early agreement on a new set of arrangements that place neither community in a position of privilege or special status against the other.  In a telling phrase, the historian ATQ Stewart said that the essence of the Northern Ireland question is that &ldquo;two diametrically opposed political wills must coexist on the same narrow ground&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In such a psychological climate of confrontation it is all too easy for any change in the political landscape, however limited, to be interpreted by one or other side as anathema or a betrayal.  Given this reality, the choice effectively becomes either resignation to a limbo of sullen and permanent antagonism or the imaginative use of statesmanship to offer an honourable way out.</P>
    <P>Many in the political leadership of the unionist community understand, even if they do not often articulate, this reality. The measured and judicious response of Mr. Molyneaux and others to the Joint Declaration offers ground for hope regarding the outcome of future dialogue. The construction of a political framework which both sides can accept as legitimate and fair would be made substantially easier if there is a willingness to accept and state openly that the cement of a new order has to be consent, partnership and a sense of common ownership regarding any new institutions.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal on which both traditions in Ireland can build and much on which we already agree.  We agree on the fundamental position that a change in the status of Northern Ireland can only take place with the consent of a majority of its people.  We agree that differences between the two traditions can only be accommodated by mutual agreement and accommodation and that any new institutions must, as a fundamental component, reflect this.</P>
    <P>It must now surely be as clear as day to all sides that any new arrangements can only be based on the fundamental <Col N="2262" /> and core reality that the two communities must live together on a basis of equality and mutual respect.  It is equally obvious that such an outcome cannot be achieved if constitutional or institutional change is perceived by either community as vindicating or assuring its position at the expense of the other.  The absence of consensus in Northern Ireland, by definition, requires a framework that takes account of this, and that provides respect for the ethos, aspirations and rights of each tradition.</P>
    <P>Communities, like individuals, have a continuity of self-definition embracing past experiences, present perceptions and expectations as well as future hopes and fears.  It is neither possible nor practical to ask either community in Northern Ireland to wipe the slate clean and pretend that past hurts or wounds did not happen, or to expect that historical fears or antagonisms can be simply put to one side.  I profoundly believe, however, that if we approach our task with wisdom and humility we can together and with imagination reach agreement on new arrangements and structures based on respect for the integrity and self-worth of each community.</P>
    <P>In 1933, at a time of deep doubt and despair, Franklin Roosevelt said that the only thing Americans had to fear was fear itself, the fear &ldquo;which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance&rdquo;. A generation drew inspiration and encouragement from these words.</P>
    <P>Liberation from deep fears and insecurity is the binding prerequisite for any true healing.  It is that search for liberation from fear on our own island that is embodied at the core of all the principles outlined in the Declaration and which must now, carefully and with balance, guide the construction of new constitutional and institutional arrangements.</P>
    <P>Unionists and nationalists have, after all, to share this island.  We have no realistic choice but to seek to respect the other's position and to appreciate as worthwhile and valid the aspirations of the other.  We have to learn to accept that although we will not agree on some <Col N="2263" /> things, the views of each tradition are fully legitimate and must, therefore, be fully acknowledged.  We have, however difficult this may be, no realistic choice but to seek to live in partnership and equality and, in doing so, to understand that diversity can be enriching rather than threatening.  I believe that, whatever the difficulties and challenges yet to be faced, we can succeed in this task.</P>
    <P>There are deeper links and bonds than we sometimes think between both parts of Ireland.  It is in all our interests that any new structures must not only incorporate equality of expression and treatment between both traditions in Northern Ireland but also, as a necessary and central dimension, provide a framework for the overcoming of divisions and the promotion of harmonious relationships on the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>There are economic imperatives affecting both parts of Ireland and harmonious co-operation and partnership, especially in the context of the Single European Market, can only be to the benefit of all the people of the island.  The development of co-ordinated policies and practices can be developed to maximise limited resources and to utilise the shared features of the two economies.  The full benefits of co-operation will yield enormous assets if we have the courage to act imaginatively and work together.</P>
    <P>We live on an island of relatively limited economic resources and are faced with a range of opportunities and challenges which we can address much more effectively acting together in partnership and co-operation.  There is, for example, considerable potential for tackling unemployment in both parts of the island by enhanced cross-Border co-operation. The expansion of trade and economic co-operation would clearly do much to develop the untapped potential in both economies.</P>
    <P>Co-operation in the different economic areas at home and abroad can harness all the energies and resources of this island for the common good.  Working together, we can help generate significant new employment and business opportunities <Col N="2264" /> that will help improve the material welfare of everyone, North and South.  Our starting point has to be that the welfare of one part of the island is ultimately indivisible from that of the other.</P>
    <P>Our shared challenge, North and South, remains how to free each other from the mistakes of the past.  We have no choice but to meet this challenge.  That reality alone may offer the greatest hope for our success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for arranging this debate.  In welcoming the Tánaiste to the House, I compliment him on what was an eloquent address.  Last December we had great hopes and expectations after the signing of the Downing Street Declaration.  Sadly, in the period since then very little of a positive nature has occurred or, if it did, it was not apparent to those watching Northern Ireland and those living there.  On the surface, things seems to be worse now than they were last December.  We are still awaiting a response from the IRA and Sinn Féin to the Downing Street Declaration.  Even yesterday's statement by Mr. Adams gave little hope for believing that we could expect a response soon or that it would be particularly positive.  As the Tánaiste said, we have seen an increase in atrocities, including the appalling sectarian slaying in Loughinisland during the World Cup.  We have had tit-for-tat killing on an appalling scale.  We have had the Dublin murder and the threat of further bombings and shootings in this part of the country.  Unfortunately, both Governments have been distracted by their own internal problems and, to a great extent, have not given Northern Ireland the priority it deserves.  We have seen an almost total stalemate in relationships between the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  So, it is very difficult to perceive any of these factors as constituting progress since the signing of the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of both Governments and political parties, there can be no further excuses for inaction.  The European elections are over and no new elections are likely for the next two years. <Col N="2265" /> So, if there is to be political progress, uninterrupted by electoral considerations on either island, the time is now clear for talks and actions to take place.  Governments and parties rarely have such a clear avenue open to them in terms of an absence of electoral considerations as both Governments now appear to have. Of course, strange things can happen but both Governments now appear to have a time frame which is clear of impending elections.</P>
    <P>Likewise, Sinn Féin and the IRA have had more than enough time to give a definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration.  In addition, they have had some significant sweeteners, including the ending of section 31, the US visa for Mr. Adams, extensive behind-the-scenes consultations, clarification and an enormous amount of encouragement from all sections of the population.  There really is no excuse for them not to give a definitive response one way or the other.  Personally, I am not very hopeful about the nature of that response but I hope I am wrong.</P>
    <P>Friends of mine in Northern Ireland tell me that there is a genuine desire for peace among significant sections of the IRA and Sinn Féin community, but so far, sadly, we have not seen this desire manifest itself in any concrete form.  The IRA has continued its campaign of murder and bombing with little let up thus giving, in a sense, its own response to the earlier efforts of the president of Sinn Féin.  For those reasons I believe that the response of the IRA will not be positive.  If it is not, we cannot allow ourselves to be played along like gullible trout while the IRA follows its own perverse agenda and blocks progress among other groups towards some sort of settlement.</P>
    <P>When we met here after the Downing Street Declaration on 22 December 1993, I supported the Taoiseach, as did everyone in this House, and applauded him on what he had done.  We believed that the Government had made a very courageous breakthrough.  More than that, the Downing Street Declaration seemed to give Sinn Féin a way off the hook and <Col N="2266" /> into the political process.  But while so many on the Government side then saw the Declaration as the end of the problem, I did not.  I said that the euphoria of that moment should not blind us to the fact that we were at a beginning and no further.  Looking back now, eight months later, we are still only at the beginning in spite of all that has happened.  I said then also &mdash; and I am glad that the Tánaiste emphasised this in his speech today &mdash; that the one inescapable fact was that any lasting settlement must be underwritten and made effective by the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  That is why nothing we do should be allowed in any way to undermine the leaders of those parties.</P>
    <P>The process will stand or fall in Northern Ireland, not here and not in London. If it cannot work in Northern Ireland then it will not work.  If it is to work in Northern Ireland, the constitutional parties must be given every help and we must encourage them to resume their negotiations.  Unfortunately, and in spite of the Tánaiste's encouraging words today, we have gone back rather than forward since then.  There has never been so little talk between the parties or such little encouragement, until this morning at least, from the two Governments to get the parties back to the talks, which had made real progress before they broke down.  There seems to be a clear lack of urgency in the Government's current approach to the problem.  It gave priority to bringing the IRA into the negotiating process.  Having done that, it seems to have put other avenues of approach on the back burner and has allowed the refusal of the IRA to respond in a positive way to cloud it to other possibilities which might be pursued.  As a result, there is, I believe, a dangerous vacuum at the heart of the Government's Northern policy at present, which is not helped by the various domestic problems of both Governments. Because of this, they are allowing the situation to drift dangerously.</P>
    <P>The worst thing that can happen in the situation of drift is that the two Governments hang around waiting for something <Col N="2267" /> to happen, hoping that the IRA will eventually come on board.  Every day without a sense of Government urgency and without activity and new initiatives puts less pressure on the IRA and contributes to the growth of loyalist terrorism.</P>
    <P>The Government must reorder its priorities.  Of course it must continue to try to persuade the IRA, it must keep the lines open and try to exploit the strong desire for peace which we are told exists in the nationalist community but we must not allow this concern dominate the attempt to bring the IRA on board or distort Northern policy as it appears to be doing at present.  We should remember that all previous Governments of this State focused primarily on how to get the constitutional parties to agree on structures of government.  If that no longer appears to be a priority, it should become one again.</P>
    <P>A great deal of progress was made in the past, more than for which credit was ever given.  It was slow, unspectacular progress, the sort that is at the centre of consensus building but which does not result in dramatic, miraculous formulae or instant solutions.  Progress will only come from slow, detailed talks, concessions all round and a willingness to concede, not just on ultimate objectives but to the sincerity of the other side, and to concede that not all wisdom lies on our side and that we, as well as the unionists, carry our share of historical baggage.</P>
    <P>There is increasing evidence &mdash; the Tánaiste adverted to this &mdash; of a new openness on the part of the Official Unionist Party.  There is a sense that it realises that things can never be the same again and that it must accept a new order. There also appears to be a willingness on the part of significant sections of its leadership to look at new ways in which the political structure of Northern Ireland can be ordered in a manner which provides for fairness, the right of both communities to express their identities and harmonious relations between both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> It is possibly because unionist politicians usually appear to be negative and ungracious in the way they phrase much of what they say that the real sea change which I believe has occurred is often lost on many of us down here.  The Official Unionist Party knows that no British Government will tolerate a reversion to the old ways.  Enough people in that party know that if they want to be part of a modern Europe they must accept pluralism, tolerance, fair play and full civil rights for all.  They must accept that communal tensions can only be handled through tolerance and accommodation and not through the domination of one community by the other.  These principles are now widely accepted within that party.  Many of them could have been put into effect if the last set of talks had come to a conclusion.  One way or another, these principles are a good starting point and are endorsed by the leadership of the Official Unionist Party.</P>
    <P>The same cannot be said of Ian Paisley and the Democratic Unionist Party.  A very interesting book published this month by Professor Steve Bruce of the University of Aberdeen provides a detailed study of the development of Ian Paisley's party and the loyalist paramilitaries over the past 25 or 30 years.  It provides a frightening picture to all of us of the extent of their alienation and the way they see themselves as a community and a way of life under threat with no friends anywhere to whom they can turn. It is very easy for us to dismiss these fears and point to the years of domination during which they displayed no accommodation or understanding to their Catholic neighbours but we will not make progress until we get to the bottom of these fears, realise they are genuine and seek to see how we in this part of the country, as well as the nationalist community in Northern Ireland, can understand and, through understanding, seek to find some sort of accommodation.  Just as we strive to protect, enhance and give recognition to the Irishness of the nationalist community, we must also recognise the integrity of the Britishness of the loyalist community.  It sees itself as <Col N="2269" /> a beleaguered, isolated civilisation under threat.  Mr. John Hume and the SDLP have always accepted the right of the Protestant, unionist tradition to the fullest possible recognition.</P>
    <P>It is surprising, when one talks separately to John Hume and the unionist leaders, to see how little difference there is between them on most of the fundamental problems and the willingness of each side to accept at this point &mdash; this was not always the case &mdash; the aspirations of the other.  This is why any progress at present must have at its centre the bringing together again of the constitutional parties into meaningful and serious discussions.  If this happens I believe many of the present logjams can be broken.  The failure of the talks so far has given an enhanced status and centre stage position to the paramilitaries on both sides.  If the political process is seen to work and the constitutional politicians are seen to be listening, talking to and accommodating each other and making progress, pressure will come on the IRA and the other paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, when Mr. Gerry Adams outlined a list of grievances of the nationalist community in Northern Ireland, he said that the IRA campaign was not a central issue.  If he expects to make progress in righting these grievances, surely the place to air them and seek redress is within the political framework and process.  As long as the violence continues, the righting of these grievances will not be addressed as fully as it might.</P>
    <P>I say to the Government &mdash; I am glad the Tánaiste emphasised this &mdash; that every encouragement must be given to the constitutional parties.  Pressure must be put on them to give way where that will mean progress.  I am not saying the Government should have a single strand policy on Northern Ireland but that the parties must be central to any policy.  The intergovernmental talks must continue and the work towards a framework must proceed and the sooner this is available for discussion the better.  Efforts must be made to win over the paramilitaries.  The alleviation of specific injustices must continue <Col N="2270" /> to be addressed, especially in cases where discrimination continues to exist. We must have greater cross-Border co-operation and more meetings between ourselves and our opposite numbers in Northern Ireland.  At the centre must be the attempt to get the constitutional parties talking to each other again.  I am glad the Tánaiste gave this priority and I hope this will be translated into effective action before long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that, at the end of this session, the role of the Seanad is to highlight the situation in Northern Ireland and on the island as a whole.  It is significant that the debate is taking place at a time when the world is becoming a very contradictory place. Nationalism, ethnic cleansing and religious domination are becoming the dominant features of life in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world. Dominance of one group by another is coming very much to the fore.  We in Ireland are trying to remove the dominance of one ethnic group and to bring a balance which will accommodate all sections of society in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>When we listen to the arguments, we realise that people can only make peace with their enemies; they cannot make peace with their friends.  We have to continue to talk to people who might have been perceived as our enemies in the past because it is only by talking to our enemies that we can make certain peace ensues.</P>
      <P>This year we have seen remarkable progress in South Africa in bringing together two seemingly intransigent peoples.  They have made unbelievable progress towards the beginning of a country in which all people can live in peace and harmony.  However, we see ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the rest of the former Yugoslavia and attempts are being made all over the former USSR to cleanse out those who are different from the dominant forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is people and not land who make countries.  It is people who count.  When we talk about the dominant forces in Ireland, we are talking about the people <Col N="2271" /> of Ireland and not the land of Ireland.  It is unfortunate that &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo;, &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; and &ldquo;dissenter&rdquo; are the three dominant words used.  There are people other than Protestants, Catholics and dissenters on this island and they too have to be brought into the equation if we are to forget past atrocities or prevent future atrocities.</P>
    <P>Relationships must be built up slowly. There are no instant solutions; there is no instant solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.  The Irish or British Governments or the political forces in the North of Ireland should not go screaming to the media every day that progress has been made today which will lead to a better future.  It is only by discussing the matters fully, in private in the main, that progress can be made.  Too often there have been leaks to the media which inhibited progress.  It is not right for the people who are discussing the situation to run to the press on every occasion.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Middle East would not have been resolved were it not for the fact that all the discussions took place in a quiet atmosphere away from conflict and media attention.  The ring of steel which the Israelis put around themselves to keep out their neighbours, the Palestinians, has now been breached but would not have been breached if there had been public statements every time a little progress had been made.</P>
    <P>Those who say that the Irish Government is not making enough progress at present do not seem to realise that day to day contact is being made with the people who are involved in this conflict. That day to day, painstaking contact is necessary.  It is not the banner headline which brings peace but the 12 and 15 hour discussions between officials, Ministers and the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, Britain and here.</P>
    <P>We must give our full support to the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  There should be no prevarication about this.  Nationalist and unionist politicians should be given every <Col N="2272" /> support so that they can make progress for their own people in the North.  If we do not go along with the constitutional politicians in the North, we might as well forget our own constitutional situation and allow the non-constitutional elements down here to take over.</P>
    <P>Paramilitaries in the North do not play a part in the resolution of the problem but rather exacerbate it.  Instances such as Loughinisland have done nothing to further the loyalist cause but have sickened the good, decent people of Northern Ireland on all sides.  Equally, when the IRA commits acts of violence it does not progress the cause of nationalism but exacerbates the situation.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin is a constitutional party and we must admit that it represents a large proportion of the people of Northern Ireland.  I believe they are honest in their attempts to bring the IRA into a situation where there could be a ceasefire.  There should not be any conditions attached to a ceasefire.  A ceasefire means giving up the armed struggle &mdash; if it could be called that.  In 90 per cent of cases, it is not an armed struggle because if it was there would have to be two sides.  If one group goes in with guns and shoots the people in a public house, bar, hotel or any public place, it is not an armed struggle but an atrocious act of cowardice.</P>
    <P>We must commit ourselves to following the line the Government has taken.  I ask the Opposition not be so carping in suggesting that this Government is not doing enough or is not open enough in its attempts to resolve the problems.  I do not think any Government since the State was founded has done so much to resolve the differences which exist between the various strands of opinion on this island or to bring together these varying strands.  The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach have done more than any other leaders in this country to attempt a resolution of the situation in the North.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of human beings against human beings and not domination of land or the South over the North.  We are talking about the resolution of human problems in the North <Col N="2273" /> of Ireland.  We can only pray that the violent people in the North will realise that each time they fire a bullet it causes ripples which spread and which make it harder to achieve a place of peace in the North.</P>
    <P>The economy of this country is important, but it is not as important as bringing together people from all sides of the political divide, North and South.  I am glad we are able to have this debate this morning because, at the end of the session, it is just and right that we bring the situation in Northern Ireland to the fore.  If we find a resolution to the problems in Northern Ireland, we can achieve everything we want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak today.  I wish the Cathaoirleach well this summer and I thank him for his assistance during the year.</P>
      <P>The Irish soccer team returns from the US this morning and I take this opportunity to wish them well.  I would also like to say how proud most people on this island are of their efforts in the World Cup.  It was emphasised in the past few weeks that the Irish team, while not representing the whole island, comes from a small population base.  In that context, it is difficult for people to understand why on such a small island, violence, hatred, carnage, murder and destruction continue. When foreigners visit Ireland they see the beauty and potential of the island and experience the friendliness of the people, yet they find it difficult to understand why this destruction continues.</P>
      <P>The people, the structures and the political beliefs which have been dominant, have not united the people or increased and encouraged understanding.  Many political beliefs, the fears therein and the fears they generate have added to the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and time again this morning Senators and the Tánaiste spoke about the two communities on this island. There is a third community and it annoys me when people refer to nationalists and unionists.  Many people on this island are in the middle and do not want to be referred to as either.  It is that community <Col N="2274" /> who will bring peace and understanding to this island.  As long as we continue to refer to two communities, progress will stagnate and we will not achieve peace.</P>
    <P>There is co-operation between the police forces, North and South, which proves that co-operation and understanding can exist.  As regards sport, someone from the North was appointed to the board of the new Horse Racing Authority last week.  There is also co-operation between North and South in relation to rugby and the GAA.  People with a particular interest come together to further that interest, be it sport or otherwise.  There is also a cultural and a historic connection between North and South.  I plead with politicians to be extremely careful when speaking about the two communities because, as I said, there is a third community.</P>
    <P>The tragedy in Loughinisland, County Down, proved beyond all doubt that people in a small community can be united and have things in common. Loughinisland is a small village in a farming community where people worked together to help one another.  That was emphasised time and time again.  The people of Loughinisland never believed such a tragedy would occur in their small community where everybody got on well with their neighbours.  Yet this atrocity was committed in a village where people lived in harmony to cause hatred, fear and mistrust.  The biggest danger to terrorists is co-operation, understanding and a lack of fear between people.  That is the path to progress in the North and on this island.  It emphasises the need for leaders from all political parties in the South, the North and in Britain, to be extremely careful.</P>
    <P>There is always an opportunity to hype up a situation and to say we have done something historic or that we are the first to do something.  That is not the approach to adopt.  People must be cautious and careful and they must understand that there is deep rooted fear on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and I thank the Tánaiste for arranging to be in the House to lead it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2275" /> In a situation like this one of the first questions we ask ourselves is, what is the point of talking?  What advances can be made by talking about Northern Ireland, using the English language, each in our own different way, to edge forward to an inclusive and peaceful solution to the conflict?  We wonder why we talk, what good are words and what can they do to influence the perpetrators of acts of violence which occur in Northern Ireland which are totally separate from the normal life of the people.  However, words are important in the context of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The subtleties of language can make all the difference; words can be used to make different myths out of the same history.  Different communities view the same historic past, but see different things.  This is reinforced by the separate life experiences of these communities. The Tánaiste put it well this morning when he said, &ldquo;They can ignore the reality of the other.&rdquo;  This was also expressed well by Senator Manning when he spoke about the fears of supporters of people like the Reverend Ian Paisley and the DUP.  Those fears are based in the fact that they see history in a different way.  Their reality is different to that of the other community because of the way they interpret history.  It is essential that we have dialogue if we are to make progress.</P>
    <P>In that regard, it is useful to look at the Opsahl report.  We had a debate on Northern Ireland this time last year following the report of the Opsahl Commission which reflected the views of people throughout Northern Ireland. There were 554 submissions to the commission which expressed a strong desire for dialogue and, in practically all the submissions, there was an overwhelming desire for peace.</P>
    <P>As long as people are locked into separate loyalties and see each other as the enemy, they find it difficult to condemn their own terrorists even when they do not support violence and have a strong desire of peace.  They are worried about betraying their own side.  Fortunately, <Col N="2276" /> as other speakers have said, there is a growing number of people on both sides of the community divide who have the courage to go beyond that and put their shared humanity above everything else.</P>
    <P>Our humanity must be placed above our loyalties.  We must be unequivocal in asserting that the taking of a fellow human being's life is always a betrayal of our own humanity.  As other speakers have said, the appalling betrayal of humanity in Loughinisland has brought that home to us again.  Senator Belton described very well how that peaceful community was absolutely shattered by the calculated act of going into that pub and shooting people who had their backs to the guns.</P>
    <P>People in Sinn Féin and loyalist paramilitary supporters who believe violence should end must have the courage to act and get out of the straitjacket.  I support what Senator Lanigan said about the ultimate responsibility of people in Sinn Féin and on the other side who believe that violence must and should end.  I hope they will have the courage to act on it.</P>
    <P>The Opsahl report pointed out that Northern Ireland has for a long time lacked a framework to support constructive dialogue and political progress. This framework has been made possible through the Joint Declaration of the British and Irish Governments last winter within which words can become the vehicle for progress rather than the reinforcement of prejudice.  It is an opportunity which has to be grasped even if the extremists on both sides cannot or will not grasp it.</P>
    <P>The framework provides space for the two communities to move closer and listen to each other.  It provides the opportunity for respect for the diversity of differing traditions.  It is only right that the British and Irish Governments have come together and assumed responsibility for finding a solution, because the problem is rooted in the historical relationships between Britain and Ireland and the ineffectiveness of past attempts to give the people in Northern Ireland the right to express their identities in a positive way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2277" /> This framework has to be based on consent and this point has been made over and over again during the last six months.  It must be based on what has been described as parity of esteem which means that each tradition has equal esteem and equal rights.  The Tánaiste in addressing the Fordham University Law School on 27 June stated:</P>
    <P>The idea that one tradition can have things its own way leaving the other side to like it or lump it is effectively dead.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>In the interests of a better future for all, both Governments are seeking ways to strike out boldly for a new arrangement in which both traditions can rediscover themselves and each other.</P>
    <P>The use of language is such an important factor in the hope for peace, it is absolutely essential that both Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution and the Government of Ireland Act in British law are scrutinised and open to change.  If words are used to strengthen the myths which separate the communities in Northern Ireland, they can only be destructive.</P>
    <P>Both Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution and the Government of Ireland Act fail to reflect the aspirations of the two communities.  Neither of these legal frameworks embrace the rights and identities of both communities.  If we are to move closer to a solution, we must have a non-threatening framework which allows movement without the fear of losing all.  Other speakers today have expressed that very well.</P>
    <P>People want a wider sense of identity. Senator Belton put that very well when he spoke about people who have a sense of identity other than the straitjacket of one community or the other.  Human beings are complex and cannot be simply defined within a narrow description. Unfortunately in the past, many people in Northern Ireland have been pushed into these two fairly simplistic identities which do not embrace the complexities of our humanity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2278" /> The Government must progress the agenda while leaving the door open to people who still follow the anti-democratic agenda of violence and coercion.  I support what Senator Manning said about the position of the SDLP and the Official Unionist Party.  Both have been very positive and we have to build on that positive attitude.  Even if the extremists on both sides are not ready to participate, we have to make progress and we should not wait.</P>
    <P>More and more people are convinced that this is the only way the politics of fear can be lifted.  This is only a beginning and it will take time for communities to learn to trust each other but this is the only way forward and the only hope. Senator Gordon Wilson expressed this view a few weeks ago on the Order of Business when he said that we are at a turning point and that we must turn in the right direction.  If we do that, the potential which the Tánaiste outlined at the end of his speech in economic development as well as social cohesion will be realised.</P>
    <P>Dialogue within an inclusive framework can be positive rather than negative. It will focus on progress rather than on looking back.  That is the real hope for political progress in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the Tánaiste's statement on this important day.  We were talking last night about the proliferation of arms. It is terrible that most conflicts in the world are inter racial, inter-tribal or inter religious.  It is particularly sad that on this small island we should have a sectarian conflict.</P>
      <P>There is an important lesson for us when we look at Northern Ireland.  When we ask people in Northern Ireland to be tolerant of each other, we too must be careful about being tolerant.  Tolerance is a two way process and it is important that those who ask for tolerance for minorities are tolerant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some religions, including some denominations of the Christian religion, which are more authoritarian than I would like.  However, it is <Col N="2279" /> extremely important to remember that these denominations have deeply committed followers and we should express our tolerance for them.  We are entitled to object if we believe they are impinging on us but we are not entitled to deride their convictions.  When we speak we should be careful to show tolerance in all directions.</P>
    <P>Our historical divisions and the problems in Northern Ireland are sadly still all too obvious.  Perhaps we should spend some of this summer trying to improve our relationship with various members of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  There are three months ahead of us.  There are lovely places in Fermanagh and great summer schools in Antrim.  We will all be welcome to go to Belfast to meet members of the constitutional parties there.  I suggest that all members of the Seanad should try to make at least one or two visits to Northern Ireland to show that we really are interested in them and that this is not just rhetoric.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the great hope we had at the end of last year for progress towards a non violent situation in the North has not been realised.  I gravely doubt if members of some of the political non-constitutional parties in Northern Ireland are capable of bringing those involved in violence with them.  There is a tremendous investment in violence in Northern Ireland and there is also tremendous status for those involved in it.  It will be extremely difficult for them to come back from the edge because they do not know how they will fare if they do.  They now have positions of power and of status and are capable of terrorising whole communities.  The lack of progress on that front should make us more determined to increase our efforts at making contact with the constitutional parties.  As we break for the summer I ask that we should give some of our time to making contact with those in political parties and non-political institutions in Northern Ireland.  The train fare to Belfast is money well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Until this morning I <Col N="2280" /> understood I would have ten minutes to speak but I now know that it is only seven and I shall have to speak quickly.  I wonder if I should bother because having listened with great interest to the Tánaiste one would think that he and I had colluded &mdash; I know what I want to say and much of it agrees with what he said.</P>
      <P>I speak as a Member of the Irish Parliament and as someone deeply wounded by the hatreds of Northern Ireland.  I am proud to be British and Irish.  I realise that to some of my colleagues in Oireachtas Éireann this dual identity is surprising or, even, incomprehensible.  I assure them that this dual identity is honestly held and honestly defended.  I say this as someone who loves Ireland and who knows the Republic almost as well as he knows the North and who loves both.</P>
      <P>I am Irish; I have been on both sides of the Irish fence &mdash; I was born in County Leitrim and I earned my living most of my adult life in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. I do not see these places as being foreign to each other.  I believe passionately that we are all the same people but we quarrel and we have quarrelled tragically.  I know; I lost a daughter.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there are two essential identities in Ireland and beyond that a strange and not quite yet born other identity.  In an odd way we are all Irish, although some of my northern countrymen deny Irishness.  I regret this denial but it is a fact of life.  In Dublin I have been reminded of a personal childhood awareness &mdash; an awareness to which I was not, as a youth in Dublin, fully sensitive &mdash; that there was a southern pride generally unselfconscious, innocent and, perhaps, unintentionally insensitive to northerners, orange or green.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent my formative years in the 1940s in the city of Dublin &mdash; a city I have always loved.  This biographical fact makes me strategically unusual much as the killing of my daughter Marie makes me an involuntary witness, among too many others, to the griefs of our island. Furthermore, I have spent my life earning <Col N="2281" /> what I hope was an honest living at the edge of the Union, among people who love that British Union deeply.  The people of Ireland must come to terms with the proposition that there are a million people on the island who honestly believe that the proposition to claim Britishness and Irishness at the same time is a contradiction in terms.</P>
    <P>Ulster Protestants commonly both love Ireland and are loyal to the Crown, and there are a million people in Northern Ireland who do not want constitutional involvement in the governing of Northern Ireland by the Irish Government.  I welcome &mdash; and they will &mdash; the statement yesterday by the Tánaiste that this Government does not seek joint authority. Another four million people on the island reject that loyalty.  I have been impressed by the pride that southerners have developed in their State, the legitimacy of which State they have accepted, much as they may grumble about it.</P>
    <P>North and South, Catholic and Protestant, we will have to accept that an emotional and mental gulf lies between the Ulster Protestant and the Irish Catholic. We must also accept that partition has, in a strange and unexpected way, worked to a degree.  It has divided North from South if that is what it was intended to do.  Southern Protestants are not as northern Protestants; they accept the democracy of the Irish Republic.  Similarly, northern Catholics are not as southern Catholics and have not the latter's sense of autonomy and, to an extent, the all too common southerner's incomprehension of his northern brethren, regardless of religion.</P>
    <P>Whatever the trendy commentators may say, identity and religion lie behind our common agony.  There are Irish Irish and there are British Irish, and both these loyalties must be acknowledged and somehow reconciled.  I have always believed that the Sunningdale agreement of 1973, betrayed by what some would describe as a cowardly British Prime Minister, was the right model.  Give Ulster power sharing self-government subject to overseership of London and Dublin.  Let my fellow Ulster men and <Col N="2282" /> women learn self-government much as the people of the south have learned it at such terrible expense over two generations of independence.</P>
    <P>We can talk about there being two nations in Ireland but I am not sure about that.  I am sure, however, that religious belief lies at the root of one of our ancestral conflicts.  Many of my fellow Ulstermen believe that Catholicism is an imperialist religion that wishes to gobble them up.  In the past this may have been true but it is evidently no longer the case. We have done terrible things to each other; in the name of our respective loyalties a great gulf of mistrust has developed through generations yet we share the same piece of earth.  Many strive to reach across in understanding, hope and love to those whom history has separated so bitterly.</P>
    <P>In that spirit I again appeal to all paramilitaries to give peace a chance.  The world is changing; Europe is changing; Britain has changed and so too has the Irish Republic.  Indeed, over 25 years, Northern Ireland has also changed, in one way out of all recognition.  The management of change for a constructive outcome is vital.  People need to find a new self confidence and society must promote the dignity of each member.  In short, we must share what we have with each other today and, believing in a future, conserve for tomorrow.</P>
    <P>To look forward to such a time challenges us to build on firm foundations but we will never do this as long as paramilitary violence for political purposes continues.  Such violence has bred counter violence so that the truth about one another continues to be obscured, and obscured it will remain until the paramilitaries lay down their arms.  Then we may learn how futile the labels were for in truth there is so much good in the worst of us and so much bad in the best of us that it ill behoves any of us to raise arms in anger against our neighbour.</P>
    <P>Violence causes resentment, bitterness, anger and revenge; it also causes remorse and psychological torture in those who perpetrate it &mdash; the awful knock, knock, knock of conscience <Col N="2283" /> which, this side of repentance and penitence, makes it impossible to live again with oneself.  All men and women are different; each is unique yet all are part of the same humanity under God.  In hurting others it follows that we are also hurting ourselves deeply.  To say that violence is necessary in the promotion of a noble cause is absurd.  We have only to consider the examples of Gandhi and Martin Luther King.  That said, it is wrong for the rest of us to adopt a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude by condemning on the one hand and, on the other, washing our hands of the violence we condemn as if we had no responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>In demonstrating that our condemnation has not always been evenhanded we also expose to ourselves that many, perhaps all of us, contain unresolved elements of our bitter conflict deep within ourselves.  With such an objective in mind I appeal to terrorists to desist from further violence so that we may all create something better together.</P>
    <P>People have been broken by despair heaped on top of anguish.  There is deep sadness and collective communal sorrow for so much hurt ostensibly on behalf of or against the interests of one side or the other.  It is long past time that the energy directed to the promotion and suppression of violence was redirected.  To fire relevant hard-hitting questions at one's own community and tradition requires far more courage than to fire bullets or plant bombs.  Let those who carry arms lay them down.  Let those who carry prejudice lay it to rest.  As the founder of our shared Christianity would have urged, let us reach across to one another and embrace.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As in November when the House debated Northern Ireland, I welcome the tone and content of the Tánaiste's address this morning.  It would be difficult <Col N="2284" /> for anybody to disagree with its sentiments or aspirations.  However, I am pessimistic about the future of peace on this island and the future of Northern Ireland itself.</P>
    <P>My pessimism is founded very much on the fact that when looking back at the proceedings of the House over the past year, as I did this morning, I found little evidence of real progress towards the genuine objective of peace, which we all share.  Other than the single greatly significant achievement of the Downing Street Declaration, which defined the relationship between the two islands and between Northern Ireland, the South and the other island, I find little to encourage me.  The declaration cemented the rights of the majority community in Northern Ireland in the sense that it could withhold its consent from the right to self determination of the Irish people.  The Tánaiste re-emphasised that aspect this morning, as did my party leader when she spoke about this matter on the Adjournment of the Dáil last week.</P>
    <P>My pessimism is founded on the fact that we are still confronted with the question of how we are to achieve the peace which we all so earnestly desire.  It is also founded on the fact that the slaughter seems to continue endlessly, despite the progress made with the Downing Street Declaration.  Once again in the House we have been forced to condemn yet another slaughter.  Loughinisland is reminiscent of Le Mans, the Shankill, Greysteel, Enniskillen, Teebawn and Darkley in that another six innocent people watching a football match were blown away. In that context, one wonders how much progress has been made because the graveyards continue to fill.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, how can we be given any grounds for optimism, hope and reconciliation?  The single most important way we can be given those grounds is through the cessation of violence. It is striking that this message, which was enunciated in the House in October, is the consistent message of Seanad Éireann in all debates on this matter.  Our appeal is to the men of violence, of whatever complexion, to end the <Col N="2285" /> violence.  My message of October 27 last has not changed: stop the killing now, and put away the bombs, the bullets and the guns because that is the only road to peace.  This House must keep repeating that message as often as required to all paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>In addition, there will be a place at the table for those people in the event not just of a cessation of violence but of a verifiable disarmament following the cessation of violence.  We are tired waiting for the response we expected from Sinn Féin.  As we wait, the graveyards continue to fill.  We were promised a response from Sinn Féin after the European elections.  Those elections have come and gone and I hope the response will come before the end of this month.</P>
    <P>While we awaited the response, we removed section 31 and gave freedom of the airwaves to people to preach a message which I find unpalatable.  There was no concession given in return.  Mr. Adams went to the United States where he preached his gospel of violence under the mask of peace.  There was no concession in return.  Mr. Adams, and his colleagues, wanted clarification of the Downing Street Declaration and they got it.  Again, there were no concessions.  Mr. Adams became socially acceptable and somebody who should be included in &ldquo;Who's Who&rdquo;.  He became somebody who should write in the columns of <i>The Irish Times,</i> as he did yesterday, but there are no concessions.  How much more is required before we get the response for which we all hope and wait?  We need to hear that response and hear it now before the graveyards fill once more.  We need some evidence of some reciprocation from that quarter.</P>
    <P>The effect of all of this, as I discovered during the European election campaign when I debated some of these matters with people from Sinn Féin, is that they consider it their peace process.  In their eyes, they are responsible for it and in some respects the constitutional politicians are deemed to be marginalised. In their eyes, we are intransigent and preventing the peace process from taking place.  We should put the responsibility <Col N="2286" /> where it lies, with the people who carry the guns and plant the bombs and those who control the people who plant the bombs and carry the guns.</P>
    <P>In this event, our response as constitutional politicians should be quite simple.  As enunciated by Senator Henry, we must talk to each other as constitutional politicians at every opportunity and in every fora afforded to us. We must see and talk to people in Northern Ireland as often as possible.  If they receive invitations to come to the South, I hope they will accept them.  There is much in that type of ordinary, every day contact which can promote peace and reconciliation.  Northern Ireland requires its own constitution and Bill of rights, although that is secondary to the need to talk and the forum for peace and reconciliation of which we heard earlier.</P>
    <P>I cannot express the sentiments voiced by Senator Wilson so eloquently but I share them.  There must be a fundamental change to generosity.  I spoke previously about the need for unilateral acts of generosity, which are important.  This generosity can replace hatred.  This generosity is at the heart of our Christian religion and if we profess that religion, as we claim, I cannot understand how we cannot bring it to bear on our discussions of this matter.</P>
    <P>Language in this context is most important.  In the past, the Seanad has debated this matter in a moderate tone, and language was controlled.  I earnestly appeal to the Taoiseach to be most careful in the language he uses.  When he goes to the United States, as he has done, to talk about matters, such as joint authority, I ask him to realise the significance of the words being used.  He must be most careful because the misuse of words can lead to more deaths and the filling of more graveyards.</P>
    <P>In that context, the remarks of Mr. Peter Robinson about some members of the Irish football team should not have been made.  They were highly offensive and racist.  Even in the worst excesses of the Boer laager in South Africa, I do not think I would have heard such words. <Col N="2287" /> That too can inflame passions and lead to more deaths and graves.</P>
    <P>We are almost in the same position as October and November.  I wish to repeat what I said on November 25, although, to be fair, the Tánaiste comprehensively addressed this point this morning.  We must recognise the legitimacy of the Britishness of some people who live on this island just as there is legitimacy in the Irishness of others.  We are confronted with the problem of resolving that fundamental conflict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Kennedy for allowing me to share his time.  I welcome the Minister and I welcome the Tánaiste's speech.  I also congratulate the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach on their work since they came into office towards resolving the situation in Northern Ireland.  The Tánaiste is trusted by the people in Northern Ireland and both he and the Taoiseach have done more to bring this matter to a head over the last two years than many others did before them.</P>
      <P>I am a regular visitor to Northern Ireland.  Before 1969 I spent a lot of time there, as did most people who live in Border counties. There were strong commercial links between Donegal and Derry.  Northern Ireland was also the most obvious place to go for clothes and dancing.  At least one could get a packet of condoms in Northern Ireland &mdash; they were not available in Letterkenny.  That is probably why there were not the same problems in Letterkenny or Donegal at the time as there were in the rest of the country.  Both sides mixed well, playing football and so forth.  It was a lovely atmosphere in which to grow up even though there were troubles then within Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The civil rights movement was making progress.  The B Specials were abolished and one man, one vote was introduced. The Provos saw that progress was being made so they got involved and created the murder and carnage we have lived <Col N="2288" /> with for the last 25 years.  What have they achieved in 25 years?  Very little.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration was a step forward and an opportunity for the two communities to examine their position.  It was an opportunity for Sinn Féin to get off the fence and do something.  The declaration put that organisation in a spot.  It had to look at itself and see where it was going.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the lack of awareness in the southern population about the situation in Northern Ireland. I have been in the Seanad for over a year and I am amazed at the lack of knowledge among Members of this and the lower House about Northern Ireland.  It is unbelievable.  I agree with Senator Henry that southern people must go to the North, see the place and meet the people. The people in Northern Ireland do not have horns &mdash; they are nice, decent people.  I have gone there on my holidays for years and I enjoy going there.  The people are wonderful but there is a lack of awareness among people here.</P>
    <P>We hear people speaking on behalf of the nationalist cause and sometimes they do not even know what they are talking about.  They talk through their hats to please an electorate they might have at home.  They should not do that.  I have lived with this for years in Donegal where people have played the nationalist card or the unionist card.  It has done nothing but created more mayhem.  We talk about the Peter Robinsons and the Paisleys in the North &mdash; we have our own in southern Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Hume-Adams document, I do not believe there is such a document.  However, at least Hume and Adams met and had an opportunity to talk.  It set the agenda for what was to come.  Sinn Féin has a serious problem with the Joint Declaration.  I have spoken to people in Northern Ireland.  Parents of prisoners and of young people who have given their lives for &ldquo;the cause&rdquo;, as they call it, want the conflict to end.  Sinn Féin is under extreme pressure.  I meet members in the streets of Letterkenny and in Northern Ireland, I visit Derry and Belfast and I talk regularly to people I have known for many years.  It is wrong <Col N="2289" /> for people to say that nothing has been achieved since December.  Those people should give the declaration a chance.  I believe Sinn Féin is coming on board because it is under tremendous pressure. The one thing Sinn Féin does not want is a split in the movement.  Nobody here would want that movement to split either.  I urge people to give the declaration a chance and not to inflame the situation.</P>
    <P>One can look at the examples offered by Derry and Belfast.  People should visit Derry city and see the changes that have taken place there.  Derry had major problems with bombings and killings.  It rarely happens now.  It is a tremendous and vibrant city where the unionists and the nationalists have worked together.  One seldom hears of bombs or killings in Derry now.  People are working together and the city is doing very well commercially and otherwise.  Most of the violence is now confined to Belfast.  There are major problems in that city.  There is massive extortion and gangsterism there. Sinn Féin's problem is to try to do something about that.</P>
    <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs is one of the better committees established recently.  It is a forum in which we can influence issues.  Northern Ireland politicians have come down to talk to the committee.  The unionists and the DUP are not prepared to come down so we should go up to the North and talk to them there.  We must be tolerant and make efforts to meet and understand them.  O'Neill, Lemass and other leaders did so.  We should grasp that nettle and work together for the benefit of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the last speech and its unusual emphasis on the need for us to understand what is happening in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I was talking to a senior Member of the Oireachtas about Northern Ireland.  He asked me how often I visited the North and I told him I visited it frequently because I have constituents there.  I am one of the few Members of this House who has constituents in <Col N="2290" /> Northern Ireland.  I asked him the same question and he told me that he had never been there in his life.  This man &mdash; and that is as far as I will go in identifying the person involved &mdash; has been voting on Northern Ireland issues for many years in this House and in other fora in this country.  He did not have to be guilty about anything but his reply emphasised to me the depth of ignorance that exists in this House and throughout the south of Ireland about what happens in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney's remarks are important.  It is important that we go up there more often and that we understand what is happening there.  It is also indicative that there are many other people in the same category as the person to whom I was speaking.</P>
    <P>I agree with much that the Tánaiste said.  I echo the appeals, particularly from Senator Wilson, for moderate language. While I welcome the Tánaiste's speech, it was limited.  I understand the sensitivities of making a speech which is aspirational in nature and demonstrates many good intentions.  However, it does not tell us much about Government policy.  It does not tell us what the Government is doing to improve the situation except that it is waiting for Sinn Féin.  I would like to have heard much more about where we will go from here rather than the Government sitting on the slightly withering laurels of the Joint Declaration.  While the declaration was welcomed by everybody in the Oireachtas it now looks slightly frayed and needs reinforcement.  Peace has not broken out and the response of those at whom this declaration was aimed has been disappointing.  Matters have got worse and there has not even been a cynical IRA truce yet, although we have expected one on several occasions since December.  The false dawns seem to occur almost on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>One of the real problems with current Government policy is encapsulated in a phrase the Tánaiste used in his speech. He referred continually to &ldquo;the republican movement&rdquo;.  This phrase is particularly offensive when used to denote the <Col N="2291" /> Provisional IRA.  For some extraordinary reason, in recent months the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach consistently refer to &ldquo;the republican movement&rdquo; as if no one else in this country is part of that movement.</P>
    <P>In my understanding that was an honourable movement for many years. Now we have allowed Sinn Féin/IRA to hijack this title and be called &ldquo;the republican movement&rdquo;.  The Tánaiste should have referred to them as terrorists because my understanding is that the Tánaiste is a member of the republican movement, in that he is a republican, as is the Taoiseach.  However we have allowed Sinn Féin's language to insinuate itself into our speeches and that is a pity.</P>
    <P>In the last six months Sinn Féin has gradually gained a degree of respectability. That is a dangerous development and it is killing people while gaining that respectability.  It is good that Senator Dardis has said this and called a spade a spade.</P>
    <P>This Government has held talks with Sinn Féin/IRA and its intermediaries. Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, 1970 was repealed in January this year and Mr. Adams and his friends are regularly to be heard on the airwaves and writing in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  This would not have happened a year ago.  Earlier this year Mr. Adams was granted a visa to visit the United States in what has turned out to be a terrible mistake.  That could not have been done without the support of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Government, the SDLP and certain powerful elements in the US.</P>
    <P>The final development, which one hopes is embarrassing to the Government, is Sinn Féin spokespersons on RTE giving plaudits to the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  They say they do not approve of what certain people were saying but what the Taoiseach was saying was highly constructive.  That is a poisoned chalice; supporters of terrorism praising the constitutional Taoiseach of the day.  This is not something the Taoiseach should welcome but he will have to live with it because he is allowing these people to <Col N="2292" /> dictate policy although Sinn Féin, the political wing of the IRA, only represents 2 per cent of the people here.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative to waiting for Sinn Féin.  Undoubtedly the Government is genuinely seeking peace but it is not enough to wrap this mantle around them and tell people not to rock the boat.  At some stage the policy must be analysed and it must be decided that Sinn Féin has been given enough time and alternative action must be taken.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly legitimate now to reexamine section 31 and to consider internment for people on both sides of the Border and both sides of the political divide.  Would the Loughinisland and Shankill bombs have happened if internment had been in existence?  We have to ask ourselves this question.  We must examine Articles 2 and 3 and the need for what Senator Dardis called unilateral acts of generosity.  These are important if we genuinely want peace.  We must consider our role in the Anglo-Irish process, whether we will be constantly and solely the representatives of nationalists in that structure.  We must ask if we should proceed more quickly with internal talks and what we see as the ultimate solution in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the ongoing tragedy of Northern Ireland and I sincerely hope that in the time provided today some contribution, however small, can be made to the solution of this terrible conflict, which has brought so much suffering and pain to the people of the Six Counties and occasionally to people in the Republic and in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should stop and take a fresh look at the problem, perhaps for the first time. It concerns a small number of people &mdash; 5 million on this globe.  My colleagues and I are these people, living on this island we all profess to love.  We are part of the problem and we must be part of the solution.  Some of our people, Catholic and Protestant, see the way forward through the barrel of a gun.  It must be our responsibility to lead all our people through the righteous path to peace, harmony <Col N="2293" /> and brotherly and sisterly love.  As Cardinal John Henry Newman wrote in his essay, &ldquo;The Isles of the North&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Let these islands become once again a bastion of Christianity which will show the right way in a very troubled world.</P>
    <P>As an Ulster person, I empathise with my neighbours across the Border who live their daily lives in constant dread of violence and destruction.  Loughinisland is the birthplace of Saint Macartan, the patron saint of our diocese of Clogher which straddles the Border.</P>
    <P>Along with the good people of that place, I admire those giants among men who daily, honestly and fearlessly, act as a beacon for us all amid troubled waters. I speak of Christians like Mr. John Hume, Fr. Denis Faul, Mr. Ken Maginnis and Dr. Robin Eames.  Senator Wilson and his good wife have been and continue to be a constant inspiration to us all.  They have shown us the way.</P>
    <P>The Provisional IRA and the Ulster loyalists are of us and cannot be ignored. However, they must be convinced their way is not correct and that there is a better one.  Charles Stewart Parnell once said that no one can stand in the way of the onward march of a nation.  The British Government has stated that it will not stand in the way.  We should continue the talks process.  Despite our disappointment that the violence has not yet ended in response to the Downing Street Declaration, peace may still be achieved through this historic initiative.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, has given a personal commitment to the search for peace.  From the time he became Taoiseach, he and the Tanáiste, Deputy Spring, have given an opportunity to all sides, which they never had before, to solve the conflict in Northern Ireland with honour and dignity through negotiations, while protecting their wider responsibilities and obligations.</P>
    <P>I urge the Tanáiste to call for the reopening of closed Border roads which greatly inconvenience the residents of Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Leitrim and Donegal and across the Border. <Col N="2294" /> I compliment the Government on its continuing efforts to achieve peace and I urge those involved to match the commitment of the Taoiseach and the Tanáiste so that Ireland will achieve a peace based on justice and equality, not on domination or a denial of rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke during this debate three days before Christmas I described the Downing Street Declaration as offering a unique opportunity to secure peace and to promote political progress in Northern Ireland.  I said it provided what was, perhaps, the best prospect of peace in more than 20 years and I warned that if the opportunity was spurned by the paramilitaries, the prospects for the people of Northern Ireland would be bleak.  At that time there was a new sense of expectation and hope that the people of Northern Ireland might at last be freed from the endless cycle of violence and viciousness which had destroyed many lives and scarred many more.  There was optimism that the Downing Street Declaration would provide a framework within which the democratic political parties in Northern Ireland would be able to develop structures capable of winning cross community support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six months later there is a real sense of disappointment because little progress has been made.  The paramilitaries, Loyalist and Nationalist, continue to reach new depths of viciousness.  Sinn Féin and the IRA continue to equivocate and have yet to respond to the Declaration.  The failure of the two Governments to follow through on the unique momentum for peace created by the Declaration has caused a political vacuum which the paramilitaries are only too happy to exploit. If the project is not to flounder, it is essential for the two Governments to act quickly to regain the political initiative. The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, are entitled to praise for the manner in which they negotiated the Declaration.  However, they deserve little credit for the way they have allowed the situation to drift since then. For more than six months they have <Col N="2295" /> appeared willing to put the efforts to find a political solution in cold storage.</P>
    <P>While we awaited a response from Sinn Féin and the IRA, Mr. Adams and his colleagues went through a phoney process of seeking clarification from the British and consulting with their own members.  They got the clarification and time for consultation which they required.  Later this month Sinn Féin will hold a special conference at which, we are told, it will make a final decision. However, the indications are that it will not give a clear response and that we will probably have more equivocation.  The conference will not clearly accept or reject the Declaration, but it will probably fudge the issue to further delay the process.  This is the clear message contained in the detailed statement issued by Mr. Adams this week.</P>
    <P>It also seems clear from Mr. Adams that the IRA will not reject violence or agree to an extended cease-fire.  A clear message must go out from this House, the two Governments and all democratic parties on this island that the period of waiting for a response from Sinn Féin is over.  It knows what is expected of them and if it wants to be part of the political process, it must reject violence as a weapon used to pursue its political objectives. There can be no place for it at the negotiating table if it is not prepared to accept this.</P>
    <P>The two Governments must act to restore the political momentum.  The meeting in Dublin later this month between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister offers the ideal platform to relaunch the Downing Street Declaration. Despite what happened, it still has the support of the vast majority of the people on this island and offers the best prospect for progress.  Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Major must take urgent steps to facilitate dialogue between the democratic parties in Northern Ireland.  Both sides must moderate their political objectives and be willing to compromise.  This is the only basis on which progress can be made.  In the final analysis, the two Governments cannot impose a settlement <Col N="2296" /> on Northern Ireland and the main responsibility for finding a way forward rests with the people there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I address the House today as a republican of deep conviction from a proud and honourable republican tradition.  The republican philosophy is based on the recognition of diversity and respect for the individual rights of every citizen in common cause and understanding. A republican must be deeply conscious of his inheritance, but even more conscious of his obligation to bring about understanding, harmony and equal opportunity for all, particularly for future generations on this island.  By definition, that potential can only be realised in common cause and common action. There must be no domination or no feeling of threat, but a mutual respect and determination to advance the cause of our people from every tradition and background.</P>
      <P>The Protestant Orange tradition has at various stages in our history shaped the paths of this island in a vital and dynamic way.  It is essential that those of us who belong to a different tradition recognise and respect that, but we must also proclaim our confident conviction that it can make an even more positive and dynamic contribution to the future of this island.</P>
      <P>Many years ago the founder of our party called on the republican movement to lay down its arms and to work in common cause for the advancement of the interests of the people of Ireland.  In this jurisdiction, our political experience has fortunately matured to the point that we can and do respect the divergence of opinion from those who have inherited traditions from people who differed fundamentally in the past.  Our political structures today in this jurisdiction, while deriving to some extent from the divisions of civil war have matured to the point where we have political parties and groups of widely different political and economic philosophies who can work together in democratic determination to advance the interests of all of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be asserted and understood by all without any qualification that there <Col N="2297" /> can be no threat, there should be no fear and there can be no domination by one group over another in any future political arrangements on this island.  We in the South have no right to make a claim over our fellow Irishmen in the North and we make no such claim.  We only make one claim: to work constantly and diligently, at home and abroad, for the advancement of the interest of all the people on this island in harmony and understanding.</P>
    <P>Irish people of whatever tradition have won respect and affection throughout the world for their contributions to the well being and advancement of many countries. It is time we challenged ourselves in this generation to do precisely the same at home, recognising the huge potential there is for economic and social advancement and justice in the confident belief that we have the personal resources and the confidence to achieve a great future through whatever structures can be agreed for all of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is essential for our fellow Irishmen in the North to understand that no government and no political party in the South is trying or will try to undermine the rights of any elected representatives in the North.  However, it is equally important to recognise that for too long life and business has been far from normal in the North, even with the benefit of millions of pounds poured into the economy there from the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the European Union is a new and vital force in the economic development of this country. We must be ready to share with our fellow Irishmen in the North equal rights to representations at all levels in that Union, whether it be at the level of the European Council, the European Commission or the European Parliament. Clearly, they do not have that under the current political arrangements and we see the effects, particularly in agriculture, tourism, fisheries development and business generally in Northern Ireland, because that opportunity is not now available to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2298" /> An agriculture policy that is linked to that of the United Kingdom poses major problems for the simple reason that the overall policy of the United Kingdom is not geared towards the agricultural structures in Northern Ireland.  Even in terms of market opportunity, their product is associated with Britain, sometimes to their detriment as with the BSE issue at the moment, by association with a British image on European and world markets.</P>
    <P>While we may not have achieved our full potential in the fishing industry, for instance, a major new programme for infrastructural developments for ports, harbours and modern well equipped fishing boats has been an important feature of our development in recent years, whereas the great fishing tradition in the North, in ports like Kilkeel, for instance, is now not being developed to anything like its full potential.  The training facilities and the quota allocation for our fishermen contrasts very favourably with those in the North of Ireland where the quota has now been reduced by 19 per cent in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>One hardly needs to state the obvious in relation to the tourism potential of this country, North and South which, if properly developed through co-ordinated programmes and common action, will realise a major new potential for all of our people from the Glens of Antrim to the Dingle peninsula.</P>
    <P>The political representatives in the North should understand that our first interest is to support them in establishing whatever political forum is acceptable to them in Northern Ireland.  We must have the same normal healthy political activity in the North as a first step towards realising the full potential, not only of the North, but of the whole island.  Co-operation in marketing and training programmes in the hotel catering industry and across the spectrum of economic life North and South can only operate to the advantage of all.</P>
    <P>To achieve this it is time that the arms were laid down in the North in this generation in the same way as they were in this jurisdiction almost 70 years ago.  The potential together is enormous.  It only <Col N="2299" /> remains for us to make that renewed commitment on the basis of mutual respect and confidence to advancing the future of all our people.  The young people of Ireland, North and South, deserve nothing less.  There must be no more killing.  There must be no more tragedies.  There must instead be a truly common determination to work together to realise the full potential of this island and to lay the basis for a worthwhile and prosperous future for all our people, with a well educated and idealistic core of young people.  The potential for this island as a whole is enormous.  It only remains for us in common purpose to realise that potential for the betterment of all the people of Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing this morning to this debate.  I thank the Tánaiste for opening the debate.  His speech was quite interesting but while there was much analysis of the differences between the two communities in the North, and there was some discussion about ways in which progress could be made, the speech was devoid of any landmarks that we could point to as resulting from the peace initiative which is getting quite old at this stage.</P>
      <P>The speech is probably most noteworthy in so far as to me at least it signifies the end of the peace initiative. There is very little of the old rhetoric that we were used to up to a few months ago. There is the almost unique acceptance at this stage by the Tánaiste that whereas Sinn Féin are expected to make a decision shortly, he does not seem to hold out much hope for that decision to be the one we have been looking for.  My view at the time was that the Government had taken a step too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas the Downing Street Declaration and the peace initiative were very worthy and had unanimous support in the Republic and much support in the North of Ireland as well, the communities in the North could not respond in the way they were expected to.  The table on <Col N="2300" /> which Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution and the Government of Ireland Act, 1925 were placed was an unwelcome one for both sides of the divide in the North. They were not able to approach that table without seeing it as a threat to their very existence.  Those of us, like Senators O'Brien, Gallagher and myself, who live on the Border are very conscious of that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that what I felt on that day when I was handed a copy of the Downing Street Declaration has come true.  The IRA and Sinn Féin have been playing a wonderful game of political football with the declaration since it was announced.  They have been offered centre stage, they have been put back on the airwaves here and they still will not say that they do not support violence. When asked, they will be ambivalent about it, will talk around it and will not face that question.  Undoubtedly, Sinn Féin still support violence as a means of achieving the ends which we all want.</P>
    <P>Six months later clarifications have been offered them and we now have an eerie silence which frightens me.  The European election is over, and Sinn Féin has gained much in the past six months but offered us nothing in return.  I always thought the generosity we expected and wanted from that source would not be forthcoming.  I found an acceptance of that fact from reading between the lines of the Tánaiste's speech this morning. Although the Governments have offered much, they have received nothing but a slap on the back of the hand.  Where will the two Governments move from here? Should they return that slap?  It would be the natural reaction but we will have to wait for the outcome.</P>
    <P>The political vacuum may now be worse than ever.  The constitutional politicians have been sidelined and the paramilitaries have taken centre stage. Indeed, signals are coming from many places to prepare for Doomsday.  Dublin business people were called together by the Garda to prepare and teach them what to do if they found a bomb, as widely referred to in the national media. Anybody reading that would surely take it as a signal to prepare for a situation <Col N="2301" /> which is not of the kind we want.  People's lives will be put at risk, and in some cases, lost, like in 1974.  The current situation is worrying and the political vacuum beginning to develop is unwelcome.</P>
    <P>One aspect convinced me that there could not be a meeting of minds in the North.  Although we live in close proximity to each other, we are not able to do business in a normal way.  It is claimed that at least 70,000 jobs would be created if normal business was done.  I ask the Government to bring about unity in industry and commerce.  It could certainly go some way towards achieving that.  The daily contact between people buying and selling goods and trying to fulfil each other's economic needs would go a long way towards establishing regular contact and a greater understanding between them.  I hope the Government will achieve that and bring about those minor aspects which must be put in place before another major step is taken.  What happens if one reaches too far and fails in a major initiative?  The British and Irish Governments must face that fact.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government every success in its continued efforts in trying to solve this problem.  It will have our support and I hope there will be some success at the end of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to put the problem of Northern Ireland in a nutshell, in fact, it is impossible and should not even be attempted.  Therefore, I will only deal with certain aspects of it in my brief contribution.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to Senator Ross's contribution, part of which unfairly criticised the Taoiseach and Tánaiste especially when he referred to &ldquo;republican movement.&rdquo; That term is a broad one and used to take in and declare all shades of republicanism.  Of course, Senator Ross may have his own agenda on this matter, as in many others.  However, it is unhelpful to have politicians such as the Senator, and there are a few, criticising politicians who are working extremely hard to achieve something and gain and make efforts at getting peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2302" /> Senator Ross also operates as a journalist, if that is what one would call his work.  I find it surprising that a liberal argues against lifting section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  I believe in free speech and democratically elected politicians should be allowed to speak and be heard, and thus be criticised and examined by others, where warranted, rather than protect them in a shroud of mystery.  It appears it would take little for certain politicians to gag everybody and throw them in prison.  Not only are such suggestions unworkable, they achieve nothing and add fuel to the fire.</P>
    <P>I thank the Tánaiste for bringing this debate to the House and his speech was as thoughtful as ever.  With reference to Senator Cotter's comments, I was not expecting any surprises.  The Minister is doing a marvellous job in tackling the question, it is not a one man show and the Minister depends on others to make progress.  Anyway, there are no prizes for novelty and we should aim for practical results.</P>
    <P>Many people switch off their televisions when politicians refer to Northern Ireland.  This happens, despite the fact &mdash; possibly because of it &mdash; that our Tánaiste and others have grasped the nettle and begun to work towards having real talks.  In fact, the recent moves have caused those with an interest in violence to worry.  Sadly, their response has been to commit even more violence.  What has been gained by killing fellow men, women and neighbours and shooting an old man in the back while watching a football match?  Nothing.  What killer can be proud of their actions when they witness the heartbreaking cries of the relatives of the dead?  It seems that those involved in the killings do not wish to achieve anything.  Cynical I may be, but I fear that both sides prefer the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>Whatever the legitimate aims, ideals and beliefs of unionists and nationalists, those recruited into terrorist activity have a frightening lack of knowledge of the realities.  They eat and regurgitate slanted and twisted morsels of history.  Those in positions of authority on both sides feed <Col N="2303" /> on that ignorance and use it to man their terror machines.  Consequently, the terrorists and sympathisers include a large number of young people, unemployed and those without purpose.  They are then given an elevated status, importance and role by becoming active in the awful activities that keep the troubles going.  I recently saw a documentary on Northern Ireland, which showed the 12 July celebrations of some years back.  Unionist supporters threw an effigy of the Pope on top of a bonfire and were screaming all kinds of comments.  An American journalist asked them to explain why they were doing this.  Sadly, they gave few reasons.  It is mainly due to practice and history, with little understanding.  It is easy to get foot soldiers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while a political solution is necessary, so too is cultural and social development.  The housing apartheid of Northern Ireland must be dismantled by the housing authority by whatever means necessary.  Dividing people only increases their fear and facilitates the killings in a practical way.  Schools must also be integrated and the religious bodies on both sides must accept this.  The young children of Northern Ireland never get a chance to look across the fence.  They grow up with slanted views and dangerously blinkered vision.  How can peace be achieved between the two communities when they are so physically and psychologically divided?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I fear that many politicians in Northern Ireland have failed their people.  Some have, to a greater or lesser degree, settled into their respective battle positions and refused to budge. Are they cosy in their compliance and fear change?  Its political system, of course, does not facilitate democratic involvement and this feeds the problem. Those democratically elected have a duty to take on board whatever may be necessary to work towards peace and I urge them to do so.</P>
    <P>The people of Northern Ireland want and deserve peace.  The politicians, terrorists, sympathisers and all members of the community which make up Northern <Col N="2304" /> Ireland have a role to play in bringing about a day when those living north of the Border can stop looking over their shoulders and learn to live and work together.</P>
    <P>Peace will not be obtained easily.  It must be worked for by all.  Those with legitimate grounds for complaint must learn to talk to the other side.  Pride, belief, history and fear must be put aside and not allowed to act as barriers to progress. It will not be easy for many, yet it must be done.</P>
    <P>Too many politicians have got themselves into bunkers where they feel they will lose face if they sit down to talk with the other side, but give in and talk they must.  The people of Northern Ireland have the intelligence to appreciate their efforts in doing so.  They have been let down badly by those who claim to represent them.  In this respect, leaders on both sides appear intransigent, as they present lists of uncompromising demands which they insist must be dealt with before they will talk.</P>
    <P>What right have those people to set down such obstacles?  In the sure knowledge that others die while they play their negotiating game, they treat Northern Ireland as a game of chess, but the people are the pawns.  How can they behave this way?  Why do they not ask the ordinary people on the ground what they want? Then, and only then, will they hear the deep cry and plea for peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for attending the House.  He has used this House on numerous occasions to speak on this issue.  The Seanad is uniquely placed to deal with the issue and has always addressed it in a positive and constructive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One may be excused for despairing when considering 25 years of death and suffering endured by the people of Northern Ireland.  The recent killings in Loughinisland horrified all decent thinking people.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland summed up the situation when he asked the killers how they would tell their children what they achieved for <Col N="2305" /> the people whom they presumed to act for.</P>
    <P>How will such people explain that they defended their position and heritage by shooting a man of 87 years of age in the back?  How can they justify this action? How can they have respect for their heritage, which is a proud one, by perpetrating such acts?  They are damaging themselves, their tradition, their people and all on this island.  No logic can be applied to acts of this kind, no matter what side they originate from.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business of the House, Members regularly condemn violent incidents and death in the North. At times this condemnation can appear rather tiresome, but it must never become so and people must never cease to condemn individual acts of atrocity in Northern Ireland.  Every avenue must be used to condemn these acts because in not doing so a level of tolerance of violence is introduced within the nation.  This must never happen as there is no level of violence that is tolerable regarding the situation in the North.</P>
    <P>In finding a solution to the problem it is necessary to seek more tolerance from all sides of the divide in Northern Ireland, and tolerance from our side of the unionist tradition in the North.  In this respect, there has never been a greater level of co-operation and tolerance in Europe, which was the cockpit of wars for centuries. Ireland is the last black spot within the EU which is continuing old traditional hatreds and wars.</P>
    <P>Something can and must be done. Everybody is seeking a solution, but nothing appears to be happening.  The Joint Declaration was welcomed by all. It appeared to be a framework for a settlement, and may still be if it is used. Those who need to use it most of all, the terrorists and those engaged in violence, the IRA and the Sinn Féin Party, must be urged to look to the declaration as a means to solving the problem.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin and the IRA have cynically used the declaration to obtain a level of credibility which they did not have previously.  They have played the declaration in the same manner as playing a <Col N="2306" /> salmon, and have used it to gain credibility throughout the world.  The visit by Gerry Adams to the USA must be viewed in this context, and this week it has been announced that he has a mention in <i>Who's Who</i>.  It is disturbing that somebody who leads and promotes violence has obtained that level of credibility. While the declaration has been cynically used in this way, the will of those who encourage Sinn Féin to accept the declaration must be understood.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that there are divisions within the IRA regarding the acceptance or non acceptance of the declaration. These divisions call for leadership, and there is a time when it must be shown on this issue.  Right must be recognised, and those within the IRA who believe that the declaration is a medium for changing history and developing relationships between the communities in Northern Ireland must, now give leadership and accept it.</P>
    <P>Despite the atrocities there must not be despair.  Support must continue for those who strive for a lasting settlement. Many on this island believe that a solution can never be found.  Some believe that violence, killing and prejudice is endemic in Northern Ireland.  Many speak of an acceptable level of violence. However, there should be no tolerance for any level of political or sectarian violence. It must be eliminated and appeals must continue to the good, tolerant and upright people in both communities to influence the men of violence to lay down their arms.  In this respect, there must be a belief that ultimately peace will and must be achieved.  If the cold war can end so dramatically, and if the Israeli and Arab leaders can embrace, surely a solution can be found to our problems on this island?</P>
    <P>The Government should not wait any longer for a response from Sinn Féin and the IRA to the Joint Declaration. Dialogue must be established with all sides in the North with a view to establishing structures which will bring both communities closer together.  The way forward is with the people of Northern <Col N="2307" /> Ireland through the appropriate structures.</P>
    <P>There should be a greater knowledge and understanding by people in the South of the situation in Northern Ireland and of its unionist and nationalist traditions. I have visited Northern Ireland regularly over the past ten to 15 years, most recently some months ago.  It is important that people visit the North.  Senator Ross highlighted a prominent politician who has never visited, which is unfortunate. All people, including political parties, should promote visits, dialogue and exchanges with the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years I have been involved in a unique relationship between the Fine Gael Party in north County Cork and the SDLP in south County Down.  The level of understanding of the situation in the North which was developed by those involved in this process which included meetings with unionists, was most positive.  Such activities provide an insight into the difficulties in the North and into the possible solutions which might develop.  I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister of State on this debate.  We should have regular debates on this issue because this unique forum can play a positive part in developing attitudes and solutions to the Northern Ireland problem.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Bill before the House today will fulfil another commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-1997. This, however, is not the first time such a Bill has been introduced in this House. Almost exactly 12 years ago, in June 1982, a Bill to establish a national heritage council received a second reading in Seanad Éireann but the Bill lapsed with <Col N="2308" /> the change of Government.  The central purpose of that Bill was to create a semi-State body to take over the executive functions of the National Museum and of the Office of Public Works insofar as heritage matters were concerned.  It would also have had advisory functions in certain aspects of heritage.</P>
      <P>In 1988 the Government established a non-statutory National Heritage Council whose functions are mainly advisory although it has certain executive functions. The expressed intention at the time was to introduce legislation to regularise the position of the council, but this was never done.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to replace the existing council with a statutory corporation which would also take over the functions of the Wiildlife Advisory Council appointed under section 13 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 as well as the functions of the Historic Monuments Council as provided for in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.  The Historic Monuments Council was, however, never appointed.  The new Heritage Council will also be given an important responsibility for buildings of architectural importance in the ownership of public authorities.</P>
      <P>Ba chóir féachaint ar an mBille seo i gcomhthéacs an pholasaí a bhí taobh thiar de bhunú na Roinne Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta.  Is í m'aidhm ná go mbeidh cruthú pholasaí mar ról lárnach sa Roinn ach go ndéanfar dilárú ar chur i gcrích na bpolasaithe sin.  Ar ndóigh, beidh ról tábhachtach ag an gComhairle Oidhreachta i gcruthú pholasaí oidhreachta.  Ar an dtaobh eile, beidh mé ag dul i dtreo an díláraithe freisin agus, chuige sin, tá súil agam Bille Mhúsaem agus Leabharlainne a thabhairt isteach sa chéad seisiún eile.  Sa Bille sin tá súil agam tuilleadh neamhspleáchais a thabhairt don dá Institiúid sin &mdash; Ard-Mhúsaem na hÉireann agus an Leabharlann Náisiúnta.  Ar ndóigh, beidh Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí ag coinneáil uirthi ag bainistiú an eastáit oidhreachta ach, mar is eol do Sheanadóirí, níl cúramaí polasaí uirithi a thuilleadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> The word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; has not been included in the title of my Department and perhaps that is just as well, as the word has become devalued by over use and inappropriate associations.  It has become perhaps too closely associated with tourism as if it were no more than something to amuse foreigners &mdash; in a temporary and slightly cultural way &mdash; which comes out in early summer and goes back into hibernation in the autumn. This is not to belittle the contribution of tourism to our economy; it is important that the targets set in the National Plan are achieved so that jobs can be created and sustained.  However &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; must be authentic and not just a romantic image of that which we think the tourists want to see.  It means preserving and telling our own story in our own way so that we are seen to be interesting people living in interesting places of which we are proud and to which we welcome visitors. In the absence, until now, of a definition of what is meant by cultural tourism, it is important that it be understood in terms of empowering ourselves to know and respect our heritage, and thus become the more interesting people to visit.</P>
    <P>Taking the word in its widest sense, &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;&mdash; or, more accurately, the Irish word &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo;&mdash; could be said to embrace all the work of my Department. In other words it is that which binds it together.  It includes all those elements of Irish life today which have survived from the past and whose continuing survival into future generations depends on the attitudes and actions of the present.  Ensuring the protection of the Irish heritage in all its aspects, and providing access to this heritage for all sectors of the population, are central planks of my policy.  When we speak of heritage we are talking about something that is the heritage of all and of those yet to come.</P>
    <P>Ach caithfear a bheith réadúil agus praiticúil agus feicim go mba cheart na cúramaí seo a roinnt suas de réir earnálacha. Mar shampla, le haghaidh na Gaeilge, tá Bord na Gaeilge ann agus, le haghaidh cúrsaí ealaíona, tá an Chomhairle <Col N="2310" /> Ealaíon ann.  Dúnfar bearna na hoidhreachta le bunú na Comhairle Oidhreachta ar bhonn reachtúil.</P>
    <P>I have created a small heritage policy unit in my Department and I will shortly strengthen it with the addition of three technical personnel; an archaeologist, and architectural historian and an ecologist. It will be the function of that unit to translate the advice of the Heritage Council into practical policy statements and legislative proposals as well as producing initiatives and ensuring that policy is implemented.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the excellent work of the existing National Heritage Council &mdash; notwithstanding its non-statutory status &mdash; particularly in its funding role and also when acting as a catalyst on a variety of specific issues affecting heritage.  The National Heritage Council was appointed in 1988 and given the following tasks: to formulate policies and priorities to identify, protect, preserve, enhance and increase awareness of Ireland's heritage in the specific areas of archaeology, architecture, flora, fauna, landscape, heritage gardens and inland waterways; to promote among the general public an interest and pride in our heritage and to facilitate the appreciation and enjoyment of it; to work closely with and make recommendations to Government Departments, planning authorities, public bodies and State companies on all matters coming within the council's general area of responsibility, to ensure the co-ordination of all activities in the heritage field, to decide on the distribution of moneys allocated for heritage work subject to the approval of the Minister, and to decide on the priorities for such expenditure.</P>
    <P>I know it has been a matter of concern to the existing council for some time now that its lack of a statutory footing has led to its role in policy formulation being limited to the point where it was coming to be perceived solely as a funding agency.  This Bill will provide the necessary statutory basis for the council's functions, integrate the heritage advisory functions under one body and strengthen the council's role in relation to the protection <Col N="2311" /> of the architectural heritage in public ownership.</P>
    <P>Is é ceartlár an Bhille seo ná comhairle reachtúil a bhunú ar a mbeidh daoine le suim, eolas agus cleachtadh acu i gcúrsaí oidhreachta.  Beidh fo-choistí sonracha le bunú ag an gcomhairle agus beidh foireann agus airgeadú dóthaineach acu chun a gcuid dualgais a chomhlíonadh.</P>
    <P>Complementary to its previously assigned functions, the new statutory council will have a special role in relation to buildings owned by a public authority and designated as heritage buildings under the provisions of this Bill.  As well as advising me in the matter of buildings to be designated as heritage buildings, the Heritage Council could exercise a veto on the plans of any public authority to demolish, alter significantly or dispose of a heritage building, unless I or the Government agree with the public authority's plans.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Historic Monuments Council and the Wildlife Advisory Council and the transfer of those advisory functions to the Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the repeal of the legal provisions establishing the Wildlife Advisory Council and the Historical Monuments Council.  These physical heritage advisory functions will now be integrated under one body, the Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the general duty of the council to propose national policies and priorities in relation to the physical heritage and sets out a number of specific functions of the council, to promote interest in the heritage and to co-operate with and co-ordinate the activities of State, public and private bodies in the area of the physical heritage.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the council may make recommendations to me, that they may make such recommendations public and requires that I respond to such recommendations within six months. Section 8 imposes a requirement on the council to respond to my requests for advice and information.  Section 9 provides that I may, after consultation with <Col N="2312" /> the Government, and with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, confer additional functions on the council relating to national heritage.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a special provision introduced to increase the protection of the State's built heritage by assigning an active role to the Heritage Council.  The present Heritage Council, if it becomes aware of proposals affecting a building it considers to be of heritage value owned by the State, a statutory body or other State agency or local authority, may advise that authority in relation to such proposals but with no obligation on the authority to accept such advice.  Under this section, buildings may be designated heritage buildings by me on the council's advice and the Government Department, statutory body or other State agency or local authority would be required to notify the Heritage Council of its proposals relating to such heritage buildings and would be prevented from carrying out a proposal contrary to the council's advice without Government agreement, unless my agreement to such a proposal or to a modified form of such a proposal was obtained.</P>
    <P>Section 11 empowers the council to assist any persons on matters relating to the functions of the council, including making financial assistance available.</P>
    <P>Section 15 sets out the circumstances as a consequence whereof the chairperson or any member of the council or of a committee of the council shall automatically cease to be a member of the council or committee, as the case may be.  These circumstances include bankruptcy, imprisonment and failure to disclose a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in any transaction or dealings with the council.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the exclusion from membership of the council of Members of the Oireachtas and members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Section 17 requires that members of the council or of a committee of the council disclose to the council or committee, as the case may be, any pecuniary or other beneficial interest in, or material to, any matter which falls to be considered <Col N="2313" /> by the council or committee, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the council employing its own staff, consultants or advisers.  The council will be required to ensure that an adequate proportion of its staff will be competent in Irish so that service may be given through Irish as well as English.  This section also excludes from membership of the staff of the council Members of either House of the Oireachtas and members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for a declaration of interests in land by prescribed staff of the council or by any prescribed person whose services are availed of by the council. It also provides that failure to make such a declaration, or the making of a false or misleading declaration shall be an offence carrying a maximum penalty on summary conviction of £1,000 and on conviction on indictment of £10,000.</P>
    <P>Section 22 requires the council to submit a report in Irish and English to me within six months after the end of each year and provides that the council may publish the report.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Schedule provide for the appointment by me of a council consisting of a chairperson and not more than 16 ordinary members; for the period of office of such persons to be not more than five years, and that such persons may not serve more than two consecutive terms; for a gender balance in the appointment of members of the council, requiring that not less than seven shall be men and not less than seven shall be women and that persons appointed as members of the council shall have an interest in or knowledge or experience of the national heritage.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 provides that the council may establish committees to perform certain functions, that it shall establish a standing committee on wildlife and a standing committee on national monuments, and that I may appoint three persons who are not members of the council to each standing committee.  These latter committees effectively replace the Wildlife Advisory Council and the Historic Monument Council.  The committees will <Col N="2314" /> be chaired by members of the council but may include persons who are not members of the council.  It is envisaged that there will be a number of other committees and, in particular, one to oversee the Discovery programme, a systematic archaeological research programme commenced in 1991 and funded by the Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will be seen as part of the <i>corpus</i> of legislation which I have been bringing forward in this general area and that it will be welcomed by all sides of the House.  This legislation has been promised for some time and I am very pleased to be able to introduce it.  I look forward to hearing the Senator's contributions to this debate.  Molaim an Bille don Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on introducing the Bill in the Seanad rather than in the Lower House.  I ask him to encourage his colleagues to do likewise when the opportunity arises for them to introduce Bills.  I welcome the Bill.  It is important and, as the Minister stated, has been promised for a considerable period.  I am concerned about the setting up of more semi-State bodies but in this case there is sufficient accountability of the council to the Minister.  I hope the Minister and his successors will not take the opportunity of evading responsibility for giving answers to questions in relation to the Heritage Council, either in this or the other House, under the cloak that the council is a semi-State organisation.  Such a situation results in lack of accountability to both Houses and I hope this will not happen in this instance.  I have every confidence that the Minister is prepared to come to the House and answer any questions which may arise on all aspects of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in that it is giving statutory recognition to what has been promised for a considerable time.  As the Minister rightly said, because the Heritage Council had no statutory basis it did not have the powers to formulate policies on our heritage.  I agree with the Minister that our heritage is valuable and we <Col N="2315" /> should not manage it in a stage Irish way. It is far more fundamental and solid and is based on a magnificent history, archaeology and tradition.  There is a wealth of heritage in the country.  I am delighted the Minister has taken the opportunity to put the council on a sound footing and give it proper recognition.  It is extremely important that people are appointed to the council because of their expertise, interest, knowledge and understanding in relation to the many areas heritage covers.  I hope the Minister will appoint the best available people to this council. This council can do great work if the right people are appointed.</P>
    <P>I am interested to note that the current employees of the Heritage Council, the Wildlife Advisory Council and the Historic Monuments Council will be absorbed into the Minister's Department. Will the Minister clarify who the new employees will be?  Will the new council employ people or will any of the current employees be retained?  This council can only be effective if there is strong communication and continuity between the people who are currently doing the job and those who may be appointed in the future.  I would like the Minister to clarify this issue in his reply.</P>
    <P>The section which defines our heritage is quite wide and varied.  I note, however, that it does not include heritage centres. Many of these centres deal with the fundamental history of our people.  Perhaps the centres are considered superfluous to this Bill but, nevertheless, the history of our people and of individual families is fundamental to our entire heritage.  I hope that the Heritage Council will be in a position to deal with this aspect.</P>
    <P>There are many valuable documents in various institutions across the country. What opportunity will the Heritage Council have to protect these as they are not specifically listed?</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome section 10 which deals with the restriction on State, semi-State and local authorities.  It is extremely important for this to be included in this Bill because quite a number of extremely valuable historical buildings are owned <Col N="2316" /> by these authorities which, in a number of cases in the past, have not respected them in the manner which we would have liked.  It is important that these buildings are respected, valued and preserved for the generations to come.  I am delighted that the Minister saw fit to include this section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The other sections which I particularly welcome are sections 17 and 19 which deal with the disclosure of interests by members of the council and its employees.  It is extremely important that members of the council, employees of the council and anybody brought in on a consultancy or advisory basis should declare any interest they might have and that there should not be a conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>I compliment the outgoing Heritage Council on the valuable work it has done since it was established in 1988.  I particularly compliment it on establishing the discovery programme which set up a systematic research programme of archaeological works across the country.  Some tremendous work has been done in that area.  It is important for the new body to ensure the continuation of that work. Some very valuable finds have been made in Dublin and elsewhere and the detail, precision and professionalism with which the work was done is quite exemplary.</P>
    <P>The staff of the council will be restricted to about 15 for the initial years.  I appreciate that the Minister has the expertise and knows exactly what he is talking about in this area.  I was particularly pleased to hear him state that he will be appointing an archaeologist and an architectural historian to a particular unit in his Department to deal with areas of policy.  I hope that unit will work very closely with the council.</P>
    <P>In general, the Bill is welcome legislation. It is extremely important to the future of this country, particularly the preservation of our past.  It is important that we respect our past and recognise it for what it really is.  It is not something superfluous but is very deep and we have a great tradition.  It is something which many other countries, particularly newer ones such as Australia and the United <Col N="2317" /> States, would love to have.  We have a potential tremendous asset.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may not like the tourism aspect of it, the reality is that there is huge potential if we treat this in the right manner to generate employment. If the proper expertise is employed and the real story is told in the professional way it should be, we will have something great to sell for Ireland rather than the stage Irish, thatched cottage and donkey image which we have been selling for years.  It is important that we appeal to a different market.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department and we on this side of the House support the Bill.</P>

Last week we spoke about the need for an integrated approach, which is very important in order to get a global view of our national heritage.  When we deal with legislation, we often find that 12 months later we get a complementary Bill.  In the meantime, the first piece has been put on a shelf and forgotten about. I am glad that this Bill has been speedily brought forward to complement last week's legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned the phrase &ldquo;cultural tourism&rdquo;, which is a growing sector.  The Heritage Council is a major step forward in the development of our tourism business.  While we must pay tribute to the existing Heritage Council and the work it has done, nevertheless I welcome putting this new council on a statutory basis with its own staff, definite areas of responsibility and an emphasis on a more active role.  The Minister spoke <Col N="2318" /> about rationalising the old Heritage Council and bringing the Wildlife Advisory Council and the Historic Monuments Council under one umbrella.  This will make it easier to deal with these bodies and will be more cost effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;, where we came from and where we are going.  Our heritage is irreplaceable and we must make sure that we pass it on to future generations. However, I also have problems in defining the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;.  We have a physical heritage of archaeological remains, architecture, buildings, inland waterways, flora and fauna and landscape.</P>
    <P>However, that definition is not wide enough for my concept of heritage.  I thought about our language, literature and music, which is our intellectual heritage. We must also incorporate that in the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;.  It should also be part of the role of the Heritage Council. It is a valuable asset in an economic sense because we are now talking about cultural tourism.  I have reservations about using that phrase, but it is a growing industry and we must recognise that for future generations.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 10 where the Minister indicated that proposals from a public body or local authority to demolish or alter significantly a building must come before the Minister and the Heritage Council for advice or consent.  It is a good provision which tightens up this area to ensure our heritage is preserved and that somebody cannot demolish or significantly change a building.</P>
    <P>We often talk about our scenery, waterways, parks and national historical monuments.  I was concerned when the Minister said that under section 11 the Heritage Council would be available to give assistance, financial or otherwise, to persons or groups.  I wonder what the Minister means by using the word &ldquo;groups&rdquo;.  Do groups include local authorities? It is important that local authorities have a role in this area.  I was a member of the old Dublin County Council in the 1980s when it acquired Malahide Castle, Newbridge House and Ardgillen <Col N="2319" /> Castle.  The council did an excellent job refurbishing and launching them as tourist attractions in the Dublin region.  That happened in the 1980s when the council was flush with money but I fear that in the 1990s, local authorities may not be in a position to continue that good work. I would like to see co-ordination and consultation with local authorities.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the word &ldquo;groups&rdquo; excludes local authorities.  When a building comes into local authority hands and because of a lack of money cannot be preserved, I hope we will find a way through the Heritage Council to preserve such a historical monument in case it would be subjected to vandalism and lost to the community.  I am concerned about that because it has happened.</P>
    <P>As regards access to a national monument, we all know that the local authority and the Office of Public Works have worked hand in hand in this area.  We should not only preserve our national monuments, but also the amenities in the surrounding areas.  Local authorities develop linear parkways which provide the only access to national monuments. It is important that the built environment complements the old environment. There may be a vacuum, but we cannot work in isolation.</P>
    <P>As regards the maintenance of public rights of way, this was discussed in relation to public liability insurance.  Has access through land to get to a building been considered in the new legislation because it is important?  The council of which I am a member will reopen Rathfarnham Castle in the next few weeks.  There was consultation with local people in relation to parks in the area and with the Office of Public Works in relation to the building.  However, there was a lot of looseness in how we got that together.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Heritage Council is in a position to link up with local authorities and local people who often know more about our heritage than the professionals because they have spoken to older people in the area.  The Heritage Council should carry out research in areas where there <Col N="2320" /> are relics of the past and involve local people as much as possible in the preservation of our heritage.  Educational institutions should also be involved, particularly when we talk about how best to promote interest, although there is a great deal of awareness.  Schools should be used and young people should take on projects to highlight our heritage in each locality.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the word &ldquo;group&rdquo;, which I hope includes local authorities. The co-ordination and consultation process between the Heritage Council and other bodies should be tidied up.  We must consider access to rights of way and public liability.  We must also be aware that the built environment must be part of the old environment, its protection as well as that of amenities in the area, which would involve the Wildlife Advisory Council, is important.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the composition of the council.  He said there would be a gender balance.  However, I do not really promote a gender balance; it is important to appoint knowledgeable people and if the balance is right, I compliment the Minister.  However, I worry about providing for a gender balance because we all contribute.  I am delighted that there is a gender balance in the House today.  Again, I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to follow that splendid contribution by Senator Ormonde, although the provision for a gender balance does not cause me as much concern as it does her.  I warmly welcome this Bill.  It is splendid that the Heritage Council is to become a statutory body and transferred to the Minister's Department.  I pay tribute to all those over the past ten years who worked in the Heritage Council in a voluntary capacity and who have given great service to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to see advertisements for an architectural historian, an archaeologist and an environmental historian in the Minister's Department because they are badly needed.  People were probably there in another capacity, <Col N="2321" /> but not specifically employed in these areas.  I am not sure what the relationship will be between the Heritage Council and the Office of Public Works.  While the Office of Public Works has done splendid work in some cases, it has not been quite as desirable in others.  I hope the Office of Public Works will be able to avail of advice from the Heritage Council and that there will be a symbiotic relationship between the two.  The Office of Public Works could do with help in influencing its decisions in relation to interpretative centres.  I believe progress will be made in these areas.</P>
    <P>I hope the aims of the Heritage Council will not be too upmarket.  An enormous amount of our heritage is not grandiose, but is well worth preserving, for example, small farm houses.  It is fascinating to see the relic of a farm house behind a new bungalow, but it is not for me to say that I would not prefer to live in the new house.  However, it is a great pity that more effort has not been put into the restoration of ordinary Irish farm houses rather than encouraging people to build new bungalows in front of them as some of them were very attractive.</P>
    <P>A greater effort could also have been made in the modernisation of farm yards. While I appreciate the difficulty an effort could have been made to preserve cobblestone farm yards and old buildings which perhaps could be easily converted to more modern uses.  The National Heritage Council should look after these areas too.  I wish it luck in the area of demolition. I do not know how they will monitor that.  One day one sees a perfect building which the next day is a heap of rubble.  I would welcome any effort to stop this.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be co-operation with the Northern Ireland heritage council. The restoration of the Erne Shannon canal has shown what can be done and it is important to have as many cross border communications as possible.  The Northern Ireland Heritage Council did extraordinarily well in preserving heritage in Northern Ireland.  This morning I urged Senators to visit the North but perhaps <Col N="2322" /> the heritage council could also make a few trips there.</P>
    <P>Wildlife conservation is extremely serious.  I was very disappointed that when tourist badger baiting was raised in the Oireachtas the response was to double or treble the fine.  If there are not enough people to enforce the law, the size of the fine makes no difference.</P>
    <P>This is a serious area which the heritage council should examine.  I am sure I am no more deeply ashamed than the Members of the House at the blatant cruelty to animals on an apparently fairly well organised basis.  I know that 99 per cent of the people would not tolerate this type of activity.  Preservation of wildlife is essential.  I have not for instance heard the corncrake for years.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the National Heritage Council trying to enforce existing legislation and giving tremendous encouragement in all those areas.  Farmers are willing to help in the preservation of our flora and fauna but it can cost money and if they need financial assistance in preservation, they should get it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Like my colleague Senator Ormonde, I compliment him on introducing this Bill so soon after the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill as it gives us an idea of what is happening in the Department and how the Bills are linked. I know the Minister has other Bills in the pipeline and I hope they too will forward the policies.</P>
      <P>Bunaíodh an Chomhairle Oidhreachta atá againn faoi láthair in 1988.  Tá anchuid oibre déanta acu ó shin ó thaobh na seandálaíochta, na haltachta, an dúlra agus réimsí eile den oidhreacht leis. Deineadh cuid den obair sin go ciúin gan morán bolscaireachta tugtha di ach trí choistí, plé agus deontais a chur ar fáil tá an Chomhairle tar éis a lán a dhéanamh &mdash; mar atá soiléir ón Tuairisc Bhliantúil a chuireann siad amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This annual report answers some of the queries raised by Senators.  For example, in 1990-1991, £25,000 was given to the Irish wild bird conservatory to assist in the acquisition of land for a mature <Col N="2323" /> reserve for corncrakes and other wildlife at Bullock Island, County Offaly.  Several county councils have been assisted including Louth County Council and Sligo County Council.</P>
    <P>I thank the heritage council for its assistance to projects in my area including the Plunkett Heritage Co-Op in Drumcollogher, County Limerick.  This was one of the first creameries built in Ireland.  It was given £15,000 to help its restoration.  The GPA Foynes Aviation and Maritime Museum Ltd. which commemorates the flying boats which came into Foynes and pioneered the Irish aviation industry also got about £10,000.</P>
    <P>St. Mary's Cathedral in Limerick received an important contribution towards the cost of work on the structure of the building.  The cathedral was originally Roman Catholic and is now used by the Church of Ireland.  It is very much part of old Limerick and is worth preserving.</P>
    <P>I also noticed in the 1991 report that money was also allocated to what would be regarded as more modest buildings for instance to repair a dovecote in County Longford, to thatch a house in County Wexford and another house in County Kerry.  It is great that aspects of our physical heritage, both large and small, have been considered by the heritage council. I hope this will go from strength to strength in the future.  The budget will be increased this year and a further increase is planned in the future.  As the money comes largely from the national lottery, it is only right that money freely given by the public should be used for the preservation of public buildings.</P>
    <P>Ach ba léir go mbeadh fadhbanna ag an gComhairle toisc nach rabhadar ar bhonn reachtúil.  Bunaíodh an Chomhairle chun moltaí a chur ar fáil don Rialtas agus do na Rannóga Stáit go léir ionas go dtuigfeadh gach éinne níos fearr cad iad na dualgais a bhí ann ó thaobh na hoidhreachta de, agus go mbeadh tuiscint níos fearr ann céard iad na rudaí dearfa a d'fhéadfadh an Stát a dhéanamh chun chur leis an Oidhreacht fisiciúil agus chun daoine a oiliúint níos fearr agus a spreagadh <Col N="2324" /> chun an oidhreacht a chosaint agus a n-eolas féin a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Training people to recognise the importance of preserving our heritage is an important aspect of the National Heritage Council.  The money given to the discovery programme is a vital component of the work of the heritage council.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;heritage building&rdquo; refers to buildings which have a local or national context.  Would it be possible to include buildings with a European or international connection, for example, the birth places of people who became famous outside this country, places which may not have local importance but may be of interest to foreign visitors?</P>
    <P>The Minister has put a threshold of 50 years on heritage objects.  The definition includes books and I imagine some books worth preserving are less than 50 years old.  The first edition copies of works of some of our poets or playwrights are potentially important aspects of our heritage. The threshold is very limiting.  It is difficult to decide on a threshold but 50 years is a little too long.</P>
    <P>Does the definition of a public authority include a subgroup or subcommittee of the public authority?  Could it also refer to a combined group of public bodies?  For example, if Limerick Corporation, Limerick County Council and Shannon Development got together to set up a body, would it be covered by this legislation as are the individual bodies?</P>
    <P>Why is there such a prohibition in Part II on the council owning land and property? In section 12 there is provision for the council to house objects.  It will be difficult for the council to house permanently any object if it cannot own the house in which the object is to be housed. Is there a legal requirement involved there?  I was hoping that section 6 would also include research and preservation. With regard to section 71 am concerned about the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Subsection (1) states that &ldquo;The Council may make recommendations to the Minister ...&rdquo; and subsection (2) states that &ldquo;The Minister shall respond ...&rdquo;.  I realise it is a safeguard that the Minister should <Col N="2325" /> respond to the council, but I do not know why the council should not have to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 9, has the Minister any intention to put a time limit on how long resolutions should remain before the Oireachtas before being passed?  Under section 10 I would like to see the role of the Heritage Council being expanded in relation to buildings not owned by public authorities and private property, although I realise there may be constitutional difficulties associated with that.  I would also like to see section 10 expanded to include heritage objects &mdash; parks and gardens, for example, are defined as heritage objects.  It would be important that if any public park was owned by a public body it would be required of that public body to preserve that park as well as any buildings therein.</P>
    <P>I am glad that section is being introduced because our local authorities and State bodies are not the worst offenders. That title goes to the semi-State bodies and, in particular, CIE or Iarnród Éireann.  The most beautiful stone bridges and buildings have been allowed to collapse.  There is an example of this in my home town of Newcastlewest; a most beautiful stone station house was left to decay and is now only a ruin.  When I came to live in the town 20 years ago it was a magnificent building that could have been used for any number of purposes. Not only was the semi-State body in question negligent in not maintaining the building, it was pig headed in not allowing anybody else to look after it. There were people interested in taking over this beautiful building to keep it but for some bureaucratic reason it fell into ruin.  If the Heritage Council can prevent such neglect from happening again it will be a marvellous achievement.</P>
    <P>Why, under section 15, are people who are unfortunate enough to be declared bankrupt barred from taking part in public life?</P>

      <P>Once bitten, twice shy. Would section 18 also refer to the presidency? Would anybody nominated for election to the presidency have to decline membership of the Heritage Council? Section 19 is not as strong as section 17, under which members of the council are asked to divulge any commercial interests they might have.  The same requirement is not expected of the employees of the council.  It is as important that an employee of a public body be as constrained as any member on the board.</P>
      <P>My final nit-pick is in the Schedule. Unlike my colleague Senator Ormonde, I think that gender balance is important. There are as many qualified women as men.  Sometimes it does not appear to people that they must appoint women. There should also be an attempt at regional balance; an attempt should be made to ensure that people from as many areas and walks of life as possible are included on the board.</P>
      <P>Our heritage is what we inherit from our parents and our grandparents and we must make sure it is preserved for the generations to come.  Tuigimid ar fad cé chomh tábhachtach is atá ar n-oidhreacht i gcomhthéacs náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta. Tá sé seo fíor-thábhachtach ó thaobh cúrsaí eacnamaíochta agus turasóireachta de.  Sa chómhthéacs Eorpach tá seoda againn agus tá dúlra againn atá fíor-saibhir nár tháinig faoi na brúnna chéanna atá soiléir sa mhéid sin den Eorap.  We have things which nobody else in Europe has and for our self respect and the self respect we pass on to the following generation we must do our utmost to preserve them.  Muna dtugfaimid aire cheart dóibh ní bheidh a leithéid ann arís.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire inniu agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille atá os ár gcomhair inniu.  I apologise to the Minister in advance that my treatment of this legislation is somewhat superficial as I have been in permanent residence in the House on other Bills over the past two weeks.  The enthusiasm of us all in respect of legislation is waning at this stage.  I am tempted to oppose the legislation for one simple reason &mdash; it <Col N="2327" /> would be interesting to see who surfaced if a vote was to be called this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the Minister take that as an indication of my opposition to the Bill I assure him it is not.  I welcome the Bill in broad terms.  There are some amendments which I hope to propose on Committee Stage; some of them would relate to aspects raised by Senator Kelly and I hope she will support the amendments when they are voted on.</P>
      <P>I do not expect that the Minister would have been familiar with some of the legislation the House has dealt with in the past fortnight, particularly the An Bord Bia Bill in which he might not have had any interest.  There are aspects of this Bill which are in some ways related to An Bord Bia in the sense of compartmentalisation and &ldquo;moving the furniture about&rdquo;, and taking areas of responsibility from one body and giving them to another.  One wonders to what effect that is being done.  Having said that, I accept fully the reason for having the Heritage Council on a statutory footing, but I wonder a little about the wildlife and some other provisions.</P>
      <P>This Government has a Department for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht but it is likely that this departmental arrangement will not continue in other Governments.  The problem of which Department, or which part of it, is responsible for what again arises.  This is a live issue, particularly in the wildlife aspects of the Bill.  I am prepared to accept that wildlife is part of our heritage but I foresee some difficulties in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several references were made to the work done by the Heritage Council.  I support those remarks and there is no need to go into them in detail.  However, one issue which arises is the cataloguing of our heritage and what constitutes heritage. I take to heart the Minister's remarks about the definition becoming <Col N="2328" /> devalued.  We are rapidly reaching the point where almost anything qualifies as heritage.  This is regrettable because it has a narrower focus.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in his reply the Minister could refer to items which he regards as part of our heritage.  There is a comprehensive catalogue of what would be regarded as heritage in the early parts of the Bill but, nevertheless, I have a difficulty.  It has reached the point in some areas that if a community opens a heritage centre, what is in the centre is regarded as part of our heritage.  This is not always the case.  I am hesitant to enter the area of interpretative centres because it is not part of the focus of the Bill and given the presence of Senator Daly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks made by Senator Ormonde in relation to public liability insurance.  This issue has been discussed on several occasions in the Seanad, particularly in respect of the national monuments legislation.  The example was given of people entering national monuments across private property who fall and break a leg, with a consequential claim on a landowner who is not the actual owner of the monument. It is a serious area and it is rapidly reaching the point where some landowners would seriously consider closing their property to access.  There are provisions in the national monuments legislation which make it possible to ensure access is accorded.  However, the circumstances at present, where people are going across private property to enter a public monument, need to be addressed because it is causing concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of built heritage, I am most envious of the record of Dublin's local <Col N="2329" /> authority regarding some of the buildings of national and international significance. However, one particular building in County Kildare, Carton House, is of major international significance.  As a local authority in County Kildare, we were confronted with a situation where a private developer wanted to establish a hotel and put in golf courses.  There were concerns about the house and particularly about the integrity of the landscape, which is parkland associated with a large house.</P>
    <P>The members of the local authority were confronted with a very difficult decision.  Should we allow a development which will keep the house and parkland intact to the extent possible or do we say no, in the knowledge that in doing so it is possible that the private resources available to maintain the house may be insufficient?  That is a difficult decision for a local authority and its members.  It is my dearest wish to see Carton House acquired by the State.  I realise it would require much money to do so but it should be done.  It comes back to the point about access.  Given its significance, it is most important that it is accessible.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister's point that this is not just for tourism.  This is our heritage and our people should have access <i>a priori</i> to it, although we derive tourism benefits from its accessibility.  In some eyes, it may not be a desirable part of our heritage, given the circumstances which surrounded its construction, but it exists and is an immense national resource.  The Minister is aware of the work done in Castletown.  He was there when Castletown was handed over and Carton House is of an much significance as Castletown. It should be available to the public in a development similar to that in Glenveagh. I regard this as a superb development, where the house and gardens were preserved and where there is also a so-called interpretative centre which is highly successful in this case.</P>
    <P>We need to have regard to the difficult area of houses in private ownership &mdash; with which this Bill cannot adequately deal although there is other legislation &mdash; where people, for example, in a Georgian <Col N="2330" /> square in Dublin, which is again something of immense international value, allow such houses to fall into decay for whatever reason.  What effective measures can be taken to ensure the integrity of the square and the buildings and to ensure that they are preserved for posterity?</P>
    <P>The area of waterways has huge potential. I have travelled on some waterways in Ireland and France.  Several waterways in France closed but reopened for tourism traffic.  I welcome the linkage of the Shannon to the Erne.  The allocation of resources to this area is highly important. There is one slight omission in the Bill, which relates to some of the matters raised by Senator Kelly about definitions. There is a weir on my property and several weirs on the River Liffey, which were put there around the turn of the century. Most have fallen into ruin or have been breached to the extent that they have been virtually washed away.  However, they are part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>In terms of restoring the weirs on the River Liffey, there is such a degree of hassle between the local authority, the ESB and the fisheries board that even where a landowner wishes to participate in the restoration of a particular piece of architecture, one reaches the point where one is dealing with so many agencies, none of which will take any responsibility for the matter, that one simply throws one's hands up in despair.  Under inland waterways, the question will arise on Committee Stage of the Bill as to whether it would be desirable to include weirs. The definition of inland waterways mentions navigable waterways and canals and I submit that some weirs on rivers are equally important, including weirs on the River Barrow.</P>
    <P>The weirs are breached because they present an obstacle to canoeists, although it is not my intention to accuse canoeists of putting holes in weirs.  However, people put holes in weirs to ensure that they are washed away and do not become an impediment for canoeists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry made a point about farmhouses, farmyards and cobblestones.  As one who lives in a small pile, although I do not know if it Georgian, Victorian or Edwardian, there is significant expense involved in maintaining a property, even a traditional farmhouse.  This is one of the reasons people moved to small bungalows, apart from the comfort involved.</P>
      <P>Regarding the maintenance of old farmyards, etc., I agree that some of those things are part of our heritage. Modern farming practices made it almost impossible to continue with the buildings that existed.  The fundamental point is that farmers are increasingly asked to be the custodians of a heritage, landscape and environment.  There is a cost to society and to the farmer in being custodians. Society will soon be confronted with the question of paying the custodian. One need only look at the Lake District in England where farms must be maintained in a particular way and where State assistance is given for that.  We must ask ourselves if society or the farmer should pay.  I do not know who should be responsible but it is a question that will become more important in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain areas where the Heritage Council could have more teeth.  I welcome the provisions in section 10. However, they also relate to the point about the citizen who has something of major significance and what controls can be exercised in that context.  It may be suggested that it is covered under section 11 by providing for co-operation and assistance to an individual or group. However, this must be addressed.  Under section 12 the council may accept a gift and under section 11 assistance can be provided to individuals.  Can that assistance <Col N="2332" /> be of a financial nature and, if so, what type of assistance is envisaged?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions regarding gender balance.  I welcome the Bill and hope it is passed speedily by the House. We will look at it in detail on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Contrary to popular misconception I am a conservationist.  I worked for a conservation authority for almost 20 years.  It is possible to conserve and protect our heritage on the one hand and to pursue development on the other. One example is the magnificent treasure of Dublin Castle.  There the professionalism of our architects, planners, engineering technicians and workers achieved a result that is the talk of heritage professionals throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The work in Dublin Castle achieved a balance between restoration and new development and is an example of how the two can be blended together.  I have no difficulty with the development of interpretative centres provided they are constructed in a careful and balanced way.  That has been done in most cases.  If one looks at the Céide Fields or Dunquin one can see evidence of the ability of our professional services to do such work.</P>
      <P>While the Bill is welcome I would have preferred the Bill which was introduced in 1982.  It would have been more effective and comprehensive than this Bill. Under this Bill there might be fragmentation and duplication of some services. The council proposed by the Minister is far too large.  I would prefer a board of nine or ten members to be given a firm mandate.  I cite, for example, the board of the RTE Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fragmentation and the establishment of various committees with members from outside the council is a recipe for disagreements.  There have been too many disagreements in this area in the past.  Such fragmentation is caused by the prevailing political reality.  We must face the political reality of the day and in this case it is that two Government Departments are responsible for an important area of our national heritage.  The sooner <Col N="2333" /> that is remedied the better.  One Government Department should be responsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the esteem in which I hold him.  I respect his ability and his determination.  This legislation is an example of his ability to tackle and resolve difficult problems.  However, dividing responsibilities between two Ministries in an important area such as national heritage is a mistake and should be remedied at the first available opportunity. Heritage should be dealt with by one Government Department and Minister and there is no better Minister than Deputy Higgins.  Until that is done we will have confusion.  We will also have similar situations to those that occurred in other agencies whereby different organisations have been drawn together for a time and are changed within a few years.  That is bad for those working in the heritage sector and for the hundreds of people who are keenly interested in and aware of the importance of our heritage.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise the important work being done by the Discovery programme and by Professor George Eogan.  I compliment him, and his staff, on their work. As I said on previous occasions, they have done outstanding work and must be given every support to continue it.  I am sure that will be the case under the new arrangements.  I also compliment the Discovery programme on the excellent publication it produced about its work which is recognised nationally and internationally as being of major significance. Its initiatives offer an example for other countries in the European Union.</P>
    <P>I also wish to voice our appreciation of the Heritage Council.  Unfortunately, it was unfairly treated at times as a result of statements purporting to come from the council but issued by the chairman. The views on the Heritage Council were misrepresented on one issue &mdash; I will not go into that now.  I hope such a situation will not arise in the new statutory body.</P>
    <P>I hope more reports will be issued by the new statutory body.  The Minister proposes that such a report be sent to him, as is probably the case with other agencies which are his responsibility. <Col N="2334" /> However, there should be more publications on the work being done in this area.  They should be freely available and circulated to schools and other educational institutions.  There is much interest in this area but a lack of publications similar to those issued by the Discovery programme. I compliment the Office of Public Works on some of its publications. A number of matters need to be carefully recorded and documented in publications written in clear language that can be understood by the general public.  They should be circulated widely to give the public a better understanding of this work.</P>
    <P>Archaeology is significant in every parish in Ireland.  I draw the Minister's attention to the new farm environmental improvement scheme which has been sanctioned by Europe.  The availability of funding under that scheme for modernising farms will cause major damage to be done to ring forts, where some destruction has already taken place.  That is a real risk unless great caution is taken. Sometimes the damage was caused because people were not aware of the significance of the sites on their farms. The Minister should have some input into that scheme to ensure the Structural Funds are not used to destroy our national heritage.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry said that many big houses, castles and abbeys take up much of our time and attention.  As she rightly said, however, there are important buildings in almost every parish that should be conserved, protected and assisted.  How will the funding be operated?  Will the new council work like the grant schemes operated by the old heritage council?  Can the Minister assure us further funding will be available?</P>
    <P>This is an area where there is great demand.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill indicates increased funding for the new council but if this is a reallocation of funding already being spent by a different Government Department, that is not an increase in funding.  Substantially increased funding should be made available to the new council to undertake supporting projects by community groups <Col N="2335" /> and other bodies in the heritage area so they can carry out the work they have identified as necessary.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Kelly, I do not understand why the council is being prevented from owning or acquiring buildings or land.  If the owner of an important heritage building did not have the finance required to undertake work on it and wanted to hand the property over to the new Heritage Council, this provision seems to prevent the council from accepting the gift.  The provision states the council can accept gifts other than land or buildings.  I would have thought it should be allowed to inherit such property but that other gifts might be questionable. However, the Minister undoubtedly has a reason for doing this.</P>
    <P>Any legislation in this area is desirable. It is a mistake to have two different Departments dealing with such an important area.  If the effort is fragmented and diluted in big boards and committees the impact will be lost and it is a recipe for disagreement, which should be avoided.  The legislation will be successful.  There are some provisions I will query on Committee Stage but I wish the Minister well in this work and I hope he presses ahead with his initiatives. I do not fully agree with all his moves but we cannot fault his energy and innovation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is welcome again to the House.  He was here last week and every time he comes we have a good debate.  The legislation is uncontentious and is a welcome development in so far as it provides the Heritage Council with statutory teeth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has some shortcomings &mdash;&mdash; for instance the council cannot acquire land and buildings, as Senator Daly said. Public authorities should be able to acquire many of our old buildings which cannot be easily maintained by private owners.  It is a source of worry that some of these buildings might disintegrate and disappear entirely.  There may be adequate provision for other authorities to acquire the buildings so the Heritage <Col N="2336" /> Council may not have to become involved in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that heritage is mainly seen as something which attracts tourists.  As I said to him before, areas not seen as important tourist centres, such as the area where I live, tend to be left out when money is spent and efforts made to protect and conserve our heritage.  On the last occasion the Minister was here, I mentioned Maghernacloy Castle, not far from Carrickmacross, which is a fortified dwelling rather than a castle in the ordinary sense of the word.  The current building dates back to the 16th century but its history dates back to the middle ages.  That building is about to disintegrate.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the town all that remains of Manaan Castle, which dates back to the 4th century, is the site where it stood.  There is nothing on the site except a plaque stating that it once existed at that spot.  I am worried that the same will happen to Maghernacloy Castle &mdash; a plaque will say that a building with a wonderful history used to exist but now one must use one's imagination to see what it was like.</P>
    <P>I had a private discussion with the Minister and I gave him some notes about Maghernacloy Castle.  He is taking a personal interest in the subject.  The castle is privately owned at present and in order for preservation work to be done it will have to be taken into public ownership. Perhaps the local authority in co-operation with the Office of Public Works and the Heritage Council can play a valuable role here.</P>
    <P>There is no reason Maghernacloy Castle cannot continue to be a family residence, as it was in continuous use for that purpose from the 16th century up to eight years ago.  Now the floors are caving in and the building is a target for people stealing fixtures until the site becomes gradually denuded.  I hope the Minister's interest in the issue and his efforts will mean the local authority, the Office of Public Works and everyone involved will act or at least prepare a definitive report for the future of the building.  It should be knocked to the ground or preserved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2337" /> I have talked about this building for seven years.  I started discussing it in 1985 when I was elected to Monaghan County Council.  I have raised this issue at every opportunity at county council level and in the Houses of the Oireachtas and I will continue to do so until something is done. It is a dangerous building and the people who own it are terrified that someone will enter it, injure themselves and make a claim against them.  An Taisce, in co-operation with Monaghan County Council, has visited the site on a number of occasions and is writing a report which I await with interest.</P>
    <P>Many old buildings and sites throughout the country not only need to be listed &mdash; it is not difficult to list sites &mdash; but also to be carefully managed and controlled. The important ones should be taken into public ownership.  Surely the work in the Shannon region was done because it is an important centre for tourism?  Important aspects of our heritage in many areas were not treated in the same way and did not receive the same type of investment. The connection between heritage and tourism, which the Minister mentioned, is valid and has been the <i>modus operandi</i> to date.  I hope it can be broken.</P>
    <P>Many people are making great efforts in this area.  There are a plethora of tidy towns and villages committees and historical groups throughout the country which disseminate knowledge about the history of various areas and make strenuous efforts to ensure that our habitats are better places.  The time is right for a national effort to deal with the protection and conservation of our heritage, but there must be a substantial investment of public funds in the form of grants.  Many people, who have a listed building on their property, have asked me if grants are available to enable them to repair its roof or to ensure it does not collapse. Until recently, I had to tell them that no such grants were available and that if they wanted to repair these buildings, they would have to do so themselves.  If these buildings are important enough to be listed, and if the investment required to protect them is outside the owner's scope, then some assistance should be <Col N="2338" /> provided by the new Heritage Council or by some other means.  This is a problem of which I am sure the Minister is aware. If the Minister had £50 million tomorrow, he would have no difficulty spending it throughout the country and more would be needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I could spend that amount in County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  There is a great need for investment.</P>
      <P>The grant available to the Heritage Council will be approximately £2.5 million in 1995 and the same in 1996.  If that is the total amount of money at its disposal for all its functions, it is derisory. Perhaps that is not the case as further funding may be made available to it. Surely £2.5 million will not be needed for administrative purposes?  If that is the total amount of money available, there will not be enough for everything, particularly if it is spread across the areas of need.  The Heritage Council's functions under section 11 will be to co-operate with and give assistance to persons or groups on matters relating to its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is right to make a great effort in the conservation of our heritage.  I mentioned tidy towns and villages committees, historical societies and such groups which are working hard in this area.  For example, in Inniskeen, County Monaghan, the Patrick Kavanagh interpretative centre was recently opened by the President.  The effort to provide that centre has brought that little community alive.  The village has now taken on a new life.  The people have also developed a pitch and putt course beside the River Fane and they will continue to do great things.  The community has come alive because it decided, with grant aid from the International Fund for Ireland, to carry out a certain project, which was successful.  It will now go from strength to strength.  If little communities, such as the one in Inniskeen, were given some assistance, they would also come alive and make the place a better one for themselves <Col N="2339" /> and any visitors who might choose to visit the area.</P>
    <P>A house beside where I live is like a museum.  The individual responsible for establishing it died a few years ago, but his wife continues to protect it.  There are horse drawn implements in the garden which were once used to cultivate the land and to control weeds, etc.  In the hallway there is a plethora of old pots and pans and instruments which were used in the kitchen and old lamps in the sitting room.  These items are a long term investment by this family because they love and cherish them.  They are not open to the public, although they may view them if they visit the house.</P>
    <P>During the summer there are field days throughout rural Ireland when old machinery is available for the public to look at.  I have attended some of these gatherings and they are popular because people love to look at things from long ago, particularly old machinery, tractors and threshing-machinery which were once used.  The people are preserving these for the enjoyment of others now and in the future.</P>
    <P>I hope the Heritage Council provides cohesion for the national effort.  I hope when this Bill is passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas that the efforts of the Heritage Council will pay rich dividends to the people.  We have a lot to be proud of, although we have a shortage of old buildings in relation to other countries. Those who travel to England and other European countries are struck by the diversity of old buildings and sites, which we do not have for historic and other reasons.  We should protect what we have because something which is now 100 years old will, in 400 years time, be 500 years old.  Things which we do not value now will be interesting and valuable to people in the future, if they are protected and passed on.  I commend the Minister's efforts in producing this Bill and the efforts he is making in his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is very timely and I welcome it.  It was initiated in the Seanad which is important.  I wish to <Col N="2340" /> make some observations on the situation in my own area and how that relates to the proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>Valuable work is being done through the national monuments committee of my local authority, Cork County Council, in identifying and restoring national monuments.  I wonder how the repeal of section 4 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act of 1987 under this legislation will affect that development and also how the repeal of section 13 of the Wildlife Act of 1976 will affect the work of the wildlife service in my area of north Cork.  This work is very evident in the Doneraile or the Kilcoleman area which was taken over by the State recently.  Spenser's Castle, the home of Spenser, the author of the <i>Fairie Queene</i> and many other great works stands in north Cork.  People come to the area from all over the world.  There is access to the castle solely because farmers in the locality know how important it is and do not object to people crossing their land. That factor must be taken on board.</P>
      <P>It is very important that this legislation helps to co-ordinate the combined efforts of the various bodies.  Section 6 of the Bill sets out the functions of the council and section 11 has been referred to frequently by Members here today.  The great thing that can be said about the Irish people is that we have recognised where our heritage lies and the great potential there is for its development.  I give as an example the Cobh heritage centre.  It is the only one I will mention. This is a massive development with a fairly substantial input by Cork County Council but there are signs of financial problems arising for those who promote the project.  It will be difficult for them to continue at their current level.  That must be provided for.  If something for which there is enthusiastic support is developed, if financial support is forthcoming, we must be sure that it can be sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and will be interested in seeing it through the other Stages.  I have every confidence that the Minister will see it through and that whatever is enacted by way of legislation will <Col N="2341" /> relate to the position on the ground. There is no point continuing with development unless it has that relevance because there is a great opportunity now to boost the economy of each local area, socially and otherwise by the development of our natural heritage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank sincerely all Senators for their contributions. Tá mé thar a bheith buíoch do na Seanadoirí as ucht an bealach a d'fháiltigh siad roimh an mBille seo agus, go h-áirithe, an bealach cuirtéiseach, cúramach a chuireadh chuige sin.  I am very impressed, I say this with sincerity, with the depth of attention which this legislation has received, as indeed has related legislation such as the national monuments legislation.  The Seanad has given careful courteous and valuable attention to aspects of the Bill and I am very appreciative of this approach.</P>
      <P>The Seanad is one of those assemblies where it is particularly appropriate that legislation like this would be given detailed consideration.  It is very clear that no matter what reservations Senators may have had about the subject matter or the details of this Bill, there is a genuine and general concern in the House for the protection of our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold what may seem at times to be an ironic view about Ireland, its heritage and the State.  In many ways those who are opposed to the State in many different areas would like to hand over to the State the bother of caring for everything of little value or benefit.  When we talk about our heritage, it is just that, our heritage.  The State has a role, as have local authorities, voluntary bodies and individuals.  We cannot regard the State as running the national attic while we get on with the business of living contemporaneously in the world, handing over every ring fort and artefact we find, assuming that the State will look after them.  What we mean by the State are taxpayers other than ourselves.  I say that with good humour because every now and again I have to remind myself of the <Col N="2342" /> earthiness that is necessary in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>There will be State responsibility and that State responsibility &mdash; apart from the provision &mdash; comes from effective and meaningful structures.  We have to get the structures right.  This is what I am trying to do in the area of heritage.  I will then move on from the heritage area to deal with commercial institutions.  That is why I am promising legislation to deal with libraries and museums.  Then we will have a comprehensive floor of legislation in place.  In order to do this properly we need to get the funding and the budgets that are necessary.</P>
    <P>As I said in my introductory speech, the setting up of the heritage council as a statutory corporation must be viewed in the context of the overall strategy in setting up the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  This strategy is one of centralising policy formulation while decentralising so far as possible the implementation process.  It is a philosophy that I have described as autonomy with responsibility.  I want to make policy provision, make the case for funding, identify what is needed and at the same time respect the statutory distance, the autonomy, the expertise of the bodies involved.  One could take an extreme view of either.  A Minister could centralise everything and continue to interfere in detail or alternatively an autonomous body could act as if it was so autonomous that it did not ever need to refer to anybody.</P>
    <P>I have struck a balance which I call autonomy with responsibility.  I am responsible for a cultural policy.  I have to ensure that people who are disabled will have access to buildings, that there will be gender equality, that there will be participation rather than exclusion in the arts and so forth.  Therefore the responsibility for cultural policy is mine.  I could not have a situation where in the face of democratic cultural expressions, an autonomous body decided to accept an antidemocratic or undemocratic view. That would be clearly absurd.  One must strike a balance between the principles of autonomy and responsibility.  Members <Col N="2343" /> will see that when I legislate for libraries, museums and all the cultural institutions for which I have direct or indirect responsibility.</P>
    <P>Policy formulation in the Department will be assisted by a group of corporate bodies with particular specialist membership who will, in addition to providing advice, also carry out specified executive functions outside the ambit of existing institutions, such as the National Museum and the Office of Public Works. This Bill will set up one of these bodies, the Heritage Council.  It should also be seen as part of the package of legislative measures which have been, or are in the process of being, prepared in my Department. That was the reason this House passed the important Bill to amend the National Monuments Act last week.  My Department is working on other proposals to amend the Wildlife Act and to provide new legislation for the National Museum and Library.  Legislation for parks is also forthcoming and will follow the same philosophy.</P>
    <P>With the enactment of this corpus of legislation, we will have provided a sound statutory basis for the protection of our heritage.  People may agree or disagree on its details, but there will be a statutory basis which will extend from artefact through heritage, expressed generally through institutions and executive responsibility.</P>
    <P>Many points were raised, one of which referred to the core of much of what was said in debating this legislation.  We might return to these matters within this Government's lifetime.  Responsibility for heritage policy lies with me and future policy on all these different areas is also my responsibility.  The day-to-day execution and implementation of heritage strategies, as I may decide and approve, are a matter for the Office of Public Works.  That is the status of our relationship.  If further clarification is necessary, I will be glad to give it.  Senator Daly made an interesting point in that regard.  We live in a democracy which elects representatives who form Governments who take decisions.  None of us <Col N="2344" /> has the right to frustrate the will of the people, expressed through Government programmes and to those who compose Governments.  I am responsible for future policy, including the design of an annual or multiannual programme of work.  The implementation of such programmes is a matter for the Office of Public Works and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Dempsey, is in charge of it.</P>
    <P>I thank all Senators for the manner and thoroughness in which they approached this Bill.  I will try to come back between now and Committee Stage to address any issues of interpretation or definition raised.  I have taken detailed notes of questions.  Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the question of heritage centres and how the new council can assist them.  Section 11 of the Bill allows the Heritage Council to co-operate and provide assistance to any person or group in any matter relating to the heritage.  I expect the new council to be a source of advice as well as giving financial assistance to any group who sets out to preserve any aspect of our heritage.  I will return to this important point when I look at it between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We cannot give away our responsibilities. When changing legislation on heritage, we are not creating a neutral area into which everyone can divest their responsibilities, be they individuals, local authorities or voluntary groups.  The powers I am giving the Heritage Council will strengthen local authorities and enable them to be more forthcoming in protecting our heritage.  Groups, defined even in their most general sense, can be assisted.  We are not there to help those who say that the heritage business is for the Heritage Council and do nothing. While we spoke about the most ethical people, which I am sure comprise nearly all our friends, I am aware of the odd local authority and group who do not share our enlightened view.  It is not my purpose to make their lives any easier. They will still have the same obligations, maybe more, but will also get co-operation and assistance.  We are there to <Col N="2345" /> move matters forward, not as a strategy for evasion.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn asked for clarification as to who the employees of the new council will be and if there will be continuity with the staff of the existing council.  It will, of course, be for the new council to select its own staff, subject to agreement on the terms of employment and numbers between the Minister for Finance and me.  I agree there is merit in having continuity with the existing staff. I am sure the new council will take this criterion, with others, when it comes to hiring new staff.  The question of having continuity and change at the same time will also be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde spoke about the importance of having an integrated view towards legislating in this area.  There is currently a debate on the meaning of words like &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; and &ldquo;cultural tourism&rdquo;. The Senator referred to farming practices in the Lake District.  I am subject to correction, but I think that part of England was referred to as Peter Rabbit country at one stage, which was a terrible abuse of the concept, name and intention of heritage.  There is an opening and developing debate on the meaning of heritage or oidhreacht.  With it is coming a sharply focused debate on cultural tourism. We can get economic benefits from well-managed cultural objects, settings and locations.  More than three quarters of tourists visiting our country go home having visited a significant cultural institution and surveys show this is what they want.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the support for the developed view that when we are responsible, both in our own name and for future generations and have made the story of our heritage our own, we are empowered to do these things because it makes sense for our educational purposes and we become more interesting people to visit.  There are then inevitable economic consequences by putting in the words &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; and &ldquo;tourism&rdquo;.  It is not a matter of us providing tourist facilities for quick fixes to satisfy the maximum number in the shortest space of time for the maximum benefit, but because we <Col N="2346" /> care about our heritage and are interested in sharing and knowing about it with our children.  Therefore, because of that commitment, we become interesting people to visit and there is also an economic benefit.  I detect, even in this debate, support from all sides for the broader definition &mdash; and broader policy definition and assertion &mdash; of heritage.</P>
    <P>If we operate a heritage policy within a cultural strategy that is, as we say in terms of culture, to be open rather than closed, participatory rather than exclusive and dynamic rather than static, and take these as features of a culture moving on to heritage policy, it would make no sense to define our heritage according to the tastes and practices of a narrow definition or group.  There is such a thing as vernacular architecture and sights that are important in the stories of people.</P>
    <P>There are sites which are important in the stories of people.  The stories of practically one million agricultural labourers were lost at the time of the famine of 1847.  Doubtless as we make our way from big houses to farm machinery we will come to the social artefacts which were used by those million farm labourers who died and the million who were forced to emigrate.  Their houses are buried, yet in order to recover the story of the famine their experiences must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is important that heritage be defined in this general sense, as the story of all of the people, with many classes and sometimes genders being buried and excluded in the conventional version.  The conventional version will have to give way to the more generous, interested and newer scholarship.  It is a matter to inform the thinking of the new council.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked regarding rights of way, which I understand will be dealt in the legislation on occupier's liability being prepared by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  I will return to the question of groups.  However, it is my intention to define them quite generally.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry welcomed my provisions in relation to gender.  This is the <Col N="2347" /> second piece of legislation where I have made such provisions.  The other was in respect of my reform of the broadcasting authority.  Perhaps such provisions are intimations of my transience.  Occasionally it has been suggested to me that it might be useful to have provisions in a Bill requiring legislative changes afterwards either to undo the gender equality of the RTE Authority or of the new Heritage Council.  So be it.  The point is that in this case it is not necessary to push women or men.  Distinguished people, in terms of background, training and interest will form panels from which selections will be made.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde addressed the issue of the council helping local authorities to protect buildings of architectural interest.  I addressed this matter, and I view the role of the Heritage Council as encouraging local authorities to take a greater interest in heritage matters.  I see no reason why this should not include financial assistance where this is appropriate.</P>
    <P>In my experience as Minister I have encountered significant aspects of heritage which should have been the interest of the local authority, but where attempts were made by people not to assume responsibility for them so that they could be handed to anybody other than themselves. I will not elaborate, but it raises the issue that, like the arts, culture or any such matters, if there is belief in something provision is made for it, and if provision is made for it there will have to be an impact on rates or taxes or both.</P>
    <P>Rates and taxes cannot be abolished, however, while at the same time declaring that somebody should fund the State, which in turn should fund everything regarding arts, culture and heritage. Ultimately, there is a litmus test, centred on the question of whether one is willing to take over a building with assistance and advice, and be willing to make provision for it over a period of years.  It is a question which arises because there are no bodies to which the building may be handed over.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2348" /> Given this reasoning it is time to consider seriously our notions of private property.  All private property is held with social responsibility, therefore it is not a matter of finding something and assuming there is somebody who will put a roof on it because that somebody happens to be providing a service funded by State taxation.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of working in partnership. In my heritage legislation I am inviting people to a partnership and to a concern for citizens who will be liberated by access to and knowledge of their heritage. This partnership will include the State, local authorities and other bodies. It will require new forms of co-operation. Senator Daly is correct to speak of better co-operation between people who work in public bodies than perhaps there has been to date.  If there is a fractured view we will not be able to make as much progress as possible, given the provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I agree with all comments made regarding farmyards.  In addressing the issue of what should be handled and defined as heritage, it is necessary to deal with it in a sophisticated way.  The National Heritage Council is not managing the national attic.  People will have to exercise discretion and establish priorities. This is a test of scholarship.  It is not a matter of assembling rules and so on, rather a matter of decision making.  There will never be perfect answers, but there is a scholarship which has already achieved a standard.  It can be pushed to include the groups and individuals to ensure that there will be a wide debate on heritage.</P>
    <P>Regarding contacts with the authorities in Northern Ireland, I have already made suggestions, in the contacts that I have had, on the issue of cross-Border co-operation.  I have also indicated that I will introduce legislation on the general wild life area.  I was reared on a small farm and have noticed welcome changes in attitudes towards wild life and ecology which have taken place in rural Ireland.  Perhaps we are not lashing out as much against nature as trying to co-operate <Col N="2349" /> with it, and that is the path to take.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly addressed the Bill in detail and I will examine the definitions she queried on at least six sections.  The Senator was correct, as others were, in paying tribute to the work of the outgoing Heritage Council.  She also spoke on the need for heritage education, and she spoke in Irish, which is another part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>On the issue of education, it is good that the Heritage Council will be able to provide advice and so on.  If we protect our heritage we should be able to share it with our school children so that they are in turn able to form a view.  This should not be done in a limiting way, because if they know their own story they are more likely to respect the stories of others.  In that respect, it is an encouragement towards tolerance in the best sense.</P>
    <P>A number of question were raised regarding definitions, all of which I will return to.  I could answer many of them, but it is best to leave it to Committee Stage, given that I intend, if necessary, to introduce amendments.</P>
    <P>I was moved also by Senator Kelly's remarks on semi-State and State bodies. The situation cannot be allowed whereby two-thirds of the family that is the State allows buildings to become derelict, while waiting for some other body to act as a kind of national dustbin, gathering them up.  This is not on.  Responsibility must be shouldered by State and semi-State bodies, authorities, individuals and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly cited the example of abandoned property, which had once been a place of business and a dwelling. I lived in such a property myself.  It was a house where a person was employed to open the gates.  All of these abandoned houses, small as they were, with all of the work that went into them, work which filled their kitchens and so on, were as important and human as anything which filled the libraries of other significant houses.  We do not have to choose between the history of the library and the history of the person who was in the <Col N="2350" /> signal man's house at a railway crossing. If we are democrats, both must be put into our version of culture and heritage.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis spoke of movement and change.  In a positive address, he indicated that he was in favour of many of the ideas I have already covered regarding the need to make choice, to catalogue heritage and the need for more publications.  He made a case for Carton House, which I will consider again.  He spoke of an interesting dilemma on the question of whether one should make concessions on planning to save the house and most of the parkland, or should you hold out for the purest version which may result in losing the house and create too great a burden to carry.  This is an example of where the Heritage Council, under the powers I am granting it, may be able to be of value in putting packages together which will be of assistance in dilemmas such as this.  I will give Senators' suggestions great attention between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As regards the rural environmental protection schemes, I will be talking to my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry about the concerns which many Senators raised, and which I share, about heritage and the need for environmental upgrading of farms.  If we take these different dimensions into account we can improve the quality of life generally without having to choose between priorities.  The new arrangements relate to agricultural production on what are, after all, family farms as opposed to larger units of the agri-business.  Such changes can be made in a sensitive way so as to avoid doing any damage to our heritage.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the various materials required for heritage &mdash; oats or wheat for thatching, for example &mdash; one can combine some of the changes in agriculture with meeting the material needs of strategic heritage planning, provided we have a shared and integral view of what we are doing.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly, who speaks with considerable experience in this area, mentioned the 1982 Bill.  It was a tough Bill and perhaps executively stronger than <Col N="2351" /> the current legislation, yet this legislation has struck a balance.  Between now and Committee Stage I may examine it to see if tougher provisions are required to strengthen matters.  However, I am happy that I have struck a balance.  On Committee Stage I will explain the reason for the limitation on property which is effectively confined to moveable property as opposed to permanent property.</P>
    <P>As regards the size of the Heritage Council, Ministers who would wish it to be smaller will, of course, always make the case for efficacy.  I believe I have got the figure right, and that in order to achieve what has to be done, one would need to draw from a pool of 16 people. We can return to this matter later.</P>
    <P>The danger of archaeological monuments being destroyed by farm modernisation was also mentioned by Senator Daly, and I have dealt with that question. Senator Cotter raised the question of Maghernacloy Castle, and I am having details of that fortified dwelling examined. He also spoke about sites in private ownership with which I have dealt to some extent.</P>
    <P>The debate indicates a welcome for encouraging the development of important artefacts, stories, institutional expressions and objects which precede us and which will certainly succeed us.  The intellectual sophistication of humility in time and space is involved; we are here for a while to occupy a space with a sense of responsibility and, hopefully, ethics, but doing things always means taking responsibility for their consequences. Therefore, the thrust of the legislation tries to build on a new enthusiasm that is there.</P>
    <P>Many Senators said I will have to fight for the financial provision for both staff and materials to enable everything that is described in legislation to be done. They are right about that, and other Ministers will also have to fight in the future.  However, I hope the public will respond as generously as the Members of Seanad Éireann have done to the challenges of this corpus of legislation.  It is only when we do things together at <Col N="2352" /> different public levels, both local and national, that we will be able to obtain the most significant results, not in any tired sense of conservation but a conservation that is a liberation, a source of joy and of great education, fun, complexity and unpredictability.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the further contributions of Senators on Committee Stage.</P>

I want to break all the rules myself and thank you, a Chathaoirligh, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, as well as the staff of your office and the Clerk of the Seanad and her assistant, and all my colleagues for the tremendous support during my brief time in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to make a brief advertisement for this forum, Seanad Éireann. <Col N="2353" /> The past year and a half that I spent in this House has highlighted for me the tremendous depth of understanding, knowledge, expertise and empathy emanating from all sides of the House during various debates.  Without wishing to diminish any particular area, I would like to focus on the contributions of all Senators to debates on Northern Ireland, including today's debate.  Through dialogue and by listening to different viewpoints &mdash; we have many varying viewpoints in the House &mdash; we have shown the level of understanding that can be achieved.  It is an example that, hopefully, will spread to others living on this island.</P>
    <P>The role of the Seanad and the public's perception of that role are much misunderstood by the general public but we must take some of the blame for that and there is a lack of press reporting of Seanad debates.  I do not blame individual journalists because editorial policy decides what is printed and what is excluded.  However, if editors from the print or broadcast media spent a day here listening to the range of debate and the level of expertise, they would appreciate what an important forum this is.</P>
    <P>In whatever forum I am representing people, I will always strive to remind people that this is by far the most unique and powerful forum for any kind of debate.  I would like to leave you with a wish that I always wish for myself.  It is a quote from William Butler Yeat's poem <i>The Lake Isle of Inisfree,</i> with which I am sure the Minister will empathise.</P>

      <P>I wish Senator Crowley every good wish in the European Parliament and compliment him on the way he has acquitted himself so ably and expertly in the House.  I also compliment him on the fine vote he achieved in Munster.  This is a reflection of the able, talented young man he is.  I am sure we will hear a great deal about him in the future, not just in the European Parliament but in the general political spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the issue of Aeroflot transfer rights at Shannon Airport.  With the break up of the Soviet Union a number of republics were formed.  A result of this was that Aeroflot was substantially reduced in size and other airlines were created.  Many of them are bringing people to Shannon.  Aeroflot is seeking from the Government permission to have people transfer from those airlines to Aeroflot flights to New York and Boston. <Col N="2355" /> I believe this would be in the interests of Shannon.  In effect, Shannon would be a hub for the Commonwealth of Independent States.</P>
    <P>The Minister must view this request seriously because the future of Shannon hinges substantially on how the Department handles this issue.  There is no point in the Minister closing his eyes and saying this is a matter which will seriously affect Aer Lingus.  We are talking about not pick up but transfer rights.  I understand that Aeroflot is prepared to have discussions with Aer Lingus on this issue with a view to, perhaps, forming a joint venture.</P>
    <P>I am greatly concerned about the future of Shannon Airport.  Unless this issue is sympathetically considered, the airport's future will be further hindered and more difficulties could arise.  The Minister should look at the history of Aer Lingus and the new services it has provided over the past ten years, in particular to and from Shannon.  Recently the Minister made a major announcement about a new cargo flight between Shannon, Dublin and Manchester. Unfortunately, this ceased operating last May.</P>
    <P>Let us look at Aer Lingus's proposal to sell its subsidiary, Shannon Rescue Service.  The record of Aer Lingus's commitment to Shannon is highly questionable. The Minister must question this record when considering the Aeroflot issue.  It is extremely important that he looks seriously at the future of the mid-west region, and Shannon in particular, when he decides on this issue.  It is not enough to say that the proposal could affect Aer Lingus and therefore cannot be allowed.  It could be of huge benefit to Shannon and the mid-west.  There is the potential for Shannon to be a hub for the CIS.  Providing this hub facility would create many jobs.  The Minister must decide that the future of Aer Lingus is important but of equal if not greater importance is the future of Shannon and the mid-west.</P>
    <P>I can see why the Minister may be tempted to say that Aer Lingus should be <Col N="2356" /> protected because its problem is obvious whereas the jobs which can be created in a region are not as obvious and cannot be identified as quickly or as readily.  This proposal would be beneficial not only to Shannon but also to Aer Lingus because, on the ground in Shannon, it has secured a great deal of employment by providing handling facilities for Aeroflot.  The more Aeroflot business which can be done through Shannon, the more handling facilities Aer Lingus will be able to provide and the more jobs will be secured by Aer Lingus.  This issue is not simple and the Minister must look at it from all angles.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Dáil that he will publish the report of the task force. Could he give us the date on which he proposes to publish this report?  Is it true that the task force views favourably the involvement of Aeroflot in developing Shannon as a hub for its business?  Are some of the rumours true about Aer Lingus and other semi-State bodies putting pressure on the Minister not to publish the full report because of the issues it raises about the future of Shannon?</P>
    <P>While I have the utmost respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who does a very good job, I think the Minister, Deputy Cowen, should be here to speak about this issue because in the final analysis it is he and not the Minister of State who will deal with the matter.  By sending the Minister of State here, the Minister is not taking the Shannon issue as seriously as he should and is treating it with the back of the hand as he has done in the past.  I have sympathy for the Minister for State who has come to deal with the issue which will be decided by the Minister and not him.</P>
    <P>I hope the task force report will be published and that we will be given a date for its publication because of the Aeroflot issue it raises.  The situation in Shannon is serious and its future is in the hands of the Minister.  There now exists a window of opportunity for Shannon and the mid-west region.  The Minister must seize this opportunity and decide that it is in the region's best interests to provide Aeroflot with transfer rights to New York and <Col N="2357" /> Boston.  We are not talking about picking up Irish people in Shannon to board Aeroflot flights but transferring people from CIS airlines to Aeroflot flights so that they can travel to New York and Boston. Normally Aeroflot itself flies directly to these places.  There is now an opportunity for Shannon which would result in more jobs being generated there.  The Minister has the chance to provide this opportunity for the people of Shannon and the mid-west and I ask him to do so.</P>

      <P>Traffic rights for air services between Ireland and countries outside the European Union are governed by bilateral air service agreements negotiated under the Chicago Convention of 1944.  Such agreements regulate principally the conditions for access to routes, the capacity airlines place on a route and the prices charged by airlines of both countries.</P>
      <P>Following the break up of the Soviet Union, we were one of the first countries to formally sign an air transport agreement with the Russian Federation in March 1993.  In this agreement and subsequently outside the formal agreement, we have given very generous rights to the Russian Federation at Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aeroflot Russian International Airlines (ARIA) has full fifth freedom rights at Shannon, that is, rights to pick up all <Col N="2358" /> transfer and local traffic for all points in Central and South America, Washington and Miami in the USA and Gander in Canada.  On top of this, we have, outside the agreement, given Aeroflot temporary fifth freedom rights to Chicago and Tampa in Florida at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Aeroflot recently sought wayport rights at Shannon, i.e., rights to pick up transfer traffic from points in the former USSR states to all points in the United States.  Given that Aeroflot already has all these rights to the points I mentioned earlier, what is really at stake here are rights to New York and Boston.  These two points are, of course, served by direct Aer Lingus services.</P>
    <P>Traffic rights have never been granted by our Department to third country carriers on transatlantic routes served by Irish carriers.  I should remind the House that in the aviation world, traffic rights are seen as national assets which are normally traded on the basis of reciprocity and equivalent benefits to both sides.  It would, therefore, be highly unusual not to give preference in these matters to one's own carriers.</P>
    <P>In examining the Aeroflot request, we had regard to the views of Aer Lingus on the effects on its direct services out of Shannon.  Granting rights, either full fifth freedoms or unrestricted transfer rights, to New York could have implications for the continued viability of Aer Lingus' transatlantic operations.</P>
    <P>Over the past year, we have been constantly advised by local representatives and interests of the need for a daily year round direct service out of Shannon to New York.  Following the acquisition of the new A330 aircraft, Aer Lingus responded to this need with the new service which commenced on 1 June 1994. We have already advised the Dáil that we are anxious to be as helpful to Aeroflot at Shannon as possible, but not in a way which would compromise the daily Shannon/New York service.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has advised us that existing and potential CIS transfer traffic, as well as additional traffic from other sources, is important to the ongoing commercial success of the Shannon/New York service, <Col N="2359" /> particularly in the off peak season. Aeroflot, on the other hand, claims that traffic is being lost to other destinations, for example, Warsaw, Prague and Helsinki, due to the lack of competitiveness of Aer Lingus' prices.  It claims that it could entice this traffic to Shannon if it had pick up rights.</P>
    <P>Following conflicting claims regarding the importance of CIS transfer traffic at Shannon, our Department convened a meeting of interested parties on 24 May in order to establish certain facts.  On the basis of the information provided at that meeting, the following interim &mdash; and I stress interim &mdash; decision was made by us: Aeroflot would be granted additional approval on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to operate wayport rights to all destinations, including New York, but only in respect of traffic from the Russian Federation and no fifth freedom or wayport rights for non-Russian Federation traffic would be granted to Aeroflot in respect of points served by Aer Lingus, i.e., Boston and New York, at present.</P>
    <P>Our Department has sought further information from the various parties on CIS traffic and comparative prices for such traffic.  The matter will be kept under review in the light of this information and future developments in transatlantic traffic to and from former USSR states.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to put on record the Government's appreciation of Aeroflot's contribution to Shannon Airport over the past 20 years and we hope that this partnership, which has yielded benefits to both sides, will continue to develop well into the future.  Our air links with Russia have grown from Shannon Airport being initially an important transit point to it now being an important hub linking the Russian Federation with a whole range of points in the Western hemisphere.</P>
    <P>Our Department will continue, where at all possible, to positively examine proposals regarding extra traffic opportunities at Shannon.  The importance of Aeroflot at Shannon will not be overlooked in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2360" /> In response to some of the points made by Senator Taylor-Quinn, I would not rule out the Manchester operation as yet. We are optimistic that there will be progress in that area in the near future.  The Senator can be certain that this Government is very committed to Shannon and to the development and further expansion of all the network of aviation services which can improve links to this island so that our economy can continue to grow with the support of the international traffic which is so vital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1986, the referendum on divorce was defeated for a number of reasons.  One of the reasons was that people were unsure or worried about their pension and inheritance rights and so on.  I know there have been a number of important legislative changes since then but the case I want to bring to the Minister's notice is an indication that we are not yet ready to recommend a referendum on divorce.</P>
      <P>I have been contacted by a lady, whom I will call Mary, who works as a nurse for the Southern Health Board.  She joined the widows and orphans pension scheme in 1984 when that scheme was extended to all female local authority workers.  At the time, Mary was married with five children.  However, in 1985 she and her husband separated legally and she also secured a church annulment.  Since 1987, she has tried unsuccessfully to opt out of the pension scheme.  Since the separation she has received no maintenance whatsoever from her husband and she has been solely responsible for the education and maintenance of her five children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, Mary decided to take early retirement and was informed that the following deductions would be made <Col N="2361" /> from her lump sum: a deduction of £867.67 for a temporary service and one of £6,152.24 for her widows and orphans pension scheme.  Interestingly enough, when she queried this and asked what the deductions would be if her husband had died in 1984, she was told that the amount which she would be liable for would be almost half that &mdash; approximately £3,138.</P>
    <P>Mary's children are now all over 16 years of age and will not have any benefit from the scheme in the event of their mother's death.  The final insult is that if Mary dies before her ex-husband, he will receive a pension which she has paid for despite the fact that they are legally separated, that the marriage has been annulled by the church and that this man has not supported or contributed one penny towards his wife or children since 1985.</P>
    <P>This case highlights a glaring anomaly in the pension scheme, a scheme which was only introduced two years before the last divorce referendum.  It also highlights a grave injustice and I ask him to amend the scheme without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The local government officers (widows and orphans contributory pension) scheme, 1984, which also applies to health board employees, is a statutory scheme and is in line with similar schemes operating throughout the public sector generally.  The scheme provides for the grant of a pension to the spouse and children of a deceased member or former member of the scheme.  These are the only persons who can obtain benefit under the scheme. There are no provisions whereby this entitlement may be cancelled or transferred. Neither are there any provisions whereby a person who joined the scheme may opt out of it at a later stage.</P>
      <P>The scheme was originally introduced for male officers on a non-statutory basis in 1968.  Following negotiations with staff interests, membership was extended to female officers in 1984.  Existing female pensionable officers were given an option to join the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2362" /> In the case of a person who joined the scheme in 1984 but had pensionable service with a local authority or health board prior to that date, contributions in respect of that service must be made. These contributions are made by way of deduction from the lump sum payable on retirement.</P>
    <P>If a member of the scheme separates from a spouse, the spouse is still the beneficiary for the purpose of the scheme.  However, where, at the retirement of a member of the scheme the spouse of the member is dead or is divorced under a divorce which is recognised by the State, contributions in respect of the period following the death or divorce are refundable or offset against contributions due for pensionable service before the member joined the scheme.</P>
    <P>This scheme is structured on an actuarial basis to cover certain risks and on certain assumptions, for example, life expectancy, that the payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members and that a person may not opt out of membership at a later date.  The combination of these factors ensures the operation of a relatively low contribution rate &mdash; 1.5 per cent by the member and 1.5 per cent by the employer.  Proposals to change the existing structure could have financial implications for the viability of the scheme and could lead to a higher contribution rate following an actuarial re-evaluation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above considerations, it should be noted that any proposal to amend the scheme would require the consent of the Minister for Finance who is responsible for public sector pension schemes generally.  This could not be considered in isolation and would have to be dealt with in the context of all similar schemes operating in the public sector.  I should point out that the application of this scheme in individual cases is a matter for the particular local authority or health board concerned.</P>
    <P>In deference to the excellent cases made by Senator McGennis I assure the House that I will bring the points she raised to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, who, <Col N="2363" /> due to Government business, cannot be with us this afternoon.</P>
