      <P>Before proceeding with the business of Seanad Éireann for today I wish to extend a sincere and warm welcome to Members of the French-Irish Parliamentary Friendship Group at the French Senate, led by M. Paul Loridant, chairman of the group.  On behalf of the Members of Seanad Éireann I wish them welcome and hope they have a very enjoyable visit in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately since we met last a former Member of Seanad Éireann has died, the late Willie Ryan.  I will call the Leader of the House to offer his sympathy and then one Member from each group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose a vote of sympathy on the death of our esteemed former colleague, Willie Ryan.  He was a highly respected Senator.  He was 28 years in this House &mdash; from 1961 until his retirement in August 1989.  He was a man of integrity and character who was held in the highest regard by all sides of the House.  He was dedicated to Seanad Éireann and the parliamentary process. As Government Chief Whip he was <Col N="3" /> always extremely courteous and helpful. Those who tried to overstretch the pairing arrangements will remember that he could say no politely and firmly.</P>
      <P>Proof of his ability and dedication is evidenced by the number of positions of responsibility he held in his long number of years in politics.  He represented his country as a member of the Council of Europe for seven years and was elected Vice-President of that assembly.  He was a member of Tipperary South Riding County Council for over 30 years and was elected chairman of that authority in 1985.  He was joint honorary secretary of Fianna Fáil for over ten years.  Willie Ryan served this House, the Fianna Fáil Party and his county with great distinction.</P>
      <P>It is only appropriate that this House should pass a vote of sympathy to his wife Peggy, his niece Majella and his sisters Mary and Philomena.  I ask the House to pay its respects today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the family of the late Willie Ryan.  I first met him on my first day in the Seanad in 1981.  On that day I was appointed Government Chief Whip; promotion came rather more easily then than it does now.  Willie Ryan was my opposite number on the Opposition.  As a brash and raw new Senator who had the job of being Whip, I could have made many mistakes and caused great embarrassment to the Government but Willie Ryan was always the soul of helpfulness and courtesy.  As the Leader of the House has said, he was also a Senator of great integrity.  When Willie Ryan gave his word, that was his bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Willie Ryan loved this House and made a significant contribution to its working over a long period.  Leaders came and leaders went but Willie Ryan kept on running the Fianna Fáil Group and most of the House during much of that time.  I can still almost see him sitting in the Whip's seat advising and encouraging the Leader of the day and also <Col N="4" /> vetoing matters that might not be in the best interests of the House.</P>
    <P>He was proud to be a member of Fianna Fáil; he had a great sense of Fianna Fáil and was very much associated with the best qualities of that party, especially the traditional qualities.  He served every Leader of Fianna Fáil with total loyalty and effectiveness, and very quietly.  As Senator Wright said, he also had a great love of his native County Tipperary and of the history of the area he came from.  At the time of his death, he was working on a history of his local parish.</P>
    <P>Personally, I will miss Willie Ryan most as a friend.  Over the years I was here with him, I had the opportunity to get to know him well.  I visited him shortly before he died and he was still the same Willie Ryan, with his dry sense of humour and laconic wit, his great wisdom and understanding and love of all matters political. All of us in this House will miss him.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party, I extend my sympathy to the party Willie Ryan served so well over many years and to his family, who will miss him greatly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent group, I wish to be associated with the sentiments expressed by the two previous speakers.  We worked with Willie Ryan during his period in the Seanad.  He was the Whip in the early stages of my tenure in this House.  The role of Whip, especially that of Government Whip, is always a difficult one.  I always found him to be a most gentle, tolerant and refined man.  When working with him, one's respect for him grew. Nothing annoyed or upset him more than having a Department undermine a commitment which he had honestly given to Whips from the other side of the House. Similarly, nothing gave him more pleasure than a close vote where Members of his own party had not shown up but he still won.  This gave him the moral high ground to tear strips off those people in his own quiet way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a lovely man.  I spoke to him some months back and he was still <Col N="5" /> interested in the workings of the current Seanad.  He asked how old Members were doing and how new Members were fitting in.  He never lost his interest in politics right to the end.  He was a quiet man, and loved for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I also wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy on the death of the late Willie Ryan.  Unlike the previous speakers, I did not serve in the Seanad with him but I knew and heard about him.  Being from a neighbouring county, I was familiar with his love of County Tipperary.  Although we might have opposed each other at times in Thurles and other places, as a fellow Munster person, I appreciated him and his service to this House for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I also wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy on the death of the late Willie Ryan.  As a fellow Tipperary person, I remember being introduced to him as a young girl by my uncle.  At that time, I never expected to be sitting in this House supporting a vote of sympathy on his death. My uncle always spoke of him as a man of the highest integrity and honesty.  The respect and regard in which he was held by Fianna Fáil was well deserved.  I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the Fianna Fáil Party and his wife and family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to be associated with the message of condolence to the widow and relatives of the late Willie Ryan.  I did not have the experience of working with him in the Seanad but because he was from a neighbouring county, one was wont to meet him frequently.  I always found him friendly and I have no doubt he left his mark on the Irish political scene.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my personal tribute to Willie Ryan.  I knew him very well, he was indeed a fine man. This day 12 months ago, he was in this House at the count until 2 a.m. or 3 <Col N="6" /> a.m.  This highlights the point Senator Manning made &mdash; although he was no longer a Member of this House he was still interested in what was happening.</P>
      <P>I ask the Members to stand and say a prayer.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to examine the recommendations of the Leader/ RRD report on milk suppliers in County Clare with a view to implementing them on a pilot basis in the county.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to have a study carried out on the harmful effects of salmon farming in Irish waters.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline how and when major reconstruction works will be carried out on the Kilrush to Ennis road, which is in a very bad condition and in a state of constant deterioration due to the amount of traffic.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to outline if she intends allocating sufficient funds for Scoil Éanna in Navan, County Meath, in her 1994 allocation.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to immediately grant <Col N="7" /> funding to Limerick County Council to alleviate the disastrous situation of the regional and county roads.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by all the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Taylor-Quinn's and Senator McGowan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Avant de commencer, est-ce que je peux dire que nous sommes trés honorés aujourd'hui d'accueillir des Membres du Sénat de la République Francaise?  Il y a toujours eu une grande amitié ainsi qu'une alliance entre la France et l'Irlande.  C'est quelque chose de trés important pour nous que ces Sénateurs sont parmi nous aujourd'hui.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, the Stillbirths Registration Bill, 1994, which will be initiated in the House today.  I hope it is the desire of the House to make as much progress as possible on this Bill.  I am sure each Member has constituents who are pleased that this legislation is coming before the House.  Item 29, which is on the supplementary Order Paper, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  The Adjournment will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, we are happy to progress the Stillbirths Registration Bill, 1994, as far as time will allow.  It is long overdue legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hoped the Leader of the House would anticipate me by producing a timetable and schedule of legislation for the coming session.  I do not want to be in the position six or seven weeks from now where I, Senator O'Toole, Senator Dardis and others are asking the Leader of the House for the programme of legislation.  I hope he will be able to facilitate us by giving <Col N="8" /> us time to plan in advance and letting us know what legislation it is proposed to take.</P>
    <P>It is the desire of all parties in the House to have a debate in the near future on Northern Ireland.  A great deal has happened, or has not happened, there since our historic debate before Christmas.  Many Members did not have an opportunity to speak in that debate and all would like a chance to contribute our observations on events since then.  I hope that in the spirit in which the offer is made, and also in the spirit in which debates on Northern Ireland have been held in this House, the Leader will be able to accede to that request.</P>
    <P>I also propose that the House do something to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the first meeting of Dáil Éireann.  This seems to have been overlooked by the Government, although I am not assigning any blame to it.  Perhaps the Whips could find some way this House would commemorate that event during this session.</P>
    <P>Finally, I presume the Whip would like to make time available to discuss the question of ethics and advertising as it relates to the last general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems far too subtle for a debate in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Regarding some of the changes that have taken place, I note that since the Seanad last met an extraordinary level of confusion has been created in the classrooms of Ireland with the implementation of the legislation on the establishment of three extra counties.  May I ask the Leader of the House to outline where that leaves the classrooms of Ireland in terms of education and geography? What happens car registrations?  Do people residing in these counties have a new address and have we solved half of the national question, now that we have 29 counties while there are six in the North?  Is this Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure, Senator, that you will find that information for <Col N="9" /> yourself and that the Leader of the House will not even endeavour to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the issue of participation in legislation raised by Senator Manning, for all Senators who wish to participate adequately in debates on legislation it is important that the legislative programme be made available. It is important that this matter be raised and it is regrettable that it is not in place already.  I recognise the pressure that the Leader of the House is under with respect to this matter, but we should continue to demand such a programme, together with a breakdown of the legislation the Leader of the House intends to initiate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Leader of the House has put Item 3 on the Order Paper, the Report on the National Education Convention.  The Leader will recall that I raised this issue on the final sitting day of the last session and that he gave a commitment to have a discussion on the report.  May I ask for some indication as to when he intends to deal with this matter?  A discussion on this report could perhaps be interactive in the same sense as a previous discussion on the Green Paper on education.  This was quite historic with regard to the workings of this House in that the Minister took questions in a structured and formal way. May I ask the Leader of the House to approve some similar arrangement in a discussion on this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Stillbirths Registration Bill, 1994, which will be considered by the House today.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to request the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to attend this House and explain what is to happen following the message the House received from the President that the Matrimonial Homes Bill, 1993, has been found to be repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the principle of joint ownership was accepted by all Members of this House as desirable and I cannot believe that the Government is now accepting that it has neither the expertise <Col N="10" /> nor the interest to bring forward legislation that would be found to be constitutional. This is a matter of urgency to the women of Ireland and I would like to see legislation introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning that there should have been some celebration to mark the 75th anniversary of the first meeting of the Dáil.  I am proud to be one of the women who did not let the occasion pass without acknowledging the election of the first woman to that Dáil, Countess Markiewicz.  I believe that the women in Leinster House were aware of the anniversary and celebrated it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding a matter of some urgency, a proposal by the Office of Public Works to slaughter two thirds of the Mullaghmore goats, may I ask the Leader of the House if he would cooperate in either making time available, or alternatively to convey my concern and the concern of many others to his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works?</P>
      <P>This may appear a silly matter, but these gentle animals have roamed the Burren for centuries.  The image of the Office of Public Works has already been seriously damaged in County Clare and it will be damaged beyond redemption if this unnecessary proposal is proceeded with.</P>
      <P>The reason advanced for the proposal is over grazing, which I do not accept. However, if that is the case, then what is the next step when the goats are shot? Will it be the sheep or the cattle?</P>
      <P>There is widespread concern on this issue.  I would appreciate if the Leader of the House could make time to have the matter discussed.  If not I ask him to convey my concern and the concern of many others to the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Manning that there should be a further debate on the North of Ireland.  I am sure, a Chathaoirligh, that you would agree with me that this is, for a number <Col N="11" /> of families, and especially for the McDermott family in the North of Ireland, a very sad day.  In that case a three-year-old girl witnessed the butchery of her father.  It was one of the most appalling crimes.  I place on the record of the House my strong condemnation of it and my rejection of the use of phrases such as Protestant or Unionist to justify this appalling act of barbarism.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to introduce an anti-discrimination Bills, an intention expressed in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  It is urgently required and this has been highlighted by two events today.  First, a court found that a young woman was unfairly treated, unjustly discriminated against and wrongly dismissed from her job on the basis that she was lesbian.  Because of the state of the law which had not been extended to cover sexual orientation, it could not grant her any redress.</P>
      <P>Second, a travelling family was denied the right to hold a wedding reception&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making those points because I am sure you, a Chathaoirligh, will recall the provisions protecting people on the basis of sexual orientation and membership of the travelling community which were passed in this House. I ask the Leader of House to raise this with the Government and to push for the introduction of this Bill.  It is important and it could be introduced in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to allow time for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, to address the House on difficulties resulting from the decision regarding the unconstitutionality of the Matrimonial Home Bill.  We spent many hours debating different aspects of the <Col N="12" /> Bill.  We put down several amendments and we debated the constitutionality of the Bill during our discussions.  We should have the opportunity to discuss with the Minister the implications for the divorce referendum and, indeed, the position regarding ownership of the family home.</P>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I recently visited Northern Ireland with a Fine Gael delegation and I would like the opportunity to debate it. Many Members did not have the opportunity to do so in the past.  Although we would have liked to debate Northern Ireland, we understood time did not allow this.  We should have that opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise an issue which I raised a couple of times before.  I ask the Leader of the House to consider a debate on enlargement of the European Union.  It is an issue which will profoundly effect the economy and our representation in the organs of the Union.  It also has implications for the fishing industry.  If we cannot have a debate on that, perhaps we could have one on the fishing industry, particularly in view of the magnificent defence the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, has made against the intrusion of the Spanish into our fishing box.  Perhaps we could have a debate on that at the earliest possible occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow is a special day in the west of Ireland because Developing the West will be launched as a response to the Bishops' initiative.  The report will be issued in Castlebar, County Mayo.  I am sure people in the west and throughout the country would like to hear the response of this House to this initiative.  I hope an appropriate debate on this issue will take place in this Chamber in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, urge the Leader of the House to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the first meeting of the Dáil. It is a pity this important occasion in our history was not celebrated.  I am glad <Col N="13" /> the women Members of the Oireachtas brought the portrait of Countess Markiewicz to the House.  I would be glad if we could mark the occasion in a general way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the fishing industry.  Before Christmas we debated a motion for two hours and Members expressed the view that it was far too short. Critical negotiations are taking place in the EU in regard to the so-called Irish box off the west coast.  Also there have been blatant incursions by Spanish fishermen into our waters.  I congratulate the Minister for the Marine on his efforts.  He is to be applauded for his contributions at EU level.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to attend the House for a day long discussion on fisheries.  I support the call made by Senator Lydon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support calls for a debate on the important issue of the fishing industry.  Incursions by Spanish fleets into our waters have been a problem for a long time.  Fishing is on a downward spiral at present.  Such incursions are contributing to this and must be tackled. Rural depopulation has long been a problem. Fishing can enhance the areas which are most isolated and desolated as a result of such depopulation.  I call on the Leader to make time available for this important debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it proposed to take the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993?  It is some time since this Bill was passed in the Dáil.  One feels there is a need for such legislation, based on experience.  Second, could the Leader say whether the Government intends to sign and give recognition to the European Charter for Self Local Government and whether there will be a debate on it in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls by Senators Lydon and Fitzgerald for a debate on the fishing industry.  I compliment the Minister &mdash; it is unique that <Col N="14" /> the Minister for Defence is also the Minister for the Marine &mdash; on his tremendous defence of the Irish fishing box in Europe before Christmas.  The second point I wish to make is one I have previously raised.  I ask the Leader if it would be possible to have a debate on the importation of drugs into Ireland and on how co-ordination between the Department of Justice and the Department of the Marine can be achieved to protect our coast from incursions of the kind which occurred before Christmas.  Finally, I ask the Leader to indicate when the new extradition Bill will come before the House.  I raised this issue many times previously.  Before the Bill is brought before the House it would be useful if we had a debate on the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the increasing importance being attached to the environment and, particularly, to the effect of leaded petrol, I ask the Leader if it would be possible to invite the appropriate Minister to come to the House to make a brief statement regarding the fact that very few garages sell ordinary unleaded petrol as distinct from super plus unleaded petrol.  Both types achieve the same result.  The Automobile Association has clearly indicated that for 99 per cent of cars the cheaper grade achieves the same result as the super plus grade on which garages are making greater profit. Will the Leader inquire whether the Minister could make a statement in the House to clarify this?  At a time when everyone is concerned about the environment and health, it is wrong that the major companies are profiting to the extent that the consumer is not gaining any extra benefit.</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on the North of Ireland.  Since the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December a new situation exists.  This House should be seen to support the declaration. We have a voice and a contribution to make.  If we are not seen to make a contribution we may give the wrong impression.  Some people seem to have the centre of the stage.  It is important <Col N="15" /> that Parliament expresses its views very strongly at this time.  In support of Senator Manning, I ask for a debate.  I do this in the knowledge that it is not long since we had such a debate but the situation has changed and I ask the Leader to do his best to arrange a debate on the current situation in the North.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senators Manning and O'Toole, I will have a programme of legislation for the coming session as soon as possible.  I would draw attention the fact that there are four important pieces of legislation with which this House will have to deal in detail &mdash; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, the Road Traffic Bill, the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill and the Adoptive Leave Bill.  Two of these Bills were initiated in this House, as is the Stillbirths Registration Bill which is being taken today.  I want to assure the House that between now and the summer many more Bills will be initiated in this House.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to deal with Item 3 &mdash; Report on the National Education Convention &mdash; this month.  I take Senator O'Toole's suggestion that the format we used the last time of statements followed by question time was successful.  I hope the Minister for Education will agree with this format.  Several Senators asked about that item during the past month and I hope the Chief Whip will be able to arrange for such a debate to take place this month.</P>
      <P>I will inform the Tánaiste that this House desires a further discussion on Northern Ireland.  The Whips will meet with regard to the appropriateness of marking the 75th anniversary of the first meeting of the Dáil.  With regard to the ethics Bill, I will look up the advertisements the Senator mentioned to see whether there is a need for an ethics Bill. With regard to the three new counties, it was suggested that the Senator was looking for a county of his own which is why the signs were there regarding Fingal.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to Senator Howard that there are many other ways in which he could raise that issue.  I will pass Senator Norris' comments and concerns to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  Other Senators have also contacted my office today with regard to that issue.  I would say to Senator Lydon that the Seanad takes every opportunity to discuss European affairs and I have no doubt we will find an opportunity to discuss the enlargement of the European Union.</P>
      <P>I gave a commitment before Christmas on the issue of fisheries.  I share the concerns many Senators expressed today about illegal fishing in our waters.  The Whips will arrange for the Minister to come to this House at the first available opportunity to discuss fisheries and that particular issue.  My understanding is that that issue will be further debated at European level in the coming six weeks.  It is important that this House would have an opportunity to support the Minister's efforts to ensure the protection of our fisheries.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Crowley's question on the importation of drugs, the Whip will contact the Minister for Justice to arrange a time to debate that issue.  I will pass on Senator O'Kennedy's views to the Minister for the Environment.  We may get an opportunity to make statements or to have a debate.  That covers most of the issues raised.</P>

    <Title>Stillbirths Registration Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for official registration of stillbirths.  There are over 300 stillbirths each year in Ireland.  A stillbirth can be <Col N="17" /> a very traumatic event for the parents involved.  When a child is stillborn, parents can be left devastated and grieving. Bereaved parents can experience a strong sense of loss and, indeed, some parents experience long term suffering as a result of the stillbirth.</P>
      <P>The process of grieving after a bereavement has received considerable research attention in the last decade or so.  An important facet of the process of coming to terms with, or adapting to, any loss involves recognition and acknowledgement of the person who has died. This acknowledgement facilitates appropriate grieving after the loss.  Such validation is not available at present to the parents of stillborn children who receive no official recognition of the existence of their stillborn child.  The establishment of a stillbirths register, as proposed in the Bill, would provide tangible evidence of the existence of stillborn children and so serve as a focus for the memories of bereaved parents.</P>
      <P>There is some form of civil registration of stillbirths in most, if not all, other European Union countries.  In this country, there have been calls from many quarters for the establishment of a stillbirths register.  Bereaved parents, and in particular the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society, ISANDS, have been campaigning on this issue for some time. The establishment of a stillbirths register was among the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approach to this Bill has been shaped by two considerations.  On one hand, the rationale for stillbirths registration is essentially therapeutic.  Stillbirths registration is primarily intended to comfort grieving parents rather than to serve an evidential or statistical purpose. Statistics on stillbirths are already compiled by the Central Statistics Office and by the Department of Health.  Given its therapeutic rationale, the stillbirths registration system should not be unduly bureaucratic or impose additional burdens on bereaved parents.  On the other hand, if an official register is to be created, some procedural formality is <Col N="18" /> necessary to ensure the accuracy of the information recorded.  The Bill aims to combine sensitivity to the needs of bereaved parents with the formality appropriate to a part of the civil registration system.</P>
    <P>One of the first questions which had to be considered in drawing up the Bill was how to define a stillbirth.  A stillborn child is a child born dead but viable outside the womb.  There is, however, no universally accepted definition of what constitutes viability.  In some countries, the demarcation between a miscarriage and a stillbirth is based on gestational age.  The gestational age used was typically 28 weeks but because of advances in medical care this has been reducing.  Twenty four weeks is now the threshold for stillbirths registration in the UK.  Other countries base their definition on the weight of the child, 500 grammes being the normal weight used.</P>
    <P>A case can be made for either criterion. Weight is more definitive than gestational age which can be difficult to assess. Weight is also the World Health Organisation's preferred criterion.  On the other hand, gestational age reflects parents' expectations about the outcome of pregnancy more accurately than weight which is typically unknown.  My view is that, since the main reason for establishing a register is to comfort grieving parents, the definition of a stillbirth in the Bill should be as wide as possible, consistent with accepted medical norms.  I have therefore provided in section 2 that the Act will apply to a child who is born dead and who either weighs a minimum of 500 grammes or has a minimum gestational age of 24 weeks.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the registration of stillbirths within the existing organisational framework for registration of births, deaths and marriages. In other words, responsibility for the registration of stillbirths would be assumed by the registrar-general, superintendant-registrars and the 300 local registrars.  A stillbirth will, therefore, be registered at local level as is a birth or death.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> As the stillbirths register is an official one and as certificates will be provided to parents, it is important the information held on the register be correct.  I have, therefore, provided in section 5 that where the parents of the stillborn child are not married to each other, the procedural formalities for recording the father's name on the register will be the same as for a live birth.  These procedures are set out in section 7 of the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act, 1880, as amended by section 49 of the Status of Children Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides that registration will be compulsory in the case of stillbirths which occur on or after the commencement of this legislation.  Compulsory registration of stillbirths is the norm in other jurisdictions.  By making registration compulsory, I believe that we assert the official character and status of the register and thereby reinforce the reality of the stillborn child, particularly as perceived from the parents' point of view.  I do recognise, however, that it would not be appropriate to add to the grief of the parents by imposing a duty on them to inform the registrar of a stillbirth or by pursuing them for failure to do so.  Section 6 provides an option for the parents to inform the registrar of the stillbirth is they wish.  If the parents do not choose to inform the local registrar themselves within a specified period, then the duty to inform the registrar will fall to the relevant hospital or, where no hospital is involved, to the relevant medical practitioner.  This procedure will ensure that registration is comprehensive.</P>
    <P>I am also making provision in section 7 for retrospective registration of stillbirths. A stillbirth which occurred at any time before the commencement of the Bill may be registered, at the request of either parent and subject to the production of satisfactory supporting documentation. This degree of retrospection is unusual in legislation but I am conscious of the fact that the suffering of bereaved parents of stillborn children can last for a long time, even for decades.  I <Col N="20" /> believe that a compassionate approach requires that we facilitate those who want official recognition of past stillbirths. Such retrospective registration will, of course, be purely voluntary as it would be neither practical nor desirable to make registration of past stillbirths compulsory.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with stillbirths registers. Information held on these registers will not be accessible to the public.  This differs from the position in relation to birth and death certificates, where any member of the public is entitled to search indexes of registers and is entitled to obtain any certificate simply by paying the required fee.  In the case of stillbirths, no public interest would be served by having the information on the registers open to the public and, given the relatively small number of stillbirths each year, an openly accessible register could be seen as an invasion of privacy of the persons concerned.  The register of stillbirths here, like those in the UK and Northern Ireland, will be private.</P>
    <P>A certificate of a stillbirth will be available to the parents of the stillborn child, either at registration, if the parents choose to notify the registrar themselves, or subsequently, subject to verification of the parents' identity.  Stillbirth certificates will otherwise be made available only at the discretion of the registrar-general. The fee will be the same as for a birth certificate.  The format of the stillbirth certificate, which is detailed in the Schedule to the Bill, will resemble that of a birth certificate but will include information on the weight and gestational age of the child together with information on both the mother's and the father's occupation and other personal details in line with the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be welcomed by all sides of the House.  This is a measure which has been sought for some considerable time and I am very pleased to be able to introduce it.  I look forward to positive contributions to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister for initiating it in the Seanad.  Many may feel it is of minor concern but it is important legislation for many people.  It is important for the parents of stillborn babies to know their child had an identity, that she or he was a human being, that the child had a name and that a birth certificate is available. This is an important area which is covered by this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been campaigned for by the parents of stillborn children for over ten years and I compliment the work done by the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society to this end.  The Bill is important for bereaved parents because they will now have tangible evidence that their child existed.  It is also important because it will provide accurate statistical information on stillbirths.  This will assist researchers in this area and I hope it will improve the situation in regard to the number of stillbirths each year.  Since November 1983 there have been approximately 3,000 stillbirths and the parents of these children have no official record of their births.  The Bill allows for retrospection and this is welcome.  It will give many parents who grieve for their child for many years after their birth, an opportunity to give him or her an official identity.</P>
      <P>Ireland is the last EU country to establish a stillbirth register.  Britain has had a register for 40 years and Northern Ireland has had one for 30 years.  Like a lot of social legislation, Ireland is decades behind its European partners in legislating for a register of stillbirths.</P>
      <P>The parents of a baby who has died before or after birth experience an array of emotions, including shock, disbelief, anger, failure and guilt.  These feelings are a normal part of any reaction to grief, but they are more intense and last longer in the case of a prenatal death.  However, unless grief becomes acceptance, the physical and mental health of bereaved parents and their families can be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first reaction of a parent who is told their baby is dead is shock.  It can take hours for the reality of the tragedy to sink in.  The parents, especially the <Col N="22" /> mother, may feel angry.  She is the first to learn the bad news and she may feel angry with the doctor who tells her, the obstetrician and the world who she blames for causing her extreme distress. She may also feel angry or guilty with herself and she may feel she is to blame for the death of her baby.  Despite reassurances from doctors and medical staff, a mother can feel a sense of guilt at the loss of her baby.</P>
    <P>Proper counselling of parents is important.  In the past, parents, especially mothers, were cruelly treated in the way they were told about the death of their child.  They were told the child was dead and they were then asked to sign a register.  This showed a lack of counselling for the parents, especially the mother, who were in a difficult and distressful situation.  There should be a dedicated counsellor in each health board area for the purpose of counselling people who are experiencing the trauma of the death of their child.  This person could also counsel people and their families who have been told they have a terminal illness.  This situation only exists in some health boards.  We are currently looking at the Mid-Western Health Board because this service is not in existence there and it should be.</P>
    <P>For weeks and months after a stillbirth the parents usually go through a period of deep sadness and emptiness.  The mother often feels very alone and goes through intense pain from the loss of her child. No one can ever measure one person's pain against that of another, yet the loss of a baby can be the deepest loss any person can experience.  There are good reasons for this.  One expects to lose elderly parents but in this day and age one does not expect to lose a baby.  A baby is an extension of the parents whose future plans have included the infant.  One's role as a parent to provide, protect and nurture has been left unfulfilled.  There is extreme loneliness in grieving for a baby; no one else knows this person except the parents.  To other people it may seem that they are grieving over the loss of a non-person because they feel a parent did not have the time to get to know the <Col N="23" /> baby's personality and character.  They will soon forget the baby's impact on its parents' lives while the parents themselves will continue to remember.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that fathers experience the same sense and intensity of grief as mothers.  While the mother's relationship is special in that she bore the child, the sense of loss and grief is also deeply felt by fathers.  Parents should have a memory of their baby, some keepsake to remind them; a photograph, a baby's identification bracelet, a baptismal certificate if the baby was baptised, or some other memento.  It is important, too, that the baby is named so parents can use a name to talk about their baby to others.  It will thus be easier to refer to him or her in discussions with their other children and easier to connect memories to the baby if he or she is referred to by name.  A birth certificate is the most tangible and legal evidence of the existence of a baby's life and it is welcome that this will now be available to parents of stillborn babies.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I too want to thank the Minister for initiating this legislation in this House.  This particular Minister has a very good record in that respect and has had very positive results from legislation which he initiated here.  In thanking him I know that I speak on behalf of bereaved parents and the Irish Stillbirths and Neonatal Deaths Society who have been campaigning for such a register for almost ten years.  When one is not affected it is easy to overlook the necessity for legislation such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My one experience of this subject was during the 1992 election campaign when a large number of issues were being raised and my party was getting a lot of hassle on the doorsteps.  When a canvasser knocked on one particular door the person asked to speak to me.  I thought it was because she wanted to make her views known to me on one of the issues which were current in Dublin North at the time, but it was not.  She <Col N="24" /> told me she had a friend who had just lost her baby having suffered a stillbirth and explained the trauma and grief the parents were experiencing.  She pointed out that there was no such thing as a stillbirths' register and asked me what I could do about it.  Having three healthy children I considered myself lucky and was thankful I had not been personally affected.  I promised the woman that, regardless of the outcome of the election, I would pursue the matter, and I am glad I did.  After the election I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Taylor, who informed me that he was going to introduce such a register.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, I met with the ISANDS group.  They were pleased if somewhat cynical because they had received such commitments before.  For ten years they had been told it would be done.  The Minister, Deputy Taylor, has taken a different approach from that of other Ministers who previously had responsibility for this matter.  This register was to be established in the context of a general review of the registration of births and marriages and that is why it was left on the long finger.  The Minister took it out of the general review.  He met with me, a number of other politicians and ISANDS and gave a commitment that he would deal with the register as a separate issue and would do so as speedily as possible. The Minister is to be congratulated for being faithful to his word.  I understand that he had an official of his Department working full time on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has produced the best possible legislation for this area.  It is seldom that we see legislation that is retrospective and which gives such a generous allowance of time in relation to the retrospection.  The society and parents who are affected by this will welcome the legislation.  The reduction of the gestational period from 28 to 24 weeks is welcome.  A woman who is six months pregnant is readily noticeable.  It seems ridiculous to suggest at that stage that there is not a viable life and to insist on the gestation period being four weeks more.  That is a welcome and compassionate provision as is the provision <Col N="25" /> regarding the weight threshold of 500 grammes.</P>
    <P>The Minister met with this group and was strenuously lobbied by its members. His speech demonstrates that he has a great grasp of what this legislation means to the parents and the society affected by stillbirth.  As he said:</P>
    <P>An important facet of the process of coming to terms with, or adapting to, any loss involves recognition and acknowledgement of the person who has died.</P>
    <P>The double trauma which parents must have felt on, first, losing their baby and, second, having absolutely no recognition of the fact that the life had existed and died, must have been almost too much for any human being to bear.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could find a flaw in this legislation.  It is compassionate and the manner in which the Minister has introduced it shows that he is caring and compassionate.  I welcome the Bill.  The remarks of a member of ISANDS to whom I spoke earlier probably speaks volumes.  She said the fact that the Minister was as good as his word and had introduced the legislation which encompassed and improved on everything being sought by the ISANDS group had restored her faith in politicians.  If it did nothing else, it was worthwhile for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I warmly welcome this Bill.  It will not only bring some comfort to those parents whose children are stillborn by the legal recognition of their birth by the State but it is also of great importance to the medical profession because it will give us the more accurate statistics which we need.  It will also encourage research into stillbirths and the causes of miscarriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one quibble with the Bill.  The Minister should amend section 1 so that the legal and medical definitions of stillbirth are the same.  Since 1988 we have defined stillbirth in our perinatal statistics in accordance with the World Health Organisation recommendation, which is that the definition for singleton children is those weighing 500 grammes <Col N="26" /> or more who show no signs of life.  The official perinatal report of the Department of Health states: &ldquo;Following WHO guidelines a stillbirth in this report refers to the death of a foetus weighing at least 500 grammes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The gestational age, as the Minister has implied, is not an accurate means of assessing the extent of the pregnancy.  I understand that the Minister is trying to deal with the emotional turmoil of parents. The emotional turmoil at 23 weeks and 24 weeks &mdash; shortly viability may be at 23 weeks &mdash; will be as difficult to deal with as dealing with the turmoil of 500 grammes.  At present, because of the increase in viability or the drop in the number of weeks at which a child can become viable, the World Health Organisation is considering it possible to drop the definition to 400 grammes.  There will always be hard cases on either side.  I would have preferred the Minister to have taken the World Health Organisation's definition, which is already used by the Department of Health, rather than having a situation where we could have medical and legal definitions in conflict.</P>
    <P>There has been a major drop in the fertility rate in this country.  Women in the early 1990s have an average of 2.2 children in their completed families compared to the early 1970s when the average was 4.1.  This declining fertility rate, which is a controlled decline due to the availability of contraception in this country, is incredible.  It is unknown in the western world since World War II.  While there has been a considerable decline in the fertility rate, there has not been so great a decline in the absolute birth rate. The absolute birth rate in the early 1970s was about 70,000 live births whereas it is now about 50,000 live births.  Although there has been a big drop in the fertility rate, the medical profession and the obstetric units do not have to deal with such a huge decline in the number of children being born.</P>
    <P>There are huge economic and social implications in these changes not only for parents but also for society.  The planning of the family has meant that there is additional grief over this much longed for <Col N="27" /> child who is lost.  Stillbirth, as Senator Neville said, is just as traumatic for the father as for the mother.  Indeed, it is extremely traumatic for the extended family.  It is also traumatic for those in the medical and nursing profession who are involved in the birth.  Everyone wants to know what happened, what went wrong, why was the child not born well and alive because in a large number of cases the child can look perfectly normal.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate in Dublin in that the three maternity hospitals, where about 20,000 of the births in this country take place each year, have a very high autopsy rate.  This procedure is sought as much by the parents as by the medical practitioners involved in the cases because the parents also want to find out the cause of death.  It can be a great comfort to them if they find out that, although the child looked perfectly normal there was some serious heart abnormality or other complaint which was not sustainable with life outside the womb.  It can also be a help if they find that, for example, it was another medical condition like utero placental insufficiency, which is the failure of the placenta through which the child is nurtured in the womb, or the presence of an infection in the child or the presence of an infection in the placenta.  It is a source of great relief to parents to find out what went wrong.</P>
    <P>The general availability of foetal assessment has been extremely important. Foetal assessment is the study of the growth of the infant within the womb by ultrasound scans.  It helps to alert the doctor if there is growth retardation so that something urgent can be done to induce the pregnancy before term or to do a caesarean section if it is an emergency. However, between 40 and 50 per cent of stillbirths are unexpected and we still do not know their cause.</P>
    <P>There are about 500 perinatal deaths in Ireland each year.  These are deaths of infants weighing 500 grammes or more who are born without any evidence of life or who do not breathe or who die within the first week after delivery.  As the Minister <Col N="28" /> said, between 300 and 400 of these are stillbirths.  The stillbirth rate is calculated by multiplying the number of stillbirths by 1,000 and dividing it by the total number of live and stillbirths.  I am sorry for quoting so many statistics but I hope the next section of my contribution will make the point.</P>
    <P>What is important is that there are some sad social statistics behind the stillbirth rate.  These are available in the perinatal statistics published by the Department of Health and I would like to point out the following in particular. The stillbirth rate among unemployed people is 17.7 while the rate among those in professional groups or salaried employees is about a third of that at 3 to 5; there is also a high rate of about 12 among unskilled manual workers.  I wonder how many children have been stillborn in this country in the last few years because their parents were unemployed. The stillbirth rate also increases if mothers have had previous stillbirths. Why are more male children stillborn than female children?  There are many factors which need to be investigated and we should not rely totally on international research in these areas because some of these situations may be peculiar to us.</P>
    <P>Our perinatal mortality rate which, as I said, includes the stillbirth rate, is at the higher end of the scale in the European Union, with Greece, Portugal and Italy. We should be careful about attributing this to our lack of therapeutic abortion. Some people go to England for therapeutic abortions.  However, we would be wise to focus on the socio-economic factors which may be involved.  Perhaps improvements in our terrible unemployment figures would do more for our stillbirth rate than any medical advances.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about stillborn children who look perfectly normal but I would now like to concentrate on children who are seriously malformed.  Many cases of seriously malformed children are ill explained and there is little serious research being done in this area.  There are children who are born with amputations, with head and torso malformations <Col N="29" /> due to a condition called amniotic band syndrome, anencephalic children, etc.  Progress is being made in finding the causes of these cases.  For example, the instance of anencephaly here, which was the highest in the world, is falling.  Vitamin deficiency in the mother's diet was probably important in this regard and this is why I say that it is important that we look at our own conditions and not rely totally on international statistics.  In some cases there may be an inherited biological propensity to a malformation but nothing goes wrong except that certain other circumstances come into play, such as an infection or a dietary deficiency, which would promote the malformation.</P>
    <P>Quite by coincidence, in this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> there is a report on just such a situation.  There is a report about surveys carried out by Doctor Patricia Sheehan who is a nuclear medical specialist. I will quote from the report because it is concise.  It reads:</P>
    <P>[Dr. Sheehan's] alarming findings come as the British authorities are locked in a furious row over the startup of the new THORP nuclear re-processing plant at Sellafield &mdash; just 75 miles from the Irish east coast.</P>
    <P>Dr. Sheehan's report refers to mothers who attended St. Vincent's school in the town [this was in Dundalk] and shows a similar pattern to the previous study of former pupils of St. Louis school.  [Senators may remember this study which she did about ten years ago.] The two surveys centred on girls who were at school at the two institutions in the 1950s.  The new report studied 319 girls who attended St. Vincent's Secondary School.  It showed that five of them gave birth to Down's Syndrome babies and 33 more babies were born with other serious handicaps, including Spina Bifida, heart defects and deafness.</P>
    <P>Five mothers had stillbirths, seven babies died within six weeks of being born and six others died in childhood. Among the 1,086 pregnancies of the <Col N="30" /> 319 women surveyed there were also 161 miscarriages and 23 premature births.  ...Dr. Sheehan believes they are linked to radiation from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Her previous study of 157 mothers who attended St. Louis Secondary School in Dundalk showed they had eight Down's Syndrome babies and 12 other babies with birth defects.  Two of the mothers had stillbirths, one baby died within six weeks of being born and two others died in childhood.  All of the mothers at the St. Louis School suffered a severe flu at the same time as a nuclear reactor at Sellafield went on fire sending a cloud of radiation across the Irish sea.</P>
    <P>Dr. Sheehan is linking the radioactive cloud from the nuclear fire to a whole range of birth defects in the Co. Louth town.  She told the <i>Evening Herald</i> that the new survey re-affirmed her previous theory of a possible link between the births and Sellafield.  Dr. Sheehan is basing her views on a host of factors.  [This is what I stressed &mdash; that multifactorial influences are extremely important and that we have to look at our own situation and not just at evidence from outside the country.] Children in both surveys suffered from a form of Down's Syndrome which is not hereditary but occurs accidentally. [That is important.]</P>
    <P>Weather reports showed that the nuclear cloud from the 1957...Sellafield fire crossed the Irish sea and heavy rain washed the radioactive particles into the soil.  In Britain the authorities ordered thousands of gallons of milk from farms in a 300 square mile radius of the Sellafield plant to be poured down the drains.  They were concerned that the Iodine 131 [that is radioactive iodine] in the atmosphere could come through the food chain and pose a risk to public health.  [No warning of this was given in Ireland.]</P>
    <P>While we cannot say that this is absolute evidence that the two were correlated, we would have to seriously look at this factor which is specific to this country. This is interesting to doctors, of course, <Col N="31" /> but it can be vital also for parents because they want to know the chance of a bad result in one pregnancy happening in another pregnancy.  They will want to know what changes they should make so that they will have a healthy live born child the next time.  We should make all efforts to help their expectation for a healthy child and this will involve money. Money needed for research is of primary importance.</P>
    <P>Money will also be needed to improve counselling services because nurses and doctors in our hospitals are over-stretched at present and counselling parents takes time, particularly after a traumatic event such as the stillbirth of a baby and even more so if the child is malformed.  I would point out that it has been found to be important that the parents should see a child who is malformed.  In the past often the mother or father was not allowed to see the child.  I have dealt with women who 30 years ago had an anencephalic child and heard them speak wistfully about their distress at never having seen their baby.  If a shawl is put around the baby's face and the baby is presented to the parents in a humane manner it is most important for them. Otherwise they will have a sense of grieving about something they have never seen.</P>
    <P>We will now register stillbirths which is extremely good, but we should also look at the possibility of registering miscarriages. While there are only about 300 to 400 stillbirths every year, there are thousands of miscarriages and these are also traumatic events for the parents and they need to be comforted.  They have a tremendous sense of loss and failure.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would explain to our visitors that I have been talking about stillbirths.  We are to have a stillbirth register which the Minister is introducing, and which I welcome.  I hope for a miscarriage register in the not too distant future.  I am sorry to load the Minister with more work.</P>
      <P>This would not just be a help to the parents but would be extremely important in planning to try to help with future pregnancies.  We must not only look at pregnancies in a quantitative manner but in a qualitative manner also.  We must value each one; we must not only focus on the outcome of the full-term pregnancy but also look at what has gone astray earlier in a pregnancy.</P>
      <P>Funding permitting, the department of obstetrics in Trinity College Dublin is about to undertake a survey of the psychological, psychiatric, psychosocial and familial sequelae of miscarriages from the parents' point of view.  Women are to be encouraged to ask questions and demand information.  I hope the Department of Health will be able to become involved in this study.</P>
      <P>We often have to return to the beginning of pregnancy.  We must urgently improve the position regarding genetic counselling.  Ireland is the only advanced country without medical genetic resources.  They have been delayed for far too long because we have had a loss of confidence in how we would handle them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago there was a genetic counselling service in the Rotunda Hospital but lack of finance for the laboratory work caused the consultant involved to resign.  Now at last a new genetic counselling service is being set up between Our Lady's Hospital for Sick <Col N="33" /> Children, Crumlin and Temple Street Children's Hospital.  One consultant has been appointed but rationally we should have between five and ten consultants in Ireland to deal with the number of cases.</P>
    <P>I have some queries about the establishment of this service.  Why have two of the children's hospitals in this city been selected and the third left out?  Why is the National Children's Hospital not involved?  That hospital is being transferred to Tallaght and surely it deserves sessions.</P>
    <P>I would also query the lack of involvement of the genetics department in Trinity College which has a worldwide reputation.  Retinitis pigmentosa is a serious eye condition which causes blindness in children.  The Trinity genetics department has been in the forefront of research in this and many other areas. We should be very proud of them.</P>
    <P>No services have been planned for adults, who comprise 50 per cent of the cases needing genetic counselling.  There is no provision for advice on multi-factorial diseases, where a genetic predisposition would be made worse by circumstances.  Illnesses which involve environmental as well as genetic factors include forms of cancer, psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autoimmune conditions such as asthma. Where are all these people to go for advice?  I presume we do not expect them to go to the children's hospitals.  The Department of Health will say this will happen in time but the time involved can be quite long.  This is an urgent matter because our population is entitled to the best of information and the best help in these serious circumstances.</P>
    <P>It appears no training has been set up for general practitioners, who will have to deal with the families at the forefront of any genetic problems which may have led to stillbirths or miscarriages.  Many general practitioners may have qualified long before these advances were made and would warmly welcome training in the area.</P>
    <P>Another problem with establishing counselling in Crumlin and Temple Street is the involvement of the Catholic <Col N="34" /> Archbishop of Dublin and the religious orders.  There are huge moral and ethical questions to be faced in genetics.  It is essential that religious views be taken into account but I wonder how wise it is to put either the Archbishop or the religious in a position where they feel they must impose their ethics on the consultant or patient involved.</P>
    <P>Obviously there would be an immediate difficulty in prenatal diagnosis.  The maternity hospitals, where many of the stillbirths and miscarriages will happen, are not involved in the scheme and will urgently require a genetic counselling service.</P>
    <P>There is also the major issue of gene therapy.  Quite rightly the churches stress their moral and ethical role in genetics. Gene therapy, which is the treatment of cells of the body by introducing other genes, may be acceptable to the churches in somatic disease, where an ordinary cell in the liver, pancreas or lung is treated.</P>
    <P>However I think there will be grave reservations about accepting gene therapy for germ cells.  This is where a gene in sperm or an egg cell is affected by a serious disease and may be treated if and when genetic therapy becomes available. I would understand if the Archbishop did not allow any genetic service in his hospital which did not comply with the rules of the church and I would not like to see him embarrassed by having to refuse. Therefore it is important that the Department of Health urgently examines the possibility of changing the circumstances so this embarrassment could not occur.</P>
    <P>We are now about to register the stillbirths in Ireland and I hope the numbers will get smaller.  We should direct research towards this area.  Moral and ethical guidelines will also be needed.  We have people with expertise in medicine, genetics, theology and philosophy.  Any contribution this country could make on the international stage could only be of the greatest value in the ongoing debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been privileged to listen to one of the most eloquent and well researched speeches I have heard.  I congratulate Senator Henry and am most <Col N="35" /> embarrassed to follow her because my contribution is minor in comparison.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing in this Bill.  It is shameful that an organisation had to campaign for 10 years before its voice was heard.  It is also a shame that a procedure acceptable in the North of this country 30 years ago and 40 years ago in the neighbouring island could not have been introduced here sooner.  There is nothing marking us as special or different which prevented us from introducing this Bill much sooner.</P>
      <P>I concur with fellow Senators about the grief and trauma couples suffer on losing a child.  Perhaps the grief is greater when the child is older but, as Senator Henry said, even when the child is only a few weeks old the grief is considerable.  From the time that a mother knows she is pregnant and especially from the time she feels she is pregnant, which is not always the same, the child becomes a life, a person.  The mother can feel the child moving and if she loses the child at that stage she feels grief and guilt.</P>
      <P>Like Senator McGennis I am lucky to have had a large brood of healthy children.  However I lost a child who was three weeks old.  I still remember the grief I felt at that time but it was nothing in comparison to what happened to my sister-in-law, who lost a child at a much later stage.  I can understand the feelings of mothers who give birth to babies who are not alive.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a means for the State to recognise this life existed.  The child is mentioned on the register and has a name.  I also welcome the element of retrospection in the Bill.  Mothers who have had stillborn children can now officially register that fact.  If the compilation of these statistics can be used by the medical profession and the scientists in our universities to reduce the incidence of stillbirths, it would be welcome.  Any measure that would enable us to bring healthy children into this world can only be a progressive one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Senator Neville's call for counselling.  The utmost sensitivity <Col N="36" /> should be shown to women who have had stillborn babies.  I have experienced an incident where a mother who had given birth to a baby who had died before birth &mdash; she was already aware of this &mdash; was put into a public ward with mothers of healthy children.  Every time a healthy child cried for attention, that mother ran out of the ward.  I thought it was one of the saddest events I had ever witnessed. Every time my healthy baby cried, it reminded her of her loss.  It would have been simple to have given that mother a room by herself.  Unfortunately, she was not a member of the VHI.  She was an unmarried mother who came from a working class area.  She was not in any psychological condition to protest about this insensitivity, which continued until the day she was released from hospital.</P>
    <P>I welcome the element of confidentiality incorporated in this Bill. While the general statistics are important for the medical profession, the details should only be the business of the parents. When people are grieving, the last thing they want to hear is that someone will be intruding into their case in the future.  The element of compulsion is important because when one is going through this trauma, it would be easy to neglect the formality of registration.  This Bill allows the medical practitioner or the hospital to do the onerous task for the parents, who otherwise might regret it in years to come not registering the birth.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing about a change in the registration form, which is contained in the Schedule of the Bill. Including the mother's forename and surname, address and occupation may be a small change, but it was not done in the past.  The record of a mother's occupation is as justifiable as that of the father.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Minister for initiating this legislation in this House.  However, I have one regret.  I have noticed that where legislation to do with children is concerned, we often end up with mainly female Senators and few of their male counterparts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill is long overdue.  England and Northern Ireland have had stillborn registers for the past 30 years and this is the only country in the EU which does not have such a register.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to Senator Kelly's comments on the fact that few male Senators are present for this debate. While we joke that they may be too shy, people often do not realise that a stillbirth can cause as much anguish and concern to the father as it does to the mother. Perhaps it is an unfortunate part of our culture and conditioning in society that men want to pretend that they are not in any way involved or associated publicly with this issue.  That may be reflected here today in so far as few male Senators are prepared to state publicly how they feel on the matter or that they welcome this Bill.  Undoubtedly, there are few who have not been touched by a stillbirth or a miscarriage and suffered the grief and trauma associated with such an occurrence. The Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society has done tremendous work in helping those who have suffered from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has presented this Bill, which is a technical one.  I am concerned about one part of the Bill.  The definition section defines stillbirth as &ldquo;a birth in relation to which section 1 of this Act applies and &ldquo;stillborn &ldquo;shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;  It provides that: &ldquo;This Act applies in relation to a child born weighing 500 grammes or more or having a gestational age of 24 weeks or more who shows no sign of life.  &ldquo;I wonder why the Minister put that definition of stillbirth in the Bill. I would find that difficult to accept.  It should not be defined by the weight of a stillborn child.  I have had children and <Col N="38" /> miscarriages and have seen scans of a child at ten, 11 and 13 weeks and I can appreciate that there is a child in formation. The child is real to a mother at that stage and she has a close bond to it. The definition needs further consideration. I know a lot of people who have had still births under 24 weeks.  I am not conversant with the technicalities of weights but it should be reconsidered. Personally, I find this section difficult to accept.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department may have chosen this definition because the possibility of a child surviving after 24 weeks would be greater.  We have had this debate in the political arena for many years.  When the abortion issue arose, we had wide discussions on the question of pregnancy and when life occurs.  This matter should be reviewed, taking into account the fact that any woman who is beginning to feel the signs of pregnancy automatically feels a bond with that child. When there is a miscarriage, there is a great sense of loss.  A mother literally moves from a state of expectation of a new addition to a total sense of emptiness and loss.  That is difficult for parents to cope with.  By identifying and recognising the child and providing the facilities of registering, life could be made easier for the parents concerned.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly referred to counselling, a point Senator Neville raised earlier in the discussion.  I concur with what she said.  Many women who go through this experience are very traumatised.  Needless to say the level of loss and grief will vary from person to person, depending on their circumstances and emotional state.  This should be taken into consideration. While the Minister does not have direct responsibility for that aspect, perhaps the Department of Health in conjunction with the Minister's Department should consider an active counselling service.  In the regional maternity hospital in County Limerick, a nurse has done wonderful counselling work.  She works in the Mid-Western Health Board area and was recently recognised in the British Isles when she was given an <Col N="39" /> award.  We need to develop more of that type of support system for the parents concerned.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for presenting this Bill.  It is welcome in so far as it provides recognition of the fact that there was a child and that parents had a child. It provides an opportunity for them to have the child recognised through a proper procedure where there is a birth certificate and a death certificate.  That is an official recognition and once that is provided, society will automatically acknowledge that there was a child.  This is extremely important.  Parents move literally from a state of hope and expectancy to a complete sense of loss; instead of having a live birth and a new addition to the family they have a death.  It is far more difficult for them if they have to deal with that and grieve in private, as if nothing had happened, without the opportunity for the normal proper procedures of a funeral and State recognition.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I ask the Minister to reconsider the provisions relating to the weight of 500 grammes and the gestational period of 24 weeks.  I have strong reservations about them.  I cannot go into the professional and technical medical discussions on it but as somebody who has experienced it and knows many people with similar experiences, I believe there is a need to reconsider these aspects.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on presenting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a caring Bill and the Minister means it as such but I have one quibble with it; the definition of a stillborn child is one born dead but viable outside the womb.  This a good definition but the Minister goes on to limit it by talking about a child who either 24 weeks or weighs 500 grammes. The Minister said the gestational age was typically 28 weeks but that is now reducing due to the advances in medical science. I know how quickly medical science advances come about so perhaps in a month or a year this definition will no <Col N="40" /> longer be any good and we will have to introduce another Bill.  Is it necessary to have these figures?  If my wife had a stillborn child and he or she was 23 weeks and six days or weighed 499 grammes, it would take a lot to convince her that she had not had a stillborn child.  This should be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I do not know if this Bill applies to the child after it is born or just before.  As the Minister is aware, the unborn child has rights under our Constitution and is protected.  We may be discriminating in some way by stating a time or an age at which a person is either viable or nonviable. It is sad when we come to measure the worth of a person, no matter how small, by her weight or age.  By having a cut off point, we are automatically devaluing that person.  At some future stage, this may pave the way for abortion legislation to which I would be opposed and which I hope will never enter this country.</P>
      <P>At the moment my concern is not with abortion but with the mother who has a child who weighs 499 grammes or the gestational age was 23 weeks and six days.  It might be better if the Minister could consider leaving the definition as it is, that a stillborn child is a child born dead but viable outside the womb.  I am not asking the Minister to change the legislation completely but to consider that definition and perhaps leave it a little broader.  Senator Henry asked for a register of stillbirths and a register of miscarriages. There may be no need for two; perhaps one could cover all.  It is concern for the mother that preoccupies me at this stage.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I too will be brief.  As Senator Kelly said, it is important that male Senators should show some concern in this area.  This is a caring Bill and recognises the fact that it is important for the parents of a stillborn child to be allowed the official grieving ritual and period and the acknowledgement that a child is born.  It is for this reason that the Minister has wisely chosen to introduce this caring legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> I was listening in my office to some of the other speeches and I found them very interesting.  One Member referred to the fact that it has taken 30 years to catch up with the North of Ireland and that there was a curious discrepancy.  Things and attitudes change and there may be something in the cultural climate, in the ethos and even in the religious climate that may have affected it.  I am old enough to remember when, for example, limbo was in existence and it was assumed in the major Christian denomination in this country that children who were not baptised spent a period in this ambiguous state of suspended spiritual animation before they were sufficiently purged to be allowed into heaven.  In that, as in medical science, we have also advanced.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Henry's contribution.  I thought a number of her points were extremely valuable.  In particular, I was impressed by the argument that we should, in this legislation as in other legislation, adopt the terminology and standards of the World Health Organisation.  I am not sure if the Minister is prepared to concede on this in the matter of definition.</P>
    <P>I was also interested in and impressed by the first point my colleague, Senator Lydon, made about the advances in medical science and the difficulties of giving a stable definition that will last. However, I differed from him in a linguistic sense when he spoke about the person. It is difficult to describe either a stillborn child or a miscarried foetus as a person in the fullest sense.  If one looks at the word personality, which derives from the noun person, it assumes a much wider range of behaviour and capacity than a human embryo is capable of.  I say that not in any sense wishing to demean the status of the foetus, embryo, stillbirth or miscarriage but to suggest that there is, when looked at rationally, a difference between a stillbirth, miscarried foetus and a fully realised child who has a personality. It is only entities which have personality that can be properly described as persons.  I do not wish to labour this point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> I was also glad that my colleague, Senator Henry, broadened the scope of the discussion &mdash; and that this was permitted because it is appropriate on the Second Stage of a Bill such as this &mdash; to include ethical committees, the Medical Council, etc.  To a certain extent we are in an area of ethics.  A number of Senators spoke movingly about the desire of parents to have children and to have the fact that they have had children recognised. This is a strong human desire.  It is not one which I share, certainly not with the strength of some of my colleagues, which is perhaps fortunate because it would present some biological difficulties for me.</P>
    <P>Listening yesterday to Marion Finucane on RTE radio, I heard an extraordinarily patronising male medic who persisted in referring to her as Miss Finucane. They were discussing the question of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation.  I draw this to the Minister's attention because this is an important area where I believe the Medical Council is making a ham fisted approach.  This gentlemen was obdurately rejecting any right of persons not religiously or civilly married to become parents, using&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish finally to congratulate the Minister on introducing what I believe to be a sensitive, caring and important Bill which permits the parents that period of grieving from which they were previously disbarred. I believe that for both parents, and especially for the mother, because for biological reasons the mother carries the child for this period of months, to officially deny the existence of this experience, or to attempt to obliterate it is offensive.  It is offensive to women especially, but also to caring men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minster to the House and thank him for this eagerly awaited legislation.  There are few sadnesses that can compare with the grief of parents at the death of their child.  We see cases all too often where there is a tragic loss of a young life and no consolation for the parents.  The same applies to parents whose children die while still in the womb.  They mourn the child they never got the chance to know and they grieve for the future that such a child will never have.</P>
      <P>Current legislation makes their anguish all the greater.  In the case of stillborn babies the law fails to acknowledge that this tiny person existed.  It obliges nobody to record the all too brief life and parents are grief stricken and heartbroken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical staff in the hospitals do their best to comfort the families by taking photographs of the stillborn child and <Col N="44" /> attempting to handle the tragedy with great compassion.  However, the problem remains that there is no formal acknowledgement.</P>
    <P>When there is no way to bring the child back to life, it is possible to give dignity to childbirth and that is what this Bill is about.  A stillbirth certificate will be available to bereaved parents lending formality and legal status to their loss.  A register of stillbirths will be kept, but will not be publicly accessible.  Legal provision is already in place to allow for the recording of the father's name on the register, whether or not the parents are married to each other.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the Bill, a child born weighing 500 grams or more, or having a gestational age of 24 weeks or more who shows no sign of life is regarded as stillborn.  The Bill also gives parents of a stillborn child the option to notify the local registrar of the stillbirth. If they do not choose to do so the, the hospital or the midwife is obliged to notify the registrar.  Parents of stillborn children, whose deaths occurred before now and up to the time when this legislation becomes law, will be able to obtain a certificate of the stillbirth on request.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, my colleague Deputy Taylor, on bringing this legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He will be thanked by many parents all over the country, whether they have experienced stillbirth at first hand or not.  It is only right and fitting that our law should recognise stillbirths. Continuing to deny that a life begins, even though it ends in the womb is not acceptable.</P>

It is a measure which is welcomed by the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society.

As the society has said in its correspondence, after ten years of negative discussion on the register at its annual conference, it can look forward this year to welcoming the enactment of the Bill at its conference in April if, following our work today, the Bill makes rapid progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that this legislation is retrospective.  As the Minister said, this is rare.  This is especially welcomed by the society, because this registration will be the only evidence that members of the society have of the existence of their babies.  Many of us who have had children of our own can appreciate, as other speakers have said, at a time of joy and hope, the loss and sense of grieving that is felt by the parents of stillborn children.  Not having it officially recognised must be difficult, especially in the country where there is so much talk about the unborn child.  In such instances it must be particularly difficult for a parent that they have had no formal recognition of their child's birth.  For that reason, and as a woman, I especially welcome the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women went further in their recommendations. It talked of the need for maternity hospitals and units to adapt hospital practices to the needs and wishes of their patients.  This is especially relevant in the case of women who have a miscarriage or a stillborn child.  The psychological well-being of women and their partners at a time of grief must be of primary concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>In this respect I would like to see the implementation of the recommendations of the Second Commission regarding the provision of separate accommodation in maternity hospitals for women who have had a miscarriage or a stillbirth.  Appropriate follow up counselling for women and their partners should also be offered.</P>
    <P>As Senator Neville has said, it is in the natural order of things that parents die before their children and I believe it is difficult for people to commence the <Col N="46" /> grieving process until there is an acknowledgement that there has been a death. Official acknowledgement, as will be possible after the enactment of this Bill, is vital to the commencement of the grieving process.  However, follow up counselling is essential.  Certain measures tend to be postponed because of the lack of funding.  We have over 300 stillbirths a year and it behoves us all in this House to ensure that funding is provided for counselling in this area.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the suggestion by Senator Henry that adequate funding for genetic counselling should be provided. Hitherto it has been difficult for women, who have had to travel to Northern Ireland and Britain for genetic counselling. This is unacceptable.  The women of Ireland have put up with it for long enough and they are now demanding better services.</P>
    <P>In this respect we are relying on the Minister.  I congratulate him on his efforts since taking over this Department and on the efforts made on behalf of women.  I urge him to continue with these efforts and I would like to see the Minister pressing at Cabinet for funding for genetic and other counselling facilities to be made available to women.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate the Minister on the Schedule to the Bill.  Regarding the information to be recorded in the stillbirths register he has again taken note of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The information in the stillbirth register will be ahead of the information that is required in the registration of birth.  For the first time, the forename and surname of the child will be recorded and the mother's forename, surname and occupation will also be recorded.  This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to move forward in this area and to implement this change in the registration of births.  There are some administrative difficulties and, as Senator McGennis said, a general review is taking place on the registration of births, deaths and marriages.  I encourage the Minister to continue his efforts and to ensure these changes will be <Col N="47" /> applied to the registration of all births. As other Members said, this is caring legislation and people have campaigned for it for many years.  I am pleased to welcome it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in giving a warm and enthusiastic welcome to this legislation.  The introduction of this Bill and the Minister's Second Stage speech are evidence of his sensitivity to the trauma which parents, particularly mothers, suffer in circumstances of stillbirths and neonatal deaths.  This trauma is deeply embedded. If we want proof of that, we would find it in the fact that these parents have campaigned for a register for a long time. That is underlined by the degree of retrospection &mdash; an unusual move in legislation which the Minister acknowledged in his speech.  The Minister said he was conscious of the fact that the suffering of bereaved parents of stillborn children can last for a long time, even for decades, and it does.</P>
      <P>The fact we have not taken action before could be an over-extension of the legal principle <i>de minimis non curat lex</i>&mdash; the law is not concerned with very small matters.  These may seem details to the majority of the population because only a small proportion is directly affected.  Although it does not affect society or parents at large, it is a measure of the attitudes and values of society that the small number affected are an integral part of our society and warrant this kind of action.  I am happy the Seanad has the privilege and the opportunity to introduce this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years I have been in contact with parents of stillborn children and I have been touched by the fact that it is a constant preoccupation with them, it is a matter of tension and psychological trauma.  For that reason, it is surprising we did not address this issue earlier.  It is a unique issue which, in my experience in both Houses, has received total and enthusiastic endorsement from all sides. There will, of course, be points of detail and technicalities which will need be considered. <Col N="48" /> Having regard to the contributions made, I am sure the Minister will take them on board.</P>
    <P>Although there was doubt about whether the Bill would make provision for voluntary registration for babies born over the years, I am impressed by the fact that it does.  The Irish Stillborn and Neonatal Death Society which contacted me and many others, including the Minister, was concerned that such a provision would be included in the Bill.  Its inclusion is measure of concern and expedition and I welcome it enthusiastically.</P>
    <P>Those who feel they have been left outside the scope of law for some unimaginable reason over the years, will now feel vindicated because their stillborn children are recognised.  For each mother this is a fundamental experience.</P>
    <P>I join with other Members in welcoming this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.  This legislation will have consequences beyond what anyone could anticipate at this time because of its effect on parents and on society who see it as the role of the Government and the Oireacthas to be sensitive and caring even to a small group.  Although this affects only a small group, and that is what makes it important, it does not lessen their right or entitlements in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I warmly welcome this Bill because I have campaigned for it for a number of years. In 19881 took a group from the executive of the Irish Stillborn and Neonatal Death Society to meet the then Minister for Health.  Although we did not get a stillbirth register, we got money for the ISANDS booklet.  I commend the Minister not only on the Bill but on the fact that he showed more sensitivity than some of the contributors in this House to both parents who are affected by stillbirth.  I rise because of a comment made by Senator Kelly.  In a frivolous and throwaway remark she made a slight at the hurt which a male parent experiences on a loss and she made a slighting reference to the interest of males in this <Col N="49" /> House.  The issue of parenthood and the pain of bereavement are shared by both genders.</P>
      <P>The Minister has done a lot in this Bill. Although it is a slight Bill in many ways, it will bring a great deal of comfort to a large number of people.  I cannot understand why this Bill has been delayed for years.  I campaigned to four Ministers for Health and my correspondence with the present Minister was passed on to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform. Given the size of the State machine, I do not understand why it cannot produce legislation like this which will not be a major consequence in terms of funds or being an imposition on the State.  It will be of immeasurable benefit and it will be of comfort to people whose lives are visited by this dreadful tragedy.</P>
      <P>I would like to address a number of points in the Bill.  Regarding registration and the procedural formalities required, I do not understand why in terms of definition is difficult to deal with this issue.  Should we be so precise as to say &ldquo;500 grammes or more or having a gestational age of 24 weeks&rdquo;?  As another Senator said, what happens where these requirements are not met, where, for example, the child is 23 weeks old or 450 grammes?  The pain and the sense of loss will be as great for those parents.</P>
      <P>From the moment one knows there is a child to the moment the horrific news comes, there is a bonding with the mother and with the caring father.  Perhaps the Minister would consider in his response, or on Report Stage, extending the powers of retrospective registration contained in section 7.  I commend the Minister on that provision because it will give a great deal of comfort.  I met a lady on the 21st anniversary of the loss of her child.  Some 21 years later the pain of the loss was still with her.  The Minister has been humane in allowing retrospective registration in section 7.  Perhaps voluntary registration could be introduced where a child does not meet the 24 week or the 500 grammes requirement because pain exists across the board in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> I commend the Minister.  He has dealt with the issue very sensitively and with speed.  I am disappointed this Bill was not introduced five, six or ten years ago. I welcome all its aspects, particularly the retrospective one.  I ask the Minister to consider whether it would be possible to introduce a voluntary registration element where a stillbirth occurs before the requirements relating to 24 weeks and 500 grammes are reached.  This Bill deals with a need but it may also leave a residual pool of pain and grief which is not addressed.  Other than that comment I have nothing but praise for the Bill.  I commend the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also commend the Minister for initiating the Bill in the Seanad.  As many Members have said, there has been a long campaign for a register of stillbirths.  It has taken a long time for this stage to be reached.  We have all welcomed the Minister's giving this issue close and detailed attention which has resulted in the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that there are more than 300 stillbirths each year.  This means that each year over 300 families have to face the great grief and sadness of a stillbirth and need the option of registering it in an official way.  Any study of psychology will indicate that it is very important to go through the process of grieving for any death, whether it be that of a stillborn baby or of people at any stage of their lives.  This process has not been made official because of the absence of a stillbirth register.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult for parents to come to terms with the fact that their child is stillborn.  I agree with Members that it is equally sad for the father as for the mother.  At least the mother has had the feeling of having carried a child whereas the father has not had the opportunity to relate to the child in any real way.  Such deaths may be psychologically more difficult for the father than for the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is as wide as possible, both in its definition of the stage of the child, whether it be by time or weight, and the way in which the register can be filled, in that the parents can do it if they wish but <Col N="51" /> if they do not do so there is another mechanism by which it can be done. There is no element of compulsion.  From the State's point of view stillbirths are registered but parents do not have to take on the obligation.  I also welcome the option of retrospection.  I do not intend to repeat what other speakers have said. The debate has been wide ranging and very comprehensive.  I add my voice to the voices of others in the House in welcoming the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank all the Senators who contributed for their constructive, sympathetic and understanding contributions to the debate on this important Bill.  The establishment of the stillbirths register will not only bring this country into line with other European Union countries but, more importantly, will provide tangible official evidence for parents of the existence of their stillborn child.  The big tragedy until now was that there was no official recognition that something very important had happened. The great importance of the Bill is that it will make it possible for the parents of the stillborn child to obtain a certificate giving an official, permanent recognition and acknowledgement of the stillbirth. This has been lacking until now.  Parents of stillborn children and, in particular, the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society have made it clear to me that they regard this official validation as a matter of extreme importance to their members.  I pay tribute to ISANDS for their long campaign.  I am more than pleased at this late stage in our history to have been able to meet their very appropriate and essential request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, I have provided for retrospective registration because I recognise that the grief of parents following a stillbirth can be long lasting, perhaps even for decades.  In the absence of retrospection this Bill would have come too late for many people.  I was not prepared to accept this situation, notwithstanding that retrospection provisions of this nature are extremely <Col N="52" /> unusual in legislation.  I have been contacted by parents whose stillbirths took place a considerable time ago and who continue to grieve.  The retrospective provision has no antecedent time limit. This will give all those parents the opportunity to have their stillbirths registered and will help them finally to come to terms with their grief.</P>
    <P>As it would not be possible to obtain a medical certificate for many stillbirths which occurred in the past, I have provided for other forms of supporting evidence for registration purposes, such as hospital records.  The format of the stillbirth registration will be the same for all stillbirths regardless of when they occurred.</P>
    <P>On the question of registration generally, my Department has assumed responsibility for a comprehensive review of the legislation on births, marriages and deaths.  The object of the review, which is ongoing, is to see how this legislation, much of which dates from the last century, can be amended to reflect modern needs and conditions.  The review will take considerable time to complete because of the age of much of the relevant legislation and the complexity of the issues involved.  I was not prepared to await the outcome of that detailed review before providing for registration of stillbirths.</P>
    <P>Many of the points made, particularly by Senators Neville and Henry, relate to very important matters.  Senator Henry gave a very interesting, illuminating and wide ranging speech.  I am sure she is well aware that many of the matters she raised are the responsibility of the Minister for Health and I will bring them to his attention. There was a long comment about the definition aspect of the Bill and I propose to deal with this when we discuss Senator Henry's amendment on this subject. We have to draw a line somewhere. I regard the definition in the Bill as flexible. I wish to confirm to Senators who raised the point that this Bill has nothing to do with abortion.  It has been said that advances in medical care mean that the gestational age and weight at which a child can be viable is reducing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> I considered providing for an amendment of the definition by Ministerial Order but decided against taking this power because there is reason to believe that a provision giving such extensive legislative power to a Minister might be unconstitutional.  As the House knows, I have had sufficient and unfortunate experiences on such an issue without wishing to undertake another one.  I am pleased to have introduced the Bill in the Seanad, which is the appropriate place to have done so.  The quality, breadth and sympathetic nature of the contributions made by so many Senators is ample evidence of this.  I thank them for their thoughtful contributions and help on all aspects of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 9, to delete &ldquo;or having a gestational age of 24 weeks or more&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the Minister but some Senators who spoke after me stressed our concern about the limits on the time after which children can be registered.  Senator O'Kennedy said that this Bill would have far reaching effects, which I think is true. The Minister spoke most sympathetically at the beginning of his speech about how this Bill was introduced to alleviate the grief of parents whose children were born prematurely and did not live.  However, it will also be extremely important in the medical field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious about the Department of Health using one definition in one area and another definition in another.  This is why I pointed out that since 1988 the <Col N="54" /> Department has been using the World Health Organisation's definition of 500 grammes in the perinatal statistics.  I know this refers to a singleton and, naturally, there may be multiple births which are lighter.  However, this can be worked out more easily than the gestational age.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche used the phrase &ldquo;a residual pool of grief&rdquo;.  Wherever we draw the line there will be a residual pool of grief but having two definitions will mean two residual pools of grief: those who did not make it on the 500 grammes limit or the 24 weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon is right in his comments about the decrease in the number of weeks at which a child becomes viable. Twenty eight weeks was considered the absolute limit until a few years ago and it is now down to 24 weeks.  With developments, particularly the development of the lung in the unborn child, we may shortly see it go even lower.  The World Health Organisation is considering reducing the weight level to 400 grammes.</P>
    <P>It is not wise to have two definitions of stillbirth; it would have been better to have one.  I know that, as Senator Roche so eloquently put it, there will be a residual pool of grief but we will be dealing with two rather than one unless we try to simplify the definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Senator Henry.  The weight can be objectively established and is more relevant than the gestational age which is a matter of conjecture in many cases.  There is the additional problem of the age at which a child can survive decreasing.  If there has to be a limit it should be the one which errs most on the side of compassion.  The Minister has clearly shown that he intends to be compassionate and wants to show a compassionate side of the State.  If we must have a limit it should be the one which can be objectively established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the World Health Organisation is considering reducing the limit we should set that limit rather than setting one of 500 grammes.  If a limit has to be set, only one should be set because we do not want to have a situation of double jeopardy.  I <Col N="55" /> am certain that the Minister does not want a situation where people could be hung on one hook or the other.  The whole approach which the Minister has adopted here is one of compassion and to open the door.</P>
    <P>There will also be a practical difficulty in that the weight and the gestational period may not be noted in any official register when it comes to retrospective registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>These are alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I know these are meant to be alternatives.  I am simply saying that what we should do &mdash; and what the Minister aims to do &mdash; is to try and open the door and get rid of pain.  The way to do that is to adopt the limit which is the easiest to establish and the lowest threshold. I stand to be corrected because I have no professional knowledge in this area, but I think that the lowest threshold would be the lowest accepted weight level.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister will give grave consideration to the points made by Senator Henry.  I understand why the two alternatives are given, this is to ease the situation.  However, it would be prudent of us to give much consideration to the point made by Senator Henry. Something which is being put into law now to make the way easy could actually make the way hard, which we do not want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding, unless I am reading it wrongly, is that the Minister is being more free in having the two options.  It is either/or; if the gestation age is 24 weeks but the child has not reached a weight of 500 grammes it can still be registered.  Therefore, it is giving more openings rather than less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go along with Senator O'Sullivan.  I understand that one wants a situation which is as simple and understandable as possible.  When I read that section initially I felt, as Senator <Col N="56" /> O'Sullivan did, that a stillbirth could be well under 500 grammes but because there was a gestation of 24 weeks it was acceptable.  On the other hand, there could be a gestation of less than 24 weeks but a weight of 500 grammes which would also be acceptable.  That was my understanding. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I have given careful consideration to the definition of a stillbirth in the Bill.  The stillbirths register is intended to provide comfort for bereaved parents and I have made the definition as wide as possible, consistent with the accepted medical norms.  The Act will apply to a child born dead which either weighs 500 grammes or more or has a minimum gestational age of 24 weeks.</P>
      <P>There is no universally accepted medical criterion by which to separate a stillbirth from a miscarriage.  A weight criterion of 500 grammes is used by the World Health Organisation.  For the purposes of the Department of Health's perinatal statistics, weight is regarded as being more definitive than gestational age which can be difficult to assess.  Gestational age, on the other hand, more accurately reflects parents' expectations about the outcome of pregnancy than weight which is typically unknown.  There is also the possibility that in a multiple birth if weight is the sole criterion used one child might qualify for the registration and the other would not.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom Government, having canvassed views in its Green Paper on Registration, has decided to retain gestational age as its criterion for stillbirths registration.  As I said on Second Stage, this issue does give rise to a broad range of varying opinions. Senator Henry's amendment seeks to delete the reference to gestational age and, if I understood the contribution of Senator Taylor-Quinn correctly, she was suggesting that the reverse should be the position &mdash; that we should retain gestational age and delete the reference to weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> However, by using both criteria the existing definition will allow &mdash; and this is my intent &mdash; the greatest possible number of stillbirths to be registered. Senator Henry's definition would have the effect of narrowing the definition and reducing the number of registrable stillbirths.  It could prove particularly problematic for retrospective registration as gestational age was the traditional criterion used in the past.  Bearing in mind the therapeutic rationale for the scheme, I believe the definition used should be as inclusive as possible.  Senator Henry's definition would deny registration to some who would be afforded this comfort under the existing definition.  With regret, therefore, I am unable to accept Senator Henry's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that it is not due to lack of compassion that I am trying to point this out.  We are going to have a perinatal statistic in this country detailing stillbirths at one figure and a stillbirth register giving another figure, and both within the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>A number of Senators, Senator Roche in particular, asked if there should perhaps be a register of miscarriages.  That is a matter that would have to be considered. It would be quite an extension of the intention of this Bill which is not to provide for registration of miscarriages. That could cover a broad range of positions at an early stage of pregnancy.

      <P>It is a small point and maybe not important but when it comes to registering, one parent will have to decide to register the stillbirth rather than have the parents do it jointly.  Could we consider allowing them to register it jointly rather than just have one do it?</P>

As I said, perhaps reducing our unemployment rate could do far more for the stillbirth rate than many medical advances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the Minister for Tourism and Trade on the positive impact of his policy for the development of tourism; and urges the Government to continue with an increasing investment in tourism as the most efficient way to economic growth and job creation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister on his first visit to the House.  Tourism has the potential to bring about the most significant growth in the Irish economy.  This fact has not been recognised by senior politicians or public servants in the past.  The Minister has recognised this potential and has succeeded in a short time in putting in place positive action to see this potential realised.  I applaud him for his achievement in removing the &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; tag from the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 we saw the start of the development of the tourism sector and since then the Government has begun to appreciate the growth potential of the industry. This has resulted in considerable increases in Government expenditure <Col N="62" /> and investment.  The return on the Government's investment is there for everybody to see.  It has resulted in £1.3 billion in foreign revenue and an increase of 24,000 jobs and £800 million capital investment in 350 new development projects. This is a good start, but only just the beginning.  Under the stewardship of the Minister, we have seen the industry get a real shot in the arm.  It is characteristic of the man that he saw the possibilities for economic growth and job creation and very quickly put together a strategic plan to release the industry from the shackles that have impeded it for so many years.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the tourism council has brought together for the first time key players in the industry.  This group will play a critical role in putting an end to the haphazard unco-ordinated approach of the past.  It will play a key role in the synchronisation of various interest groups in the industry.  This unity of purpose is vital for achieving results. The Minister's identification of adequately funded marketing as the key factor in driving the industry forward is, as it were, putting the finger on the button.  The attitude of senior politicians and public servants to public expenditure on tourism marketing in the past has been to view it as an expense rather than an investment.  This narrow minded approach stifled the industry in previous years.  There is no logic in refusing to spend a pound if it can make a pound, or, as in the case of tourism marketing, many more pounds.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that the Minister's initiative to put together a new fund of £3 million for a direct hard sell campaign in the United States is exciting and without doubt will bring about the desired result.  The projected benefit is a 17 per cent increase in visitor revenues from the United States.  This represents upwards of 52,000 additional visitors from the US, giving at least 500,000 additional bed nights.  It will create 1,000 new jobs as well as extending seasonal employment and giving a projected annual additional £10 million in gross tax revenues to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> It is also a wonderful achievement for the Minister to have received an additional £5 million for marketing in the recent budget.  The Government are to be congratulated on their foresight in making this significant amount of money available.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, deserves credit for this and other decisions in the budget, namely to improve the regulations for hotel owners in regard to inheritance tax and also to improve the capital allowances from 10 per cent over ten years to 15 per cent over six years.  I ask the Minister to give us some indication tonight as to how this money is to be spent and I urge him to concentrate on the European market and on the off season period.</P>
    <P>The budget shows that this Government recognises the progress the industry has made and its potential to go much further.  However, we are still in my view only scratching the surface in terms of what tourism can achieve for the Irish economy.  I am convinced that our economic future lies in tourism and the service industry rather than in manufacturing industry or agriculture.  At very best we can only hope that manufacturing industry will hold its own in terms of jobs and that agriculture can achieve something similar.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Government has done to date, there is great potential to do much more.  I want to outline to the Minister a number of measures which must be put on the table for consideration in the coming year.  We spent the last three days announcing the creation of 500 jobs in Galway by Boston Scientific. It is a wonderful achievement to get such a company and it is a welcomed by every Galway politician.  However, its impact on the Irish economy pales in significance beside the achievement of Seán Quinn and the impact of his hotel, the Sliabh Russell in Ballyconnell, County Cavan. In that project, he has made an investment of £20 million.  There are 115 people employed on a full-time basis, together with 60 part time jobs.  The project only received 3 per cent of the capital cost, somewhat more than £600,000, in <Col N="64" /> Government grants.  There was not much excitement about the hotel.  Had the Taoiseach not gone to open it we probably would not have known about it.</P>
    <P>When I first visited the hotel, my impression on trying to find the place was that there could not be much of a hotel in the middle of nowhere.  How wrong can a person be.  It used to be nowhere, but it is now the centrepiece of some of the most beautiful rolling Ulster countryside which is becoming known to thousands of people in Ireland and much further afield.  Some 62,000 people stayed in that hotel last year.  The hotel has transformed the whole region.  It has brought enormous spin-off to all kinds of businesses and economic activity in that part of the country.  The sad fact of the matter and the point I am trying to illustrate is that there are few Seán Quinns in this country.  It is only somebody like Seán Quinn or indeed Noel C. Duggan of the Millstreet Equestrian Centre who can put such facilities in place in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The problem is that we politicians do not take the hotel sector seriously.  We seem to have a jaundiced view of hotels, their contribution to the economy, the quality of the employment they offer and the amount of profit they make.  That is evident from the number of cowboys who tried to get into the sector when it appeared under the BES that there were some soft opportunities in that area.</P>
    <P>It is time that we as politicians accepted that a hotel employing 20 people is a far greater economic benefit than a factory employing a similar number.  Hotels put 87 per cent of their sales revenue back into the economy.  For every two jobs in a hotel there is a further job created in other sectors.  Hotels contribute more to GNP than manufacturing industry, with foreign revenue having a particular impact on GNP.  Hotels are the engines of growth in the industry.  For that reason it is economic suicide to charge a hotel 40 per cent corporation tax where manufacturing industry enjoys a rate of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Irish Hotels Federation, whose chief executive, Mr. John Hogan, is here <Col N="65" /> today, has for years called upon the Government to extend the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to hotels engaged in the provision of international services. This year they have put forward a very reasonable proposal to introduce investment allowances to encourage hoteliers to reinvest in their premises and also to allocate 50 per cent of their retained profits to improve marketing campaigns abroad.</P>
    <P>Penalising hotels with a 40 per cent corporation tax is the most regressive form of taxation.  Reducing it to 10 per cent to correspond to manufacturing industry would immediately release a new wave of investment and economic activity, unequalled by any other change in taxation.  The fall-off in revenue to the Exchequer would be made up in a few years because the 40 per cent corporation tax has gone past the point of diminishing returns.  I know the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, feels the same as I do and I urge him to continue his fight for this change.  I appeal today to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to take cognisance of the logic of this proposal.</P>
    <P>The cost of car hire is another deterrent to the development of the industry.  We are out of line with our main competitors in Europe.  The cost of a class A car in Ireland is £259 per week, compared to Portugal which is £88; Spain, £99; Jersey, £136; Scotland, £199; and Florida, £130. This cost must be reduced as it is a negative factor, especially in the shoulder periods.  The reduction in the vehicle registration tax given in the 1993 budget had the effect of reducing the weekly rental cost of a car by 8 per cent.  This should be repeated this year in the Finance Bill and it should be continued on an ongoing basis.  The lost revenue would be regained by the increased number of new cars required for hire.</P>
    <P>While we have considerable capital investment in the industry in recent years we still lack major infrastructural development, for example, all weather facilities such as tropical water facilities which are comparable to those in the rest of Europe.  If we are to succeed in <Col N="66" /> developing a 12 month season and short breaks, which the Minister considers a priority and which is possible if we take the correct action, then we must put such centres in place, especially in the traditional tourist areas of Donegal, Connemara and Kerry.</P>
    <P>Such projects have high capital costs. However, there is a significant amount of international mobile investment which is being attracted to other countries.  We have no proper mechanism to attract such investment here.  It seems ridiculous that the IDA travels the world in search of manufacturing investment which is becoming more difficult to find, yet it cannot talk to a major player in the tourism leisure sector who could invest in such projects.  I am talking about companies as Centre Parks in Holland which has 15 such centres throughout Europe, including Sherwood Forest near Nottingham in England where it invested £70 million.  Centre Parks considered this country, but they were not able to deal here.  I propose that a joint venture between the IDA and Bord Fáilte should be allowed to attract such projects with the same range of incentives as the IDA offer to manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>One of the Minister's and Bord Fáilte's priorities is to extend the season.  I take this opportunity to compliment the Bord Fáilte executives for the great work they do in promoting Ireland.  Direct access from Europe into the west through Shannon is critical to this development.  While scheduled services from the ten major European cities would not be viable in the short or medium term, a structured charter service two or three times per week could be viable if it was underwritten by Government and industry during its infancy and if the required marketing finance was made available over a three year period.  It is an area which could be considered for the £5 million which was announced recently.</P>
    <P>When we consider the off-peak offers to European travel agents by Ashford Castle and Dromoland Castle &mdash; £89 per room for two people, which includes bed and breakfast, and £25 for dinner &mdash; there is no reason why such a luxurious <Col N="67" /> vacation should not become the most sought after in Europe.  Access is a problem. This must be addressed, particularly as Paris is the only place being served by Shannon at present.  This offer is in contrast to the best commercial single rate of £75 per night in a four or five star hotel in Paris or Munich.  It is clear that if we could provide direct access at competitive rates then we could rejuvenate our winter and off-peak season.  The lack of such services into Shannon from Europe is a greater impediment than the perceived loss which the industry in the west became upset about when the Shannon stopover ended.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, will look at developing all year charter services into Shannon.  This would enable hotels to stay open all year round and give continued employment, even if profits in the off-peak period were non-existent.  The Minister's policies have had a positive impact on tourism development.  The most efficient way to economic growth and job creation is to increase investment in tourism.</P>

      <P>I second this motion.  It is nice to see so many distinguished faces in the Visitors Gallery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Senator Fahey, particularly on the point he made about the 10 per cent corporation tax rate for the hotel industry.  I am directly involved in this industry and it is a crippling factor which is stifling investment and expansion.  As Senator Fahey said in his well researched contribution to the House, this is an area with potential for jobs and growth.  There are opportunities for young people and for training.  No other industry requires the same amount of training on an ongoing basis or gives school leavers the opportunity each year to become involved in a training service.  I asked a colleague before Christmas if he could tell me where I could get a good hotel manager.  He laughed and said he would not tell me even if he knew where to find <Col N="68" /> one.  This highlights the opportunities which exist in the hotel trade at present.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Fahey in his remarks about all weather tourist activities. The Government and the EU are not doing enough in this regard.  Our tourism trade lasts five or six months. However, projects such as those developed by Centre Parks, which Senator Fahey mentioned, and all weather activities such as visits to museums have not been seriously considered by Bord Fáilte.  We have great potential and we should consider what can be done in relation to these activities.</P>
    <P>VAT is also stifling those who need to expand.  Little dividend has ever been received by investors because moneys are reinvested.  Tremendous work was done in this country by the pioneers who went to America and saw the facilities which were required.  The late Mr. P.V. Doyle, in particular, did a lot of work in this area.  Many people are employed by hotel groups in their own communities.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made about the Ballyconnell development which is only a few miles from where I live.  This is an area where there were no jobs a few years ago.  It is great to see the investment from Mr. Sean Quinn's empire going back into his local area and creating employment for the people in west County Cavan.</P>
    <P>Tourism is the area of economic activity which has the most potential to raise revenue and to generate employment. Ireland has a range of traditional strengths, including the friendliness of its people, the beauty of its scenery, the richness of its cultural heritage and the quality of its environment.  Over the past four years we have seen the expansion and improvement of our tourist facilities and this has added a dynamic new dimension to Ireland as a tourist centre.  This has created further opportunities to increase our market share and develop new markets.</P>
    <P>However, despite this growth there are still many other challenges to be faced and opportunities to be grasped.  No one knows this better than our own Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy <Col N="69" /> McCreevy, who, through his energy and commitment to developing the tourism industry, has shown that this Government has a vision for tourism that will provide up to half the net growth in the economy over the next five years.  That fact demonstrates the importance of that industry for the economy.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is this Government's commitment to tourism more clearly demonstrated than in the National Development Plan which aims to achieve an increase of 50 per cent, in real terms, in foreign tourism revenue by the end of 1999.  It also aims to secure a much wider spread of tourism income throughout the year.  The plan aims to create up to 35,000 jobs, 6,000 of which will be in construction and associated capital works, with the balance in the tourism sector including arts and culture.  Total investment under the heading of tourism will be over £580 million, which is undoubtedly the largest ever injection of investment in Irish tourism.  That is the Fianna Fáil commitment to tourism.  Elements of this development include specialised tourism such as activity holidays and language learning.  We have one such language college just three miles from my own home in Castlepollard, at Coláiste Clon Lir an Chúil where Spanish, German and French, along with Irish, are taught to the younger generation.  In addition, our own generation can update their language skills there.  The plan also provides for a national conference centre in Dublin for these new facilities which are so badly needed, with the emphasis being on culture and heritage.</P>
    <P>Last week saw the publication of a most positive and far-reaching budget.  It was a caring budget with a range of social welfare increases and additional resources for health and education.  It was a pro-enterprise budget with a range of incentives to encourage enterprise and cut through all the red tape we have unfortunately experienced over so many years.  It was a pro-employment budget with no less than 20 specific measures designed to promote employment.  It was also a pro-tourism budget, as the Minister pointed out, that will lower the costs of <Col N="70" /> the tourism industry and encourage investment as well as providing an additional £5 million boost for promotion. The end result will mean more jobs.  Among the pro-tourism measures contained in the budget are an improvement in capital allowances providing an immediate benefit to Irish hotels resulting in greater investment and, consequently, more jobs.  The budget contains a special £5 million sum to promote and develop tourism in 1994 which we must all welcome.  Promotion and marketing are two of the key priorities in building up a successful industry and this is a particularly welcome measure.  The Minister will be unveiling details of this plan shortly and I look forward to its swift and successful implementation.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention also the forthcoming World Cup football competiton which offers us a unique opportunity to promote Ireland on the global stage.  Various Government departments and State bodies will have a significant role to play in promoting the country at this time. Recognising this, the Minister for Finance allocated £150,000 in last week's budget towards the cost of co-ordinating promotional events connected with the World Cup.  This is too valuable an opportunity to be dealt with in a haphazard manner.  We will not have this chance again for a long time and so we should treat the run up to the World Cup like a well organised campaign with clear goals.  I propose that a World Cup action plan should be put in place detailing a rolling series of complementary actions taking place both here and in the United States, designed to maximise the benefit to Ireland.  This would require tremendous co-ordination and effort on all parts but it would pay off at the end of the day in promoting tourism and jobs here.  As we all know, we have terrific ambassadors in our football team and our band of supporters are well liked throughout the world.  Let us support them to help benefit Ireland and put this action plan in place.</P>
    <P>I have admired the ability the Minister for Tourism and Trade has displayed over the last number of years.  He has been <Col N="71" /> given a very challenging portfolio which can create an enormous amount of jobs and help the economy to grow.  This promotion and investment in tourism can take place under his skilful guidance.  I am glad to second the motion before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;condemns the failure of the Government to (1) provide sufficient resources for marketing Ireland abroad; (2) ensure sufficient funds for a major investment in non-national roads especially in high priority tourist areas; and (3) provide family run hotels with grants from the next operational programme for tourism for the upgrading and extension of accommodation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him every success.  In the limited time available I would like to make a number of general comments on tourism, an expanding industry.  With that expansion come opportunities for the creation of many jobs.  Tourism is also expanding worldwide but Ireland's share is not keeping pace with world growth and, in fact, the gap is widening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of bottle necks to growth in tourism have been identified as follows: the short season; expensive car hire and coach tour costs; expensive petrol and drink; and the poor condition of many roads in tourist areas.  In addition, we are uncompetitive in spring, early summer and early autumn with holidays in sunnier climates.  We have, however, many advantages that can attract more visitors here but our promotion leaves a lot to be desired.  As Senator Fahey said, many promotional efforts are being made which are local, small and unco-ordinated. Too often, one area or product is competing against another and the national impact is therefore lost.  There <Col N="72" /> is a need to combine efforts and create an overall structure that serves Ireland first and local activities and products second.</P>
    <P>The role and effectiveness of Bord Fáilte should be examined.  It has been regarded as successful by some people in some areas of the industry but it is an expensive organisation.  It has an excellent propaganda machine but there are some who feel that that machine is too often used to justify Bord Fáilte itself and to explain away some of its shortcomings. Bord Fáilte's major effort is in the United States' business and up-market tourism sectors.  Fewer of its activities are devoted to the European and ordinary tourist markets, yet all the indications are that the greatest potential for growth exists in these areas.  Bord Fáilte does not enjoy an excellent standing with many people in the tourism industry, particularly the small operator and family-owned business. These are matters that should be addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to marketing, Senator Fahey spoke of the achievements of Seán Quinn in County Cavan.  I want to refer in a parallel way to the achievements of another hotelier, Jim White in Lisdoonvarna, who does his own promotions in mainland Europe, Britain and Northern Ireland.  Over the past few years he has consistently filled 500 bed/nights from mid-March to November in his hotels and other establishments in north Clare.  People like Jim White, Sean Quinn and others who are successful in tourism have experience and expertise in the promotion of that product.  The Minister should avail of that expertise and experience to a greater degree when selling Ireland as a tourist destination.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent scheme of grants which will be paid to farmers to maintain and improve the condition and appearance of their farmyards and fields.  The Irish countryside is largely unspoiled and peaceful and has received favourable comment from many of our overseas visitors. I was in Austria some years ago as a member of a parliamentary delegation and one of the major Austrian concerns about joining the EU was whether they <Col N="73" /> could maintain the grants they pay to farmers to continue living on the mountains. They felt that the presence of the farmers on the slopes ensured that the countryside remained landscaped; they used the term &ldquo;landscaped&rdquo;.  They believed that the landscaped appearance of their countryside was vital to the success of their tourist industry.  At the same time I realised that our policy in relation to some of our most scenic areas was to cover them with a blanket of forests or to let the rushes and scrub run wild.  That contrast in attitude represents the difference in success between ourselves and the Austrians in developing the tourist product.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the village of Doolin in County Clare.  It is a remote village, an outpost on the western coast.  However, it enjoys, international recognition for traditional music and Irish dancing.  I visited the village last Saturday and, although it was the middle of winter, there was a surprising level of activity there.  Cars with registrations from Italy, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Dublin were to be seen.  I do not believe Bord Fáilte or any other agency is selling Doolin.  If they were I wonder what traffic would be there.  However, it shows there is a vast market for culture, heritage and family roots.  We are not exploiting that to the extent we should.  The activity I saw in that village could be replicated in many other villages throughout Ireland if the effort was made.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the changing type of visitor from the United States.  In previous years these visitors either stayed with relatives or hired cars and drove around the country; they stayed in hotels or in bed and breakfast establishments, they ate at roadside restaurants and they visited local pubs.  Such tourists are now virtually non-existent.  Their replacements are now met at the airport.  They are loaded onto buses and are driven from one designated hotel to another.  At all times they are under the watchful eye of the tour guide.  They are not permitted to enter shops or pubs unless those premises have a prior agreement with the <Col N="74" /> guide or coach driver to pay a straight commission on the purchases made by the tourists.  These tourists spend their holidays in virtual captivity.  They are not permitted to go to places of their choice and they never meet the real people of Ireland.  They make little or no contribution to the economy of the small operator.</P>
    <P>The system of counting tourists arriving in Ireland is worthy of comment.  In the opinion of many in the tourism business the figures are the biggest con job of all time.  The numbers are simply not there.  The system should be scrapped and replaced by one that is believable and which reflects true tourist numbers.</P>
    <P>I wish I had more time to discuss other aspects of this matter.  I am encouraged by the constructive nature of the discussion so far.  However, I will revert to a subject which I raised on the Order of Business today.  I want to protest the Office of Public Works proposal to slaughter two-thirds of the Burren goats.</P>

      <P>These goats are a tourist attraction.  They have roamed that territory for centuries; they are unique to it. They are regarded as a protected species. Hippies who, a few years ago, trapped and cooped a few of the goats were heavily fined and threatened with jail.  When there was concern that some of the goats were being captured and exported to Northern Ireland squad cars circled that territory day and night and the practice stopped.</P>
      <P>A few years ago fears were expressed that the numbers had declined to a dangerous level.  A group concerned about their survival was established and a campaign was launched to sponsor a goat.  A woman who visited me at the weekend had responded to the campaign and paid £24 to sponsor two goats.  Their ears were duly tagged with her name and they are now roaming free.  However, she was angry and concerned that some bloodthirsty bureaucrat in the Office of Public Works had decided to shoot her two goats.</P>

      <P>There are two main objections.  The standing of the Office of Public Works is poor in many areas of the Burren for certain reasons and if this unnecessary slaughter goes ahead, the reputation of the Office of Public Works will be beyond redemption.  The reason advanced for this unnecessary cull is that the area is being overgrazed.  If it is and the goats are removed, what will be next? The people who farm the area believe the sheep and their livestock may be the next targets of these individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well. This is a useful time to discuss an important issue like tourism, an industry which has created about 25,000 new jobs and of which the Government demands the creation of another 35,000.  There has been a certain reluctance on the part of the Government, and on the part of the Department of Finance in particular, to put the industry on a level playing field in relation to taxation reliefs, capital allowances and the level of investment by the Government.  Some of those matters were addressed in the recent budget, particularly in relation to tourist coaches. However, the Government's level of input has fallen short.  Although the Minister will welcome the extra £5 million for his Department, I wonder where that <Col N="76" /> money will be spent.  The Minister should tell us exactly where the money will be spent.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the industry can be developed and expanded in many areas and that it has been affected by the problems in Northern Ireland.  We hope the present talks on the joint declaration will bring about the desired result.  The troubles, both there and here, have caused losses to the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>It is the State's duty to invest in marketing, promotion and advertising to create the improved awareness of Ireland that is necessary to encourage more people to visit this country.  We must look at the question of extending the season. For a tourist industry to flourish it is necessary that the country's infrastructure keeps pace with the high quality demanded by our visitors, particularly by improving &mdash; as stated in the amendment &mdash; the county roads.  That brings to mind the problem of our over-priced car hire. The Minister must look at that problem and seek a better return for the tourist.</P>
      <P>At times the Government seems to forget that a new hotel, golf course or leisure centre provides tangible jobs. While great efforts are being made at present to attract industry, and we wish them every success, particularly in getting industry in Galway, the same force should be given to recognising that real sustainable jobs can be provided by tourism. It is one of the few sectors where there is real scope for further development. The Government paid a certain amount of lip service to this in its Programme for Government and many in the industry are gravely concerned that the deeds of the Government and the Minister do not match the fine words in the National Plan or in ministerial speeches.  I do not doubt the Minister's personal commitment to the industry but more can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important when the Minster gets the £5 million that it is not allowed to gather dust at a time when the money should be spent on promotional activities and on productive marketing abroad.  At present the tour operators are launching their own brochures and backing them <Col N="77" /> up with advertising.  I was interested to hear what Senator Howard said in relation to the packaging of coach tours. We have also seen attractions such as the interpretative centres developed.</P>
    <P>I hope that the serious matter Senator Howard mentioned regarding the culling of the goats is given attention.  Where will this stop?  Will it end up with the horses on the Curragh if we do not cry stop?  I am glad Senator Howard has brought this matter to the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we cannot compare our country to places which have the sun, such as France and Spain.  We must carve out different niches in the development of golf and leisure centres, and other industries such as hunting and fishing.  The lack of investment in certain areas of fishing must be examined and the serious problems which have arisen with sea trout.  I welcomed the announcement some time ago by the Minister for the Marine that substantial moneys will be devoted to building up the fishing industry, including fishing in inland waters.  I understand from people on the ground that there is no indication these resources will be devoted to employ management expertise to supervise, monitor and protect these fishing resources.  The present state of the sea trout fishing sector underlines the shortsightedness of such an approach and I ask the Minister to investigate this sector.  Some of our rivers, lakes and coastal waters, while free from pollution, are not being developed to their full potential.</P>
    <P>It is important that our environmental laws are strong and that the Environmental Protection Agency has teeth and that it ensures that environment programmes are well developed to support the tourism industry.  Standards must also be maintained.  Many entrepreneurs who have been successful in various parts of the country have been mentioned this evening.  From the biggest hotels to the smallest bed and breakfast accommodation the highest standards should be maintained.</P>
    <P>Another matter which must be looked at is that of costs and pricing.  In many respects there is tremendous value in this <Col N="78" /> country, but there are some areas where this is not the case.  In particular, I would mention some restaurateurs who will, so to speak, kill the goose before it has laid even one egg.  I would ask the Minister to appeal for a sense of balance so that tourists are not ripped off.  We recognise the great potential of the industry and we must all work for it and support the efforts of Bord Fáilte.  While Bord Fáilte is not without certain faults, I would hope that it will get the Minister's support and that he will meet with it with a view to expanding the industry and ensuring that the necessary promotion and marketing takes place.</P>
    <P>The American market has changed, and Senator Howard is right in saying that we have to look at other markets. We can make greater inroads into the English market and into short stay breaks, and target the European market. We must also try to attract back those who travel to the Continent from here. It would also be worthwhile to consider those who come here as au pairs because if an impression is made on them they will return as tourists at a later date, hopefully with their families.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take on board what I have said regarding the promotion of tourism.  I have no doubt about his personal commitment to tourism and I hope that in his battles at Cabinet he will secure a better result so that all of us can benefit.  The main priority must be to get more people in work and more visitors coming here which will lead to greater prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this discussion on tourism, which is extremely important for our country.  I support the motion complimenting the Minister on the positive impact of his policy for the development of tourism.  It is an endless task to develop tourism properly because of the many possible avenues for development.  We need large investment in tourism because economic growth and job creation are most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to speak first about economic growth and the disadvantaged and <Col N="79" /> peripheral areas in the country.  With set aside and quota restrictions, people will have to find varying ways of earning a proper income in the disadvantaged areas.  I come from the south-west and I am aware of the position in the disadvantaged areas there with young people leaving the land, land being sold and parishes decimated.  In some cases it is not even possible to field a football team.</P>
    <P>We have tremendous potential for the development of tourism.  On the physical side we have the mountains and the sea, our lakes and rivers and good clear air. The greenery of our scenery is a great attraction to people coming from industrial areas.  The openness of our countryside is also a great asset.  We have a lot to offer and promote.  On the human side, the friendliness of our people has been remarked upon over and over again by people who come from foreign countries where, in many cases, they have not time to bid one another good day.</P>
    <P>People in this country still have more time and the friendliness and hospitality offered by the Irish is a tremendous asset which can be marketed abroad.  One aspect which impressed people I met at various conferences last year was how easy it was to mix with Irish people and how quickly visitors felt at home.  That is difficult to market but we must show that we are hospitable.</P>
    <P>We have an ancient heritage.  We know the position in Mayo.  Throughout the country there are raths, forts and other national monuments which are a great tourist attraction, especially for people from the USA and Canada who do not have a history as long as ours.  There were settlements and an advanced civilisation here centuries ago.  We have this on offer and we must promote it.</P>
    <P>Glengarriff and Kenmare are known throughout the world and have been promoted well.  I come from Dunmanway which won the national tidy towns competition in the early 1980s.  The peninsulas in the south west are second to none for scenery, fresh air, sea pursuits, sporting activities, boating, fishing, etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> The islands off the south-west coast must not be forgotten.  Although they have modern facilities, the isolation and the difficulty in getting to them in winter means the island people need other sources of income.  Tourism must be developed on these islands.  People from abroad, and even from our cities, can be attracted to the islands.  The isolation and peacefulness there can lead to an enjoyable holiday.</P>
    <P>I am glad £5 million was provided in the budget for a tourism promotion drive. The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, has earmarked £500,000 for the marketing of Cork Airport.  It is an important airport; Senator Kiely might feel the airport near Killarney is more important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>We also received £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Good, then we can put them together and have £1 million to promote the south west.  It is good to see Cork Airport developing in that way because it is a useful airport for tourism as well as for industrialists and anyone coming into the country.  Positioned on the south of the city, it provides a natural gateway to the tourism facilities in the west Cork region.</P>
      <P>I was also glad to see in the budget that £15 million from the tax amnesty would be devoted to the maintenance and upkeep of non-national roads.  They are most important for tourism.  The long winding roads of our countryside often provide an attraction for people who are more used to modern three lane motorways such as the <i>autobahn</i> or the <i>autostrada.</i> To be able to ramble along on a reasonably good, pothole free road in a rural part of Ireland is a tremendous advantage.  The money from the tax amnesty will be useful here.  It brings the total money allocated to non-national roads this year to £28.3 million, an increase of 113 per cent.  It should have a great effect not just on tourism but for people who use the roads for agriculture or business purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> I commend the Minister for his work. His attitude towards tourism for the future will be positive.  Economic growth can stem from this and result in employment where it is badly needed.  Such employment may be only seasonal but it is better to have a job for part of the year than to be idle for the whole year.  That is a tough statement but any jobs of this nature will bring great benefits to areas where emigration and unemployment are rampant and no other growth exists.  We need tourism in our peripheral and disadvantaged areas.  Family farms, town houses, bed and breakfast establishments and small and large hotel complexes will play their part when properly developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and enthusiastically support the motion. I will point out four steps which may be of use to the Minister and I have one proposal I hope he takes on board.</P>
      <P>I have no axe to grind but I speak from experience.  I grew up in one of the two holiday camps in Ireland which was a marvellous experience for development. My father ran Red Island holiday camp in Skerries, which closed in the 1970s. Later I was on the board of the Imperial Hotel in Cork for 15 years.  I have a background in tourism but no present involvement.</P>
      <P>I take pleasure in recording four recent steps taken in tourism.  The first is the development of electronic marketing with the Gulliver information and reservation system put into operation by Bord Fáilte.  I make a point of praising Bord Fáilte here because I will make points against them later.  The beauty of electronic marketing is that it turns our disadvantage of being on the periphery of Europe into an advantage.  Also, it is an all-Ireland venture.  If Senator Wilson were here he would recognise this as a way for the North and South to work together, something we are all seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second step is the recent recognition that revenue is important, not just numbers.  The crucial issue is not the number of tourists who come but the amount they spend.  We have the benefit of uncrowded beaches and roads.  We <Col N="82" /> must encourage tourists to spend more. I am attracted by the recent efforts to coax conferences here because people attending those conferences spend money.  We should not be just spending money to attract Spanish students to learn English; we should also attract European business people anxious to learn English, who are willing to spend a good deal of money for intensive courses. I am delighted to see some recognition of that.</P>
    <P>My third point, in support of Senator Cosgrave, is that the job of marketing Ireland is definitely a job for the State. Often I argue the State should not be involved in many areas but in this area it should be.  This has been recently recognised and I am glad the budget took steps in this direction.  It is not merely a job for individual parts of the tourism industry. We all benefit from that; I read that 50 pence out of every pound spent here by a tourist goes to the Revenue in one form or other.</P>
    <P>The fourth positive step was the tough stance the Minister took with the main State agency, Bord Fáilte. One of the most distressing aspects of tourism in recent years was the amount of energy wasted in squabbles between the Department and Bord Fáilte and between Bord Fáilte and the tourist industry.  I use the word &ldquo;squabbles&rdquo; purposely.  The sad truth is that Bord Fáilte has over the years lost the trust of its sponsoring Department and of the industry it serves.  Those in the industry may be too diplomatic to put it in those terms but most would privately agree with me.  Instead of a creative cooperative relationship there has been one of confrontation and mistrust.  Someone, and it may have been the Minister, even referred to the board as an independent republic.  I do not wish to rake over the coals of this affair but I want to make sure it is put behind us.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently shown himself ready to stand up to Bord Fáilte and to declare who is the boss.  This has now been underlined by the fact that the money for the new marketing campaign in the United States will be controlled <Col N="83" /> directly by the Government and not by Bord Fáilte.  However, this practice cannot continue.  One cannot run a national tourism effort by bypassing the national tourist office.  I am sure the Minister does not intend to drag all the functions of Bord Fáilte back to his Department.  That is the last thing Irish tourism would need.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have the courage of his convictions and go the whole way in solving the Bord Fáilte problem. Everyone would agree that the agency has lost its way and something must be done to put it back on the rails.  Bord Fáilte should be revitalised and reinvigorated. Bypassing Bord Fáilte, as has been tried before with the setting up of task forces and now with the holding back of their spending power, is only a temporary expedient.</P>
    <P>To carry the medical analogy one step further, what Bord Fáilte needs is not a bypass but a transplant.  I mean this in two specific ways.  First, it needs a transplant in terms of strength from the tourism industry itself.  For years, Bord Fáilte has been crippled by the distance from its core business.  In my teenage days, I attended one of the last meetings of the Irish Tourist Association before it closed down and was placed in the hands of the State.  That was a mistake.  It was also a mistake to swallow up the Irish Goods Council, which had firm roots in industry and the private sector, and bury it in the bureaucratic embrace of Bord Tráchtála. Bord Fáilte needs to reconstitute its structure so that it becomes part of the tourism industry and that industry becomes part of it.  One does not do this with a few token appointments to the board but by putting in place a genuinely representative regional structure and, above all, by coming closer to business, the customers and the people who serve them.</P>
    <P>The second transplant I have in mind is a geographic one.  The only way the Minister can be sure of rejuvenating and reinvigorating Bord Fáilte is by taking it by the scruff of the neck and physically locating it elsewhere.  The headquarters <Col N="84" /> of Bord Fáilte should be moved to the west.  A national tourism organisation needs to be located at a major gateway, and Shannon is the obvious choice. Moving Bord Fáilte to Shannon would be good for the organisation itself.  It would shake it up and force it to take a fresh look at its mission and the way it conducts its business.  It would be good for the west as well.</P>
    <P>When this issue was debated in the National Plan, I pointed out that we had to start reversing the drift of centring everything in the east.  A policy to make the west the national centre for activities that are not location-sensitive, such as services in general and tourism in particular, should be examined.  Moving Bord Fáilte to Shannon would be good for the region.  The area badly needs a number of positive injections if it is to maintain the critical mass of support and to develop its infrastructure and employment.</P>
    <P>I want to see a national tourism effort in which the four main players are pulling together and not apart, which is happening at the moment.  They should first put all their energies into attracting visitors here.  They should then treat them so well that they will want to come back. The four players are the Department of Tourism and Trade, Bord Fáilte, the various elements that make up the industry and, most importantly, the Irish people. If we are to make a real success of tourism and if it is to realise its potential, we have to rediscover the truth that tourism is not only a special sector, a vested interest of those who work in it, but that it concerns all of us.  Tourism is everybody's business. We should work to make it a real winner because we all stand to benefit hugely from that victory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for giving me such a hearty welcome.  I was here on many occasions as Minister for Social Welfare.  Indeed, I was rarely out of this House for Adjournment Debates. However, as Minister for Tourism and Trade, I have only been here on one previous occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> I will take on board many of the interesting comments made by various Senators.  Senator Fahey's contribution summed up the matter when he said that the tourism industry has been regarded as a Cinderella industry for a long time. The Senator also referred to the fact that we have welcomed the recent Galway initiative three times in the last three days and because of this a person said to me that there must have been 1,500 jobs created there.  Senator Fahey also said that a small hotel may employ up to 30-40 people.  This is a highly labour intensive industry.  Small hotels are dotted throughout the country and the spin-off in tourist activities means real jobs for our people.  The various points raised by other Senators illustrate that thought. We are at last beginning to recognise tourism as a real industry which provides real and lasting jobs.  I will take on board the ideas put forward by the Senators, and those of Senator Quinn in particular. Indeed, I set up the Tourist Council for the purpose of making the industry work together.</P>
    <P>The development of the Irish tourism industry is at the heart of the Government's economic and employment growth strategy.  Up to half of the net employment growth in the economy over the next five years will come from tourism. This is set out in our National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>Before I talk about my plans for the new operational programme for tourism, I will refer briefly to what was achieved under the programme that has just ended.  There can be no doubt that it has been a major success.  Practically all of the ambitious targets set for the development of the industry at the outset of the programme have been substantially achieved.  Revenue has increased by 96 per cent or £450 million; overseas visitor numbers are up by 73 per cent or 800,000 people and tourism jobs are up by 90 per cent or 20,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>This performance was achieved through a combination of complementary factors.  Government policies have kept our inflation rates among the lowest in Europe.  The liberal competitive air and sea access policy pursued by the Government has led to a marked <Col N="86" /> reduction in fares and the opening up of new routes into Ireland.  Tax incentives and value added tax policies have encouraged investment.  However, the single biggest contributory factor has been the large scale investment programme undertaken over the last five years in new product, expanded marketing and training, with EU assistance of £170 million.  We now look forward to a new and even more exciting era of tourism development, which is spelled out in the <i>National Development Plan for Ireland, 1994-99.</i></P>
    <P>Since taking office last year, I have consistently maintained that we need efficient, streamlined tourism structures to facilitate a more planned an co-ordinated effort by all involved in the industry. The new Department of Tourism and Trade, with responsibility for overall national tourism policy, has, as envisaged in the Programme for a Partnership Government, provided a central focal point for the sector.  Last September I established the Tourism Council to act as a national forum for consultation between the tourism industry, State tourism agencies and Departments.  Three sub-committees of the council have since been set up to address access, product development and marketing issues and report back to the council.  I understand that all three sub-committees are making progress in their deliberations.  Overall, I expect the Tourism Council will play a vital role in identifying problems and providing guidance in determining tourism policy in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I reached agreement with the regional tourism organisations last October to reform the corporate structures of the organisations.  Arising from that agreement, new structures based on county divisions are in the process of being established to replace the existing regional councils of the RTOs.  Each county, therefore, will be represented by a county tourism committee comprising representatives of the various membership categories within each RTO, including members of voluntary groups and organisations. In addition, new slimmed down boards of management will be established to replace the existing management committees.  Tourism will emerge all the stronger at regional and <Col N="87" /> county level within the new framework. The new structure is practical and well co-ordinated and designed to facilitate the achievement of our tourism targets.</P>
    <P>Due to its labour intensive nature and the problem of low profitability, tourism development is particularly sensitive to the fiscal environment.  In recent months, through the Tourism Council and its committees and in bilateral discussions with the industry, a number of specific concerns have been identified.  I am happy to say that last week's budget addressed many of these in a positive and constructive way.</P>
    <P>The continuation of last year's budget provision relating to the application of vehicle registration tax on the car hire sector has already received a wide welcome. Last year this measure proved very successful in addressing shortages in the car hire fleet, which was its primary objective.  There is strong evidence, however, that it also impacted on price and its retention in this year's budget, together with the actual reduction in vehicle registration tax, will make this important sector more competitive.</P>
    <P>The improved VAT refund arrangements, which will allow coach tour operators a full refund of the VAT paid on certain touring coaches, is also a significant and welcome development.  Irish coach operators have expressed concern about competitive disadvantages, particularly <i>vis-á-vis</i> UK operators who have lower costs.  This measure will result in a major improvement in the Irish operators' cost base which will help the sector to compete efficiently.</P>
    <P>Tourism is not only labour intensive but is made up predominantly of small and medium sized businesses.  It is recognised as the single sector with the greatest potential to deliver much needed jobs in the future.  Many of the measures in the budget, therefore, while not exclusively aimed at the tourism sector will, nevertheless, make a significant impact on its profitability, competitiveness and job creation potential.  These include, for example, the changes relating to capital acquisitions tax, which is of particular benefit to family businesses, the new PRSI rates for low paid workers and <Col N="88" /> access to the new £100 million subsidised loan scheme.  The extension of the urban renewal scheme for another three years is particularly welcome.  By encouraging the revitalisation of previously run-down areas of our key cities and towns the scheme will contribute to the improvement of our tourism environment.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Minister for Finance has made available to me an additional £5 million for a special tourism promotion and development programme in 1994.  This money, in addition to the earlier provision of £3 million in my Estimate for tourism promotion activities, will enable me to provide a major impetus to our marketing drive this year. A special industry led £3 million campaign, focusing on the north American market, will shortly be launched using television, magazines and newspapers.  It will highlight Ireland in a new and vibrant way.  Our target is to increase the number of visitors from the US in 1994 by 57,000. A sum of £100,000 is being made available for tourist promotion in Japan.  A further £100,000 is earmarked for marketing in Australia and New Zealand and £800,000 will be directed at a special campaign to improve business in the shoulder and off peak season.</P>
    <P>I am currently considering how the additional £5 million given to me in the budget for tourism marketing can be best spent.  My priorities will be that the money is targeted at markets where we can expect a real return, but I believe we must be open to new concepts of marketing Ireland.  Ultimately, I want to see an industry which can stand on its own two feet, finance its own development and co-ordinate its marketing on a co-operative basis.  There are signs that we are getting this change.  The product development companies, especially in areas such as golf, gardens and heritage, are providing a co-ordinated and focused vehicle for relatively small operations to contribute to marketing their product. The special initiative on North America, which I already mentioned, has generated a sizeable cash contribution from major tourism players for our promotional campaign in that market.</P>
    <P>The further development of the tourism industry is an integral part of the <Col N="89" /> national development plan.  That plan is essentially an employment plan and the tourism industry is being targeted to provide up to 50 per cent of the net increase in employment envisaged in it.  That is a huge task which will require a momentous effort on the part of all sectors of the industry.  My task as Minister is to ensure that the right climate is created to facilitate this level of performance.  I believe that the proposals for the tourism industry in the plan are a first step in this regard.  These proposals will be expanded upon in the operational programme for tourism which I hope to be in a position to publish before the middle of this year. The principal objective of our tourism strategy over the 1994-99 period is to maximise Ireland's tourism potential by increasing tourism revenue thereby ensuring much needed employment.</P>
    <P>The programme specifically aims by 1999 to do the following: achieve an increase of 50 per cent in real terms, equivalent to an extra £1 billion in foreign tourism revenue; create the equivalent of up to 35,000 full time jobs in the economy; improve significantly the seasonality profile of Irish tourism &mdash; the aim is that by 1999 two-thirds of visitors will holiday outside the peak period compared to about 60 per cent at present; and improve service and quality in the Irish tourism product.  The new operational programme for tourism, 1994-99, will be the key plank in the strategy to achieve these targets.  It will build on the partnership between the public and private sectors initiated under the previous programme.</P>
    <P>The strategy to be pursued under the programme will assist the further development of the tourism sector by concentrating on the following: a large expansion of marketing activities with special emphasis on seasonality; further product development to meet specific market deficiencies; major improvements in the conference, angling and cultural tourism products; and an expansion in the range and scale of training to cater for anticipated employment growth. Planned investment in the tourism sector, as outlined in the National Development Plan, is estimated at £700 million, with EU grant support of £400 million.  We <Col N="90" /> intend to continue practical co-operation in areas of mutual benefit to tourism interests, north and south, in the future with financial assistance from both the EU and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this motion acknowledges the positive impact of my policies in the area of tourism development.  Let me leave nobody in doubt that this Government's commitment to the tourism industry is genuine and I intend to personally steer this industry through the next six years.  It will be an exciting but challenging time when we may have to let go some of the thought processes of the past and face up to new ways of thinking and doing things.  Economic indicators are positive for the foreseeable future and this augurs well for tourism.  According to IMF and OECD forecasts, growth in the OECD area this year is likely to be over 2 per cent compared to 1 per cent last year.  The outlook for the UK economy represents a considerable improvement over recent years and a major opportunity for growth.</P>
    <P>We need to get it right.  Tourism is being looked to not alone to assist in our efforts to achieve economic cohesion with our European partners but to stimulate economic and social development throughout the country.  It has a major role to play over the next six years and I assure Senators that my and this Government's commitment will reflect that important role.</P>
    <P>I have noted the amendment tabled to this motion.  In so far as marketing is concerned, it is clear from what I have said here this evening that sufficient resources are being provided for the marketing of Ireland abroad.  This year there will be £21.7 million available directly to Bord Fáilte for its normal marketing programmes.  In addition, a further £3 million was provided in the 1994 Estimates for a special marketing programme and last week a further £5 million was provided in the budget for an additional tourism promotion in 1994.  It is also planned to make provision in the new operational programme for tourism for a marketing programme over six years, costing over £130 million with European <Col N="91" /> Regional Development Fund assistance of over £50 million.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the condition of many of our secondary roads, which are of importance to tourism, is less than satisfactory.  In this regard, my Department has engaged in discussions with the Department of the Environment with a view to ensuring that certain roads of critical tourism importance are improved.  Provision has been included in the national plan for this purpose and new arrangements are being put in place by the Department of the Environment with local authorities to ensure that sectoral priorities for tourism, industry, etc., are supported.  The question of grant aiding accommodation is under consideration in the context of the proposed new operational programme for tourism.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and I am sure the remaining contributions will be equally enlightening. In general, I hope the following will mark my tenure as Minister for Tourism and Trade: I am not afraid to make mistakes. The number of mistakes made by any successful business person would probably outnumber their successes.  One tries to ensure that one's successes are of greater benefit than one's mistakes. However, one is never going to be successful if one is not prepared to make such decisions.</P>
    <P>Changes are taking place in my Department, some of which I have announced.  For example, I have established the Tourism Council.  Anyone who has any idea, even although it may have been rejected either by the State agency for tourism or the Department of Tourism in the past, should be aware that I am willing to consider all ideas to see if they will work.  Some measures will fail, but we hope the measures we get right will make a marked improvement.  Tourism is the one sector of the economy where we have an advantage.  We can do it ourselves and do it better, and it should lead to lasting and sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. I will take on board many of the ideas put forward and we will run with some of them.  At least, however, <Col N="92" /> we will tease them all out.  I appreciate the opportunity of presenting my views on the tourism sector and I thank the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I may share my time with Senator Neville.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  I hope his flair and marketing ability will have an effect on County Monaghan where I live, because we in the county are the lowest earners from tourism.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this situation.</P>
      <P>We have a certain natural product which has not been developed.  When the Minister is considering how to spend his £5 million he could easily leave a big chunk of it in our part of the country where we have natural resources, coarse fishing, lakes and rivers in abundance, but sadly we do not have many people fishing them at present.</P>
      <P>I hear stories about the 1960s when people, especially English people, came in droves to fish in our lakes.  The development of our lakes did not proceed and the habit waned.  We have to start from scratch and build up that market again.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are close to the Border has also had an impact, but I believe the product we had was deficient.  For example, there are stories about fishermen, who, when leaving in the morning to go to the lake to fish were given a chunk of timber to carry on their shoulder so that they could stand on the muddy banks while fishing.  They did not appreciate that and over time they stopped visiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are lakes in that part of the country in such abundance that we can give people who come to us their own personal lake.  There are hundreds of lakes &mdash; many of which are small, and we have good coarse fishing.  However, the tourism base is so narrow that it is difficult for us to market that kind of a product. We do not have the resources.  For example, there are approximately 1,200 tourist beds in County Monaghan.  When the Minister is considering ideas on how to spend the £5 million, he might look in <Col N="93" /> the direction of County Monaghan and spend some of it there.</P>
    <P>We have fantastic resources which are not being utilised.  There are approximately 4.5 million people in England using their fishing rods every weekend. A small percentage of that market would be wonderful for us.  It is an easy market to handle.  Such visitors do not want very high standards of accommodation.  They tend not to come as families.  They arrive as individuals or as groups of individuals. They fish all day, have a few pints at night, a bit of craic and they are satisfied. All they want is good fishing which they will get in abundance.</P>
    <P>Further development of the resource is required, such as access facilities.  We want to leave the days behind us when the fishermen had to take a wooden pallet on which to stand at edge of the lake. English fishermen use the bank; they do not use boats.</P>
    <P>The wonderful figures the Minister has recorded are not mirrored in County Monaghan or in County Cavan.  We are the lowest earners and have a long way to go.  Having said that, we are making some progress in so far as the Leader Programme and the International Fund for Ireland are providing assistance for development.  Who is willing to make a fairly substantial investment in tourism unless they can be sure they are going to have a return?  It is not a problem if one is living in County Kerry or some place that is well known in the coastal areas. Inland, where there is not a strong tourism base, how is a substantial amount of money to be invested when there may be no return?  This consideration has been holding back our development.  Jack Charlton found, when he wanted a place for his team before a couple of his matches, that the best place was the Nuremore Hotel outside Carrickmacross in County Monaghan.  There are jewels, but they are too few.</P>
    <P>When we in County Monaghan talk about tourism development, we are talking a different language from the kind talked in other parts of the country.  Some developments are taking place, but we require much assistance.  The counties <Col N="94" /> along the western seaboard such as Galway and Donegal are able to make substantial money from tourism.  We have to find some way of maximising our earnings from that sector also.  If we do not we will have a heavy drain on our population and that will lead to its own cycle of problems in our small economies.</P>
    <P>Regarding the development of the golf courses over the past number of years, we were lucky that such development was late in so far as we were able to learn much from other countries where development had already taken place. The golfing tourist arrived at, perhaps, Shannon, headed for Ballybunion, maybe Waterville and then travelled to Dublin.  Such was the scene until recently.  The tourist would play at Royal Dublin, Portmarnock, and then travel to Scotland to complete his tour.  Even golfers without great ability would always go to the Mecca of golf, that is the golf courses recognised world wide as being exceptional.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years we have added a few courses to the list of world renowned golf courses.  However, many golf courses have been developed which will not be a major attraction to international tourism.  Everybody wants to walk in the footsteps of Jack Nicklaus and his likes and everybody wants to hit a green with a drive and an iron similar to Arnold Palmer in the 1960s.  They go to the places where these golfers played; they tend to travel in their footsteps.</P>
    <P>Many of the developments in golf are secondary attractions.  They will help to keep people happy if they visit an area for a holiday, but in most cases golf would not be the primary purpose of their visit, unless there is a golf course like Ballybunion and Portmarnock which is internationally recognised.</P>
    <P>We need to try and feed ourselves as a nation.  We have never managed to do so since we achieved independence.  We have always looked to America, England and foreign lands to feed us.  We are always waiting for another wave of youngsters to leave the country and take the weight off our shoulders.  We have a long way to go.  The development of <Col N="95" /> tourism will make a large contribution and we look forward to achieving the maximum from it.  The Minister has the flair, the knowledge and the interest to take us a long way down that road.  We may be critical from time to time, but he is able to accept that.  He would welcome criticism in order to generate new ideas and approaches.  I hope tourism will make an impact over the next few years which will enable us to keep our people on the island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate him on his address.  I also listened attentively to contributions from other speakers and, for the first time, tourism has been recognised as an industry with a potential for future growth.  The Minister will put his weight behind this in order to reach his targets.  He has already made his mark. He has put his money where his mouth is and this is important.  I am delighted extra revenue has been made available in the budget which will enable the Minister to promote the industry, something which has been neglected.</P>
      <P>Last year I went on a promotional tour on behalf of County Kerry and visited many cities in the United States.  The tour operators and groups I met felt that not enough effort was put into promoting tourism, particularly in North America. There has been a fall-off in North American visitors to Ireland.  Only 5 per cent of Americans hold passports out of a population 250 million.  There is enormous potential for growth in America, Canada, South America, Australia and Japan, an area which the Minister is moving into.  I am excited about Japan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator could go there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been as fortunate as Senator Neville, although I have dined in Japanese restaurants. When one travels to other countries and sees the large numbers of Japanese tourists, it is obvious there is a vast market <Col N="96" /> there.  I will not praise the Minister unreservedly because a lot of work must be done to bring more people to this country in the future.</P>
      <P>Many people, particularly in my county, are dependent on tourism to make a living.  A previous speaker referred to people moving to County Kerry because they were guaranteed a return.  I know a lot of people who came to County Kerry, but left it as quickly as they came in.  They believed the season would last for six or seven months, but it only lasted for four, five or six weeks, particularly in underdeveloped seaside resorts.  While I welcome the announcement about inner city relief and the inclusion of Killarney, I would like all seaside resorts included in that network. It would give those living in these towns and those who have emigrated an incentive to bring back the old seaside family holiday which we were accustomed to before Spain and Portugal became popular.</P>
      <P>There is potential for growth in sea angling, which remains untouched in my area.  Those I introduced to deep sea angling, particularly from the UK, were impressed by the number of fish off the coast.  Last September or October I met people from Wales who fished close to my village.  They stayed up all night to catch fish which they threw back into the water.  They told me there were approximately 7,000 angling clubs in Wales.  I believe that is a market we could develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the climate, many tourists are interested in walks, scenery, historic monuments, etc.  Areas like the Ring of Kerry and different trails could be developed.  At present I am setting up a trail in North Kerry.  Those coming off the Tarbert car ferry will see the bridewell. Local people contributed approximately £100,000 to its restoration and recreated part of their heritage.  I am sure it will be successful in years to come. Many castles located between Ballylongford and Ballybunion have not been utilised. Local people must get together with tourism organisations to take action. Many people come from different parts <Col N="97" /> of the world to visit the Rattoo round tower and the Crag caves in Castleisland.</P>
    <P>With the help of Kerry County Council and Tralee Urban District Council, a heritage centre was built in Tralee.  Some 100,000 people visited the centre last year.  In addition, we received grant aid from the Irish American Partnership Board to restore the old windmill in Tralee and we also restored the old steam train.  We have achieved all this in a small area.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister mention the 400 or 500 jobs in County Galway which have been announced 24 or 25 times.  However, we are barely touching the potential of the hotel and catering market.  The Minister said he will be in the Department of Tourism and Trade for the next five or six years.  I hope he will be there for longer and that he will tell me in future years that I was right.</P>
    <P>I was delighted various areas benefited from the Leader programme.  Although my constituency, North Kerry, did not receive anything, those in south Kerry did.  Many people extended and upgraded their premises by building <i>en suite</i> facilities and business doubled and trebled as a result.  I would like grant aid introduced to seaside resorts and other areas in need of development under the Leader programme.  I do not know whether the entire country comes under the programme, but it would enable people to upgrade their premises.  People will no longer accept a room without an <i>en suite</i> facility.</P>
    <P>Although I have not travelled as extensively as Senator Neville, I lived in the United States for ten years as a young man.  I knew about facilities which Irish people were not accustomed to.  Having returned to the United States on a number of occasions, I can say our facilities are as good as those in any part of the world.  I compliment those involved in tourism, including the Hotels Federation and people running guest houses, on the high standard of hygiene they have introduced. I compliment restaurant owners throughout the country, including County Kerry, on the standard of their <Col N="98" /> restaurants which one would not see in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>We have huge potential for developing markets for sea and inland fishing.  We have clean rivers.  New legislation has been introduced to deal with pollution. Our rivers have definitely improved over the years.  I fish a great deal.  I lived near the River Feale in Listowel, which goes all the way to Abbeyfeale.  I remember fish kills there on numerous occasions. Thank God there has been no such kill there for four or five years.  Last year was one of the best years for salmon and trout fishing on that river.  It is open to tourists to fish in this river.  They can get daily or weekly licences.  We love to see these visitors because they stay in guesthouses in our area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I had the opportunity to be our party's spokesman on tourism in the Lower House for two years.  I found, and I am sure the Minister also found on his appointment, that since 1987 we have had a serious problem in relation to funding the development and promotion of tourism.  The Minister stated that £21.7 million was made available to Bord Fáilte for the national marketing programme. However, this sum is equivalent to the <Col N="99" /> amount by which funding has been continually reduced over the last five years. Thus, there has been no real increase in the amount provided to Bord Fáilte for the North American and other markets. Only a limited amount has been made available.</P>
      <P>The Minister informs us that £5 million is being made available for the promotion of tourism.  I know from experience dealing with Bord Fáilte and others, that a long period is needed to develop the North American market.  This cannot be done over three or four months.  Marketing and promotion of this country must be ongoing.  This additional £5 million for marketing in North America, Japan, Australia and elsewhere is small in real terms in comparison to the cost involved.  However, it is welcome.  The extra £8 million, consisting of the £3 million allocated in the Estimates and the £5 million announced in the budget, is only restoring funding to the levels needed by Bord Fáilte to market Ireland in 1987, 1988 and 1989.  In those years we did not have this money but it is now available. I hope this money will be used wisely for the long term benefit of the country.</P>
      <P>Costs facing tourists when they arrive here is an important aspect of tourism but this was not mentioned by the Minister, and is not referred to very often by many Ministers.  Apart from minor proposals in the budget to help tourism, it provided for increases in the price of petrol, alcohol and cigarettes.  These are extra costs on top of the cost of holidays here.</P>

The £667 million in taxation provided for in the budget will be collected.  Tourists will pay a share of this.  Until there is a policy directed towards reducing taxation and the costs to tourists coming here, it will be difficult to attract the extra tourists we require.</P>
      <P>Finally, in relation to the new proposals on grant aid which will be announced later in the year, it is vital that small hotels, which were mentioned by Senator Kiely and others and which want to provide <i>en suite</i> accommodation, should be considered for grant aid.  This was not the case in the past.  The lack of sufficient and adequate accommodation across the country is serious.  Many areas will not have proper bed nights until they are given help.

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Minister the issue of attacks on tourists, which are damaging to tourism.  Last year <Col N="101" /> there were a spate of robberies in Dublin and other cities which seriously damaged the image and attractiveness of our country to tourists, especially on the continent. Tourists from the continent were often subjected to such attacks.  Visitors to this country are subjected to robberies and physical attacks and their cars are broken into.  Tourists have been raped.  I ask the Minister to impress on the Minister for Justice the need to counteract this problem, to make Garda reinforcements and facilities available and to have a planned approach to controlling tourist crime.</P>
      <P>Cowardly criminals have identified tourists as easy targets.  They have attacked these vulnerable people and shamed our reputation as the nation of a thousand welcomes.  Adequate resources should be made available to the Garda and a special effort should be made at the start of the season because if these cowardly people feel they will be brought to justice at an early stage, the level of crime will be stemmed.  Once tourists know these people will be brought to justice the problem will be nipped in the bud.  It is very important that the experiences of last year are not repeated this year.</P>
      <P>It is also very important that those who have committed such crimes are brought to justice and that the full rigours of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1991, are introduced.  This would mean that District Justices would be used to obtain sworn evidence from tourists before they return home, which could later be presented in court.  Video link-ups can also be arranged to provide the evidence in court to convict these cowardly criminals who are seriously damaging the image of our country and the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objective is to impress on the Minister the need to ensure that crime this year does not reach the same level as last year, when crimes against tourists were committed daily in our capital and other cities.  There should be a planned approach in early May to stamp it out and nip it in the bud.  Criminals should be convicted and made aware that if they <Col N="102" /> attack a tourist they are as likely to be detected as if they attacked an Irish citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fahey and join in the welcome for the Minister. Much could be said about tourism; we have high levels of unemployment and it is an area where jobs can be created far more cheaply than in industry.  Seven out of ten jobs which are being created can be traced back to tourism.  Fifty pence out of every pound spent by tourists goes to the Exchequer.  The more tourists we have the less people will have to pay in taxes.  In most areas we can be proud of our hotels and guesthouses, they are second to none and give great value. They can be something of a rip off in some areas but that happens in every country.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the Minister mention to the Minister for the Environment that our signposting leaves much to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something which should be looked into.  Some people might say that if there were signposts everywhere tourists would never meet the natives because they would be driving so fast.  If tourists have to pull up to speak to people, they discover how friendly the Irish are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> about an award which was given to a Limerick man who was very kind to a tourist.  If we are friendly to tourists and do not rip them off they will act as ambassadors for us.  This man from Limerick met a German tourist and his wife whose car <Col N="103" /> had broken down.  The gear box had gone and this man went to enormous lengths to help them out.  He gave them his own car, sent them away on holidays, sent to Germany for the gear box, came into Shannon, fitted it and had it ready when the Germans, who were strangers to him, came back.  He got an award from Murphy's Brewery and the Cork Tourist Board.  He deserves praise and got his due reward.  We should be as friendly and helpful as possible to tourists because it leaves a very good impression.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville mentioned that, unfortunately, tourists are being robbed.  If there was a garda on every street comer this could not be prevented because, particularly in big cities, it is hard to handle crime.  However, it leaves a bad image and the Government is doing all it can in that area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to hear that the Minister is taking a hands on approach to this matter.  He is investing more money marketing our tourism product abroad.  I am sure we will get greater value in the future because, particularly in the United States, we have not been getting value. There is a great market for us there and I have every confidence that the Minister will do a good job in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who took part in the debate and the Minister. It is rare that an Opposition Senator or Deputy describes a Minister as having flair.  However it was an appropriate description of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, by Senator Cotter.  It is recognised across the board that we have in this important position the man whom we are all confident will deliver on the great potential of the industry.</P>
      <P>I want to dwell on a couple of the points which were made.  Aspects of the tourism industry were discussed tonight which are not the responsibility of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, such as the need for changes in taxation and improvements in transport.</P>

      <P>These issues could perhaps be taken up in a tourism related debate. If the Minister for Finance and perhaps the Minister for Transport were here we could highlight some of the elements of those areas which pertain to the industry.</P>
      <P>With regard to the desire to expand the length of the season, Senator Howard's point about Doolin and Lisdoonvarna sums up the potential which is there.  I am a reasonably frequent visitor to Doolin because I live quite close to it.  There is no doubt that Doolin does not need to be promoted because every day in the town where I live people stop to ask directions to Doolin.  It is known all over Europe.  Rather than develop Doolin further, we should try to develop a couple of hundred Doolins where we could create the atmosphere of that village.  As Senator Howard said, tourists are there at the moment and they are not too bothered by the rain or wind.</P>
      <P>I gave the example of Dromoland Castle where, at the moment, two people can stay for £89 a night for bed and breakfast and £25 for dinner.  This is one of the most luxurious hotels in Europe.  We must be able to bring people from Europe and the United States at this time of the year to stay in a hotel such as that and to enjoy the beauty of the Burren.  It does not matter about the wind and the rain because there is nothing more exciting than sitting on the rocks on Black Head on a bad day enjoying the power of the Atlantic.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made the point that tourism involves all of us.  I recall seeing a slogan in the United States some time ago which read &ldquo;Look after our visitors and save your tax dollars&rdquo;.  The message to be learned from that slogan is that we are all promoters of Irish tourism and the more we look after our visitors the fewer tax pounds we will pay because of the resulting increased tax revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the season, it is a pity that so many hotels are closed today.  I rang five major hotels in the west and south-west today and there was no reply from any of them, they were all closed. We have asked the Minister to introduce <Col N="105" /> improvements for the hotel industry, and we know he is doing that.  However, there is an onus on the people in the industry to extend the season.  These people were shouting about the Shannon stopover but they were closed at the times they wanted daily flights.</P>
    <P>I rang a hotel in Myrtle Beach today and asked how much it would cost to stay there for a week at this time of year, their low season.  A week in a four star hotel where I could play golf on five golf courses with a buggy would cost $129.  I said to the hotelier that surely they did not make money on that.  He replied that they did not but they kept their people at work.  That has got to be the message for Irish hoteliers who believe there is no point in opening for the winter months. I would accept that there is no point opening in the west of Ireland at the <Col N="106" /> moment.  However, I would urge the Minister to open the Shannon gateway from Europe and let tourists come directly on structured chartered flights.  I am confident that we will then be able to keep those hotels open all year round. We will be able to attract people to holiday during the winter which will result in year round employment.</P>
    <P>We can save the west of Ireland, which is my priority as far as tourism is concerned. Tourism is the one industry, as I said at the outset, which can bring about economic growth and job creation. I am delighted the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is in the driving seat and I wish him luck in his task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I thank you for giving me an opportunity <Col N="107" /> to raise this important matter and I am pleased that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has graced the House this evening.  Undoubtedly the Minister has at his disposal the RRD Leader research programme report prepared by J. Mannion, J. Phelan, J. Kinsella and M. Kenny on the milk suppliers in County Clare.</P>
      <P>Clare is primarily an agricultural county and specifically a dairy county. In 1992-93 there were over 2,332 milk suppliers in County Clare supplying milk to five different co-operatives.  In the course of the study it became evident that of these 2,332 milk suppliers about a third would be forced to cease production of milk at some time in the near future.  A high percentage of the remaining two thirds, about 48 per cent, were in danger and would need substantial support and assistance to maintain employment in the agriculture sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government are undoubtedly aware of the importance of agriculture in employment.  Unemployment in Clare is a serious problem. Unemployment, emigration and migration have left their mark across the entire county and the loss of any jobs in the dairying sector would have severe repercussions for the rural communities and for the towns throughout the county.</P>
      <P>This study proposes initially to attempt to hold as many of those at risk farmers on the land and in dairying.  It is accepted that it will not be possible for some of them to continue in dairying but some could be kept in dairying with some support from the Minister, his Department and through the structural funding from Europe.</P>
      <P>It is very important that the Minister and his Department look seriously at this study.  We must accept the sincerity of RRD Leader and in particular Father Harry Bohan, who has done tremendous work for rural communities in Clare and throughout Ireland, in the commissioning and preparation of this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The findings in one sense are frightening but they are presenting facts and identifying the problems.  Prevention is always better than cure.  They are asking the Minister to administer a prevention <Col N="108" /> formula rather than trying to treat something much later that may be incurable. We do not want to see a further reduction in the numbers in rural communities in County Clare or a further reduction in the services provided in the rural communities &mdash; post offices, Garda stations, or schools.  When fewer people live in a rural area services decline.</P>
    <P>This is in a sense a case study for the entire west of Ireland.  Every county from west Cork right up to west Donegal has similar problems.</P>
    <P>This study asks that the recommendations outlined in it would be implemented by the Minister on a pilot basis in County Clare over a period of three to four years and closely monitored. If they prove successful a similar type of proposal would be administered on a national basis.  I know that the Minister and his Department have looked at it and support has come from the Minister's Department in relation to this study.  The bottom line is the implementation of the report and its recommendations.  Support in the form of subsidies is needed to update housing facilities on dairy farms for milk purposes, to provide an opportunity to farmers to purchase additional quotas.  Greater emphasis should be placed on the provision of support from Teagasc, particularly to direct and monitor those farmers in the high risk category so as to ensure that they do not have to leave farming.  The Minister will see from the report the type of annual income many of these farmers receive and that over 48 per cent of the milk suppliers in County Clare are in the 9,000 gallon quota category.  The Minister will agree this is a low quota relative to that in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>This is a fine study commissioned by people with genuine concern for the county and supported by all the farming and community organisations, both urban and rural.  The business people in the towns recognise that unless there is a viable economy in the surrounding rural areas they will not be able to operate viable businesses.  The study has extensive support throughout the county and has been welcomed by all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> The Minister must now approve the implementation of the specific recommendations made in the report.  I ask him to consider this seriously so that they will be implemented in County Clare on a pilot basis for three to four years and perhaps afterwards at national level.  The Minister must recognise that the money involved is relatively small &mdash; approximately £15 million &mdash; when one considers that we are talking about 1,300 farming jobs which could be at risk.  One is talking about a small investment to secure these jobs relative to the cost of job creation in the industrial sector.  This report should commend itself to the Minister and I ask him to give it his full support.</P>
    <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me this opportunity to present this case to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by this debate to say a few words in the Seanad on the Clare Leader group study and on the recommendations made about the milk quota restructuring arising from that study.  I have also listened carefully to the case made by Senator Taylor-Quinn.</P>
      <P>Senior officials in my Department and I have had ongoing contact with the Clare Leader group since the study was launched.  I took the opportunity to visit County Clare to officially launch the study and I met Fr. Harry Bohan and the other people associated with the enterprise. Since then, senior officials from my Department have had several meetings with the group and have had the opportunity to discuss in depth the ideas presented.  I was impressed with the study and the recommendations the group put forward.  I instructed senior officials in the Department to study this report in depth and to work closely with the group in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Clare study clearly demonstrates the vital social and economic role played by milk production in the area.  Milk production is the most lucrative farm enterprise in disadvantaged parts of the country and we must retain the milk pool in the area if we want to maintain rural communities.  The recommendation for a pilot milk quota restructuring scheme <Col N="110" /> follows from the recommendation in the report.  As recently as last Friday the group presented its recommendation to the Department.  In the context of a meeting with senior officials, various details were teased out and the implications of such a scheme were examined in depth.</P>
    <P>I applaud and understand the objectives of the Clare Leader group.  I have always recognised the importance of milk production for the local economies.  In the more disadvantaged areas where alternatives to milk production are limited, this is even more the case.  As a rural development instrument, a milk quota tied to land is of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>In the light of this, my approach to the management of the milk quota system and, indeed, to the renegotiation of the regime at European Community level, which took place in 1992, has been underpinned at every stage by a commitment to the small quota holder.  There are a number of schemes in the quota system which provide flexibility to dairy farmers either to permanently increase their quota or to lease additional quota without land on a short term basis.  There is also a scheme which provides for the reallocation of unused quota at the end of each year to producers who have exceeded their allocated quota and thus risk having to pay superlevy.  In each of these schemes absolute priority is given to smaller producers and only when the needs of such producers are fully catered for can larger producers benefit.</P>
    <P>These schemes work extremely well throughout the country and have contributed greatly to the ability of smaller producers to improve their lot.  For example, the existing quota restructuring scheme which allows for the sale of quota by producers ceasing milk production to those wishing to expand has to date diverted approximately 80 million gallons of milk to small producers.  Notwithstanding the orientation of the redistribution and reallocation schemes to small producers, the fact remains that in outlying and isolated rural areas smaller farmers are giving up milk production. The Department operates with the best will in the world in the administration of the schemes.  The smaller farmers who <Col N="111" /> have little help on the farm should be encouraged to retain milk production on each individual farm.  Co-operatives serving those areas should also be encouraged to service the smaller milk producers in the outlying areas.</P>
    <P>During last year's EU price review, I succeeded in negotiating an additional 6.6 million gallons of quota for Ireland as well as 1.9 million ECUs to be used towards the restructuring of quotas.  It was my firm intention that the bulk of the quota and the money would be used for the benefit of small producers who had demonstrated both a commitment to milk production and a need for additional quota.  With this in mind, strict criteria were devised to target such small producers and I hope to be in a position soon to make the quota allocations to individual farmers.  I hope those allocations of milk, which will be free of charge, will keep a considerable number of smaller farmers in milk production.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it can be seen that what the Clare Leader group is attempting to do in its area is similar to what I have been doing through the Department at national level.  The group recommends that moneys be made available to certain categories of milk producer to upgrade facilities in the light of the new EU hygiene regulations.  I share the thinking of the Clare group in this regard and I have already made provision for substantial funds to be made available from the Structural Funds for this purpose in the context of the National Development Plan.  This plan, as the Seanad will be aware, is currently under consideration by the European Commission and until such time as this process is complete, details of a grant scheme for dairy farmers cannot be finalised.  However, I take note of the views of the Clare group on this matter and I will take them into account when the scheme is being put in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> Apart from the moneys to be provided under the Structural Funds, I succeeded in having 6 million ECUs from the EU Co-responsibility Fund made available for upgrading and providing on-farm refrigeration equipment for milking machine maintenance.  This scheme is up and running at present and the individual grants are extremely attractive.  Here again, smaller producers are given priority in order to ensure that everything possible is done to allow them not only to remain in milk production but to encourage them to realise fully their potential to develop their holdings still further.</P>
    <P>I have also asked Teagasc, through their advisory services, to give special attention to these smaller milk producers. Additional funds were made available last year, and are being made available again this year, for a special intensive small farmer advisory service. It is mainly situated, of course, in the west of Ireland, including Clare.  I would hope and expect that the Teagasc advisers would also contribute to keeping these small milk producers in business.</P>
    <P>I am fully conversant with the original study carried out by the Clare Leader Group, and have considered the recommendations derived from that for a pilot scheme in Clare.  The recommendations are being examined by my Department and are being considered in the context of the management of the milk quota system in the country as a whole.  A total review of the milk quota system is to be implemented nationally.  The Clare Leader Group report is of tremendous benefit to this review which is nearing completion.  I will have it implemented in a very short time.</P>
    <P>The objectives set out by the Clare Leader Group already reflect my overall approach to the milk quota system throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 February 1994.</P>
