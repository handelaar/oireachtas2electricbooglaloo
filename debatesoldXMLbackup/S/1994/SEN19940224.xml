      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to clarify the current position regarding the proposed erection of the Loren C mast at Loop Head, County Clare, and if he will instruct the Commissioners for Irish Lights, who have been acting as his agent not to appeal to An Bord Pleanála the decision of Clare County Council who refused planning permission.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty about Item 1 being taken without debate. Has the Leader made progress on the debate on Northern Ireland?  Given developments at the weekend and statements made by Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday, it is appropriate that we have an opportunity to review the situation two months after the Downing Street Declaration. As a consequence of last night's vote in Private Members' Time, will the Leader confirm proposals to install electronic voting in the House?</P>

Two full days have been set aside for this and there will be late sittings on both days.  Many other Bills are also on the way to us and there is an extensive amount of work to do.

      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West</i>): Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are essentially drafting ones, which make no substantial change to the meaning of the section. They simply clarify that more than one map can be used.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (3), line 11, after &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or for reasons of safety&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister.  The effect of the amendment is to clarify the circumstances in which the owner or occupier of a monument must give notice to the Commissioners of Public Works about alterations and so on.  There is an exemption in the Bill which states &ldquo;in the case of urgent necessity&rdquo;.  The question arises as to whether reasons of safety are converted by the phrase &ldquo;urgent necessity&rdquo;. I will wait for the Minister's reply <Col N="781" /> before commenting further on the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Donegal South-West</i>): The words &ldquo;urgent necessity&rdquo; are intended mainly to cover reasons of safety.  There is no need to use the two terms.  It is preferable to have one clear comprehensive term.  What is more urgent than safety?  Reasons of safety are provided for in the words &ldquo;urgent necessity&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.16:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) When the owner or occupier (being the commissioners) of a monument or place which has been recorded under <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section or any person proposes to carry out, or to cause or permit the carrying out of, any work at or in relation to such monument or place, he shall first consult with the National Heritage Council and thereafter give notice in writing to the Minister of the proposals to carry out work and shall not, except in urgent necessity or for reasons of safety and with the consent of the Minister, commence the work for a period of two months after having given the notice.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is more substantial than amendment No. 17.  Section 12 (3) refers to the responsibilities of owners and occupiers of national monuments, other than the Commissioners of Public Works. The purpose of the amendment is to impose the same responsibilities on the commissioners.  It is important that the commissioners should not be exempt from the same restrictions imposed to others.  To do so would give them such <Col N="782" /> latitude that it would render the Bill totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the commissioners should consult the National Heritage Council and, thereafter, give notice of their proposals in writing to the Minister.  The reason is simple; the National Heritage Council, or some other competent body, could be given a role in this matter.  The heritage section of the Programme for a Partnership Government states that the National Heritage Council will be placed on a statutory footing.  If this happens, there are very good reasons it is the body which should be consulted.  Even if it were never to be placed on a statutory footing, there are plenty of precedents in legislation passed by this House over the years to allow non-statutory bodies to be consulted on matters like this.  The responsibilities of the commissioners under law should not be different from those of the private citizen.  They should have a duty to consult some competent body, which we recommend should be the National Heritage Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless Senator Dardis's amendment or mine is accepted, a different situation will apply to the commissioners from that applying to private owners and others.  It is essential that where the commissioners are proposing to carry out work, proper notice of the proposal should be given and people must be aware of it.  A situation has already occurred where the commissioners, without notifying people, were able to commence work.  They were treated entirely differently from other parties which is not proper.  When work is being carried out, the commissioners and other parties should all be treated equally in law.  Section 12 (3) creates a distinct difference and this is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instances where the commissioners have carried out their responsibilities, without obtaining permission, have led to considerable difficulties when the commissioners did not have to proceed in the way which normally applies to other parties carrying out works.  They did not <Col N="783" /> have to apply for planning permission or have obligations imposed on them, which are imposed on other parties.  The purpose of my amendment is to make certain that the commissioners and everybody else have the same responsibilities.  The commissioners should be equally obliged to give notice in writing of their intention to carry out works.  The Minister should also be notified.  It is essential that from now on there is no distinction when works are being carried out and that the commissioners are obliged to serve proper and adequate notice, like everybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West) Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> The functions of the Heritage Council will be set out in a separate Bill and it would be inappropriate to make provision as proposed in this amendment. This proposed subsection is precisely the same as subsection 5 (8) of the 1987 Act which provides for registered monuments and it would not be logical to provide for more rigorous procedures in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not appropriate to provide in this Bill for the commissioners and other owners of recorded monuments to notify the relevant local authorities of proposed works.  The planning Acts are the proper place to provide for such procedures.  If the amendment was accepted, land owners could find themselves having to deal with the same local authority under two separate codes of legislation &mdash; the Planning Acts and the National Monuments Acts &mdash; in regard to a single development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is compiling the list of monuments and it is in the best position to know if developments are likely to harm a monument.  Under the planning regulations, the planning authority is obliged to consult with the monuments advisory body in relation to planning applications for developments in the vicinity of monuments.  While there is no advisory body in existence at present, it is expected that this function will be taken over by the proposed statutory heritage council.  This arrangement ensures that there is a liaison with the local authority in regard to monuments. <Col N="784" /> Amendment No. 19a which I am introducing proposes to place on the Commissioners of Public Works the requirement to go before the Oireachtas in cases where they propose to interfere with such a monument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard that answer as satisfactory.  There is a great deal of talk at the moment about consultation on matters such as Mullaghmore &mdash; which is not the same as the national monuments issue but involves the same principle. When it is really put up to the Government to consult with people it does not do so.  It is illogical for the commissioners to consult themselves, but who else can they consult?  I suggest that the National Heritage Council which we are about to put on a statutory footing would be the appropriate body.</P>
      <P>It is not consistent to say that the Oireachtas should be the arbiters of tastes.  That institutionalises the rights of the commissioners and brings us into the difficult area of defining good taste.  We would have to say that the people who worked on the restoration of the Seanad Chamber exemplified good taste. However, we can think of many precedents within our history where the official State taste, as represented by the commissioners, was totally out of keeping with any objective assessment of what good taste might be in artistic or other terms.</P>
      <P>An Taisce has made substantial representations on this matter.  In a letter to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, dated 3 December 1993, it stated:</P>
      <P>The need to provide quality standards in relation to work done to monuments needs to be addressed whether this work is done by State agencies or private owners.  At present, the Commissioners of Public Works are the sole arbiters of quality standards in regard to any works done to the national monuments and they have no obligation to consult any other body before making decisions in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> The letter goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Effectively, the Commissioners of Public Works are exempt from the planning process for any works they do to national monuments.  An Taisce would recommend that this Bill should incorporate the principles of the Granada Convention, 1985, adopted by the Council of Europe members, including Ireland.  There is a considerable amount of international data in this context that would be drawn on including the attached Charter of Venice, 1966, by the International Conference of Monuments and Sites of which the Office of Public Works is a member. Articles 1, 6, 7 and 11 of the Venice Charter are particularly relevant in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It further states:</P>
    <P>An Taisce is urging that the principle of quality standards should be included in the text of the Bill but that the detail could be left to ministerial regulations and should include a consultative process, which could be a function that could be assigned to the national heritage council, which could form part of this Bill designed to give it statutory recognition which forms part of a commitment by Government.</P>
    <P>If a body of the stature and importance of An Taisce feel that way about this matter I submit that the Government should feel the same way.  The Minister has made the point that this should be incorporated into the planning acts.  On a regular basis in this House, it is given as a reason for not improving a Bill before us that certain provisions are to be incorporated into some other legislation. However, that does not happen.  Once the Bill is passed through the House it is forgotten about and we rarely, if ever, come back to incorporate the changes advocated in one Bill into other legislation. I do not see anything wrong with people being governed by two sets of legislation.  Local authorities are governed by a multitude of legislation and they are able to work wihin that ambit. The fact that we have two areas of legislation, <Col N="786" /> one in the planning Acts and one in the National Monuments Bill, does not create an impediment.  I am not clear about the functions of the National Heritage Council when it is put on a statutory footing.  I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify the comments he made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum makes this quite clear.  It states: Subsection (3) provides that an owner or occupier of a monument or place recorded under subsection (1) shall not carry out any work on the monument or place so recorded unless he gives prior notice in writing to the commissioners. The owner or occupier has a responsibility to notify the commissioners.  Whatever other powers the commissioners have, they are not infallible.  The Minister stated that the commissioners know best. That is the wrong approach.  I have put on record my praise of the works carried out by the commissioners over the years. However, on occasions I have disagreed with some of their work.  I am seeking that where the commissioners are carrying out works on a recorded monument, there should at least be notices placed in newspapers and adequate notice given to the owner of the property.  The public should be informed that these works are to be carried out.  It would be wrong for the Minister to proceed without seeking to give adequate written notice to the relevant local authority and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Dardis's proposal about the National Heritage Council. The local authorities are charged with responsibilities in regard to planning. If work is going to be carried out on any monument the local authority should at least have an opportunity to see the proposals.  They could debate them publicly and the local or national press might be interested.  The local public representatives would then at least have the opportunity to agree, disagree or comment on the matter.  I have considered the question of the National Heritage Council, but the local authority should be involved.  It will not be an expensive <Col N="787" /> proposal but a notice in writing should be circulated.</P>
    <P>Lately many Bills have been challenged in regard to their constitutionality. The Family Home Bill in regard to joint tenancies, for example, has been held to be unconstitutional. According to one of the national newspapers, the Council of State may have to meet to discuss the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill.  Reservations have also been expressed here about the constitutionality of section 11 of this Bill.  If there is to be one law for one person and another for somebody else, there may be a constitutional challenge to this section. Local people in the area around the monument should be allowed some input.  There are historical societies in most of the counties we represent, comprised of serious people who take an active interest in their local areas.  The amount of work they have done to date &mdash; and their splendid research &mdash; is proof of their active interest in these historical sites.  The failure of the Government to take this on board is a regrograde step.</P>
    <P>There have been problems with this matter in the past in Counties Wicklow, Clare and Meath because specific applications were not made and planning permission was not obtained.  All I seek is a simple amendment which would meet reasonable requirements, would be regarded as fair and allow those with local knowledge to have some input, rather than giving all the power to the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a consultation procedure incorporated between the Commissioners of Public Works and the planning authorities as we are all conscious of the need to preserve our amenities.  All our buildings must blend with the areas around them.  I hope this Bill will incorporate consultation procedures.  We do not need to go beyond having the local authorities and people involved.  The planning of such a consultation procedure has already been indicated and must be incorporated because we are all involved in the preservation <Col N="788" /> of our amenities and of national monuments in our areas.</P>
      <P>One can think of many such monuments where access must be referred to the local authority because it is responsible for the land surrounding the monument. One such example in my constituency, Rathfarnham Castle, belongs to the Office of Public Works while the surrounding land is the responsibility of the local authority. There is already a high level of consultation there.  Every time there is a discussion in regard to the Office of Public Works, there is also one with the local authority; it is a joint meeting.  I am happy with that consultation procedure but it needs to be reinforced.  Our areas are becoming increasingly tied to each other.  We are all conscious of our environment and there are monuments of great prestige in many areas.  The people want a consultation procedure but it is already in place.  Perhaps the Minister will refer to it again in the context of my statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West) Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I emphasise that the Heritage Council is not a State body.  It does not provide for consultation, but we must consider that it is now intended to make it a statutory body.  The new Bill will provide for the functions of the existing heritage council. In my original contribution, I said that although there is no advisory body in existence, it is expected that this function will be taken over by the proposed statutory heritage council.  While I cannot give a categorical assurance, it is our intention to introduce legislation this year to place the council on a statutory footing.</P>
      <P>If any landowner or occupier wishes to do work on an area of land that might be recorded as a national monument, he would have to give two months' notice to the Office of Public Works, who will investigate it.  Permission will be given if it is not a monument of importance, but that is a matter for negotiation between the two parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning permission is not required for the restoration of monuments.  The Senators will appreciate that if it was <Col N="789" /> required, it would be up to the Office of Public Works to submit an application to the relevant local authority.  However, as we are all aware because of last year's events, planning permission is necessary for the erection of a new building and consultation will take place with the relevant local authority.  Planning permission is not necessary for restoration purposes, but it would be necessary if the monument was to be extended or changed in any way.  The Office of Public Works will follow the procedures laid down as a result of the events last year.</P>
    <P>The national council, which I hope will be on a statutory footing this year, will deal with this matter adequately.  I do not want to seem difficult, but we are confident that this council and the current planning permission laws and regulations will allow for consultation between the Office of Public Works and the local authority.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if there is any question of changing a monument, it will be necessary to consult and obtain the permission of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  If the Minister agrees with the proposals, he must lay this decision before the Oireachtas.  That is another manner of consultation, except in the cases of public health and safety and that would be only in extreme circumstances. If the Minister agrees with the proposals to demolish a national monument and goes before the Houses of the Oireachtas, it will be transparent and give the Houses the opportunity to air their views.  There is adequate room for consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The record is important.  I queried on Second Stage how the new record would compare with the list which is currently in the possession of each local authority.  Each authority has a list with maps and details of every national monument in its area which was compiled over a long period.  Much work was put into that project, including aerial photography which identified sites.  In one county an additional 1,000 sites which had not been previously recorded were discovered.  I ask for some clarification as to the relationship between the new record and the record which each local authority already has.  In light of the new information from the Commissioners of Public Works, a number of applications for planning permission have been revised and, in some cases, refused.</P>
      <P>I advise the Minister to be cautious about giving statutory authority to another organisation, particularly the Heritage Council.  There is already sufficient statutory provision for what needs to be done.  It is duplication and a waste of both human and financial resources to establish another statutory council to deal with the same area and it will lead to confusion among the public.  At the end of the day, somebody must make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been more consultation about Mullaghmore than any other project since the foundation of this State. Certain people refuse to accept any decision, even a decision as to whether an application for planning permission should be made.  Who will ultimately make such decisions?  I would be cautious about creating, as is being suggested, another statutory organisation such as the Heritage Council to do what is already being provided for in this legislation. These amendments are unnecessary. The Minister should be very cautious about establishing a statutory Heritage <Col N="791" /> Council.  It should not be done without a detailed examination of this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that some of these matters should be dealt with by planning laws and then we were told that planning permission is not required.  Where does that leave us?  I am sure the Minister will agree that there is an absolute obligation on the State to protect our national monuments as part of our heritage and that nothing should be done to destroy them.  Does the Minister not accept that the commissioners have the same obligations as a private individual who is the occupier of a national monument?  This is the central question.  Does the State not have the same obligation as the private individual? We are in a fairly sorry mess.</P>

      <P>Section 11 refers to the provision of facilities for persons who have access to the monument.  In other words this allows extensive work to be <Col N="792" /> carried out.  That is a simple example of how far this can go.  The commissioners can carry out those works without notifying, in writing, the relevant local authority.</P>
      <P>When works have been carried out the Office of Public Works has been exceptionally helpful and has notified people about various national monuments in Offaly.  There is goodwill at present but when passing legislation of this nature it should be specified that the local authority must be notified in writing.  I seek this or something in the nature of Senator Dardis's amendment which requires consultation with the National Heritage Council.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly mentioned the consultation process with regard to Mullaghmore. In a matter of such national and European importance, consultation is essential.

      <P>My amendment may seem frivolous, but it is important as it deals with metal detectors and detection devices.  It seeks to exclude from this legislation devices used for agricultural purposes.  This is an important point because it is now routine practice to fit forage harvesting machinery and combine harvesters with metal detectors or detection devices.  These shut off the machine so that it will not be damaged if it picks up a piece of metal.  These devices should be specifically excluded in the legislation because someone who has such equipment on agricultural machinery could be in trouble.  The device detects an archaeological object above the ground.  It is an advantage to have it on a machine because it can detect tems, such as flails which may have become detached from mowing machines, and shut down the machine to avoid damaging it.  I realise the Minister does not wish to prosecute people who have such devices but it is important to specifically exclude them.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis because when a detector is in place it may not be removed.  It may be possible to abuse conditions which state that a local farmer may have a metal detector on his machine.

      <P>Senator Dardis's amendment shows common sense.  It would also be possible to insert words such as &ldquo;the user in possession of a detection device for the purpose of searching for objects&rdquo;. The Minister is trying to prevent people using metal dectors to look for valuable objects because they have been abused. I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Donegal South-West</i>): The term &ldquo;detection device&rdquo; is defined in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, as a &ldquo;device designed or adapted for detecting or locating any metal or mineral on or in the ground, on, in or under the sea bed or on or in land covered by water, but does not include a camera.&rdquo; Section 12 (5) extends the protection of national monuments contained in the 1987 Act to monuments recorded under section 12 of this Bill.  The term &ldquo;detection device&rdquo; would not include a device used solely for agricultural purposes. Under existing law, it is an offence to use the device at a protected monument, or anywhere else, for the purpose of searching for an archaeological object.  We want to ensure this cannot be used in the areas where there are 150,000 recorded monuments. Senator Dardis gave a practical example of a combine harvester which has a metal detector attached to it.  This is, of course, being used solely for agricultural purposes and thus the law is not being broken.  A metal-detector is used solely for detecting archaeological objects, while the combine harvester with a metal detector is used solely for agricultural purposes.  I see no difficulty with this in that it is not breaking the law.</P>

However, I am even more confused on the basis of what he has said about section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1993 which refers to a device designed <Col N="796" /> for detection of metal above or below ground.  That is specifically what these attachments to agricultural machines are designed for.  They are designed to detect metal and to ensure that the machine stops.  I realise that the Minister would not wish to see anybody prosecuted for possession of one of these metal detectors on an agricultural machine but nevertheless it seems that under the legislation they could be so prosecuted.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 37, to delete &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 14 amends section 2 of the Principal Act by the substitution of the following definition of &ldquo;archaeological object&rdquo;.  It goes on to say what that means, including an &ldquo;association with any Irish historical event or person&rdquo;.  It is conceivable that in certain circumstances objects could be found which have an association with historical events elsewhere <Col N="797" /> rather than specifically Irish events.  The scope of this section should be so wide as to include any archaeological object whether it be associated with an Irish historical event or otherwise. I suppose one could argue a case that if something was brought over by boat and dropped in an Irish field, it was associated with an Irish historical event but that would be a very tenuous connection. That is the reason for this amendment.  The definition should be wider, and not specifically connected to an Irish historical event.  It could be connected to any event.  For example, something could fall off a spaceship and land in a field in Kildare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West) Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> The main object of the new definition of archaeological object is to remove reference to the term &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo; from the definition.  This is a difficult legal concept and clouded the State's right to the ownership of such objects.  Under the provisions of section 14 an object is an archaeological object, and thus the property of the State, if found with no known owner and is either of archaeological interest or has an association with an Irish historical event or person.  Once either condition is satisfied, the object will be an archaeological object, and items which are not necessarily associated with an Irish event or person but are of general archaeological interest are covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As explained in the Minister's speech on Second Stage, we are trying to give statutory expression to the findings of the Supreme Court in the Derrynaflan case. That judgment, which was an adjudication on a complex constitutional question, dealt with the rights of the Irish people to their own heritage.  Accordingly I feel that the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; strengthens the definition without limiting it in any substantial way and I would prefer if the House agreed to allow it to remain.  I may summarise by saying that to qualify as an archaeological object there are three conditions: first, it is something that the State has a legal right to ownership of; second, there is no known owner; and third, it is of archaeological <Col N="798" /> interest and/or has an association with an Irish historical event or person. In view of this and of the fact that it is either of archaeological interest or associated with an Irish historical event or person, the House might take the decision that the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; should remain.</P>

      <P>(3) (A) The consent referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall not be given by the commissioners or the commissioners and a local authority, in a case referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (1) of this section, unless it is in the interests of archaeology to do so or the Minister has approved of the giving of that consent.</P>

    <P>(3) (D) An order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if an order annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder'.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Under the heading &ldquo;Our Heritage&rdquo; in the Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97, the partnership Government undertook to prohibit the giving of consent to the demolition of manuments without approval by the Oireachtas in exceptional circumstances and after a full archaeological excavation. At present the Commissioners for Public Works, or the local authorities acting jointly with the commissioners, are empowered under section 14 (3) of the National Monuments Act, 1930 to give consent to the demolition or alteration of a national monument in the care of the commissioners or of a local authority or a national monument in private ownership which is the subject of a preservation order.  The consent may be given by the commissioners in the interests of archaeology or for any other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the majority of cases where such a consent would be sought, the purpose would be to allow an archaeological excavation to take place.  It may also happen that other physical changes to a monument <Col N="800" /> might be required for reasons of public safety or health.  For instance, if a monument is in a dangerous condition it can happen too often that consent would be given when the purpose is to allow a building programme to proceed.  The most notable example of a consent of this nature would be commonly regarded as a joint consent given by the commissioners and the local authorities in respect of the Wood Quay site in Dublin in 1979.</P>
    <P>The proposed section sets out precisely the circumstances in which the commissioners shall give their consent to the alteration or destruction of a national monument in their care or to removal of a preservation order from a national monument.  The commissioners, or the commissioners and local authorities jointly, will continue to be empowered to give consent for reasons of archaeology without reference to the Minister.  If consent is sought for reasons of threat to public health and safety this will have to be submitted to the Minister for a decision.  In these circumstances the Minister would have the authority to refuse such consent.  Should the Minister wish to give such consent for any reason other than threat to public health or safety he would be required to make an appropriate statutory order but the order would not become operative until the Houses of the Oireachtas had been given the opportunity to debate and annul the order if either House so desired.  It is anticipated that very few cases of the latter nature would arise in practice, but where a serious conflict of interests arises between the need to protect our physical heritage and the exigencies of development, the procedure proposed would at least allow an informed debate and the ultimate decision to be taken in a manner which would be viewed by all concerned as reasonable and open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment attempts to remedy, to some extent, the obvious defects in existing legislation.  I have spoken on a number of occasions previously, here and in the Dáil, about Wood Quay and other situations have <Col N="801" /> arisen with regard to Mullaghmore, Luggalla and other sites.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation the final decisions about work being carried out &mdash; demolition, improvements or excavations &mdash; rest solely with the commissioners and the Minister.  In this amendment &ldquo;unless it is in the interests of archaeology to do so&rdquo; the consent will not be given by the commissioners or the comissioners and a local authority.  I agree.  However, it is essential that other interested bodies, such as An Taisce, are also notified.  An Taisce is devoted to the preservation of items of historical and archaeological interest.  It is a voluntary group, as far as I am aware, although it may have a a couple of salaried personnel. The group gives of its time in a generous way and it is in everyone's interest that it should be notified.  We also have a national heritage council and other relevant groups.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not go far enough as voluntary groups and organisations who have an input to this area must be included.  Fr. F.X. Martin took on Dublin Corporation over Wood Quay and later received a sizeable legal bill for his valiant efforts to preserve that site. He was unsuccessful but at least he highlighted the problems.  It is essential that the Minister involves people like Fr. Martin, the members of An Taisce and other groups with an interest in archaeological sites.</P>
      <P>We depend too much on the commissioners and the Minister.  It became obvious during the controversies in Wicklow and Clare that when a local authority makes a decision, thus making it policy, that policy gathers momentum and is hard to stop.  That can only be prevented by a disinterested party which has no material objective or a financial interest in the matter.  I am not implying that the Minister or the commissioners have a financial interest but a body like An Taisce would be interested and involved and we have an obligation to notify such a body and to see its consent in an instance of this nature.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that An Taisce did not ask me to reflect its views as I have no difficulty reflecting the views of any pressure group.</P>
      <P>We have a well educated population and, naturally, people will ask us to highlight problems with consultation and other aspects of the preservation and protection of our national monuments. However, I have great difficulty withthat if it undermines the role of a public representative who may already be presenting those views.  It casts doubt on the mandate given to the local representative to represent the views of the people. While it is necessary to have help, nobody should be given a special role to make me, as a public representative, aware of people's views or to impress on me that its view is the only one to be considered. It is my job to reflect the views of people in the area and I do not want one pressure group to take precedence.  Public representatives should not be undermined.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Senator regarding the views of An Taisce.  Of course, they should be taken into account, but in the same way as the views of every other member of society.  We have an important role.  The consultation procedure should be through the normal channels. With our educated population there should be no difficulty in doing that.</P>

Whom are we obliged to inform?  Are we obliged to inform every individual in the country or voluntary organisations such as An Taisce?</P>
      <P>This amendment sets out the circumstances in which the commissioners shall give their consent to the alteration or destruction of a monument in their care or to remove a preservation order from a national monument.  It provides for major cases which are the cause of controversy.  All interested parties should be made aware of them.  The Minister will be obliged to make the appropriate statutory authority that this could not become operative until it is placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the opportunity given to debate and annul the order if either House so desired. What more publicity could there be than by placing the statutory order before the Oireachtas and giving an opportunity for both Houses to debate it?  There is adequate opportunity for informing the various bodies, An Taisce and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to the examples I gave.  Those examples would be to demolish or remove wholly or in part or to disfigure, deface, alter or in any manner injure or interfere with any such national monument without or otherwise than in accordance with the consent.

The final decisions have to be made by public representatives on the policy issue and the Commissioners of Public Works may proceed on the basis of those decisions and also make their own decisions.  An Taisce has no motive other than that it is actively interested on a voluntary basis and it has built up a considerable amount of expertise over the years.  Members of such bodies who take cases to court to <Col N="804" /> protect sites or monuments which they believe need protection do so at great financial risk to themselves.  They can lose their family home or their property if they lose such an action.  While some people may brush aside the views of such individuals and groups it is essential that we have included in the legislation, if not their consent, then at least a requirement for consultation with them.</P>
      <P>For me Dublin was the buildings on Fitzwilliam Square, Merrion Square and Hume Street.  I remember being on Molesworth Street and seeing beautiful buildings torn down and I saw millionaires in big cars looking on and approving of the work.  Some people disagreed with a lot of what was said about the Burren and felt that many of the people were just agitators.  Whatever one thinks of their views they were at least concerned citizens who had views and it is important to get those views.  With regard to Wood Quay our generation will look back in years to come on a decision which it will be hard to justify.  It is only with the co-operation and goodwill of An Taisce working with the commissioners and the Minister that we will arrive at an ideal solution, if it can be achieved.  A requirement for consultation should be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with consultation with any group which has an interest in an area.  I have great difficulty if the group moves into an area and takes over the role of the community. That is not consultation, rather it is a dictatorial approach.  We can all give examples of that.  I have no difficulty if they express their views through the local residents' association and let the community councils &mdash; who are well equipped and educated &mdash; deal with the issues. Consultation should be through the normal process in the area where the monument is situated.  Outside bodies who may be knowledgeable should make a submission but it should not be normal procedure to consult them in regard to particular issues.  I would have difficulty with that.</P>

      <P>I do not understand how consultation can be as confined as that. If consultation is to mean anything it should mean consultation in the widest possible sense, whether through statutory agencies, non-statutory agencies or voluntary bodies.  In many cases there is a fundamental conflict between the local needs and wishes and the national needs and wishes.  That was evident in the case in County Clare and it can work in both ways.</P>
      <P>The Grey Abbey outside Kildare town is a significant archaeological monument. However, a motorway is to be built and the question arises as to whether the motorway should go through the archaeological monument or around it.  The local population might say that it should go around it because Kildare is a heritage town with many archaeological objects of significance.  The national interest might require that the motorway should go through the abbey.  Who arbitrates in those circumstances?</P>
      <P>The opposite case exists in relation to Carton House, a hugely important building of international significance.  A commercial company wants to develop golf courses and the local public representatives are faced with difficult decisions where planning permission is required to alter the building.  Do we say that because of the need for jobs and to develop the economy in the area such a development should be allowed?  Are we confronted with a situation where by allowing such a development the fundamental nature of the resource is being affected?</P>
      <P>It is not always the case that what the local public representatives are saying is the same as what those who are involved in these matters nationally would say. There has to be a resolution and that is why the consultation has to be of the widest possible nature.  Bodies who have expertise and a great interest in these matters and who have a long history of protection of such resources need to be consulted.  I would not wish to see that consultation process restricted in any way.  I do not think Senator Ormonde is suggesting that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I should have said earlier that I am pleased Senators have welcomed amendment No. 19a.  Its purpose is to improve the position.  Heretofore, the commissioners could take these decisions without any consultation whatsoever, without any involvement of the Minister or the Oireachtas.  The purpose of this is to ensure transparency.  The commissioners know they must now go before the Minister and the Oireachtas, which will necessitate consultation.  It is practically impossible to draw up a list of those who should be advised.  An Taisce is a recognised voluntary body which takes an interest but I would be worried if it was not aware of an item like this laid before the House.  As a public representative and a member of a local authority for many years, I have been amazed at An Taisce's awareness of events, irrespective of the size of the application or its location.</P>
      <P>This order will go before the Oireachtas and there is no doubt that An Taisce and other interested parties, including individuals, will be aware of what is happening.  Who better to reflect the views of those interested than Members of this House and Dáil Éireann, who will be fully briefed by these people?  We have gone a long way; we do not deserve credit for that because it is necessary to give the Oireachtas and public representatives ample opportunity to discuss the matter.  Members will represent these bodies, groups and individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should we take it upon ourselves to advise any such group or individual? This will receive so much publicity that everyone will be aware of it.  I appeal to Senators to accept this in good faith.  We <Col N="807" /> inserted this section to allay fears expressed in this House.  It once more proves the effectiveness and value of the Seanad in introducing this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention of the Office of Public Works, the Minister or myself to insist that there is not such openness. The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works are both extremely open and we want to ensure that continues.  We are ensuring the Dáil and Seanad have an opportunity to debate the appropriate statutory order, which will not come into effect if it is annulled by either House.  I ask the Senators to reconsider their position.</P>

      <P>The role of the Houses has been expanded by committees of the Dáil, which go into greater detail on Committee Stages of Bills.  Given the amount of legislation and publications involved, some matters can slip through the net.  Newspapers, television stations and those involved in such organisations may not become aware of events until it is too late.  When decisions are made at national or local level, public representatives may only have a certain amount of information.  I do not suggest that information has been kept from them.  They receive the views of the Office of Public Works or the Minister but there are other viewpoints, often coming from bodies like An Taisce with specialised expertise in a given field who may wish to give their views.  Senator Ormonde will be aware what happens when decisions are taken.  Bureaucracy gathers its own momentum.</P>

      <P>The matter with which this amendment is concerned will not arise on a regular basis.  It is not often that someone finds a wreck over 100 years old.

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I agree with Senator Enright that the sooner a find of this nature is reported the better.  I expect that if a responsible person finds a wreck he or she will report it as a matter of priority.  I do not wish to place an impossible burden on the finder of such a wreck.  We do not know the circumstances in which a diver may find such a wreck or the difficulties which may be encountered in making a report. There could be pressing personal reasons for not making such a report immediately.</P>
      <P>The requirement to report such a find within four days strikes a fair and reasonable balance between the need for urgent reporting and the personal priorities of the individual.

      <P>That is fine but for how long does that process take place?  Is it a day or a week? The purpose of the amendment is that it should be for a period of not less than two months.  This would be reasonably consistent with county development plans which are on public display for a defined period of time.  When the comissioners have decided that they want to acquire land, there should be a defined period of time, which should not be a short period, whereby the maps are on public display.</P>

      <P>This relates to the compulsory acquisition of land and the powers of the Minister in respect of that acquisition.  The Minister should not be able to unilaterally decide these matters.  It comes back to the question of consultation.  Regarding land acquisition under the motorway Acts &mdash; and I have personal experience of this &mdash; in the event of a person being unhappy with the offer that has been made, he then has the right of appeal at arbitration. That can go for or against him and if it goes against, costs can also be awarded against him.  It should be wider than just the Minister's remit.  There should be an independent arbitrator who can act perhaps to the extent of valuing the land. There should be some vehicle of that nature in the legislation.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> This proposal would remove the decision from the Minister to an independent arbitrator. The purpose of this paragraph is to ensure that where the owner or occupier of land which is to be acquired makes an objection, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht must consider the matter before deciding whether to give his consent.  The consent of the Minister for Finance is also required and it would be open to the Minister to seek whatever advice he felt desirable in the particular circumstances.  On occasions the advice of an arbitrator might be useful. However, the Minister would have to be free to consider each case on its merits. If we were to accept this amendment, it would remove the decision making from the Minister to an arbitrator and would tie the Minister's hands completely.  The Minister will first seek the observations of the Office of Public Works.  He can obtain advice from experts and he is in a position to appoint an arbitrator if he so wishes and if he feels that is in the best interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This paragraph is concerned with the principle of whether the property should be compulsorily acquired.  It has nothing <Col N="812" /> to do with the amount of compensation to be paid.

      <P>I would be in favour of tying the Minister's hands, and that is precisely the objective of the exercise. Senator Enright made a reasonable point.  How can the Minister appoint a person who is an independent arbitrator? The difficulty with that is finding a formula of words.  There are many precedents and I quoted what happens under the motorways Act.  At one time, if someone had a disagreement as to the valuation of property for death duties or whatever, and one side submitted one valuation and the other side submitted another, there was an independent arbitration system in place.</P>
      <P>Matters of this kind can be difficult and the result of not introducing a measure such as this would be to encourage people to go to the High Court to establish their rights.  Many people who are not in a position to do this because of a lack of resources may be victimised in consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be undesirable to return to the methods of the Land Commission given what the commission did to some people over the years.  However, the proposed arrangements allow the Minister <Col N="813" /> almost to reach the point of victimising an individual.

The Leas-Chathaoirleach and all the Senators who sit on local authorities are familiar with these procedures.  There is an obligation in such instances to go to arbitration.  The Bill should include a provision whereby, if it is required, an independent arbitrator shall be appointed.</P>
      <P>There are many arbitrators to undertake this work and in the event of failure to agree, one should be nominated by a body such as the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland or the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute, which should be empowered to this effect.</P>

The consent of the Minister for Finance will also be required.  If the offer, that is the assessment of compensation under the Lands Clauses Acts, is not acceptable, then paragraph 5 (2) of the Schedule to the Bill provides for the appointment of an arbitrator at that stage.

      <P>I refer to paragraph 5 (1) of the Schedule relating to compensation. Under the terms of the Bill, people are compensated for the acquisition of land, easements, titles or interests and the finder of an object may be paid. However, the Director of the National Museum may enter land to safeguard or remove an object and if property is damaged, there is nothing in this Bill which states that the landowner must be compensated.

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I draw Senator Dardis's attention to the Lands Clauses Act which is defined in the <Col N="817" /> Interpretation Act.  I have no difficulty with the word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;pay&rdquo;.  In the event of any difficulty under the Lands Clauses Act, paragraph 5 (2) of the Schedule provides for the appointment of an arbitrator if the offer of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is not accepted.  I will consider suggestions if they improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that we are compensating people where land is vested or acquired.  However, there are many cases where it would not be necessary to acquire land.  For example, if a Viking boat was found in Clontarf and it was removed, there would be no need to acquire the land, but how would that person be compensated for damage to their property?  It is unacceptable if such a provision is not included in the Bill. The Director of the National Museum may unilaterally enter land without giving notice &mdash; we tried to improve the Bill so that notice would be given &mdash; and the landowner has no comeback if the land is not acquired.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I do not believe the Office of Public Works could carry out an excavation without acquiring the land.  It is the intention to compensate if it is necessary to purchase the land.  If a Viking boat was found in Clontarf and it was necessary to excavate the remnants of the vessel, it would be for the commissioners to decide whether to acquire the land and compensate the landowner.</P>

It is not good enough to say the Director of the National Museum will compensate people.  That provision must be included in the Bill, otherwise it is not equitable.

        <i>Donegal South-West</i>): The purpose of this provision is to restrict the scope of section 8 to instances where the physical context in which a find has been made may be under threat.  This amendment arises from the concerns of Senators, expressed during the debate last week with regard to the broad scope of section 8, which could be interpreted as going beyond the immediate need of the director to take action to research and record the features of the immediate surroundings of a find while intact.

      <P>&ldquo;(4) When the owner or occupier (including the commissioners) of a monument or place which has been recorded under subsection (1) of this section or any person proposes to carry out, or to cause or permit the carrying out of, any work at or in relation to such monument or place, he shall give notice in writing of his proposal to carry out the work to the relevant local authority and shall not, except in the case of urgent necessity and with the consent of the Minister commence the work for a period of two months after having given the notice.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I moved this amendment on Committee Stage but I did not press it to a vote for procedural reasons.  Senator Dardis pressed his amendment to a vote on Committee Stage but I left mine open so that <Col N="822" /> it could be discussed again on Report Stage.  I believe, and I said this morning, that owners and occupiers have rights but the commissioners should also have to give notice in writing.  An obligation on the commissioners to give notice to the relevant local authority should be written into the Bill.  All relevant parties should be notified of what is taking place.  Under the Bill the commissioners will not have to give notice to anybody when they are carrying out work.  A local authority should be notified that works are about to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis's Committee Stage amendment provided that the commissioners should consult with the National Heritage Council and, thereafter, give notice in writing to the Minister. My party supported this.  Our amendment is on the same lines.  If local authority members receive notice of planned works, they can alert An Taisce and local historical societies.  The matter can then be discussed locally and later nationally.  This would create necessary publicity.  We should have learned lessons from Wood Quay, Fitzwilliam Square, Fitzwilliam Street, Merrion Square, the Burren, Wicklow and Meath.</P>

      <P>There were some consultations in these cases.  However, it is serious if local people are not made aware of works to be carried out.  Section 11 deals with all works which can be carried out, such as extensions to national monuments and car parks.  If the National Heritage Council is not to be notified of such work, at least local public representatives, county engineers, local historical societies and An Taisce should be alerted.  However, the commissioners should not be permitted to carry out work without at least having notified the relevant parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. On Committee Stage the Minister accepted the argument that the commissioners should be subject to the same obligations as private individuals who are <Col N="823" /> occupiers or owners of national monuments. If that is the case, the commissioners should be subject under the legislation to exactly the same provisions. That is why the amendment is a good one.</P>
      <P>My Committee Stage amendment proposed that the owner or occupier should first consult the National Heritage Council. However, I am prepared to accept Senator Enright's argument that the local authority is also an appropriate body. We had an argument about the National Heritage Council not being a statutory body, although we are going to make it a statutory body under the terms of the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>The local authority can have a role to play in this.  The powers vested under section 11 are so broad in terms of what can be done on land which is adjacent to a national monument that there must be a safeguard.  These self-appointed arbiters of public taste have a very narrow focus of what is desirable in architectural terms.  The Government repeatedly talks about consultation but its definition of consultation is far narrower than mine.</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say on Committee Stage that on Report Stage he would attend to the problem of damage to land which was not being acquired.  However, I do not see that matter being attended to here.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Enright. Without casting any aspersions on the taste or work done by the commissioners, advice in such situations is always of value.  Those in the locality have the greatest vested interest in what will happen to the national monument involved.  They are also the people who are most likely to be the guardians of that area.  I cannot understand why the input of local archaeological or historical societies and the National Heritage Council would not be of value.  Senator Enright's suggestion that the local authority should have the information is perfect because then all these other bodies could see the proposed plans and give <Col N="824" /> advice or make comments.  I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> We discussed the substance of this amendment in the debate on amendment No. 17 on Committee Stage.  I must reiterate and emphasise the fact that it is much more onerous on the commissioners when they have to advise the Minister; the Minister, in turn, has to lay the appropriate order before the House.</P>
      <P>In relation to the planning Acts and the regulations, if the commissioners are restoring a building they are exempt. However, if any major alteration is being made or if they are adding to a monument they must obtain planning permission. The Office of Public Works must make the appropriate application to the relevant local authority.  This provides an opportunity for those who have varying views on any development to become involved in the process.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to get planning permission to carry out restoration work to a dwelling if no alterations are being made. However, it is necessary if additions are being made to the dwelling or if substantial alterations are being made.  The Office of Public Works will comply with the regulations which are there.  I believe the responsibility on the commissioners will be much more onerous as a result of our introducing a further section to the Bill.  I do not believe acceptance of this amendment would improve the Bill and I regret I am unable to accept it.</P>

      <P>I made the point this morning when I was discussing Senator Dardis' amendment that, due to the volume of legislation, some matters may not get the attention they deserve from TDs, Senators or the media.  I am looking for a safeguard.  It is possible to get caught up in bureaucracy and red tape.  This is to ensure that the relevant interested parties are notified, and notifying the local authorities is the correct way to do this.  The amendment states: &ldquo;notice in writing of his proposal to carry out the work&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;Where a national monument is falling into disrepair, or where it is obvious that such neglect will result in serious permanent damage to the said monument then it shall be in order for any interested person, individual, group or society to serve an order on the commissioners and the Minister, alerting them as to the condition of the said monument and where after the passing of a period of two months from the date of the service of the said notice then the relevant individual or body shall be empowered to take such relevant court action to compel the commissioners and the Minister to take all necessary steps to preserve and maintain the said national monument without any costs or expenses being paid by the said individual or person.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Where there is a problem with a national monument which is owned by a third party, the commissioners now have the powers to compulsorily acquire it.  As long as there are proper safeguards, I would have no objection to the commissioners taking control of such a monument. However, I received correspondence from a person who is interested in such procedures and is concerned that there are a number of national monuments and monuments of local historical significance which are allowed fall into disrepair and ruin.  If ordinary individuals see that a monument is falling into disrepair they should notify by registered post, the commissioners and the Minister. They will be given two months to attend to the matter or to outline a plan whereby it will be attended to over a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the commissioners or the relevant Minister fails to take notice of the warning furnished to them, that person shall <Col N="826" /> have the power to issue proceedings against them and to bring the issue before the relevent court.</P>
    <P>Few people would be able to take that sort of action because of financial constraints. If they bring a case showing that the monument is in a state of neglect and if the proposition is reasonable, they should not be penalised for costs but at least granted their outlay so that they would not be out of pocket.  Some provision along those lines is essential.  This is not to disparage the fine work the Office of Public Works is doing but because financial constraints and the pressures of work over a period of time, many fine monuments and buildings can fall into a state of disrepair.  This amendment is designed to give concerned citizens or groups, such as An Taisce, legal powers to try to preserve a monument if they feel it needs attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I am sure the Minister can envisage circumstances where the owners of monuments might almost be a party to allow them to fall into decay and disrepair.  If we are to be consistent on the matter of consultation, concerned members of the public must be included in preserving our national heritage in the widest possible context.  There are some who are vigilant in preserving our national heritage but they should be made to feel they have an input and this provision would be a good way of doing that.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I can envisage circumstances where the owner of the property might totally neglect the monument in order to get rid of it.  This, regrettably, has happened to much of our architectural heritage.  I do not wish to reopen the debate we covered in detail on Committee Stage, but I wish to refer to public liability insurance.  Farmers are liable for any injury to people crossing their lands. There are some farmers who would prefer to see the monument on their land demolished than be open to public liability claims.  That is why the amendment is a good one and should be supported.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> One must differentiate between national monuments which are the responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works and those that are not.  However, under section 12 of the 1930 Act, the commissioners are obliged to maintain all monuments in their ownership and guardianship.  There is no need, of course, to introduce a new provision for those monuments which are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works if the commissioners are negligent in their duties of such monuments in their care.</P>
      <P>Concerned citizens may seek an order of <i>mandamus</i> from the courts to compel the commissioners to do their duty.  If we were to accept that the Senators are referring to all 150,000 recorded monuments, this would result in a serious financial responsibility on the commissioners if they were responsible for taking the necessary action.  I fully appreciate that it would not be a question, and the Senators do not indicate or insinuate that it would be necessary to do this with such a number.  However, if provision is made for a number of isolated instances, it must include all these monuments.</P>
      <P>The commissioners should not be forced to take responsibility for the maintenance of all recorded national monuments. This would have grave financial implications for them.  If the Senators are referring to a number of important individual monuments that may cause problems in the future, there is nothing to prevent the Commissioners of Public Works from acquiring such monuments compulsorily.  Under section 12 of the 1930 Act, they would then have responsibility for the maintenance of those monuments under their ownership.</P>
      <P>I hope the House accepts that such an amendment could open the floodgates and leave a responsibility on the commissioners for the maintenance of 150,000 monuments.  The amendment states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...after the passing of a period of two months from the date of the service of the said notice then the relevant <Col N="828" /> individual or body shall be empowered to take such relevant court action to compel the commissioners and the Minister to take all necessary steps to preserve and maintain the said national monument without any costs or expenses being paid by the said individual or person.</P>

If this amendment was agreed, there are people who would be able to take the necessary steps to ensure that the necessary works are carried out.  We are too easy-going when it comes to monuments. This will put pressure on the Commissioners of Public Works and the Minister of the day, and that is why I put down this amendment.  In the past we allowed many of these monuments to fall ino a state of disrepair.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say there is so many monuments; many of them are of considerable historic value and should be preserved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West</i>): I thank the Senators for their contributions on Committee Stage, especially Senator Enright, Senator Dardis, Senator Ormonde and Senator Daly, who took a particular interest in the Bill.  While, as Senator Dardis said, the acceptance of the amendment might be only a small victory, I have no doubt that the contributions of Senators are in the best interests of the Bill.  I hope it will be enacted in the near future as it is proposed to take Second Stage in the Dáil in the next few weeks.  It is important <Col N="830" /> legislation and I am pleased that we introduced the additional section which places more onus on the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>There may have been some misunderstanding as I certainly had no intention of trying to mislead Senators in relation to compensation.  I referred to the amendment, accepted on Report Stage, which restricted the scope of section 8 to instances where the physical context of a find and site is in danger of destruction or decay.  The purpose is to restrict the scope of section 8 to instances in which the physical context in which a find has been made is under threat.</P>
      <P>There is no question of paying compensation. By the same token this restricts the power of the director who will go to the site to carry out an inspection to establish if the archaeological object is of historical importance.  The tools he will carry with him, by and large, will be a trowel and spade.  There may be a perception that he will arrive with a number of dump trucks, a JCB and low loaders.  If that were the case I could fully appreciate Senator Dardis's concern but I do not believe that to be the situation. It will not be the intention of the director using his trowel and his spade to cause any serious destruction meriting compensation. If I gave the wrong impression, I apologise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Higgins, who was present on Second Stage and Deputy Gallagher who was here on Committee Stage.  I found them most helpful and courteous in their handling of this Bill.  A number of points were made and dealt with at length.</P>
      <P>There are matters which the Minister should look at further in the Dáil, particularly with regard to payments.  Unless we are generous in this area and there is a proper procedure for assessing value, the legislation will run into difficulties. Similarly, when acquiring national monuments, easements and so on for the provision of facilities, one is taking over private property.  It would be essential for constitutional purposes to have proper safeguards and a system of arbitration for the payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> There should be some more acceptable way of dealing with cases where the commissioners are carrying out works.  They should be in a position to notify local authorities, public representatives and interested parties such as An Taisce.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an example of legislation where powers are being acquired by the State.  This is desirable in some ways but there should be more transparency and acceptance of the fact that ordinary individuals also have rights.  My last amendment was relevant in this regard.  Where an object or monument is falling into disrepair, it would have given that person or An Taisce the right to notify the State and the Commissioners of Public Works that a place is being neglected.  They should be given an input to this area. Perhaps the Minister could consider the matter and accept a similar amendment in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his diligence over two days of Committee Stage, his attention and the manner in which he dealt with our queries and amendments.  I also thank his officials as they have answered our questions openly and well.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would not mislead the House, certainly not deliberately. I hope the legislation will achieve its intended objective, which is to preserve and secure our national monuments. I hope it will also ensure that the public will have general access to those monuments.</P>
      <P>I still have a problem about the serious flaw with regard to the powers of the director and what he might do with his trowel and his spade.  I heard the trowel and spade argument over lunch but there are circumstances where damage can be done.  I accept it would be in very limited circumstances but if damage is done somebody should be able to recover the cost of repairing that damage.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind when he brings this legislation to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister is here and I recognise he is currently under great pressure.</P>
      <P>I wish to convey my sincere sympathy to all the families and people affected by the tragedy in Castletownbere this morning. The Minister will be leaving here and going on to Castletownbere so I appreciate the fact that he is taking this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be aware that the Commissioners for Irish Lights have been refused planning permission to erect the Loren C mast on the Loop Head peninsula in County Clare.  Clare County Council issued a refusal to them recently on the following grounds:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed development would, by virtue of the scale of its ancillary supporting structures and its hazard warning <Col N="833" /> features, be injurious to the visual amenity of the area.  The proposed development would, by virtue of the scale of its ancillary supporting structures and of its hazard warning features, be seriously injurious to the amenity and reduce the value of property in the vicinity.  The proposed development may be prejudicial to public health due to the impact which the electromagnetic fields produced by the development may have on the population in the vicinity.  The proposed development may endanger the health of those occupying or employed in adjoining structures due to the impact which the electromagnetic fields produced by the development may have on the population in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>These are the four grounds that Clare County Council enunciated in making this refusal and in doing so they considered a report submitted by the Cockhill laboratory, Wales, which analysed in detail the scientific arguments produced in the McManus report.  In analysing those they found the McManus report very seriously wanting in regard to a variety of items.  Clare County Council was influenced in its decision by the arguments put forward by that group.  The Minister will recall that an official of his interviewed on the Pat Kenny show some time ago clearly stated there would be concern within the Department in regard to the environmental impact of this mast if it were to be erected.  The Minister will recall outlining his concern at various meetings and in the other House in relation to the feeling of the local population and the local authority.</P>
    <P>I was pleased when the Minister decided to apply for planning permission. Although he did not have to do so at the time it was a move in the right direction. Now that Clare County Council and the local planning authority for the area very clear stated its position and refused planning permission on a variety of strong grounds, the onus is on the Minister to take notice of what has been said by it, the local community and the public in the west Clare area.</P>
    <P>The jury is still out on Loran C about the health effects of the electromagnetic <Col N="834" /> fields.  The fact that there is still doubt about this issue and nothing has been proven suggests that the matter should not proceed.  The people of the Loop Head peninsula and the west Clare area do not want to be tested to see if Loran C is good or bad for the future or what its fallout effects may be.  We must be concerned about this issue.  Peoples' fears must be recognised and accepted.  The fact that the local community are strongly opposed to this development and that the local authority refused the application speaks volumes.  The Minister listens to the concerns expressed and I have no doubt he will adopt a fair approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister employed the Commissioners for Irish Lights as his agent to proceed with the Loran C system.  Will he now request them not to lodge an appeal with An Bord Pleanála to try to counter the local council decision?  This decision was arrived at after a lot of consideration, representations, scientific examination of the application and hearing the views of many people.  This decision was not taken lightly by Clare County Council and I ask the Minister to take that into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senator for raising this matter, although it is not the first time I discussed it with Senator Taylor-Quinn.  The jury has reached a verdict.  It returned to court and the verdict, as far as Loran C is concerned, is not guilty.  I do not know where the Senator got her information from in relation to that aspect of the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The jury is as much a figment of the Senator's imagination as of mine.  If we are talking about fantasies, my conclusion is that the phantom jury returned a verdict of not guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator correctly said, while technically we do not have to apply for planning permission approval because such masts do not require it, I give an assurance that my Department will go <Col N="835" /> stated in the Official Report, 11 March 1993, Volume 135, column 777.  The county councillors in County Clare, as is their democratic right, said that this project should be stopped and refused planning permission for the erection of the mast.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the planning application for the proposed Loran C navigation mast.  Extensive details of the project have been given to the Oireachtas on a number of occasions, but I would like to remind the Seanad of the salient facts.  Loran C &mdash; long range C &mdash; is a land based radio navigation system used extensively throughout the world.  The Loran C system in north-western Europe is being expanded under an international agreement signed by Ireland and five other European countries in 1992.  The purpose is to ensure the availability of an independent cost-effective system as an alternative to the US military satellite global positioning system &mdash; GPS &mdash; and to significantly improve the safety of investigation and protection of the marine environment in European waters.</P>
    <P>Under the international agreement approved by Dáil Éireann in October 1992 Ireland is to join a chain of Loran C masts in the participating European countries of Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, France and Germany.  Dáil Éireann unanimously approved this agreement on 8 October 1992.  The Senator may have been a Member of the Dáil then and may have unanimously supported that resolution, as her party did.</P>
    <P>The opportunity to establish an extended European control Loran C system followed the decision by the US Government to phase out the Loran C chains outside the US by the mid-1990s when GPS became fully operational for military purposes.  Loran C's use for civil purposes in the US will not be affected. The US also offered to transfer ownership of existing Loran C transmitters to host countries as a basis for a European system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> Ireland's decision to participate in the Loran C system requires the construction of a radio mast located in the south-west as an essential link in making up the system.  The Irish station will provide a significantly enhanced level of coverage in Irish waters, especially off the south and south-west coasts.  It is one of the three new masts to be constructed under the agreement; the other two are currently being constructed in Norway.</P>
    <P>At European Union level there is growing support for the concept of regional Loran C chains as essential ground based back-up for satellite based systems.  The development of ground based Loran C systems under European control is seen as a prudent investment to ensure accurate and comprehensive coverage in the interests of maritime safety.  Even in the longer term, such a system will be required to back up existing satellite systems whose availability for civilian use cannot always be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The Loran C system is also superior to the coverage offered by the short range Decca navigation system, the alternative ground based system currently in general use.  Lorcan C offers a high degree of accuracy and reliability and a considerable range of coverage for Irish waters.  The benefits of the system for the Irish fishing industry and for marine safety generally will be considerable.</P>
    <P>The erection of the Loran C mast is an exempted development for the purposes of the planning Act.  There is no legal requirement on the Commissioners for Irish Lights to apply for planning permission for the mast, even allowing for recent changes in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993. However, in accordance with my commitment to full transparency and openness, the Commissioners for Irish Lights submitted a planning application on 13 October 1993 in respect of the proposed development at Loop Head.  The Senator will recall that having met a number of her concerned constituents I gave an undertaking that despite this development being an exempted one, I would, nevertheless, apply for planning permission. To date, my efforts have met <Col N="837" /> with failure.  We are only half way through the planning process and I assure the Senator I will send the application to An Bord Pleanála which may decide whether the Loran C is a good or bad project.  I will be bound by its decision.</P>
    <P>On 18 February 1994 Clare County Council refused planning permission for the mast on the grounds that it would be injurious to the visual amenity, reduce property value and might be harmful to public health.  To address the concerns expressed by members of the local community on the health issue, two reports were commissioned in 1993 at considerable expense.  One was from the professor of applied physics at University College, Galway, and the other from the technical officer at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. The reports conclude there is no evidence to suggest that the installation would constitute a public hazard.  Ne'er the twain shall meet.  The Senator's constituents say there is a health hazard, but the two experts deny this.</P>
    <P>I still hold the view that the widest possible consultative procedure must apply in this case to ensure that both the benefits of Loran C and the legitimate concerns of the local community are fully explored and the facts clearly established. It was with this objective in mind that the decision to submit this development through the planning process was taken in the first place.  The project is now being fully examined in accordance with established planning procedures and I am sure the Senator agrees it would be inappropriate and, indeed, unusual to truncate the planning process.  The provision for an appeal is an integral part of our planning law designed to ensure that applications and the reason for their refusal are further examined fully on their respective merits.  Consequently, it is intended in this case to proceed through the established planning procedures to the maximum.  To do otherwise would be to depart from the path of transparency and due process to which I <Col N="838" /> am committed in all matters and in this specific instance.</P>
    <P>The course of action which I outlined is reasonable and fair.  I am, frankly, puzzled by the suggestion that I should now seek to prematurely end the process of examination of this proposal in accordance with the planning laws.  It is the case, of course, that the appeals procedure requires the planning authority to make details of the appeal available for public scrutiny at its offices.  Any party is subsequently entitled to make submissions to An Bord Pleanála and I fully expect that such submissions will be made.</P>
    <P>Again, I express my gratitude to the Senator for her concern and for again raising the matter in the House.  I have no doubt that in due course she will bring the matter to the attention of the Lower House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically asked the Minister to truncate the planning process, given his record in relation to evaluation and appreciation of the views and concerns of the local community.  In relation to the various reports, the Minister has a number of scientific experts who have done research.  The local group in west Clare has a number of scientific experts, equally&mdash;maybe better&mdash;qualified, who examined this matter.  They both came to different conclusions as is the position in relation to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This matter must go through the full rigour of the planning process and that is what will happen.  I will abide by the decision of An Bord Plenála as I <Col N="840" /> know the Senator, in her wisdom, will also.</P>
