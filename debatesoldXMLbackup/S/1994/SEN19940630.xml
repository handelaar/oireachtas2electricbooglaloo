      <P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to intervene in support of the Centre for Independent Living.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the application for citizenship of a person of Irish extraction from South Africa (details supplied) and that the review be carried out with a view to issuing the applicant with an Irish passport.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cregan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline to the House the up-to-date position in Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Norris' and Senator Cotter's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Cregan may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Items 1 to 4, inclusive.  I understand that there will be a request from the Dáil for a motion to be dealt with in relation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I hope that we can deal with this at 2 p.m.  I will inform the House when the motion has been dealt with in the Dáil.  It is intended that we will deal with the Committee and Final Stages of Item 1, the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill, 1994.  It is also intended that we will deal with all Stages of Item 2, the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, 1994.  There will be a sos on the completion of Items 1 and 2 after which we will take all Stages of Item 3, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Bill, 1993 and Item 4, the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Bill, 1994.  The Adjournment matters will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with the Government Whip that we should take all Stages of the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, 1994.  However, I have been informed by my party's spokesperson on the issue that he wishes to table some amendments.  Perhaps I could discuss this with the Whips without taking a firm view on it at the moment.</P>
      <P>May I express, on behalf of my party, our sympathy with the former Leas-Chathaoirleach, Mr. Joe McCartan, on the tragic death of his son yesterday. All Members would like to convey their deepest sympathy to the McCartan family on their tragic loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago I asked the Leader if he could give an assurance that when the beef tribunal report is published, the House will be recalled to discuss it.  The timing of the publication of the report is solely a matter for the tribunal itself, but given that this House was instrumental in setting up the tribunal and that it is likely the report will be published during the summer, it is essential that the House be recalled so that Members can give the report full scrutiny and have a full discussion <Col N="1767" /> on it.  I would like an assurance on this before the two Houses rise.</P>
    <P>I had intended raising, under Standing Order 29, the plight of the Centre for Independent Living.  All of us have met the people involved outside the House over the last day or two.  It is a matter of serious concern.  You have allowed the matter to be raised on the motion for the Adjournment, Sir, and I will not raise it in the manner I intended.  I appeal to Members from all parties to give this motion every support.  All of us have been impressed by the work of the centre and the sad plight in which it finds itself. It should be possible to find funding to allow it to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never do that. The Senator knew I was going to raise the matter.  Will the Refugee Bill be taken during this session and will it apply to Members of the other House who are seeking refuge from a sinking ship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning for his support of the motion on the Centre for Independent Living.  He mentioned this to me yesterday and I am grateful to him.  I understand that there is widespread support in the House for the motion.  Far from being irritated by a possible stealing of my thunder, it is an issue we all take seriously.  It is not a private issue and the property of any one Member.  It will be supported by the whole House and I hope the Minister will be able to do something for us.  I am also grateful to you, a Chathaoirligh, for selecting it because, as Senator Manning indicated, the people involved spent last night in their wheelchairs outside the Oireachtas.  It is a tribute to their courage and determination that they did so.  They made a very dignified protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader suggested he was going to deal with the question of a request from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign <Col N="1768" /> Affairs at 2 p.m.  Presumably this is for the use of the Chamber tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be here for this because I am one of the five representatives of the Seanad on the committee, but some of its members will be having a meeting with some of the Pakistani delegation so it will not be possible for me to be here.  This does not indicate a lack of interest.  Perhaps I might have a word privately with the Leader.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the Order of Business as presented to us by the Leader.  I am agreeable to taking all Stages of the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill today.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in expressing our condolences to Mr. Joe McCartan and his family on the death of his son.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Leader indicated that today he might be able to tell us what legislation is to come to us between now and the end of the session.  Has he any idea whether we will be able to debate Northern Ireland, as we have requested several times in the past?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this side of the House, I wish to be associated with Senator's Manning's condolences to Joe McCartan on the death of his son.</P>
      <P>Item 12 on the Dáil Order Paper deals with the request we will be discussing. Next week it is intended to deal with the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, the Investment Limited Partnership Bill, the An Bord Bia Bill and to begin the Heritage Council Bill.  It is also possible that we would deal with Second Stage of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill.  We may also take Second Stage of the Heritage Council Bill.  We will know before noon today whether we will deal with Northern Ireland next week.  If that is the case, I will ensure that the office informs the various Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted Senator Manning's comments in regard to the Beef Tribunal and <Col N="1769" /> will pass them on.  The Refugee Bill will not be dealt with.  I will not comment on anything else he said as it might be taken that I have a personal interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 9, before &ldquo;betting office&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on-course&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a minor matter but it is of some significance.  Due to the later provisions in the Bill which refer to betting and the possible effect which the Racing Board and the totalisator might have on betting and the establishment of betting offices, it is important to clarify what a betting office is.  In that context we suggest that it should be specified as on-course betting rather than off-course betting.  The legislation would allow us to proceed to a situation where there might be off-course betting.  The amendment is proposed in order to clarify the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides a precise definition for each of the series of words and phrases which are either used regularly throughout the Bill or may have a limited or special meaning in the Bill which would require, in the view of the draftsman, a precise definition. Section 2 states that &ldquo;'betting office' means any premises at an authorised racecourse&rdquo; in lines 9 and 10 of page 6 of <Col N="1770" /> the Bill.  Senator Dardis is seeking to amend that phrase from &ldquo;betting office&rdquo; to &ldquo;on-course betting office&rdquo;.  However, the words &ldquo;on-course&rdquo; would be superfluous as the definition itself restricts the use of the term &ldquo;betting office&rdquo; to a premises at an authorised racecourse.  Therefore, I oppose this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give us a rough estimate of the time scale in relation to when the Authority will get under way?  I know he said that he is going to meet them next Monday.  Perhaps he could give us some of his inner thinking in relation to the setting up of the Authority and when we will see some action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will be aware that I recently announced the appointment of the Authority on an interim basis in order to facilitate essential preliminary arrangements on structures, staffing and other matters.  I am asking the members to act with immediate effect, pending the finalisation of this legislation and the formal establishment of the Authority through the signing of an order under section 3.  I expect that it will take until about September to get the staffing and various structures in place.  By that stage all of the preparatory work will be done. The new Authority is meeting on Monday next, 4 July, and will get down to business straight away to get all of this preparatory work out of the way.  I expect that it will formally come into existence by about September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Some later sections deal with the various positions.  Does the Minister think that the appointment of these people will take effect some time after that?  Does he envisage any difficulty <Col N="1771" /> with the continuation of the employment of those who are employed at present in various areas?  That is, that the people who are already employed there may move sideways or whatever but that their job prospects will not be in any danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has an absolute assurance on that.  There is no difficulty whatsoever in relation to that. I expect a smooth transition from the old order and structures to the new one.  I am anxious to get it up and running as quickly as possible.  To that end I have asked the Authority to meet at an early date.  It is meeting on Monday and will get this preparatory work out of the way during the summer so that by September it can hit the ground running, so to speak, and get moving on the real business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 34 and 35, to delete paragraph (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for moving this amendment is to be consistent with amendment No. 10, which seeks to amend section 39 of the Bill.  It is to remove the allocation of race fixtures and the setting of race programmes from the Authority and to leave it with the racecourse regulatory body.  I do not see the need for the Authority to be involved in this exercise.  I do not see why it cannot be done by the racecourse regulatory body.  It involves quite a large secretarial job.  In the event of the Authority being the body allocating the fixtures and setting the race programmes, how is it proposed to provide <Col N="1772" /> secretarial assistance to the Authority? Would it be through the existing Turf Club staff or would a new staff be set up?  The basic thrust of the amendment is that I do not see the need for the Authority to involve itself in this particular exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 10, which are being taken together, propose transferring the race fixtures and race programme committees back to the regulatory body.  The race fixtures and race programmes are central to the whole organisation of racing.  The Authority will be responsible for developing the industry, regulating betting to generate the maximum returns, the promotion of the industry and the guaranteeing of prize money and integrity of services.  These are all dependent on achieving the best possible fixtures list and race programme at each fixture.  It is appropriate, therefore, for the Authority to have final responsibility for these matters.</P>
      <P>Within the constraints specified in sections 19 and 20, which involve a strong consultative process, the proposal in amendment No. 10 to allocate the function of licensing jockeys and trainers and other functions related to the regulation of horse racing to the regulatory body is not necessary as these are functions carried under the rules of racing and, therefore, are already covered by section 39 (b).</P>
      <P>I should clarify that the regulatory body also licenses racecourses under the rules of racing.  However, it was decided to include a specific provision in section 39 relating to the licensing of racecourses because section 59 of the Bill also provides for the authorisation of racecourses by the Authority.  I wanted to make it clear that the licensing of such courses by the regulatory body which relates to the condition of the track, safety of horses and so on, will continue.  The authorisation by the Authority relates to all the facilities at a racecourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 39 paragraph (g) as proposed in amendment No. 10 regarding representation at horseracing events abroad is not necessary either.  I had a similar <Col N="1773" /> provision in the published Bill but deleted it on Committee Stage in the Dáil as I was persuaded by representations from the Turf Club that it was not necessary. It is now my view that this is a day to day matter which is not appropriate for inclusion in legislation.  For those reasons I oppose amendments Nos. 2 and 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what is wrong with the present system.  Why is it deemed necessary to change a system which, as far as I understand it, has worked well in the past and continues to work well?  That is the central question.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment of section 39 to include the licensing of racecourses but I ask him to clarify the position on representation abroad.  The remit of the Turf Club has been to be the international representative of Irish racing.  It is affiliated to the international bodies and attends the international fora. Am I to understand from the Minister's comments that this is to continue and that nothing in the legislation will prevent the racecourse regulatory body or the Turf Club from being the international representative of the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in relation to representing the industry abroad; it will continue as it was heretofore. During the consultation process it was suggested that, before representing the industry abroad, the racing regulatory body or the Turf Club would clear it with the new Authority.  I met with the Turf Club subsequent to the published draft of the Bill and they pointed out that this would be a cumbersome and unwieldy operation.  They also pointed out that they had represented the industry abroad, at various seminars and other activities for the past two centuries.  I accepted their line of argument and deleted the original section.  The Bill as now drafted is satisfactory to the Turf Club and the existing situation continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At some stage in the future the Turf Club may wish the Authority to represent racing.  This could be due to financial or other considerations but it will be a <Col N="1774" /> matter for the Turf Club.  There is no change and the Turf Club are happy with the Bill as it now stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about fixtures. What is wrong with the present system which has prompted this change and the vesting of this function in the Authority rather than the racecourse regulatory body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Integrity services are being provided by the racing regulatory body.  The change is that the cost of the integrity services will be underwritten and guaranteed by the Authority; the entire cost of integrity services in the legislation are guaranteed by the new Authority.  I believe this strengthens the position of the racing regulatory body.  I consulted with members of the Turf Club and they are satisfied and completely happy with the modifications in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the draft Bill after Government approval I met in Cork with representatives of the Turf Club.  We went through the Bill in some detail and I accepted and introduced six or seven amendments to accommodate their concerns.  This is one of those amendments.  I am satisfied that they are happy with it and that it is in the long term interests of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept much of what the Minister says because, as I stated on Second Stage yesterday, the Bill has definitely been improved, particularly section 44 which says that: &ldquo;The Racing Regulatory Body shall inform the Authority when making or amending any of the Rules of Racing&rdquo;.  This is radically different from the provision in the original draft of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have another question, and I hope it is in order to deal with it on this section. It concerns the registry functions of the Turf Club.  In terms of funding and the secretarial aspect of this function, does it reside with the Turf Club or is it to be a function of the Turf Club which must be met our of the funds of the Authority?  I need clarification on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (d) deals with the allocation of race fixtures and the setting of race programmes.  Sunday racing has been a tremendous success and is very popular.  Some national hunt meetings, and even some of the classic meetings, are now held on Sundays. There were initial difficulties about the cost of holding these meetings.  Since they are a great success no doubt the Minister will discuss with the Authority further promotion and possibly an expansion of the number of Sundays on which meetings will be held.  There will certainly be an effort to maintain the current number.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to outline how he would envisage the maintenance of Sunday meetings.  Will there be difficulties about paying people?  There was much discussion about the cost of Sunday meetings, which seems to be inordinate. Obviously people expect to be paid more for working on a Sunday as it would normally be their day off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (f) deals with the promotion of the Irish thoroughbred horse. Obviously if racing is a success here, the promotion of this industry will be almost automatic.  How does the Minister envisage the Authority dealing with this area? There may be greater recognition of horses racing abroad particularly in terms of exporting to Hong Kong, Australia, etc., where a more average horse could possibly achieve great success recognition can be given to the export market in Hong Kong, Australia and other places where a somewhat average horse can achieve great success.  One can read in sales catalogues about relations of Irish horses which have won races in countries such as Spain, Australia and New Zealand. <Col N="1776" /> How can the Authority expand the promotion of the Irish thoroughbred horse?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Sunday racing is a major attraction.  It has a down side in that it is unsocial and difficult for the staff who must work at the weekends. However, that problem has been resolved by the consensus on payment of appropriate rates for Sunday and weekend work.  From time to time new rates will be discussed by the industry, staff and union representatives.  It would be in the interest of the race-going public and the industry that this consensus continues.</P>
      <P>We hope to make attendance at Sunday race meetings a little more attractive by improving the alcohol licensing arrangements so that people will be able to celebrate their winnings appropriately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Or drown their sorrows, as may be the case.  Sunday racing is thriving.  It will be the responsibility of the new Authority to allocate appropriate fixtures and produce good programmes. The Budweiser Irish Derby is now held on a Sunday to facilitate television channels worldwide and to attract a wider audience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of the Irish thoroughbred is extremely important.  I have given it much consideration during the past couple of years and I have increased the allocation from the Department of Agriculture to the Irish Thoroughbred Marketing Board.  Its chief executive, Matt Mitchell, was appointed a couple of years ago.  After consultations between me and the Minister for Trade and Tourism the board received an allocation from his Department through the Irish Trade Board.  Trade in horses is a valuable part of Ireland's general trade.  In addition, the industry contributes pound for pound, so the organisation will have about £1 million available for promotion. At the Goff sales last November it encouraged and probably subsidised <Col N="1777" /> buyers from many countries, including new buyers from Scandinavian countries. It has also produced very professional promotional literature.  The organisation is doing a good job.  It is important for the size and scale of the industry that its promotion and marketing is accorded due importance.  I will also see if it is possible to continue to increase the allocation to that body under the Structural Funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The World Equestrian Games will be held here in 1998 and they will be a showcase for the industry.  This event could be used as a lever for promotion. Perhaps the Minister might consider making a special allocation for that purpose.  All areas of the industry, from racing to eventing, are related and one should help to sell the other.  Perhaps the Minister would make a special allocation in the next few years to promote such events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That option would be worth pursuing.  I believe that the equine industry is one industry; it is not divided into thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred. The United States, when it won the Nations' Cup in the RDS, had a team of thoroughbred horses.  There is no doubt that hosting the World Equestrian Games is a tremendous fillip to the image of the Irish horse industry.</P>
      <P>The Army Equitation School has also done a fabulous job over the years for the image of the industry.  I hope to find a means of assisting the Army Equitation School in acquiring a continuous supply of good young horses.  Its riders have been battling on the international front for many decades and they have done a tremendous job for the image and reputation of the Irish horse.  It is an another aspect of the industry which I hope to assist in the future.</P>

      <P>...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> (b)  the development and promotion of the Irish horseracing industry (including the development of authorised racecourses, the guaranteeing of prize money at race-fixtures and the costs of integrity services),</P>
    <P>...</P>
    <P>Does &ldquo;development of authorised racecourses&rdquo; mean that if, for example, the owners of Naas racecourse wish to dispose of property to develop their racecourse, the Authority has a direct input into the type of development that will take place?  It should not have that role; it should be up to the owners of the racecourse to make such decisions.  I accept that the licensing function would impose certain restrictions on the owners.  However, in terms of the general development, the owners are putting their money on the line and they are entitled to decide how it should be spent. Does this provision only apply to racecourses such as The Curragh, which is controlled by the Turf Club, where the Authority would have a role in its development?  If the Authority's role applies to all racecourses, would its role be such as to restrict the type of development which the owners of a racecourse believe they are entitled to carry out?</P>
    <P>I assume that &ldquo;development and promotion&rdquo; applies to sponsorship.  Will the Authority have a function in eliciting sponsorship, or would that be a matter for the racecourses or the racing regulatory body?  We spoke about this matter on Second Stage.  There are many sponsorship opportunities that are not being exploited.  The flagship event is obviously the Budweiser Derby, which is consistent and very well done.  Given the worldwide audience for the event, it is a good investment for Budweiser.</P>
    <P>However, there are opportunities for sponsorship at a lower level and perhaps we do not do enough in that regard.  On Second Stage I mentioned a newspaper report about the possibility of logos being worn on racing silks.  I confess that I am a traditionalist and I would not consider it attractive to see a jockey racing up the <Col N="1779" /> straight in the Curragh with &ldquo;Mars Bar&rdquo; or a slimming product or sauna product &mdash; that might be more appropriate for jockeys &mdash; written on his or her chest. However, it is an important aspect of sponsorship.  It has become prominent in other sports, particularly in golfing, where one can spot the small logo on the golfer's equipment and clothing.  Could the Authority have a function in that regard?</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave spoke about promotion in general.  The quality of the videos being produced by leading Irish stud farms is very high.  On the international scene such videos not only promote the industry but also the country. Would funds be made available to people who make these promotional videos since the videos are sent to international breeders and racing interests?  Yesterday we spoke about the connection between this Minister and the Minister for Trade and Tourism.  The recipients of these videos have in many instances large amounts of money to spend and they are influential in their communities.  The distribution of such videos can be beneficial not only to the bloodstock industry but also to the tourism industry in general.  They are highly effective.</P>
    <P>The World Equestrian Games are coming to Punchestown and this has been discussed in Kildare County Council.  We are anxious to maximise the benefit to the county from the games and the large amount of money which will come into the area as a result.  When the council approaches the Minister for practical assistance for this purpose, I hope he will treat us favourably.  That is a recommendation to the Minister and I apologise, a Chathaoirligh, if it is a parochial one.</P>

      <P>I support what the Minister said and I encourage him to ensure that the Army Equitation School is sufficiently funded.  The development of young horses is important because it is not feasible to buy fully matured horses. The success of the school has been due to its supply of horses being continually renewed.  We cannot stress enough the importance of the school's achievements through the years.  I fully support the Minister's position and I hope he can make his colleagues in Cabinet see the necessity of maintaining that standard and giving sufficient funds.</P>
      <P>The development of authorised race courses is important and the Minister wants all-round standards to improve. The present courses should be maintained as far as possible, but it may be unrealistic to build new ones.  In time some tracks may have to close.  I will not mention any names.  Perhaps the Minister has a list of favourites and a number of others which are not showpieces or he does not like because he did not have a lucky day out.</P>
      <P>The equine industry is on a 32 county basis and every nook and cranny in the country has some connection with horses. Some areas have tremendous traditions. The Minister's region, Waterford, had great success last year.  Tramore may not be the Irish equivalent of Ascot, but that area has a role to play.  Does the Minister envisage the Authority improving overall standards in the maintenance, development and facilities of tracks?  He may have some comments on his pet project, Mallow racecourse, how he sees it progressing and what timescale he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 10 (b), the development of racecourses is a matter for the local race committee. Under the Bill the Authority would assist the committee if it has proposals for assistance and modernisation.  It is the prerogative of the race committee to draw up the proposals and it would then seek capital grant assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also envisage the Authority supporting local management in seeking <Col N="1781" /> sponsorship and having better support for the meetings.  Some racecourses have good management and racing clubs attached to them and they go out of their way to obtain sponsorship.  I think this should be encouraged because it makes the meetings much more attractive for racegoers; it increases the prize money and the meetings are better overall.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the new Authority interfering with local management of race tracks.  It is important however that the local management be encouraged to get sponsorship.  In most parts of the country commercial organisations set aside a certain amount of money for promotion and marketing.  There is no reason why the equine industry should not avail of that and I see the Authority giving assistance and support to those moves.</P>
    <P>Agreement in principle on Mallow racecourse has been arrived at and the small print is being worked out.  Money has been set aside in the budget for this purpose and I want this to come to fruition as early as possible.  Tracks like Galway and Listowel put on meetings which are well sponsored and supported and make every effort to accommodate owners, trainers and racegoers.  I want other local managements to follow that lead and keep facilities and tracks up to standard.  Trainers are sometimes reluctant to take a particular horse to a given track, especially when the weather is taken into account.  The racecourse tracks and facilities should be in proper condition and we hope to achieve that with this new Authority.</P>
    <P>The emergence of race clubs connected to some tracks has helped this move.  In Punchestown over the last few years an ordinary race track has emerged as the Irish equivalent to the Cheltenham Festival. It is extremely well attended and every effort has been made to turn it into an enjoyable, carnival occasion with great racing.  The Punchestown Novice Chase was won this year by Mary Gale and it had £60,000 prize money; elsewhere entire race meetings with six or seven races might have total prize money of £13,000.  This has happened because of <Col N="1782" /> dynamic management and local support through the racing club.</P>
    <P>More of our tracks should take a lead from Punchestown and the other tracks which have done an outstanding job in recent years.  The Authority will support the management of the racecourse rather than dictate to it.</P>

This type of sponsorship to derive revenue happens in many sports &mdash; cycling, car racing, soccer, etc.  I assume it will be a matter for the new Authority or the regulatory body or both to decide whether this is a way to increase funds.  If I had a bet on a horse I would not mind what the jockey was wearing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;11.  &mdash;(1)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order confer on the Authority, in relation to the development and promotion of horseracing, such additional functions connected with the functions for the time being of the Authority, or the services or the activities that the Authority is authorised for the time being to provide or carry on (including functions of <Col N="1783" /> the Minister in relation to any directive, regulation or other act adopted by an institution of the European Union in relation to horseracing) as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>(2)  No order made under subsection (1) shall have effect until it has been laid before and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(3)  No order varying or revoking an order made under this section (including an order under this subsection) shall have effect until it has been laid before and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may make such provision as he considers necessary or expedient in relation to matters ancillary to or arising out of the conferral on the Authority of functions under this section, or the performance of functions so conferred (including provision for the transfer to the Authority of any property held by the Minister for the purposes of functions conferred on the Authority under this section).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is important for this House to be kept informed about the various orders being made, either through the Minister or in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  As regards additional functions and the development and promotion of horseracing, I ask the Minister to consider laying certain orders before this House and to keep us informed about the promotion of certain matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave is proposing to substantially amend section 11 and has provided a new section 11 with four subsections.  Key changes have been made in subsections (2) and (3).  The section is dealing with the power of the Minister to confer additional functions on the horseracing Authority by order. In the present draft, this order would be subject to section 7, which means that the order would be laid before the Oireachtas and either House would have the power <Col N="1784" /> to annul it within the next 21 days on which they sit.</P>
      <P>The proposal seeks to amend section 11 so that an order under that section would not have effect until it is approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This would defeat the purpose of the section. The section is to cater for urgent situations which might arise, where it would be appropriate to confer additional functions on the Authority at relatively short notice.  The safeguards are that in conferring additional functions, those functions must be connected with the functions of the Authority for the time being, or the services or activities which the Authority is already authorised to provide.  As a result, there is no power given to the Minister by virtue of section 11 which would allow him to confer any additional function on the Authority, which is not connected with the functions specified in section 10.</P>
      <P>If the order was required to be approved in advance by the Oireachtas, this could delay providing for some technicality which would allow the Authority to act quickly if a new situation arose. An example may be that if some technical matter arose during the recess, nothing could be done about it for the length of the recess, which is approximately two and a half months.  This is an opportunity to do things quickly.  If there is a problem, it can be annulled within 21 sitting days. There are sufficient safeguards in the Bill on this matter.  Therefore, I oppose amendment No. 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Any individual, association, company or body corporate on whom or on which the Authority shall levy a charge, either on its own behalf or on behalf of the Racing Regulatory Body, or by the agency of the Racing Regulatory Body, or jointly with the Racing Regulatory Body in connection with the powers conferred by this Act on the Authority and on the Racing Regulatory Body, shall have the right to appeal against the level of those charges to a court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is similar to one tabled under section 40.  The question of charges and fines must be considered and there should be an appeals procedure so that people can appeal the level of the charges.  There is a danger that an Authority could impose unreasonable charges, fines or levies.  There should be an appeals system.  For example, the manager of the Irish team could not appeal his fine because it was below a certain amount.  There should be an appeals procedure for small or high charges or levies. It is not right for an authority to suddenly impose a fine because one is dealing with all types of individuals.  A certain charge may not mean a lot to the sheikhs of the world or to the better racecourses, but the racing world is full of small individuals who are not wealthy.  They should have a right of appeal to a court of competent <Col N="1786" /> jurisdiction in relation to an amount being levied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 proposes that people upon whom the Authority levies a charge should have a right of appeal against the level of those charges to a court of competent jurisdiction. It could prove to undermine the power of the Authority in the setting of charges if every individual affected had a right, enshrined in legislation, to challenge the level of charge applied.  We must remember that all the relevant interests in the industry have representation on the Authority.  These groups also have strong and well established associations to negotiate their position for them.  It is reasonable to say that the Authority will, for its own sake, set any charges it sees necessary at a reasonable level.  The representative bodies concerned will lobby to ensure fairness of charges applied.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to subsection (1), where it states that &ldquo;The Authority may make such charges, as it considers necessary and appropriate&rdquo;.  If, in the exceptional circumstances an individual feels that a particular charge on him or her is unfair, then that person would have recourse to the normal legal remedies, such as a judicial review.  For those reasons, I oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 43, to delete &ldquo;after consultation&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;in conjunction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As it stands the section says that: &ldquo;The Authority shall, after consultation with the Racing Regulatory Body, establish a committee (&ldquo;the race-programme committee&rdquo;) to determine the race-programme for all race-fixtures.&rdquo;  Consultation is not strong enough; there should be a joint function here given that the Minister has made improvements to the Bill and, in particular, to section 44 which says: &ldquo;The Racing Regulatory Body shall inform the Authority when making or amending any of the Rules of Racing&rdquo;, in other words, vesting that function in the racing regulatory body rather than in the authority and having the regulatory body inform the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that there would be a spirit of partnership and a spirit of cooperation between the authority and the racing regulatory body and anything that can be done to reduce tension between the two should be done.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment so that rather than have the authority consulting the racing regulatory body and then acting unilaterally there should be <Col N="1789" /> an element of joint decision making in this matter.  This is only in respect of the race programme and not the race fixtures so I do not see what difficulty there would be about the matter.  It is not of major import but, in the spirit in which some of the other amendments have been made by the Minister it would be entirely consistent to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal of this amendment is to change section 20 to have the race programme committee established by the Authority in conjunction with the regulatory body rather than after consultation with that body. I am not satisfied with the phrase &ldquo;in conjunction with&rdquo;.  In the context of the amendment proposed this would lead to some confusion about which organisation has the final responsibility to establish the committee.  It is important in legislation to have clarity above all and, therefore, I am holding to the view that the consultation process suggested in the Bill is sufficient and leaves the final responsibility for establishing the committee firmly with the Authority.</P>
      <P>The Turf Club expressed reservations and concerns about this section and I met its representatives at the meeting in Cork.  I agreed with them that we would simplify the original section and I introduced an amendment in the Dáil to satisfy their concerns.  It is my understanding that it was satisfactory from their point of view.  On those grounds I oppose amendment No. 6.</P>

That power will be vested in the committee and I do not see why the committee cannot be drawn jointly from the authority and the regulatory body.  I realise the Minister has made a genuine attempt to allay some of the fears of the Turf Club and others in respect of the Bill, but just because he has done so does not mean that it is not right to press the amendment.</P>

As everybody knows, the type of programme available at various fixtures is important.  In that Dáil and here reference has been made to the programmes offered at a number of fixtures.  The programmes committee will be important; it will have to meet for extensive periods and have technical people in its membership.

      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the proposed appointment of the new chief executive of the Authority. This is an important position and some thought should go into choosing the most suitable person and what will be expected from that person.  Will it be the Authority, the Minister or a combination of both who will choose the candidate? There were apparent difficulties over some of the nominations to the Authority and no doubt the Minister is aware of possible names being mentioned for the post.  When will the chief executive be appointed?  Will that person come from within the present ranks of the Authority, or has that been decided yet?  If not, will the Minister be seeking a businessman, as has been mentioned by one member of the Authority, with a flair for developing industries.  It will not be sufficient to appoint solely an administrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> It is important to appoint the right person to the job if we want to move the Racing Board into the next century and further develop horse racing.  It is obviously a job that will require reasonable remuneration.  A small salary will not attract the right type of person. Hopefully, the new Authority will work well, but a lot of this will depend on a good chief executive.  I am sure the Minister would agree that the person nominated and selected for this position will have to know about the industry but will also have to have a greater awareness of the importance of selling it.  Could the Minister elaborate on how he would see matters proceeding?  Will it be the Minister or the Authority who will choose the person?  When does the Minister see the chief executive being appointed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is clearly covered under section 21, especially subsection (5), which states that &ldquo;The chief executive shall be appointed, and may be removed from office at any time where he fails to perform his functions satisfactorily, by the Authority.&rdquo;  Therefore, they will be appointed by the Authority, which is only proper.  The Authority was set up to develop the industry and set it on a sound footing, hopefully for many years to come.  It should naturally get the best possible chief executive.  I envisage the Authority putting its structures in place when it gets down to business next week.  It will formally take over from the Racing Board by September.  It will over that period of time have to decide on its chief executive.  I assume it will publicly advertise for the position.</P>
      <P>This situation is now fairly standardised with State bodies.  It involves a chief executive being appointed and given his or her functions by the Authority itself. The only role played either by myself or the Minister for Finance is in ensuring that their salary is set within the public service guidelines.  I will be glad to leave the matter of picking the best person for the job to the good sense and wisdom of the Authority.</P>

When the Minister meets the Authority next Monday could he impress on it the need for appointing a dynamic person who could efficiently promote, sell and run the industry?  Could the Minister also pass on the various comments he heard in this House to the Authority?  I presume most of its members appreciate the necessity of getting it off on the right foot from the first day by getting the right person.  It is not for the Minister or myself to say who that person should be, but he or she should hold more than just an administrative role.  They should be a vehicle for selling, promoting and developing the industry and liaise at all times with the Authority.</P>

      <P>I will convey the wishes expressed by Senator Cosgrave to the Authority.  It makes a great deal of sense for the Authority to treat this matter with the significance and importance it deserves.  The new chief executive will be the key person being charged with the implementation of the programme of development which will be outlined by the Authority.  It would be the wish of the Members of both Houses that the best possible person is sought to assume this role, something in which I concur.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 44, after &ldquo;proper.&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Authority shall act in a fair and impartial manner when considering requests from racecourses for funding and when allocating such funds.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress to the Minister the necessity for treating the various racecourses on an <Col N="1793" /> equal basis.  Obviously, when applications come to the Authority, it will have to come up with priority lists, targets and the like.  However, I hope that all of the money does not only go to a few tracks.  Basic facilities in all tracks should be improved.  Racecourses that are not as fashionable and may not necessarily be admired by everyone should also get a fair hearing.  All of them should be treated fairly and in an impartial manner. When an application is made, each of them should be judged on its merits. While the Authority will obviously have certain priorities &mdash; everything cannot be done overnight &mdash; I hope it will act in a fair and impartial way and without any favour or prejudice against some racetracks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment requires the Authority to act in a fair and impartial manner when considering requests from racecourses for funding and when allocating such funds.  A basic assumption underlining the Bill is that the new Authority will act in a fair and impartial manner in carrying out all of its functions.  In any event, it is required to do so within any reasonable interpretation of the rules of natural justice. It is not necessary therefore to write this into legislation and I am advised that it would not be appropriate to included such a statement in the Bill.  It is not used in other Acts and it would in any event imply that there may be some reason to suspect that the Authority may not act fairly.  It is something which could undermine the Authority.  It could be argued that provisions such as that proposed could be used by a person who vexatiously felt aggrieved by the Authority. Furthermore, any person who feels legitimately aggrieved by the Authority may have recourse to the courts through the judicial review process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The race tracks are well represented on the Authority.  The chairman of the Association of Irish Racecourses, Pierce Maloney, is a member of the Authority, as are two other members who are managers of racecourses.  If I have a concern regarding this matter it is that a number <Col N="1794" /> of the more provincial racecourses are not represented on it and there appears to be a concentration of representation from the County Kildare area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to circumvent your authority, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, and I accept your ruling. However, funding is central to the Bill &mdash; without adequate funding the edifice constructed by the Bill will fall apart. There must be a degree of certainty regarding the way in which the Authority, and racing in general, is to be funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made the point on several occasions about the importance of putting the industry on a sound footing. Section 27 is central to that exercise. A way this could be achieved would be to allocate a fixed sum from off-course betting.  Amendments Nos. 8 and 9, <Col N="1795" /> which unfortunately I am not allowed speak to because they have been ruled out of order, refer to this system of funding and suggest that the off-course revenue should be considered with a view to having part of it allocated to the Authority.</P>
    <P>If adequate prize money is not forthcoming and if the Authority is not provided with adequate funds to resource its functions, the Bill will not achieve the effect the Minister wishes of improving the industry and putting it on a sound footing for the future.  However, unless the funding aspect is dealt with effectively and properly it is impossible to see how the objective which the Minister has set for himself can be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 27 is required to allow for the provision of funds from the Exchequer to the Authority, the level and form of which will be decided in the context of the annual Estimates of public expenditure by Government Departments. It has been much commented upon that the section does not include a specific commitment to the provision of a sum at least equal to 2 per cent of the 10 per cent tax collected on off-course betting.  This would be a major departure from the arrangements which have applied to the provision of Exchequer funds to all other industries and it would take from the power of the Government and the Dáil to decide each year how best the moneys available to them should be spent.  More importantly, it would lead to the position where a substantial number of claims from other sectors to be treated similarly.</P>
      <P>The reason for the demands for the fixing of the funds to the off-course betting is to ensure an adequate level of funding to facilitate the development of the industry in the years ahead.  I have already given a strong commitment on this.  I reiterate my advice to the House on Second Stage of the Bill when I confirmed that the Authority may plan for the future on the basis that the Exchequer contribution will be maintained at current levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> I believe that I can stand on my record regarding previous commitments to this industry.  I accept that we will not always be around to look after our favourite sport or industry, and in view of this I would like to see an amount or percentage of funding provided into the future.  However, given the structure of the office of the Attorney General and the draftsman's office, and given also the way in which the country is run and operated since the foundation of the State, this cannot be done.</P>
    <P>In addition, the amount of money bet on Irish racing is relatively small compared to the amounts bet off-course.  For example, the national lottery is now a major betting opportunity for people in the High Street offices.  In addition, there is betting on British racing and various other activities.  I understand, for example, that the Mount Juliet golf classic, sponsored by Murphy Brewery (Ireland) Limited in Cork, is another occasion where people have a little dabble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Even a large dabble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of how heavily they dabble, but the USA classics are bet on also.  These sports would also seek, with some justification, their cut or percentage from off-course betting.</P>
      <P>Given the constraints and circumstances involved, the section applies the same provisions as are applied to all State bodies.  The current level of funding, which I have made a commitment will be maintained, is in excess of what is sought as a percentage of the off-course betting.  In addition, and as an indication of my goodwill towards the industry, I was able to persuade the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to recognise that any surpluses which the Authority will make will be reinvested in total to promote and develop the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also prepared to consider conferring tax exemption status on the Authority in the next Finance Act, which would be of great benefit to the Authority.  The incentive would then <Col N="1797" /> exist to create various ways of raising revenue, revenue which would go totally into the industry for its further development.</P>
    <P>Given the two-thirds of the cost of the various services, prize money and development of the industry provided by the taxpayer, together with the tax and income status which we propose conferring on it, the industry is doing relatively well.  It is my intention &mdash; and I have put this on the record for future Ministers in charge of the industry &mdash; to ensure that an adequate and appropriate level of funding will be available.</P>
    <P>Under the circumstances there is no further strengthening I can give to the industry and I am satisfied that there will be scope and opportunity for the Authority to plan into the future on the basis of this section to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points that was made on Second Stage was the fairly central issue of prize money.  It is apparent that without adequate prize money the industry will die on its feet.  There must be some reasonable expectation when one puts a horse in training that one is going to make something out of it. During the past week certain criticisms were levelled at the industry about the fact that off-course betting was primarily directed at English racing because it was perceived to be fairer than Irish racing.  I do not know the truth or otherwise of that allegation but on the assumption that there was some substance to it, part of it would have to relate to an inadequacy in prize money.  If the prize money is not adequate to cover the expenses being met by the owner there is an obvious temptation to wait to bring off the coup. Prize money is important in terms of actually making the industry fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the Minister, with my hand on my heart, that on one occasion in the Phoenix Park I was going into a race meeting with an owner who was approached by another owner asking if a deal could be done prior to the race. Fortunately, my owner was an honourable person and said there were no circumstances under which he would <Col N="1798" /> consider a deal.  In the event, his horse was beaten a short head by the horse of the owner who had sought the deal.  That sort of carry on cannot be legislated for but it comes back to the point that prize money is important.</P>
    <P>The Turf Club's accounts for 1993 indicate that the Racing Board contributed £5 million in prize money while owners contributed £4 million.  Commercial sponsorship accounted for approximately £2.25 million and other sources of prize money came from EBF sponsorship and surplus funds, giving a total prize fund of £12,242,650.  It is a substantial amount of money but not when you spread it over all the races in the Irish calendar.  Yesterday, we discussed the fact that the average figure for prize money was just over £7,000, but when one takes the classics and group 1 races out of it, you are down to small amounts of money.  The Minister himself referred to race meetings where the total prize money was no more than £12,000 for the day.  An important issue at stake here is that if the industry is to be developed, the question of prize money and the wider aspect of funding is central to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that certain procedures have been in place since the foundation of the State.  We get into very heavy going in this area, to use racing parlance.  The Turf Club had certain procedures in place for 200 years and it was deemed important to rectify those, so perhaps procedures which have been in place since the foundation of the State could also be reviewed.  That, however, is a wider issue.</P>
    <P>In terms of off-course betting, there are events which people bet on which have nothing to do with horse racing, such as golfing and the outcome of the World Cup.  Nevertheless, on the basis that that money is going into the Exchequer, there is an entitlement that our largest industry based on betting should derive significant benefit.  Yesterday, the Minister used a figure of £35 million which accrued to the Exchequer from off-course betting.  The £5 million from the Racing Board, which takes the on-course side of the business into <Col N="1799" /> account, is very small.  We will deal with on-course betting later on, where there is a huge possibility for development.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how a State monopoly can lose money on betting.  We must be unique in the world in that the tote actually loses money.  I do not know how that is possible.  I do not know of any betting operation that ever lost money anywhere other than that particular one. Another aspect of the issue is that much of the off-course betting is falling into the hands of large English or other international companies.  The small high street bookmaker has gone out of business or has been taken over by the large operators if he was in any way successful.  I do not have a great deal of sympathy for these big operators.</P>
    <P>There is another question that I wish to spring on the Minister and I am sure he can answer it.  It concerns the race apprentice centre which, as the Minister knows, is highly successful.  It has done valuable work in bringing competent and qualified people into the industry.  I assume that the Authority will be responsible for funding the race apprentice centre, the equine centre and the farrier scheme and that they will continue as before.  In other words, I assume that their funding is secure and that there is no question of them not securing the funds which they require to continue in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Dardis in relation to prize money.  Until the Exchequer contribution to racing a few years ago, funding was at an all time low and it was hardly worth people's while participating.  The Senator rightly made the point that if people had the cost of keeping a horse in training, the incentive was there to wait for a coup rather than be bothered with the small amount of prize money available.  In the last few years the situation has improved, especially in the National Hunt end of the industry where prize money has increased substantially and now compares favourably with most other racing <Col N="1800" /> industries worldwide.  That is not to say, however, that it cannot be further improved.  I would encourage the management of racetracks to seek additional sponsorship because it is obviously worthwhile for people to enter horses in valuable races.  If the value of the prize money is sufficient they will all be trying. There is an unfortunate perception that racing in Britain or other countries is fairer on the punter than here and that they get better value for their money. Whether there is any credence to that or not I do not know.  This Authority, however, will seek to improve the facilities, regulation, image and integrity of Irish horseracing.  The Authority will put every effort into ensuring that all those matters are to the fore in their deliberations. I wish them success in that regard.</P>
      <P>The race apprentice centre and the equine centre are extremely important components of the overall industry.  On a number of occasions I have been at the race centre where they are producing fine Irish-born jockeys as well as training apprentices from Japan and other countries. Not alone do they train them in the skills of horse riding but they also provide education in managing their domestic finances.  Many of the apprentices come from fairly deprived backgrounds and get a tremendous opportunity &mdash; probably their first &mdash; in education as well as learning a skill.  They also have the opportunity to have a fine career and maybe even become famous.  Many of us would never qualify for entry to that school because you have to weigh about five stone and anybody over that limit would be excluded.  So, it is not just on the CV alone that one gets into it.  Similarly, tremendous work has been done in the equine centre.  We all know that when viruses strike, the horses run below par and a stable can be put out of business. It is important to have all the components in place for a comprehensive industry. The new Authority is charged with the responsibility of looking after the various sectors and I am sure that that will be done.</P>

    <P>Sections 28 to 32, inclusive, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister introduced an amendment in the other House in relation to the starting price.  Much depends on the starting price and is the Minister satisfied that any difficulties or problems have been dealt with by this section?  As the Minister is aware, it is most important that there is no question of any underhand dealing and that there is one official starting price.  Perhaps the Minister can confirm that the various people who made representations to him are satisfied, particularly the off course bookmakers, because there have been questions with regard to the starting price.</P>
      <P>Our friend in England, Mr. McCrirrick, makes great play at times about a horse that is two to one on the off but which is suddenly shortened up to seven to four when it comes to giving the starting price.  The Minister is probably on a better price anyway.  One could be concerned about a manipulation of the service, particularly as regards the control waged by the major forces and large chains in that they could perhaps start to write their own price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The integrity of starting prices is an essential component of racing.  The starting price return is the return made by a person at a race fixture who has examined the generality of odds available to punters at the track from on course bookmakers.  This person takes into account what level of bets are being placed with the different bookmakers at particular odds and then calculates what he or she assesses to be the odds which were typically available to punters at the track on each horse in each race at the off.  These are the odds which are then used by bookmakers on the high street for paying bets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" /> Naturally, it is critical to the off course betting scene that the integrity of the starting price return is maintained.  The system for returning the starting price has for the last few years been the subject of a contract between the people calculating the starting prices and the Association of Irish Racecourses.  A situation developed from this in recent years whereby two contracts existed and therefore for certain events two starting prices were calculated, which was chaotic.  This led to confusion and did not protect the integrity of the starting price return.  It could have serious consequences for off-course betting on Irish horseracing.</P>
    <P>It was not our intention to alter the current regime in any way other than to ensure that as soon as possible there is no more than one starting price in respect of any race, that the situation whereby there are two starting prices being dissimulated is not allowed to recur and that the job continues to be carried out by people or an organisation that is both independent and reputable.  It is therefore envisaged that the licence will be issued to an independent and reputable organisation, but this will be done on the nomination of the Association of Irish Racecourses.  A provision is included to allow individual racecourses to nominate a body.  It is not anticipated that it will be used other than in exceptional circumstances where the association was unable to continue to represent all racecourses. There will now be a specific requirement, by the insertion of subsection (5), that there shall be no more than one starting price returned for any horse in any race.</P>
    <P>As the Senator correctly said, this matter was the subject of a great deal of concern and I met a number of delegations. In association with those who were concerned about this matter, a consensus was reached that this section covers it adequately.  Nobody wants a reoccurrence of the chaos of the two starting prices for horses at particular meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister envisage the tote operating at Down Royal and Downpatrick in the future?  The Minister said that there will be changes in the way the tote operates as regards the High Street, but is there an integral difficulty involved in having the tote operate there? Has the Minister had any consultations with his opposite number, or would it require legislation?  Racing there needs a boost and it prevents jackpots taking place, etc.  In time, given the new improved tote, does the Minister envisage that it will operate at those two meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 34 we have a continuation of the provision in the 1945 Act simply giving the Authority power to operate a tote betting service.  However, this section also allows for the service to be provided by a subsidiary company. The Authority or subsidiary could then enter joint ventures on developments in this area.  This an enabling situation which would allow the tote to develop in conjunction with the developments taking place generally.</P>
      <P>An amendment to the Tote Act, in section 63 of the Bill, will remove the one technical restriction in that Act which would have prevented the extension of tote betting to the high street.  Simple amendments to the Department of Finance tote regulations and the Racing Board's tote licence could then provide for such an extension of the tote if the Authority make a case for it.  There has been much criticism voiced about the fact that the existing Irish tote is not making money for the industry.  The provision in this Bill will affect the tote and how it may be structured.  It will allow the Authority to reorganise the way in which the tote is operated so as to put in place the structure which would be most efficient and profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of this House and the other House have raised the fact that the tote <Col N="1804" /> in Ireland must one of the few tote operations anywhere in the world that does not return a profit.  In my Second Stage speeches in both Houses I stated that this is one of the matters that I want the new Authority to examine at an early stage. There is no point in the Exchequer providing money for an industry if the industry's own resources are declining. Unfortunately, this is what has happened in recent years in relation to Irish racing. I want the Authority to examine all ways and means to develop the industry, particularly in relation to developing new sources of revenue and rationalising and making more efficient its existing sources.</P>
    <P>I see no difficulty with having the tote operations here available to racing anywhere in the world, including Down Royal.  I will examine the possibility of discussing the extension of the tote to particular racecourses with the industry there.  It is a 32 county sport and if its facilities can be developed in any way, including the tote, it will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If one is at a track in England, one can bet on the tote there. This should be possible in Ireland; it makes sense.  The whole area of the tote must be examined in terms of improvements and expansion.  It seems crazy that a body which does not lose money elsewhere loses money in this area.  The tote should be expanded and connected so that if one is in Mallow one can also bet on a race in Leopardstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an enabling provision. If one is in Mallow and there is a meeting at Leopardstown in which one fancies something in the third race, one will have the opportunity to place one's bet in Mallow, Sligo or elsewhere.  I gave the example yesterday of racing in Australia, which is a highly developed industry. As the House is aware, there are approximately 35 minutes between each race and people want activity.  They do not just bet on the race that is taking place on the track there but perhaps on races at five or six other tracks elsewhere in the country.  If there is racing at Ascot <Col N="1805" /> or Cheltenham and somebody is at a meeting in Listowel, Galway, Leopardstown or wherever, they will have an opportunity to place their bet on the racecourse, at particular tracks.  With satellite communication tracks can show racing from other tracks on large screens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that it is not intended in this section to even consider allowing the Authority itself to act as a bookmaker, this section would only allow a subsidiary of the Authority to act as a bookmaker. This is further qualified in section 36 which provides that such a subsidiary company can only be established with the <Col N="1806" /> consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Senators may be concerned about the risks which may be involved in a State board operating as a bookmaker. I assure the House that this is only an enabling provision.  It was recommended by the Dowling committee, to which I referred yesterday.  It was felt by that broadly based industry committee that the option of allowing a subsidiary of the Authority to become involved in bookmaking should be there to be used only if circumstances in the future made such a development desirable.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis pointed out that many regular family bookmakers have gone out of business because they were unprofitable or, if they were profitable, they were taken over by major British companies such as Corals and Ladbrokes.  The whole structure of bookmaking has changed over the last decade and will probably change further over the next number of decades.  The industry felt that this enabling section will be an option for it in the future and the Minister and the Minister for Finance would have to give consent.  This would not be given unless there were serious and well researched studies carried out on the matter and detailed proposals submitted which would justify such a development.  It would be possible at some stage in the future for the Authority to derive funds for the industry from this source and to lead the betting industry in the development of new and improved betting facilities. I strongly oppose the deletion of this section.  It was requested by the industry as an enabling measure which may in the future be a possibility for it.</P>

      <P>The new declaration system is a help.  It means that people do not have to spend a lot of money entering races weeks in advance of them being held.  Perhaps the Minister would note my point regarding fines and fees and mention it to the Authority. Big owners will not be affected badly by the loss of a few pounds. However, other owners might be operating on a tight budget and unnecessary fines and levies do not help them or help to keep them in the industry.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 26, before section 50, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;50.  &mdash;Notwithstanding any provisions of this Part of the Bill, the Authority may set out regulations which will allow for the sale of bookmaker's pitches at racecourses so that authorised bookmakers with course-betting representative permits with not less than two years experience or service on racecourses, shall be able to purchase them freely.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> There have been difficulties about the availability and passing on of pitches on racecourses.  The Minister should look at this matter and talk to the members of the Authority and other representatives about it.  Some bookmakers down the line find it difficult to stay in business and they are far from where the main action is taking place.  Perhaps some areas should be redesigned.  At some racecourses in England the pitches are almost on top of each other and it is most uncomfortable.  However, at other tracks one could walk a couple of furlongs, from one end of the line to the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Senator's proposal appears to have merit, I did not intend that the Bill should be so intrusive into the organisation of the betting regime on racecourses.  That is a matter for the racecourses and the bookmakers. The Authority is involved in the type of betting that takes place because it affects the levy and the service to the punter.</P>
      <P>Section 50 envisages agreement between racecourses and bookmakers on a range of issues relating to betting.  The Authority then brings in regulations governing these areas.  The regulations and rules on the sale of bookmaker pitches should be specified.  As I promised the Dáil, I will ask the Authority to examine this matter when drafting the regulations and to do so in consultation with the bookmakers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 28, lines 1 to 6, to delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This refers to the opening hours for betting offices on racecourses.  The subsection <Col N="1812" /> specifies that the betting office should not be open for business before the public is admitted and should not be open for more than one hour after the conclusion of the last race.</P>
    <P>It is fair to assume that the operation of racecourses will change in the future. They will become more like leisure centres and will have a wider range of uses than is the case at present.  If we assume that Leopardstown, for example, has restaurants and other facilities available to the public, is associated with a sports club and is open to the public seven days of the week, it would appear to be reasonable that the betting office on the premises should also be open to the public.  It would probably be an added attraction. It makes sense and would be part of the overall development of the industry.  The amendment is proposed in that context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 proposes to delete the control of the opening hours of betting offices.</P>
      <P>The opening hours of betting offices are restricted from the time the public is admitted to the racecourse for the race fixture to one hour after the last race. This is necessary because the opening hours of betting premises on the High Street are severely restricted to 6 p.m. each evening and they are closed on Sundays. The exemption to these laws is allowed because of the direct association of the betting activity to the sport of horse racing taking place; therefore the extended hours in the evenings and on Sundays must be limited to the event.</P>
      <P>Any further liberalisation is a matter for amendment of the Betting Act, 1931, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister for Justice.  It would not be appropriate for me to make amendments to the betting laws in this Act beyond those strictly necessary in the context of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments are taking place in racing and other activities on which people place bets.  Events can be seen on satellite television and people in pubs and other social centres may want to place bets on the event.  This is happening unofficially <Col N="1813" /> at present and perhaps these bets should be allowed officially when evening meetings from various parts of the world can be seen.  On the other hand, these facilities are fine for those making the bets, but their spouses or families may think there is enough betting at present without further liberalisation.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice to amend the Betting Act, 1931, if this is thought desirable.  I can tell my colleagues this call has been made but the matter needs some consideration before making a change.  The section allows for betting up to one hour after the race meeting and I think that is a reasonable balance.  I oppose amendment No. 14 because further opportunities to bet would liberalise betting to a far greater extent than many of the non-betting public would wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Minister to think I am proposing unrestricted betting because I see the dangers involved there, although it is reasonable to assume people who are addicted to betting will find a way to service their habit.  However, the concern here is that the subsection precludes racecourses from becoming involved in betting activities if there was free public access to the course.</P>
      <P>If this subsection is adopted, am I correct in saying there would be no circumstances under which the course would be able to operate a betting service other than under the terms of the subsection? In that case, if there is a large event on a day, not necessarily a racing day, on which the public has access to race course bars and restaurants, the course would be precluded from operating a betting service.  Activities on non-racing days are likely to increase, so would betting be precluded in all circumstances except under the terms of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as outlined by the Senator; the facilities are directly associated with the event taking place at the racecourse.  I know what <Col N="1814" /> the Senator refers to because I was in Leopardstown when the Breeders Cup was beamed in by satellite.  It was a nice occasion and I, along with others, would have liked to have a bet on a horse in the race to heighten the excitement, but that was not possible.  On such occasions I think the provision of betting facilities would be reasonable but the public may have a different view.  The proposed liberalisation and opening up of additional betting opportunities is quite far-reaching. I will bring the matter to the attention of the Departments and Ministers responsible, but in relation to this amendment I am unable to accede to Senator Dardis' request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 33, subsection (1), line 2, after &ldquo;authorisation&rdquo;, where it firstly occurs, to insert &ldquo;issued by the Racecourse Regulatory Body&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main concern is with amendment No. 17, which is concerned with the duration of the licence.  On Second Stage I said five years is not long enough.  If a body operating a racecourse wants to begin a development programme and wishes to borrow to raise funds, there may be a degree of uncertainty.  If the bank discovers the licence will only last five years <Col N="1815" /> it will almost inevitably not give a loan for a longer period because it cannot be certain the licence will be renewed.  The non-renewal may be an unlikely eventuality but bankers are adept at catering for all such events and limit their exposure to a great degree.</P>
    <P>The period should therefore be longer because five years is a short time.  Given the way racecourses are operated it is unlikely circumstances would change so much within a ten year period as to preclude giving a second licence.  The process is more likely to take ten rather than five years.  If the Racecouse Regulatory Body is to be the licensing body, the Bill should specify that it rather than the Authority will grant the authorisation. That is the reason for proposing Amendment No. 15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press amendment No. 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 15 I refer the Senator to the definition of an authorised racecourse in the Bill as one authorised by an Authority under section 59.  Racecourses are licensed by the regulatory body under the rules of racing under section 39; this relates to the racing track, etc.  Racecourses are authorised by the Authority under section 59 and this relates to all facilities at the racecourse, including accommodation for bookmakers, betting offices, punters and the public.  It is vital for the future of the industry that all racecourses have appropriate facilities to service their customers. This point was made by several Senators during the course of the debate.  In those circumstances it is therefore essential that if the Authority is to develop the industry it must have a role in the authorisation of racecourses so that it can ensure as far as possible that facilities are up to current day standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 is not moved. Amendment No. 17 envisages openended authorisation unless a racecourse ceases to comply with published or specified requirements.  Two or more suspensions for this purpose would lead to <Col N="1816" /> revocation of the authorisation.  I do not see the need for this system, but I see the need in the current climate for spectators, who are looking for better facilities, and for horse owners and trainers, whose needs are changing.  Every racecourse should be reviewed at least every five years.  It is not intended to use this provision to close down or impede smaller racecourses.  Some Senators expressed fears in this regard during the Second Stage debate.  I do not see this happening in practice.  I see this review period being used to ensure that the facilities provided at racecourses are kept up to the standard which the public are entitled to expect when they go racing.  Nothing more or less is required.</P>
    <P>As we know, some racecourse managements go to tremendous lengths to ensure that the racegoing public, the owners and the trainers have proper facilities.  I know owners who find it difficult to take horses to certain courses because the stabling is inadequate.  A couple of years ago in Killarney horses broke out of their boxes and went all over the place.  If I recall correctly, Mr. Jim Bolger had to take his horses back to Kilcullen.  They did not race at a meeting that day or any other day.  There is a requirement to have adequate facilities and a review every five years to ensure that a certain standard is reached for the racecourse, trainers and horses,</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 17, racecourses should be reviewed at least every five years.  I consider that the ten years suggested in the amendment is too long a duration to leave a racecourse without some review.  For that reason, I oppose the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister said about amendment No. 15, but I continue to make the point about amendment No. 17.  If racecourse owners embark on a substantial capital development, they need to be sure that the licence is for ten years, particularly if they are to operate in reasonable conditions. If they have a licence for only five years, the bank manager may not lend them money for seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> We are creating an additional layer of bureaucracy.  We are now saying that the racing regulatory body is the licensing body for racecourses.  That amendment was introduced by the Minister in the Dáil and I welcome it, because it is important that the racing regulatory body is the licensing authority.  However, in addition to the licensing of the racecourse, we now have an authorisation, which is a layer above the licensing body. Does this mean the racing regulatory body could licence a racecourse but the Authority will not authorise it?  What is the difference between an authorisation and a licence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Racecourses should be reviewed every five years.  In the course of everyday activities, for example, if one is looking for a driving licence, there is a requirement to review matters so that things are not left in place for too long.  In most instances racecourse management ensure that facilities are kept up to the highest standards.  It is reasonable that a review, and it is nothing other than a review&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The racecourses will be authorised in the first instance, but then a five year review will take place after that.  That is reasonable and it should not affect people's financial requirements.  In some instances there should be a stringent review.  I was at a race meeting recently and a number of horses had to be put down because the standard of the track was so bad.  That was not the official reason given, but the track was not up to the required standard from the animals' point of view.  In some cases before one enters the racecourse, one needs to wear wellingtons to get as far as the turnstiles. If the sport and the industry is to flourish, which we all want it to, certain reasonable standards must apply.  The requirement to have a review every five years is reasonable.  For this reason I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

    <P>The intention behind the amendment is to increase the number on the Authority. <Col N="1819" /> Although it appears that most interests are represented, some are doubly and trebly represented.  The horse trainers, in particular, have a representative from the short list and the Minister is also entitled to nominate one.  Many of these interests are more than adequately represented. Perhaps the Minister could tell me why a member of the Jockeys Association was not included.  Jockeys are an integral part of the system.  Their lot at times is difficult, because the Pat Edderys, the Michael Kinanes and the Charlie Swans are in the minority.  Many jockeys have a short life span, particularly those involved in National Hunt racing.  They need to get everything they can, including a jockeys benevolent fund.  Their lot must be looked after.  I am not saying that some of the members on the Authority will not show concern for them. However, I wonder what liaison is going to take place.  They seem to be the obvious missing link.</P>
    <P>This brings me to amendment No. 21. I do not know what has gone on in relation to the members from Northern Ireland.  The Minister's Northern Ireland counterpart set up a committee of five to select a person and the name of Mr. Jim Nicholson was forwarded, but in the course of the race for the Authority he seems to have become unseated and has been withdrawn.  This has not been clarified and there is a case now to be made to right the wrong and include this individual on the Authority.  The Minister has said that he knows him and is aware of his great ability.  There is concern that the Minister's original list was changed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take these two issues on board.  I do not know what consideration was given to having jockeys represented.  You would not go too far in horse racing if you did not have a jockey on board.  There is a case to be made for clarifying the position of the representative of the Northern Ireland horse racing industry nominated for appointment by the committee established by the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.  I ask the Minister to respond positively to this matter.  He <Col N="1820" /> has not given us much today.  He might consider giving us something.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also find it very curious that Mr. Nicholson is not a member of the Authority.  I do not know anything of the credentials of the lady who has taken that place.  There was a general expectation that Mr. Nicholson would be the person from Northern Ireland who would become a member of the Authority.  I find what has happened very surprising and I would be interested in the Minister's comments on it.</P>
      <P>I would not be in favour of increasing the membership of the Authority from 15 to 17 as proposed by Senator Cosgrave, because the Authority is almost too big as it is and it would become very unwieldy if it was any bigger.  To that end I tabled amendment No. 22, which would reduce from four to three the number of people chosen by the Minister.  The Authority is big enough and it could with effect be smaller.  I am very reluctant to grant the Minister a large block of votes in any body of this nature.  This is not a comment on the Minister personally, it is a comment on any Minister.  As a matter of principle it is undesirable that the Minster's representatives should be dominant within a body established under statue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that an amendment was made to introduce a representative of racegoers onto the body.  Because an extra person is being included at that level, we should reduce the four that the Minister has the power to include, although one of those is a representative of the horse racing industry in Northern Ireland.  My original intention was to propose that the number of the Minister's nominees be reduced from four to two, but given that one of them is a representative of the horse racing industry in Northern Ireland, I would be satisfied with reducing the number to three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question whether it is possible for this Legislature to compel the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture to establish a committee.  We could possibly ask them, but I do not know what effect our law would have in terms of making them responsible for forming a committee <Col N="1821" /> which would select a representative from Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Amendments No. 18, 20 and 21 would have the effect of increasing the Authority by a further two places. This would mean an authority consisting of 18 members.  That would be too large and cumbersome.</P>

      <P>I wish them luck on Monday night.</P>
      <P>I was originally reluctant to have as many as 16 on the Authority but found that this was necessary to achieve the balance of interests which I wanted.  I do not want to see a cartoon in the next issue of a prestigious publication showing a very substantial queue lining up for the first meeting of the new Authority.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendments No. 20 and 21, jockeys do not need to have special representation on the Authority.  Any or all of the members of the Authority represent the interests of jockeys at appropriate times when matters relating to them are being discussed.  Members of the governing bodies and others such as owners and trainers will have special roles to play in relation to jockeys.  I have had requests from owners that they should have more members on the Authority. I know all the members of the Authority and virtually all of them are owners as well as representing other sectors of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representation of the industry in Northern Ireland is provided for by direct appointment.  The situation regarding who or which body would be best suited to making nominations in relation to Northern Ireland interests can change from time to time and rather than rely on one nomination, I felt it was necessary to have the system by which I would select the person to represent the industry in Northern Ireland open.  Very few would argue with the choice that has been made. People have made comments about the person appointed and in most cases preface <Col N="1822" /> their remarks by saying they do not know the person concerned.</P>
    <P>As I explained already, a number of requirements had to be fulfilled.  There is a requirement of balance as between different sectors and interests in the industry.  There was also a gender balance requirement.  Very few would argue against including five women in a State authority of 16 persons.  Racecourses are adequately represented, not alone by their chairperson but also by two other managers of racecourses.  I had the difficult job of selecting people to give balance in regard to gender and the different sectors of the industry.  I stand over my appointment.  I know Mr. Nicholson and wish to put on the record of the House the very fine job he has done for the industry in Northern Ireland and in particular the modernisation and upgrading of Down Royal racecourse.</P>
    <P>I said that I would be specifically asking the new Authority to take the Northern Ireland end of the industry into account and to give it special attention because it falls between two stools.  I said earlier that I was at Down Royal some time ago. There were six races at that meeting and the total prize money was £12,500.  In other words, there was a purse of £2,000 per race with £2,500 for the main race of the day.  By and large, our prize money is far in excess of that paid there, so I would like the new Authority to give special attention to the industry in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have to have regard for overall balance and there are some constraints on me.  Overall, the Authority consists of people with not only a national but an international reputation.  We have in this country some fine, astute trainers, for example, and we have a tremendous tradition of training horses.  Mr. Vincent O'Brien must be one of the all time great trainers in the world, as was the late Mr. Tom Draper in the National Hunt scene. We have at present a new crop of trainers who are internationally recognised and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps we will breed a Wimbledon winner in due course.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 22 Senator Dardis proposes reducing the number of people the Minister may appoint directly from four to three.  Excluding the representative from Northern Ireland, this would reduce the Minister's direct appointments from three to two.  Any reasonable person would have to accept that on an Authority comprising 16 members the Minister of the day should be allowed to appoint at least three out of the 16.  It is absolutely essential if he or she is to be given any opportunity to try to achieve the balances necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would rely on some of the good advice given to me by a former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, in his contribution in the Dáil on this matter.  He <Col N="1824" /> said that if there was one element he disagreed with, it was the system of nominating bodies and that in his experience &mdash;and he was Minister for over four years &mdash;the worst board over which he had to preside was Bord na gCapall.  He eventually had to abolish it; it was the world's worst and it was comprised totally of nominated people.  He suggested that any Minister of the day worth his or her salt would appoint the Authority or the board and stand over it.  If it was good the Minister could claim credit and if it was in any way useless he or she would have to accept responsibility.</P>

There was no official nominating body in the area so I was left to have regard for the general balance <Col N="1825" /> and was constrained by gender balance and the balance of the different sectors of the industry represented on the Authority.

      <P>In page 40, paragraph 4, line 1, to delete &ldquo;The Minister may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The Authority may by a simple majority of all its members&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two amendments relate to the power the Minister has in respect of dismissing people.  Paragraph (4) of the Schedule states that: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time remove the chairman from office&rdquo;, and paragraph (12) states that: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time remove an ordinary member of the Authority from office&rdquo;.  The Minister talked about the various bodies who had nominating powers to the Authority and the need for balance in the Authority, and I would agree with him.  If they have the power to put forward a representative for inclusion in the Authority, then allowing the Minister to remove the chairman or a member of the Authority from office without significant grounds for doing so is to confer on the Minister a power which is not appropriate.  It should be left to the Authority to vote no confidence in a member.  It should be the vehicle by which people who have lost the confidence of the Authority might lost office. Suppose there is a change of Government, <Col N="1827" /> it leaves it wide open to the incoming Minister to get rid of some of those it may regard as enemies.  That is bad for the interests of the industry. There must be continuity in the way the Authority operates.  That would be a priority which I am sure the Minster would accept.</P>
    <P>If a steward at the Turf Club or the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee is a person the Minister decides should be dismissed from the office of the Authority, does he cease to be a steward of the racing regulatory body, the Turf Club or the Irish National Hunt Committee? He could find himself in an impossible position.  A person may not be a member of the Authority while remaining a steward of the Turf Club.  If the senior steward of the Turf Club was dismissed from the Authority, would he automatically cease to be senior steward of the Turf Club?  That would also cause untold chaos if it arose.</P>

      <P>In response to amendments Nos. 19 and 23, the chairman plays a key role in the affairs of any organisation, especially in an authority like the Irish Horseracing Authority.  In such a case, the Minister of the day is effectively delegating certain major responsibilities on that industry to a chairman and a full board.  That is why he, in the final analysis, appoints a chairman.  If he is unhappy with their performance, he must be able to remove that chairman if he feels it is necessary.  This would only happen under extreme and exceptional circumstances.  Of course, the laws of natural justice would come into play.  If a Minister appointed a chairman and disagreed with him for a certain reason, there would be good grounds for him to take a case claiming that his reputation was destroyed and was reduced by this effective dismissal.  This is only a precautionary measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an association like the Irish Horseracing Authority, the chairperson of the day has an extremely important role. Being a semi-State body, it must do its job properly and correctly.  If for any <Col N="1828" /> reason that does not happen over a period of time, this section would be appropriate to deal with it, but it would only be used in extreme and exceptional circumstances and the laws of natural justice would apply.  For that reason, I oppose both amendments.</P>

    <P>On the issue of the new Authority, I express my appreciation to those organisations which submitted names, to those who accepted membership of the Authority, because there is no remuneration of any kind, and to those who served on the various groups and committees.  Such people have jobs and occupations to pursue, yet they spent an enormous amount of time going through the proposed provisions of the Bill in fine detail.

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the dissolution of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards, for the sale of their ancillary business and for the establishment of a new National Milk Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before addressing the specific provisions of the Bill I would like, if I may, to say a few words about the background to this measure.  The Dublin and Cork <Col N="1831" /> District Milk Boards were established in 1936 and 1937 respectively by Orders made under the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936.  The boards' primary function was to ensure an adequate all year round supply of milk for liquid consumption in the country's two biggest urban areas.  This was achieved through the boards' power to ensure that producers received a minimum price for their milk.  Prior to 1936 the producer price of milk had occasionally fallen below the cost of production leading to shortages in supply during the winter months.  The milk board regime provides for a &ldquo;production district&rdquo; from which dairy farmers supply milk and a &ldquo;sales district&rdquo; in which the pasteurisers and distributors must have a registered premises in which to prepare milk for the consumer.  In Cork the sale and production districts are the same &mdash; an area within a radius of about seven kilometres of the city centre.  In Dublin the sales area is Dublin city and county, together with the urban district of Bray, while the production district comprises most of Leinster.</P>
    <P>Only milk supplied by a registered producer to a registered pasteuriser could lawfully be used in the preparation of milk for liquid consumption within a board's sales area.  In times of scarcity milk could, of course, be brought in from outside the production district, but this was subject to licence.  While the board system had legal effect only in the Cork and Dublin areas, it formed a model for the arrangements which applied in certain other areas.  The system worked well over the years and despite the pronounced seasonality of milk production in Ireland, it ensured an adequate supply of milk for liquid consumption throughout the year.  It is generally regarded as having been a major contributory factor in Ireland's high level of milk consumption. However, following the receipt of complaints, the European Commission formally notified the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry that the boards' regulatory activities were contrary to European <Col N="1832" /> Union law.  I suppose that I had better express an interest here in that the main complainant was myself.</P>

      <P>The restriction of access to the market for drinking milk in their respective areas to registered producers, processors and distributors located in the areas concerned, the subjection of the marketing of milk from outside those areas to a licensing system, and the maintenance of an arrangement establishing a minimum producer milk price were, in the Commission's view, not in accordance with the common organisation of the market in milk and milk based products in Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome. On the advice of the Attorney General it was decided not to challenge the Commission's opinion.  Nevertheless, it is very important that the supply of milk for liquid consumption in Ireland should have some form of regulation because, due to the highly seasonal pattern of our production, a complete <i>laissez-faire</i> approach could result in shortages during the winter months.  Accordingly, the Department entered into consultations with the European Commission about alternative arrangements which would be in the best interests of both producers and consumers and would be within European Union law.  The central provisions of the Bill now before the House are the result of this process.</P>
      <P>Both the central provisions of the Bill and the consequential provisions have been the subject of consultation with the various parties affected.  There is a very high level of support for the measure on all sides in the industry and I am satisfied that the Agency, which will be financed entirely by the industry itself through a statutory levy on milk sales, will ensure the orderly development of the market for milk for liquid consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The production, processing, marketing and distribution of milk for direct human consumption is important to the continuance of a strong and vibrant dairy industry.  The drinking milk sector provides <Col N="1833" /> a stable outlet for about 10 per cent of our total milk production, good returns for producers and high employment levels in distribution.  There are at present some 4,500 producers supplying 39 pasteurising establishments with milk to a retail value of some £300 million per annum.  There are about 5,000 persons employed in its collection, preparation and distribution.</P>
    <P>In addition to their statutory functions, the milk boards became involved in the provision of services to the dairy farmers in their respective areas to encourage them in the efficient production of good quality milk.  These services included the artificial insemination of cattle, milk recording and mastitis control.  As a result of this, the boards have acquired considerable assets and now employ some 125 staff.  This ancillary business has declined somewhat over the last few years and this decline is reflected in the boards' financial position.  In the four years from 1989 to 1992, inclusive, they lost a total of over £500,000 between them.  It is not expected that the audited accounts for 1993 will show a reversal of that trend.  The basic problem is that because of the decrease in demand for some of the services which they provide, the boards are now, by commercial standards, significantly overstaffed.</P>
    <P>I should, I know, refer to the fact that this is the second time a Bill to abolish the Milk Boards and establish a National Milk Agency has been brought before this House.  The previous Bill was introduced in November 1991 and completed its Second Stage in January 1992.  I recall that occasion very well, when concern was expressed by various Members to ensure that both assets and staff were looked after in an orderly way.  Accepting the concern raised here at that time, I undertook to do that.  It has taken a considerable length of time to put things in place and obtain general agreement with the staff associations and unions.  I am glad that that point has now been reached.  But at that stage, negotiations with the boards' staff were still in progress. It was intended that before the Bill completed its passage through the <Col N="1834" /> House, such provisions relating to staff as might require statutory effect would be included in the Bill.  However, the negotiations did not conclude until January of this year, when the staff voted to accept an agreement reached under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>Broadly, the terms of this agreement are as follows: the five or six staff which will be required by the National Milk Agency will be recruited from among the milk boards' staff, provided that a sufficient number of suitably qualified candidates apply for these jobs.  Some 50 staff will be offered voluntary retirement on terms analogous to those which applied in the Civil Service in the 1987-88 period while the remaining 70 or so employees will transfer with the sale of the ancillary business as a going concern. They will transfer with their existing terms and conditions of employment and these may be altered only in accordance with established industrial relations procedures. In the event of being made redundant through business failure or a further staff rationalisation programme on the part of the new employer, they will have the right to redeployment to the public sector.  There will be no compulsory redundancy involved in the abolition of the boards.  This has been voted on and agreed by the staff and their associations.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the particular provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 defines certain words and terms used throughout the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the establishment, by ministerial order, of a National Milk Agency.  The basic function of the agency is to ensure the availability to the consumer, at all times of the year and at a reasonable price, of supplies of good quality milk for liquid consumption.  The agency will have a part-time chairman, appointed by the Minister, and will be composed of representatives of milk producers, processors, distributors, retailers and consumers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the dissolution, again by ministerial order, of the two milk boards and the sale of their ancillary <Col N="1835" /> business.  It also provides for the possibility of transferring the business to an interim board.  The House will note that the Bill provides that the order, which abolishes the boards, will at the same time replace them with the new agency. My intention is that the ancillary business should be sold at just about the same time.  However, as a precaution against any delay in concluding the sale, the Bill includes provision for an interim board comprising three ministerial nominees to take over direction of the ancillary business until such time as the sale is completed.</P>
    <P>Any such transfer would be technically liable to stamp duty so it is necessary to provide in the Bill for an exemption in keeping with the realities of the situation, hence the reference in section 3 (8) of the Bill to the Finance Act, 1895.  The sale of the business will be by competitive tender, in keeping with Department of Finance guidelines for the disposal of State assets.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the pension position of the boards' staff.  Basically, it provides that once the boards are dissolved, the administration of their pension schemes will become the responsibility of my Department.  It bestows power to amend these schemes.  It thus provides, in accordance with the agreement reached with the staff, for enhanced redundancy and severance payments for temporary and seasonal staff who may be granted voluntary early retirement, to provide notional &ldquo;added years&rdquo; of service for permanent staff in the same circumstances thus enhancing their pensions and to provide for the possibility of spouses and children's benefit for former and present members of the schemes.</P>
    <P>In this latter connection, it is necessary to amend the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1961, and this is done by subsection (7).  Since future pension liabilities will be borne by the Exchequer, thereby securing the pension rights of staff, subsection (8) provides for the taking over by the Exchequer of the existing pension funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> Sections 5, 6 and 7 are at the core of the Bill.  These sections provide that milk may not lawfully be sold for liquid consumption in the State unless it is produced on foot of a registered contract between a registered producer and a registered processor.  There is provision for certain exemptions and prescribed penalties for contravention.  There are also requirements that, in order to qualify for registration, a contract must provide that the raw milk supplied be at least up to the quality prescribed by law, be for a period of at least 12 consecutive months, include supply during the winter months and specify a price level adequate to satisfy the agency that ample compensation is being provided to the producer for maintaining production during the winter months.</P>
    <P>The three substantive elements of the contract &mdash; milk of appropriate quality, all year round supply and adequate compensation for the producer &mdash; are all interlinked.  Given the grass based, summer concentrated pattern of Irish milk production, the quality and continuity of supply during the winter months can best be assured by a regulatory system of the type I have described.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the payment of a levy to the agency in respect of every litre of milk acquired under a registered contract.  The rate of levy will initially be fixed by ministerial order and may subsequently be adjusted by the agency with the consent of the Minister.  The section also deals with matters ancillary to the obligation to pay the levy, such as the requirement to make proper returns of milk supplied so that the amount due may be calculated and the procedures to be followed, up to and including the cancellation of registration, if the levy is not paid.  As I have mentioned, it is the intention that, by means of this levy, the agency should be completely self-financing.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 make provision for records to be kept and returns to be made by registered parties to facilitate the agency in its work of regulating milk supplies. Section 11 distinguishes between <Col N="1837" /> information which may be published and that which must be kept confidential. Sections 12, 13 and 14 deal with matters such as the alteration of registration or its cancellation for reasons other than non-payment of the levy which, as I have stated, is already dealt with in section 8 and the admissibility of registers as evidence in the courts.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 23 are classified as miscellaneous provisions.  They make no new substantive provisions; their purpose is rather to provide powers and impose obligations to ensure that the preceding provisions in the Bill can be effectively and efficiently implemented and also to fulfil certain necessary legal technicalities.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill sets out detailed rules applicable to the new National Milk Agency, many of which I have already covered in general terms.</P>
    <P>I hope I have given a clear outline of the contents of the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is looking rested since he got his curate successfully elected to Europe.  I have no doubt that he will be paying greater attention to the problems of Irish farmers from here on.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is three years since a similar Bill was discussed.  It was probably worth the time it took to deal with the matter of staffing.  I hope the offer and the agreement that has been reached will be of some comfort to the staff, who have given excellent service to the milk boards, in the event of any of them being made redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that producers and processors must be registered.  This is right, I suggest that retailers should also be registered since they are part of the chain between the producer and the consumer.  In order to achieve comprehensive coverage and protection for the consumer, it would have been a step in the right direction if it was necessary for retailers to register. I am puzzled to know what will happen in the event of a challenge to the agency to establish an appropriate price to ensure continued supply for the consumer <Col N="1838" /> and how the agency will decide on appropriate price.</P>
    <P>Existing milk producers can have a variation of as much as 30p per gallon in their production costs.  I foresee a challenge where somebody will try to prove that he or she could produce milk at less than the price obtained by the agency in order to get a chance to produce milk all year round.  This would be more lucrative than seasonal milk production.  I am sure thought has been given to this matter to ensure it does not happen.  I am glad to note also that the Bill has received the general approval of all farming organisations and processors.  I am not sure to what extent retailers expressed approval or disapproval of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the background to the Bill.  Legislation to regulate the supply and price of liquid milk on the home market goes back as far as 1936. The Milk (Regulation of Supply) Act, 1936, ensures a year round supply of liquid milk, as the Minister stated.  In recent years, due to EU legislation, it became apparent that existing milk boards would have to be abolished.  This is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main features of the new National Milk Agency will be: first, all dairies and liquid milk producers must be registered with the agency; I would like retailers registered also.  Second, registration with the agency will require producers to meet specific technical standards and to have a written contract with a registered dairy, guaranteeing all year round supply.  In addition, all such contracts must be registered with the agency.  Third, the agency will be empowered to monitor the terms of the contracts to ensure that they do not contain provisions which would jeopardise the all year round supply of liquid milk.  In particular, the agency will be empowered to refuse to register contractors which do not include a milk price sufficient to meet the costs of winter production. There will be some disputes about this issue in the years ahead. Fourth, the agency will be empowered to withdraw registration from producers or dairies which do not observe the terms of contracts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> The liquid milk market is worth about £300 million a year.  Ireland has the highest level of milk consumption in the European Union and the second highest in Europe as a whole; consumption in Finland is significantly higher.  Annual <i>per capita</i> consumption is 179 litres but if we make allowances for tourists it is probably nearer 150 litres.  Total liquid milk sales in 1990 amounted to about 490 million litres.  Sales reached their peak in 1984 and have declined consistently since then.  While factors such as an aging population may have something to do with this, I feel there may other factors involved.  It would be a pity if our level of consumption dropped to that of some European countries, such as Italy and Spain.  This would be bad for the consumer, the processor, the retailer and, especially, the producer.</P>
    <P>Whole milk natural or standardised fat level sales account for approximately 90 per cent of total Irish milk sales.  This is out of line with sales in other countries. In the Netherlands, low fat or skimmed milk consumption now amounts to over two thirds of the liquid market.  Taking the EU liquid market as a unit, the low fat milk consumption figure is now higher than the consumption figure for whole milk.  Implications arise for the development of butter fat.  We already have huge EU surpluses of butter fat and it now seems that consumers of liquid milk are showing a preference for low fat milk thereby sending more butter fat on to the market.</P>
    <P>Based on the CSO household budget survey, the average milk bill is about 9 per cent of total expenditure on food.  I was surprised it is so high but this is what the CSO figures show.  For the average household of 3.5 persons, the estimated weekly cost of milk is about £6.  This is double the amount paid for bread.</P>
    <P>There has been some fun in the area of distribution in the past and I will be surprised if there is not more fun in the future.  The real objective of the multiples, particularly Dunnes Stores, was to gain market share and we now witnessing the beginning of an inevitable and <Col N="1840" /> demanding campaign by the supermarkets to capture a much higher share. If the producers and the bottlers are disappointed with this development, they have only themselves to blame.  This applies particularly to the processors. The processors gave a discount of at least 30 per cent to the multiples in order to gain market share.  Having made what I would describe as exorbitant profits, Dunnes Stores, in their wisdom, decided to drop the price of liquid milk by 9p per litre.  The immediate reaction of the processors was to deny liquid milk to Dunnes Stores.  In effect, they were foolishly trying to force Dunnes Stores to continue to make exorbitant profits.</P>
    <P>The consumer is surely entitled to milk at a reasonable price.  Why should milk producers give a 30 per cent discount in addition to three months' credit and cold cabinets in supermarkets to the big retailers and not to poor people who get up at 5 a.m. to do door to door deliveries or to small shopkeepers.  The producers' actions enabled multiples to continue to make exorbitant profits which, on the basis of my calculations, must have been of the order of £20 million a year.  It is inevitable that milk retailers will expand in supermarkets and shops with fewer door to door deliveries.</P>
    <P>Some people say this trend will reduce milk consumption but I am not sure if this is the case.  I have conflicting figures from the National Prices Commission's report of 1979, the AFT report of 1984 and market research sources.  Some of these figures indicate that the percentage of door to door deliveries is as low as 41 per cent but the trend here and in every other country is for an increasing quantity of liquid milk to be distributed to the retail trade.  It is usually contended that a doorstep delivery network is essential to keep up consumption levels, particularly for high milk consumption countries such as Ireland, Britain and others. I have difficulty reconciling this argument with what I said earlier about Finland having the highest level of milk consumption in Europe.  The Finns have not had a delivery service for a long time. Nevertheless, its consumption level is significantly <Col N="1841" /> higher than ours.  In the US, where 95 per cent of sales are through retail outlets, milk consumption has increased in recent times.  The overall decline in consumption per head in Denmark over the past seven years has been about the same as in Ireland, despite the switch to an exclusive retail system.  I cannot, therefore, accept that reducing the proportion of milk deliveries to doors will result in a decline in milk consumption. There is a feeling that it will do so but there is no evidence to this effect.</P>
    <P>The big retailers can get favourable credit terms and do not have to handle the milk; the processors deliver it to and fill the cold cabinets.  The customer picks it up, takes it to the checkout and pays, but the retailer pays for it three months later.  As I see it, the trend will be for more milk to go through retail outlets and less through door to door deliveries. However, some people, for one reason or another, will want to buy milk in small corner shops or have it delivered to their doors and we should ensure that they are catered for at all times.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be uneasy about my conclusions on the price of milk.  The margin between what the consumer pays and the producer gets is difficult to explain.  It is difficult to calculate what the producer gets because of variations at different times of the year and different quantities.  I estimate that the amount is an average of £1.05 per gallon.  It is a simple process to pasteurise milk, to put it into containers and deliver it to shops. The consumer pays about £2.50 a gallon. I find it difficult to see how pasteurisation and retailing costs can command £1.50 a gallon.  The farmer commands only £1 in real terms on average.  The retail price of milk in Ireland was decontrolled, as the Minister said, following regulations in 1988 from the UK Government.  The price per litre has gone up from 40p to 60p since 1985, an increase of 50 per cent. There have been major changes over the years.  The cost of producing milk is extremely high.  The multiples are making huge amounts of money and enjoy three month credit periods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1842" /> The Minister spoke about the appointment of people to carry out the work of the agency while it is being set up.  I hope that when it is established they will not be treated like Mr. Jim Nicholson &mdash; I am sorry the Minister is not here to answer this &mdash; who was to be a member of the new racing board but was not appointed to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is my second time to speak on this matter as I spoke on the last milk supply Bill which was before the House in January 1992.  This legislation is most welcome and necessary. It provides for the establishment of a National Milk Agency to regulate the supply of milk for liquid consumption. The Minister stated that:</P>
      <P>It is very important that the supply of milk for liquid consumption in Ireland should have some form of regulation because, due to the highly seasonal pattern of our production, a complete <i>laissez faire</i> approach could result in shortages during the winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is very important.  The real purpose of the Bill is to implement a Government decision to abolish the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards, to sell their ancillary businesses and to establish the new National Milk Agency. The Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards were established in 1936 and 1937, respectively, under the Milk <Col N="1843" /> (Regulation and Supply) Act, 1936, in order to ensure an adequate supply of milk all year round in the country's two biggest urban centres of population.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly mentioned door to door deliveries.  In my area, which is very rural, there are extensive door to door deliveries.  People are more conscious of hygiene now and they want quality milk delivered in the most hygienic conditions to their door.  Forty or 50 years ago milk was delivered in churns.  That is no longer the practice and there is now a demand for a more hygienic delivery of milk. When the Dublin and Cork district boards were established, people who did not produce milk were able to call to a neighbour and get milk in a jug.  That was the system which prevailed then.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1936, the producer price of milk occasionally fell below the cost of production causing shortages of milk in winter months.  The milk board system was established to ensure that farmers were adequately paid to supply milk to urban areas.  It is very important that the Irish liquid milk market is not left without some regulatory system because of the risk of a free for all system which would leave the market short of liquid milk in the winter months, as happened in some areas outside Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this legislation is necessary to ensure that we have an adequate supply of liquid milk for human consumption available on demand.  It is not easy to produce milk all year round. Before the 1936 regulations were brought into force, there were not the facilities to produce milk which exist now.  We have modernised our system.  Prior to that, people did not have milking machines and had to milk cows by hand which was hard work, especially in the winter months.  Those producers had to be paid for producing milk 365 days of the year. That demanded effort and those who made the effort were adequately compensated and were paid a proper price which was determined by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>The production, processing, marketing and distribution of milk for direct human <Col N="1844" /> consumption is vital for the continuance of a strong and healthy dairy industry. The drinking milk sector provides a stable outlet for about 10 per cent of our total milk production with high employment levels and good returns for producers. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>There are, at present, some 4,500 producers supplying 39 pasteurising establishments with milk to a retail value of some £300 million per annum. There are about 500 persons employed in its collection, preparation and distribution.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a milk agency to regularise the production of milk for human consumption.  The Minister also stated that:</P>
    <P>There is a very high level of support for the measure on all sides in the industry and I am satisfied that the agency, which will be financed entirely by the industry itself through a statutory levy on milk sales, will ensure the orderly development of the market for milk for liquid consumption.</P>
    <P>The functions of the agency include ensuring that milk is properly produced and that producers and processors are licensed.  I do not think the operation of the agency will be expensive or that there will be a big levy.  I do not know whether it will be the producer or the processor who will pay the levy but it will eventually come from the cow.  It was once said that due to all the levies, if a cow had four teats the farmer would be lucky if he was left with one for himself by the time everything was paid for.  The producer will have to be protected in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the problems which arose when this legislation was introduced in 1991 as regards the workers have been resolved to everyone's satisfaction. The Minister stated that:</P>
    <P>At that point, negotiations with the board's staff were still in progress.  It was intended that before the Bill completed its passage through the House, such provisions relating to staff as might require statutory effect would <Col N="1845" /> be included in the Bill.  However, the negotiations did not conclude until January of this year when the staff voted to accept an agreement reached under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>That is very welcome, It is great that this matter was resolved to the satisfaction of all involved.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that the ancillary business should be sold at about the same time.  The Minister stated that:</P>
    <P>However, as a precaution against any delay in concluding the sale, the Bill includes provision for an interim board, comprised of three ministerial nominees, to take over direction of the ancillary business until such time as the sale is completed.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised that whoever the purchaser is, the ancillary business will continue as heretofore.  It provided a great service for farmers.  Milk recording, which is carried out by an ancillary business attached to the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards, is vital for farmers.</P>
    <P>I am also delighted to see that the Department is looking after the pension position of the boards' staff.  It is very important to ensure that their pensions are protected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue. It is very important in a country such as Ireland, which is well known for its green grass and milk production, to have a regulatory system for liquid milk consumption; control over the producers, processors and retailers and to ensure that milk is available to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to have been spending a great deal of time discussing agriculture over the past two days.  This Bill, which was originally put before us in 1991, is to be welcomed.  I do not intend to oppose it &mdash; I would hate the <Col N="1846" /> Labour Members to have to make the decision which lobby they were going to troop through.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not controversial.  It is very important that we ensure that consumers have a regular supply of high quality liquid milk at a price they can afford. This legislation does not differ in any marked way from the 1991 Bill other than in the provisions relating to staff.  I was one of those who raised serious questions about the staff at the time.  They were in the public service and naturally valued the security that gave them and they were concerned about their future.  It has taken two years to sort out those concerns, but that would not do in the case of TEAM Aer Lingus or Irish Steel.  This matter has been sorted out satisfactorily and that is to be welcomed because it was the single biggest problem in the original Bill.</P>
      <P>I note with interest that the definition of milk has changed since 1991; perhaps it is a sign of the changing technology. Milk now means &ldquo;raw milk or heat treated milk&rdquo; which are both defined.  In 1991 milk meant &ldquo;cow's milk in the form of whole milk, semi-skimmed milk, skimmed milk or any other form to which the Milk and Dairies Acts apply&rdquo;.  I would have thought that the milk was pretty much the same now as it was in 1991 but perhaps technology has advanced to the point where it is not.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the introduction of this measure was imposed on us by the European Union.  It is worth recording that the EC Commission agreed in 1988 that a new National Milk Agency would be established to replace the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards.  I said yesterday that the gestation of the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill had been leisurely, even by equine standards.  In the case of this Bill the gestation has been so leisurely, that it almost did not happen at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The broader question is our compliance with obligations imposed on us by European directives in other areas of legislation.  In this case the relevant Council directive is Directive 92/46/EEC which lays down the rules of production and the placing on the market of raw milk, heat treated and milk based products. <Col N="1847" /> While the Commission decision on the need to introduce an agency was made in 1988, the directive is more recent.  However, even though this is a more recent directive, there is still a question about the length of time it is taking us to comply with EU directives in other areas.</P>
    <P>I broadly welcome the legislation. Those who produce liquid milk, both the dairy farmers and the processors, have performed a valuable service on behalf of the State.  It was and still is a very unsociable activity as it ties people to their farms at times of the year when the weather is very poor.  Milk production must conform to very high standards and they have done that very well and faithfully over a long period.  They are to be thanked for that.</P>
    <P>The consumer is entitled to expect that the quality of the milk delivered to the door or bought in shops and supermarkets is of the highest standard.  Liquid milk producers were among the first group of farmers to recognise the need for high quality and to consistently produce it.  They have set a headline for producers of other agricultural commodities. The liquid milk producers have always recognised the primacy of the consumer. This message is only beginning to become readily apparent to producers of other commodities.</P>
    <P>Seasonality is a serious problem in Irish agriculture, not just in milk production but also in the production of beef and other commodities.  The producers of liquid milk who are frequently committed to producing during the winter months in unsociable conditions and at more expense to themselves, must be compensated for the extra expense and extra work involved.  The payment of compensation is enshrined in the legislation and I want to impress this upon the Minister &mdash; that compensation must be fair and adequate otherwise the seasonality problem will become even more serious to the extent that we could envisage circumstances where supplies could be jeopardised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> I do not have any particular problem with the interim board but I hope it will not be like the temporary postman who remains a temporary postman for his entire life and never becomes a full-time employee.  The composition of the agency is to be welcomed, particularly the fact that producers, processors, distributors, retailers and consumers of milk will be appointed.  This broad spectrum of interest which includes the consumer is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the type of services which the milk boards provided and continue to provide.  There has to be some concern about those services particularly in the context of the Single Market and freer movement of goods. There is a growing trend among the leading dairy farmers to import semen from private companies.  I heard of this happening on several farms in the past year. This obviously impinges on the profitability of the milk boards and it is apparent from the Minister's remarks that they have been losing money.  I do not know if they have been losing money providing bovine semen but that is a highly competitive business.</P>
    <P>If mistakes are made in this area it can have serious consequences for the quality of the cows being milked, and possibly even the quality of the milk itself.  It is extremely important that the boards be given the resources to ensure they are at the leading edge of cattle breeding in this country.  They should be in a position to bring the latest technology to the country rather than leaving it to private concerns which may be less responsible and driven by baser motives than the milk boards have been in the past.  I ask the Minister to monitor this area.</P>
    <P>Door to door supply is traditional.  The so-called milk wars had the potential to eliminate the door to door supply but it is a tradition which people want and there is a demand for it.  I hope this activity will continue.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage significant amendments on Committee Stage but we will study the Bill over the next few days and if there are any amendments, they will be of a limited form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who introduced the Bill.  The Minister is a fellow constituent and has experience in the dairy business.  He was manager of a dairy in West Cork for some time and was involved in the marketing of the Clóna brand.  I compliment him on his work when it was found that we were in contravention of some EU regulations.  He highlighted the situation with the milk boards.</P>
      <P>The milk boards served their purpose. They were established about 60 years ago when people who were not involved in farming &mdash; farming folk had a plentiful supply of good milk &mdash; took their &ldquo;gallon can&rdquo;, although it was often only a sweet tin, and hiked out to the local farmer for their milk supply.  Later the same sweet tins were often used to collect creamery milk for baking or feeding poultry. Although the boards served their purpose, we need a modern body such as the National Milk Agency to control and regulate the production, processing, marketing and distribution of milk.  I am glad the agency will be self-financing.</P>
      <P>Little has been said about the work of the milkman.  We cannot miss this opportunity to compliment the milkmen who are out early each morning delivering milk in urban and rural areas.  Small suppliers who supply small markets in a village or town provide a tremendous service.</P>
      <P>While the National Milk Agency is responsible for the production, processing, marketing and distribution of milk, it also has an important role providing employment.  About 4,500 people are involved in the production of milk and about 5,000 people are involved in its collection, preparation and distribution. Good quality milk is good for the health of the population, particularly children. Fresh milk that is properly produced and delivered is of the utmost importance. Although we often complain about the rain, our wet climate is responsible for the quality of our fresh milk.  We should appreciate what God has given us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the problem regarding staff <Col N="1850" /> has been resolved.  The agreement reached under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission was satisfactory to all concerned.  I welcome the establishment of the National Milk Agency and I believe it will be successful in the maintenance of our milk industry. Senator Dardis referred to the direction we are taking.  I know the direction being taken by our group in the Seanad.  Mr. Cox marched through the dairying region of Munster and made his way to Europe without Senator Dardis and his party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I must claim a double vested interest in this legislation.  A member of my family is the present chairman of the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards and I am a supplier of liquid milk.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation.  The milk boards were established in 1935 and 1937 respectively, to regulate the milk supply and they were very successful.  They played a vital role in the regulation of the supply and quality of milk for consumers in urban areas.  The boards have not only served the consumer well, they guaranteed farmers a certain price for milk above what would be paid during the summer months.  That allowed the farmers to invest and expand thus guaranteeing a regular supply of high quality milk.  This benefited the dairy industry throughout the country.  The farmers in district milk board areas were pioneers in the use of modern technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disbandment of the milk boards is a necessity.  Their existence was in contravention of European legislation.  The milk board areas are perceived to be lucrative markets and producers from outside those areas have a right to supply those markets.  However, some words of caution are appropriate.  If this new agency is to be a success &mdash; and I hope it will be &mdash; it must realise it is expensive to produce milk in the winter months. Farmers who have invested heavily in previous years have benefited from different price levels and if those price levels are deflated there will be disastrous consequences for the producer and the consumer.  The high quality of milk could be undermined; the agency should regulate <Col N="1851" /> and control with that possibility in mind.</P>
    <P>This Bill was initiated in the Seanad in 1991 but there were difficulties with industrial relations.  I am glad these delicate matters were handled with care and consideration and that the Labour Relations Commission proposals overcame the problems.  There will be no enforced redundancies and the staff will be deployed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The issue of cartels has been mentioned on a couple of occasions.  It is an important issue, although it might be outside the remit of this Bill.  The multiple stores appear to be toying with the idea of breaking the small retailer and door to door deliveries by milkmen.  It is a lucrative market worth £300 million per year.  However, if they succeed there will be disastrous consequences for the milkman, the small retail shop and the producer in the long term.  Senator Farrelly quoted figures from Finland and said that the door to door milkman no longer provides such a service there.  Perhaps that is because the milk would freeze if it was left outside the door for long.  In this country, however, door to door deliveries encourage a higher consumption of milk.  Having milk delivered to the door instead of having to travel to the shop for it is a useful service and it must be maintained.  That sector should be allowed to compete for its share of the market.</P>
    <P>One must query the motivation of the multiples in initiating milk wars.  It is a lucrative market.  However, the co-ops and producers who are shareholders in most co-ops have made a mistake.  All parties should be on a level playing pitch. It is hard to understand how a multiple store can get three months' credit and a 30 per cent discount while the small retailer must pay for milk up front and without a discount.  The retailers must be protected because they are the backbone of the industry and are the most efficient means of distributing the milk to the consumer. I spoke on this issue on other occasions.  Monopolies and cartels must be tackled not only in the milk sector but <Col N="1852" /> in the bread sector and the food industry generally.  This is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>The board is self-financing.  That is welcome because it will have a certain amount of independence and will be able to do its business with a guaranteed source of revenue.  That is vital for an agency of this importance.</P>
    <P>The milk boards have contributed a great deal; they were involved in progeny testing, artificial insemination, somatic cell count, milk recording, freeze branding and other projects.  They were instrumental in encouraging the dairy sector to expand on our entry to the EU. They gave information and held seminars throughout the country to encourage people to upgrade the progeny of their cattle.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note that an American company was interested in some of the services provided.  What will happen to the ancillary services after this Bill? Perhaps the Minister could clarify this at a later stage.</P>
    <P>If we are to encourage a high consumption of milk, which already exists to a certain extent, it is vital that this agency should promote milk and control its quality and supply.  The door to door milkman and the small retailer should be given every opportunity to compete on a level playing pitch.  The importance of these aims cannot be exaggerated.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the sale and production districts in Cork are within a three and a half mile radius of the city centre and that temporary licences had been granted in the past because the district could not supply Cork during the winter months.  In Dublin the sale area is the city and county of Dublin and the urban area of Bray, while the production area comprises most of Leinster.</P>
    <P>The proof of what the milk boards have contributed to the dairy sector is the efficient milk production patterns, which mainly occur in the milk board areas. They contain the top class breeding herds, the high yield herds and the most efficient producers.  When the new agency is set up, I hope the Department acknowledges this and uses its resources <Col N="1853" /> to fill the vacuum the milk boards will leave when abolished.</P>
    <P>Since the milk boards were found to be in contravention of European law, measures had to be taken.  I welcome the Bill because overall it is a positive step which lets everyone have an input into the supply of what is perceived to be a lucrative market.  I often wondered whether that was the case when I was milking cows at 6.30 on winter mornings. The issue has caused tension in my area and in Dublin but most farmers now realise it is a positive step for milk supply.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the later Stages. There is little in the Bill to cause controversy since superannuation and other staff problems have been solved.  I wish the Bill well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Rationalisation and greater efficiency have long been recommended as the way forward for the Irish dairy sector at all levels in the industry and thankfully this challenge has been taken up by many in the last few years, with farmers and consumers benefiting. The establishment of the new National Milk Agency is an example of the Government's commitment to all involved &mdash; producers, processors, distributors, retailers and consumers.</P>
      <P>The liquid milk sector has experienced great change over the years.  With district milk boards having outlived their usefulness and the role for which they were created, this House should record its appreciation of all involved for their work developing the boards.  The range of services provided to farmers was critical to this development.  Improving the breeding programme and milk quality came, in many cases, through the expansion of services available from the Milk Marketing Board.</P>
      <P>In complimenting the staffs of the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards, the Minister is protecting their welfare as best he can at this time.  It is welcome that the majority of staff will continue to work in their specialised positions following the formation of the new board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structure of the new Authority is representative of all involved, bringing <Col N="1854" /> together everyone from the producer to the consumer.  This leads to a better understanding of all involved and of the other positions.  This must benefit everyone. The importance of this Authority to oversee the collection and distribution of liquid milk to our major urban centres is enormous.  It must ensure a supply is available all year at a competitive price and that the producer is adequately rewarded for his work.  Given the population growth in our urban centres, it is vital that the regulation of milk supply is strictly governed and the new National Milk Agency is the vehicle to ensure this.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Walsh, for bringing the Bill to the House and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, for steering it through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Brian O'Shea">

      <P>I thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  By and large there has been welcome for the Bill and its provisions.  A number of issues were raised by Senators during the debate which I will now discuss.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher asked who would purchase the milk board's business and what was the position of an American company which had expressed an interest in purchasing it.  The business will be put up for sale by competitive tender and there is no way of knowing at this stage who the interested parties are or whose bid will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis spoke about the control of artificial insemination activities. Artificial insemination activities are governed by EU directives, specifically dealing with artificial insemination, and by national legislation, implementing those directives.  Senator Dardis also mentioned the length of time it had taken to bring this Bill before the House.  It should be stressed that the Bill was delayed since 1991 to take account of the staff whose livelihood would be affected by the change.  Time has not passed in a leisurely manner.  The negotiations were long and difficult at times, but it was worth it because the staff's interests have been met and the way has now been cleared <Col N="1855" /> for the sale of the businesses as going concerns.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the definition of milk as per the previous legislation which was before this House and the legislation before us today.  The change arises directly from the adoption of an EU directive in 1992 which contained a new definition of milk.  It was considered desirable to use, as far as possible, the same definition of milk in all legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly spoke about the interim board, but we need to clarify this matter.  The interim board is not a board in the way the National Milk Agency is a board.  The National Milk Agency will be made up of a board representing those involved in the industry while the interim board, which is quite small, may never be used.  It is a safeguard mechanism if there is a delay in winding up the boards or in selling the businesses as going concerns. This device is available to expedite the work involved.</P>
    <P>Retailers should be registered, and this point was made by Senator Farrelly. Food hygiene at retail level is the responsibility of the Minister for Health, not the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Retailers are not involved in the regulation of supply, with which this Bill deals.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly asked how the National Milk Agency will decide on an appropriate price.  This will be a matter for the agency.  The price can vary from area to area and from producer to producer. The idea is that the price of each contract should be sufficient to compensate farmers for the cost of winter production.  It would be too rigid if the Bill were to specify criteria for determining the appropriate price for milk.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly referred to supermarkets, the price wars&mdash;which Senator Calnan and Senator Kelleher also mentioned &mdash; and the important role carried out by the milk delivery service and the small retailers throughout the country. There is considerable employment in this sector and we want to retain the employment levels there.  The issues involved here do not come under this Bill but <Col N="1856" /> are more suitable for consumer affairs legislation and the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has been active in this area. Senator Farrelly also mentioned possible disputes.  Provision is made in section 19 for resolving disputes between the National Milk Agency, producers and processors.</P>
    <P>I am happy at the widespread welcome for this legislation.  I compliment the staff in the Department for their ongoing efforts to resolve the matter and to find a solution so that the rights and conditions of future employment for the staff in the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards would be satisfactorily dealt with. That is an achievement in itself.  It took time, but the officials did not take a leisurely approach.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat as ucht an fáilte, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the payment of allowances to chairpersons of certain Oireachtas committees and to the Leader of the House in the Seanad.  It also provides for the removal of the statutory provision, applicable only to Members of the Oireachtas who reside within ten miles of Leinster House, which restricts the payment of travelling allowances to such Members to days on which they attend sittings of the relevant House or meetings of House committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to chairpersons of Oireachtas committees this Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  This review body recommended payments for chairman of Oireachtas committees because the workload of a chairperson significantly exceeded what would be regarded as the fully extended range of responsibilities and workload of an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Member of the Oireachtas.  Since the review body reported the new committee system has been introduced in the Oireachtas and it is proposed to apply the recommendations of the review body to the chairpersons of these committees as well. It has been generally accepted that the new committee system is working very well.  The role of the chairperson in bringing about this situation and in ensuring it continues is vital.  For this reason, paying allowances to these chairpersons on the same general basis that is to apply to the chairpersons of the more traditional <Col N="1858" /> committees is considered to be fully justified.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, section 2 of the Bill provides that the Government may, by order, provide for the payment of an annual allowance to every non-office holding Member of the Oireachtas who is the holder of the position of chairperson of designated Oireachtas committees. It also provides that the Government may determine the amount of that allowance and that different amounts may be specified in relation to different committees.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides that the Government may by order provide for the payment of an allowance to the Leader of the House in the Seanad. Section 4 of the Bill provides for the payment of these allowances by way of addition to salary to those Members who qualify for them.  This section also provides that the allowances will not be payable in respect of any period before 12 January 1993, the date on which the present Government was formed.  The intention is that the allowance will be payable from whatever date after that date a particular chairperson or Leader of the House was elected to the relevant position.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the rates of the allowances may be increased administratively in line with general pay movements in the Civil Service.  This is a common provision.  Section 6 provides that contributions in respect of superannuation entitlements under the Houses of the Oireachtas Members' pension scheme may be deducted from the allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes provision for the laying of orders under this Bill before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made to comply with the necessity of bringing the arrangements into line with the requirements of the Constitution and of efficient administrative practices.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 8 enables the Minister for Finance to amend the existing regulations governing Oireachtas travel allowances to enable Deputies or Senators residing within ten miles of <Col N="1859" /> Leinster House to claim daily travel payments for attendance on &ldquo;non-sitting&rdquo; days.  This will bring them into line in this respect with other Members.  Section 9 provides for a short title and collective citation.</P>
    <P>A difficulty has come to light in the past few days in relation to the payment of travel claims to certain Deputies.  I will be taking the opportunity to remove this anomaly by moving an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has shown himself to be a reforming Chief Whip.  Some of the changes in the way business is run in the other House can be attributed to him.  I welcome the Bill.  It is a short Bill and I will be equally brief.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask about the sections which are not now in the Bill &mdash; sections 7, 8 and 9 have been removed from the Bill as initiated.  I understand why but I would like the Minister to indicate what he intends to do about the problems which arose in regard to the secretaries which led to the delay in the Bill and to the eventual withdrawal of those sections. All Members wish negotiations to be initiated, through the Labour Relations Commission if necessary, so that the staff know where they stand for the future.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of uncertainty among members of the secretarial staff about their future.  Some feel that their working conditions have been unilaterally changed without consultation. This is a matter in which the Houses of the Oireachtas should be setting a headline in terms of labour relations, good procedures and good practices.  We should ensure that our staff are treated fairly.  I urge the Minister resolve this problem as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before looking at the Bill proper I wish to draw the Minister's attention to an anomaly which exists in the Seanad. There is a distinct difference in the way the different parties are treated with regard to secretarial assistance.  The Government parties seem to have a ratio <Col N="1860" /> of two Senators to one secretary; in the Fine Gael group the ratio is three to one. I do not know why there is this disparity or why our group is treated differently to other groups but I would like the Minister to look into it and to rectify it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises that committees are an increasingly important part of the life of this Parliament.  When we look at other parliaments we can see that the best are those with highly developed committee systems.  They allow detailed work to be done and consensus to be reached where that is possible, and they allow parties to talk to each other in a civilised and easy way without some of the theatricals which often accompany full scale debates in the Houses.  It is now being recognised that committees are increasingly important and that the chairpersons of the committees have a crucial role.</P>
    <P>It has been the experience of this House through the 1980s and to the present that a committee will often stand or fall on the ability and commitment of the chairperson.  If there is a good chairperson who shows leadership and gives drive to the committee then it will be successful.  If the chairperson is lethargic, has no vision and does not put his or her best into the job, the committee will frequently wane and make little impact.  This crucial role of the chairperson is recognised by the decision to pay an allowance to the chairperson.  It should be a generous allowance commensurate with the responsibilities involved.</P>
    <P>In any parliament the crucial elements are the Houses and the members.  Over the years the Members of our Parliament have been too slow in seeking the recognition to which their work entitles them and in seeking to have that work rewarded properly.  I welcome the decision to pay chairpersons a special allowance and it can be justified in any forum in which it might be challenged.</P>
    <P>As a Senator I greatly resent that Members of this House are excluded from three of the four major committees. The Members of this House want to be <Col N="1861" /> as fully a part of the legislative process as Members of the other House.  We want to play our part in committees, yet, under statute, we are entitled only to membership of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I have raised this issue before and it has to be addressed by Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I signal it as a grievance which we have.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Leader of the House is to be paid an allowance.  It should be substantial because the work the Leader of the House takes on is virtually double that of any other Senator. The Leader of the House, the Whip and others who hold positions in this House are responsible for the smooth functioning of the House and are responsible if things go wrong.  It is long overdue that the Leader of the House be paid a special allowance.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  It recognises important developments that have taken place and I am happy to support it.  I hope the Minister can answer some of the questions I have raised.  However, I would point out one anomaly.  I welcome the payments to the chairpersons of committees but they are now paid more than the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  It is long past time that we had a review of the positions of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach as they have significantly fallen behind what the status and the responsibilities of those offices requires.  It is wrong that the Leas-Chathaoirleach should be paid less than the chairperson of a committee.  I welcome the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and commend the Minister for bringing it forward.  Anybody who makes an independent assessment of the performance of the Oireachtas since the new committee procedure was adopted and the modernisation and streamlining of procedures here was undertaken will see that there has been a significant improvement in the amount of business done, some of it quite complicated and detailed.  The decision to introduce this legislation and to pay allowances to certain chairpersons of Oireachtas committees is timely and <Col N="1862" /> welcome and will improve the overall professionalism of this House.</P>
      <P>I also support the proposal in section 3 to provide an allowance for the Leader of the House.  Regardless of who the Leader of the House may be we have seen the enormous dedication and the volume of work involved in the position.  I would like to know why the Government Whip has not been included.  The Government Whip does a large volume of work liaising with the Whips of the other parties, in organising the business of the House and liaising with Departments and Ministers endeavouring to organise the business of the House in such a way as to utilise the time available in the most productive manner.  This is time consuming and tedious work and I would like to record our appreciation of the work done by the present Whip, Senator Mullooly.  The work he is doing is important and should be included in this legislation.  I am sure Members on all sides would recognise that the work of the Whip to ensure the smooth working of the House and to ensure the best organised procedures are in place is very important.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in this Bill that orders made under it have to be laid before the Houses for a period of 21 sitting days.  Why is that length of time needed?  If, for example, an order was made now there will not be 21 sitting days until almost next Christmas.  I am not certain it is a necessary provision.  It is necessary to have a certain time limit on objections or resolutions opposing these orders but that could be six or seven sitting days rather than 21 sitting days.  I see no advantage in having that provision in the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister would also explain what is meant by section 4 (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise a point about the secretarial assistance available to previous office holders.  I held office for a number of years and I have seen the volume of work that is left when one leaves office and go to backbenches or other benches. There is never any provision made to cater for that extra volume of work in terms of secretarial assistance.  This <Col N="1863" /> applies even to previous Taoisigh.  The secretarial assistance provided to former Taoisigh has been very limited.  This assistance should be expanded.  Even after leaving office Members have quite a volume of work, as do many office holders who might be actively engaged in the political arena.</P>

      <P>Financially there was not that much difference between being on the backbenches and being an office holder given the demands of time and travel involved.  However, that is for another day.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us if allowances are taken into account in the calculation of pension?  On retirement from office pensions are often affected by other things.  When trying to work out the detail of one's entitlements one finds snags which reduce one's entitlements on leaving office.  In the calculation of pension for Members when they retire from office, will allowance be made for the additional responsibility they had in dealing with either chairmanships and leaderships in their various offices?</P>
      <P>This legislation is welcome and will help to make the Houses more efficient. It will also tend to make a politician more of a full time professional.  As someone who has worked full time in politics in a professional capacity for 21 years, that is desirable and to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>First, I unashamedly welcome this Bill.  There is often a certain degree of discretion, almost shyness, in politicians in accepting any further remuneration.  I take the view, a Chathaoirigh, that we are grossly underpaid and under-resourced.  I have no hesitation or diffidence whatever in saying this.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of politicians work hard and get a raw deal from the media. To adopt one of Fianna Fáil's watch cries, I am sick, sore and tired of reading in the media the fact that Chambers such as this are empty.  Where are the Members doing their work?  The media know perfectly well where we are.  We are in attendance in Leinster House day after day.  There is no necessity for us to be in this House.  We are provided with monitors and can see what is going on here. The fact that we are not physically present as drones and parasites idly sitting by in this House does not mean we are not working.  We are working in our offices and the reporters on the electronic and print media, who consistently make sensationalised attacks upon politicians, know this perfectly well.  It is about time they stopped attacking politicians who they well know are doing their job and are working hard.  They get a cheap crack at politicians to abuse them when they see this House is not consistently full.  If every Member was in their seat for the full length of the sittings of the House, no other work would be done.  The same reporters who attack us for not being present would then attack us for not being in our offices.  I welcome this small and marginal amelioration of the conditions of politicians, for whom I have a great respect across the party spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad the Minister had the good sense to shed a noxious section of the Bill which would have required totally incompetent persons like myself to become the direct personal employers of our secretaries.  I understand this would not have been welcomed by our secretaries. It certainly would have not been welcomed by me nor by many of my colleagues.  It would not be fair to add this additional and demanding burden on <Col N="1865" /> us.  It is about time our secretaries were brought on board as fully fledged members of the Civil Service.  I really urge the Government to consider taking this step.  They work hard in difficult conditions in offices that are quite inadequate. The Cathaoirleach knows my views on this matter because I put a strongly worded motion down about this on the Order Paper last term.  They do good work.  The least we could do is recognise their status by incorporating them as part of the permanent Civil Service Oireachtas framework.  I call on the Minister to consider this with a view towards recommending it to the Government.</P>
    <P>My good friend and distinguished colleague, Senator Daly, who has had the privilege of ministerial service, spoke about the need for secretarial assistants in these roles, even when, for example, a Taoiseach retires.  I am sure this is true. However, I would not want the Senator to walk away with the idea that the current secretarial assistant situation was perfect.  This is by no means the case. Our secretaries are grossly overworked and we are under-resourced in terms of secretarial help.  My secretary works hard, willingly and she is extremely efficient.  When I say my secretary, I really mean that I only possess one third of this delightful creature,</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  There is a serious point here that we all recognise.  The idea that one secretary can fulfil the secretarial requirements of three full time politicians is a complete absurdity, a nonsense and leads to gross inefficiency.  It will continue to do so until the Government sees sense and gets the courage to spend a few more pounds on making us efficient and bringing us up to the proper professional standards.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister had the opportunity, because I was with him at the time, to visit the Australian Parliament in Canberra.  The Minister saw, as did the rest of us on that delegation, the wonderful facilities they have there.  Each member of Parliament, whether a Senator or a member of the Lower House, has at least one secretary.  They have the most luxurious accommodation and the most up-to-date facilities in terms of computer terminals.  It is just superb. We should not be diffident in requiring that.  I am not saying that because I went on some kind of freebie or junket, but because it will make us, as professional politicians, even more so.</P>
      <P>Even with this small increase &mdash; I hope there will be another one in the pipeline; I understand there is one currently been negotiated as part of the Devlin award scheme &mdash; our remuneration will be completely laughable on a professional scale. I cannot think of any surgeon, lawyer or engineer who would regard the kind of remuneration we get with anything other than the contempt it deserves.  I can assure the House that if I were charging on a professional basis for the number of hours I spend in here, they would have a massive Bill.  It is about time we were properly remunerated and this is but one small move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also indicates some degree of justice. I have constantly cavilled at the fact that in an arbitrary and capricious manner, those Members of either House who manage by accident, design or heritage to live 10.1 miles beyond the precincts of this august mansion got an extra mileage payment per day.  I have always found that aggravating and a form of discrimination against our capital city and <Col N="1867" /> its residents.  I do not see any reason why people like myself who are in the building every single day of the week should not get some degree of subsistence.  I very much welcome, if I have understood the convoluted grammar of the Minister's speech correctly, the final removal of this anomaly.</P>
    <P>On the subject of attendance at the House, I enjoy being here.  I try to do a fair amount of work.  It would be of great help if this place was more accessible.  I find it absolutely idiotic that I cannot get into my office from 9 p.m. on a Friday until 9 a.m. Monday.  The weekend is a good time to catch up on a backlog of work.  To be locked out like a naughty schoolboy and deprived of access to my office because some busybody thinks I cannot be trusted with the key is a load of fatuous rubbish.  I hope that may be cleared up as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that chairpersons of Oireachtas committees are being remunerated.  It is appropriate they should.  I served on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and we worked hard.  We had a distinguished chairperson in Monica Barnes.  She did a great deal of unpaid and valuable work. I am now privileged to be a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The committee has a very senior politician in the role of chairperson, Deputy Brian Lenihan, a former Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  To expect a person of that stature to engage in the kind of work he undertakes on the committee without any recognition in financial terms is rather insulting to the dignity of this kind of office.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that section 5 of the Bill provides for the rates of allowances to be increased administratively in line with the general pay movements in the Civil Service, which is a good, reasonable and practical exercise.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the Minister's admirable, short and succinct speech, he refers to a difficulty that has appeared in the past few days regarding the payment of travel claims to certain Dáil Deputies. <Col N="1868" /> The Minister has taken the opportunity to remove this anomaly by moving an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.  I am curious as to the nature of these difficulties.  I hope they are salacious and that they will cause some entertainment to the House when they are revealed.  The Minister is correct in removing them, and I direct his attention to another anomaly which I have unearthed. On occasions when one is invited to address meetings orchestrated, organised or incited by one's parliamentary constituency, it is possible, apparently, to claim the rail fare back to Dublin, but not the fare for the journey out.  This is rather strange; perhaps it is another anomaly and, as such, might benefit from the Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The address by Senator Norris is a hard act to follow and he has well covered every section to the Bill.  The Bill is interesting in so far as it is much shorter than the Bill originally initiated as it contains four fewer sections.  I am pleased that the Minister withdrew a number of the sections from the Bill in the Dáil, especially sections 7 to 10, inclusive, which deal specifically with the position of secretarial assistants in the House.</P>
      <P>It was most unfortunate that these sections were included in the Bill.  It prompts speculation as to the reasons behind their inclusion and why legislation of that nature was proposed and put before the Lower House.  It illustrated at total disregard for the positions of the secretarial assistants in Leinster House.  It also illustrated a complete disregard for them as people, and as women.  If all of the secretarial assistants were men, would such legislation have been envisaged, let alone drafted in the form of a Bill?  It was horrific that it was proposed that the female staff of the House, the secretarial assistants, were to be treated as a bit of baggage, almost like a computer, where they could be moved around by the Member and dealt with and paid by the Member in whatever manner he or she thought fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1869" /> The deletion of these sections only took place following political pressure from various Members of the Oireachtas and strong pressure from the trade union movement.  However, it is recognised that under the Constitution the Houses of the Oireachtas are entitled to employ whatever people are necessary in order to make the Oireachtas function and workable, and in this respect what action does the Minister propose to take on this issue?  Does he intend to present further legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  What plans does he have to replace sections 7 to 10, inclusive, of the original Bill?  What is the view of the Minister for Finance and his Department on this issue?  Undoubtedly, they feel obliged to introduce some kind of legislation or come to some kind of agreement with the secretarial assistants.</P>
    <P>The proper way to proceed with this matter is through the Labour Relations Commission.  Negotiations should continue and respect should be shown to the secretarial assistants of the House, who have undertaken great work.  Many of them have worked for the House for ten to 14 years and it is unacceptable that it was envisaged that they should be thrown on the sideline by a piece of legislation. The situation is in a state of limbo at present, following the withdrawal of these sections of the Bill, and the House must be advised of the proposed measures to be taken.</P>
    <P>The secretarial assistants to the House undertake a number of duties.  They provide secretarial assistance, accept phone calls, provide reception facilities, undertake research work, meet many people and deal with many problems.  They are not only secretarial assistants, but personal assistants, and their work is wide and varied, a fact which should be fully recognised.  They are not regular typists such as those in the Civil Service who undertake a typist's job in a section of a Department.  Their role is far wider and should be recognised for what it is with suitable and adequate remuneration.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, when the Minister considers the situation he will initiate discussions through the Labour Relations <Col N="1870" /> Commission and the matter will be satisfactorily concluded.  Hopefully, also, the tenure of office which these women have in the House will be held and respected and that, ultimately, the kind of nervousness that crept into the staff over a number of months will be finally and completely dismissed, because what happened was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is appropriate that the chairpersons of committees should be remunerated for the additional work they undertake.  The effectiveness of these chairpersons will depend on their initiative and commitment to their respective committees.  The Leader of the House has a specific job to undertake and acts in the place of the Taoiseach on the Order of Business in the House.  It is important therefore that he be properly remunerated and I am pleased that a provision to this effect is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The office holders of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad should also be remunerated.  They have a specific role and responsibility, roles which both present office holders of the House undertake admirably.  The Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach should not be treated any differently to the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil.  As a House of the Oireachtas, the House should be given equal status at all levels to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Bill introduces the daily allowance for people residing in the Dublin area within a ten mile radius of the Oireachtas.  Most such Members have offices in the Oireachtas, their secretaries are located in the complex, they are in attendance every day and they should be duly remunerated.  However, the position of Members residing outside the ten mile radius depends on their proximity to Dublin.  Such Members are allowed to undertake either four journeys a week to and from Dublin, or one and a half journeys a week.  Travelling from the west of Ireland, I can undertake one and a half journeys a week.  Therefore, if I travel to and from Dublin and back to Dublin, I am supposed to stay in <Col N="1871" /> Dublin until the following week, which is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>As a Member of the House I object to the arbitrary manner in which these matters are decided.  Members have a job to undertake.  Situations arise which require travel to and from Dublin once, twice or three times a week.  There are situations where Members who are close to Dublin, only 20 to 40 miles away, are only allowed to undertake four journeys a week; yet they may be in the House five days a week.</P>
    <P>This matter must be addressed and matters such as this should not be decided in an arbitrary fashion by an official of the Department of Finance.  The Minister should ensure that Members of the House are properly treated regarding this issue, because there is too much petty nonsense emanating from the Department in relation to it and, as Senator Norris rightly said, we are too shy and ashamed because we are afraid of what the media will say.  The reality is that we are totally underpaid for the amount of work we do.  It was not until last year, when we were asked to make a submission on working hours for the Devlin report, that I saw on paper the number of hours per week a Member is engaged in political activity.  It is enormous and we are not properly remunerated for that.  We will not get the right people into the political party system to represent and govern this country in future unless we treat them and remunerate them properly.  Until this is done the country will lose out in the long run.  We should stop penny-pinching and apologising to the public in general and the media in particular for what we do.  We have a specific and demanding role.  It is a seven day week job during which Members of the Oireachtas are on call every hour of the day.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will come before this House with a far more detailed Bill on Oireachtas allowances in future.  I commend him on the Bill he has brought before the House today and I recognise what he is attempting to do but I hope this is just the beginning.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with the contributions already made by Senators Norris, Taylor-Quinn, Manning and others.  The time for Members of the Dáil and Seanad to be apologetic about rises in their salaries and allowances is now over.  It is refreshing to see both sides of the House, including Independent Members, uniting to reject media criticism of this issue.  Members of the Oireachtas should state on television and in the newspapers that they deserve a lot more money than they receive now.  In the past we have tried to hide the fact that we get salary rises and other benefits to which we are entitled.  One of the reasons politicians are held in such low esteem is that we hold ourselves in such low esteem&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we are prepared to put up with nonsense from the media about being overpaid.  Nobody is prepared to stand up and defend politicians' pay rises and say we are underpaid.  If we did that we would be respected for it and we would attract people from different backgrounds, people who would be prepared to give a full-time commitment to politics.  I do not know what Senators earn; I think it is about £18,000 a year. In terms of any profession or any job in the business sector &mdash; virtually any job with a moderate salary anywhere in the country, including overtime and perks&mdash; this is a pittance.  If this is all we are prepared to pay those who are sitting in this House we will not necessarily get the calibre of people we want, or we will get people who are dedicated but broke &mdash; and nobody wants Members of either House to be broke.  I do not know by what formula the relationship between Senators' and TDs' salaries is worked out but perhaps the Minister can tell me.  If Deputies earn £30,500 and Senators earn £18,000 I would like to know why since every piece of legislation has to go through this House just as it goes through the Dáil.  We have Private Members' business just as the Dáil has.  Nearly every Member of this House is involved in as <Col N="1873" /> much political activity as an ordinary TD. Maybe a lot of that political activity is a waste of time, and personally I think it is.  However, the reason for some of the problems we face is that we are not given the responsibility or respect we deserve by successive Governments.  The Dáil and Seanad are rubber stamps for legislation which is prepared and decided on elsewhere.  That is not always the case but very few amendments are accepted in this House.  An amendment on the Health Bill, moved by Senator Norris, was accepted the other day but that is the exception rather than the rule.  Most legislation that comes to this House is passed after discussion but without amendment.  That is a great shame as it diminishes our role, and the justification for it, in the eyes of the public.</P>
      <P>Many Members of this House and the Lower House are said to have talked their way out of the Oireachtas rather than into it.  The least rewarding way politicians can spend their time is by talking in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Because of the vulnerability of every seat in this House, the most rewarding way they can spend their time is in the office doing constituency work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the public comes into this House or the Dáil they see empty Chambers &mdash; far emptier than this House is at the moment &mdash; and this gives rise to cynicism. The reason for the empty Chambers is not that Senators and TDs are lazy but because the pressure being put on them by their colleagues and rivals in the constituencies is so great that they regard appearances in the Oireachtas as a nuisance rather than a duty.  Because of the system, they are so busy looking after their own interests and seats that they do not contribute as much to the Houses as they ought.  That is a vicious circle because, as a result of that, they have very little self respect, the public has very little respect for them, and it is difficult to justify paying them increased salaries and allowances.  In order to pay us far larger salaries the Minister should make us justify them by changing the system so that we do give more attention to legislation.  We do not give the required <Col N="1874" /> attention to legislation at present, and I am as guilty of that as anybody else.  This not an accusation against my colleagues on any particular benches.  I do not give sufficient scrutiny to legislation because I am involved in other political activity which the system requires me and everyone else to do in order to survive.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the overall situation in terms of paying larger salaries which could be justified in terms of time worked.  We could then tell our constituents that they are getting value for money for the work done in both the Dáil and the Seanad.  At the moment it is difficult to persuade the public of that because the system requires Senators and TDs to do constituency work rather than parliamentary work.  That is a serious problem which no Government has had the courage to tackle and it presents a difficulty in justifying increases in salaries and allowances.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the rates of allowances may be increased administratively in line with general pay movements in the Civil Service.  It goes on to justify this, as all Ministers always do, by saying that it is a common provision.  The fact that it is a common provision does not make it a good provision.  We frequently ask Ministers questions and they reply that such a procedure has always been the case and has served the test of time.</P>
    <P>It is not necessarily fair to equate the allowances or salaries of TDs and Senators with the Civil Service.  The job of civil servant is completely different from that of a TD or Senator.  Civil servants are paid handsomely at the higher end of the scale and they also have great benefits which Members of the Oireachtas do not have.  The public should realise the insecurity of every Member of this and the other House. Every Member of this House puts his or her job on the line every one to four years.  We do not even know when that will happen, and this should be recognised. The public, if they feel a particular person does not justify his job or salary, can remove that person from his job without compensation in certain cases.  There <Col N="1875" /> is no security of tenure and that person will be outside this House looking for another job the next day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  There is no appeal.  That is peculiar to politicians and to link them to civil servants is to take one down a false road of thinking because there is no comparison between the two roles in society.  Our jobs are insecure while civil servants jobs are totally secure and should be paid accordingly.  We should be paid for achievement by setting the goals higher and allowing us to achieve those goals.</P>
      <P>It is important that every Member of this House should echo the words of Senator Manning, which were repeated by most of my colleagues.  The attempt to change the position of the secretaries was extremely unfair and thoughtless.  It was inexplicable how the Government proposed initially to leave the secretaries in this House in an even more vulnerable situation than they are at present.  Even now, our secretaries do not have any real security.  They are in an anomalous situation within the Civil Service in that they are vulnerable to us losing our seats. There is a problem with the Department of Finance on this issue but the Government proposed to leave them in a far more vulnerable situation by making them indirectly employed by the Members.  That was obviously unsatisfactory for the Members and the secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Members could have paid them a pittance and pocketed the rest of the allowance.  Perhaps I am wrong but I understood that was the initial proposal. If that was not so the Minister can correct me.  However, it could have left people who had no qualifications and who would be bad employers and bad wage payers, in a position where they could have exploited their secretaries.  I welcome the fact that this provision has been removed from the Bill but it still leaves the secretaries in this House in an anomalous and vulnerable position.  The <Col N="1876" /> Minister is aware of this because the Government tried to tackle the problem. I ask the Minister to tell the House what he proposes to do about this and what proposals he intends to bring before the House in the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Ross regarding the respect, status and commitment of past Ministers and the present Minister to this assembly.  At various times, we send people from this Parliament to other countries to advise on and oversee the setting up of democracy. We put ourselves forward as experts on democracy yet, in our democracy we run away and hide from it.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to justify why one secretary must work for three Senators. Our secretaries are upright, honest, hardworking people but the Minister cannot justify the situation because it is unfair to expect one person to do that amount of work.  Carrying out work for Senators involves a huge amount of concentration, particularly if the Senators are from different parts of the country.  The Minister knows that most Senators work on behalf of their constituents.  If they do not carry out that function people will ask why we are here.  In order to do that job, Senators are entitled to same facilities as TDs, with one secretary for each Senator.  That is the way it should be.</P>
      <P>In addition, secretaries were put through the dreadful experience of not knowing if they would have a job or who would employ them.  What a laugh, especially when it comes from this Government which has heaped upon itself advisers, spin doctors, programme managers, etc.  A humble Senator is not allowed to have his or her own secretary and each day the secretary would not know if she would have employment in the morning.  It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will explain his actions to the House.  He should defend democracy and give respect to those people who are involved in it.  This is the only way democracy will survive.  If we <Col N="1877" /> do not have respect for ourselves, who will have respect for us?  It is time the situation of three Senators to one secretary ended and that a definite employment procedure for secretaries was drawn up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that chairmen of Oireachtas joint committees are to receive monetary recognition for their work.  I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies during the last Administration and I am now a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  These committees put in a great deal of work and much work is required from the chairmen.  They are away from their constituency duties and it is important that this is recognised.</P>
      <P>It is also important that the Leader of the Seanad receives recognition for his work.  I pay tribute to the present Leader who has the interest of this House at heart.  While he does not always do what we ask and give us the debates we seek, and to which at times we feel we are entitled, he is making a fair effort to reflect our views in the correct places. He is genuine when he says he wants to introduce the debates that are sought and I wish him well.  I hope he will have further success.</P>
      <P>In common with Senator Belton, I am also concerned about the level of service Senators obtain.  Our secretarial service is under much pressure and it is unfair that the secretaries are put in that position.  Many Senators work as hard, and sometimes harder, than Deputies but we have one secretary to three Senators and this puts them under much pressure. At present, in some of the groups, many of the Senators are looking towards the next general election and they have a workload which is as heavy as any Deputy.  This puts a substantial amount of pressure on the secretaries and creates frustration for the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unfair to ask that we be treated equally with our Dáil colleagues in that respect.  We are Members of the Oireachtas and are told that we have <Col N="1878" /> equal status with TDs in the Constitution. We have the same workload as TDs and it is not unfair to ask that we get equal treatment in relation to services, particularly secretarial ones.  I also wish to deal with the extreme difficulties and pressure the secretaries experienced as a result of the approach taken by the Government to change their conditions of employment. I have been involved in industrial relations for over 20 years and I have never seen any approach to changing conditions of employment like this one, which involved using the Oireachtas to pass legislation to unilaterally change the conditions and security of employment of secretaries.  Security is very important to people today because of the level of unemployment.  To do this through legislation was preposterous.</P>
    <P>In all my days in industrial relations and in all the strikes we have experienced, I have never seen an issue like this which was tackled with such lack of feeling and without the manners to consult people.  In industrial relations the first thing that is done when one wants to change conditions of employment is to talk to people to explain why this must be done and to get their agreement.  None of this was done.  The changes were introduced by legislation.  This was the first the secretaries heard about it.  They were left in limbo.  They did not know what was going to happen and whether they would still have their jobs after the next election.  Their security would have been threatened even if Members resigned from this House.  This was the worst case of the handling of an industrial relations issue which I have ever experienced. Anybody in the area of industrial relations would have to agree with this.  I am happy that some Labour Members of the other House saw fit to stop this.  The Members who did so have industrial relations experience.  They saw how unfair this was and I compliment them on calling the Government to heel on this issue.</P>
    <P>However, we are still in limbo and do not know how the problem will be solved. Insecurity still exists to a certain extent among the secretarial staff.  Any good <Col N="1879" /> manager would try to remove this insecurity because it is a demotivating factor for people.  It must be demotivating if people do not know how their security might be affected by future changes. Security in employment has become more and more important because of the level of unemployment and the difficulties in obtaining employment.  The proposal to make secretaries appendages to Senators and Deputies was totally unfair, bearing in mind that almost half of the Members of the previous Seanad were not elected to this one.  If the Government's original proposals were in operation, half of the Seanad secretaries would not have had jobs after the election. Some of our secretaries have been here for ten, 15 or 20 years.  To change the security of such people in the fashion it was done was totally out of order and against any decent principles of industrial relations which I have ever experienced.</P>
    <P>I welcome certain sections of the Bill. I particularly welcome that the obnoxious sections 7, 8 and 9 have been removed from the original Bill.  The Minister should look at the level of work Senators do.  We want to give the same service as TDs.  Most of us have a broader electorate and constituency.  We have the constituencies in our localities and must also represent the national constituency of the public representatives of Ireland.  We do this as best we can and need as much assistance as we can get.  I am glad that some recognition has been given to the Leader because this increases the status of the House.  It is fair to say that the work of Senators and this Seanad has improved the view the public have of our role.  I hope this will continue.  We on this side will work as well as we can and we hope the Minister will look favourably at giving Members any help he can, especially in the area of secretarial assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak on the Bill but it may be the only opportunity I get to explain the difference between the secretarial assistance given to Members of the Lower and <Col N="1880" /> Upper Houses.  Many of my colleagues who have served in both Houses find it difficult to contend with this difference. I am as busy as a Member of this House as I was when I was in the Dáil.  The secretary I had as a Member of the Dáil is now dealing with three Senators.  She is overloaded with work every day and does not get any break.  If we are to try to upgrade the attitude to politicians, they should at least be given the facilities to do a proper job.  Unfortunately, we are not given such facilities.  All politicians should have the courage of their convictions and provide money for systems which would result in the better running of the Dáil and the Seanad and better facilities for TDs and Senators.</P>
      <P>I welcome the lavish plan the Minister has put forward for vast improvements in both Houses, which is a courageous step. I would have no difficulty in defending the making available of extra funding to Senators to provide adequate secretarial facilities because we do not have them at present.  The secretaries working for Senators are under extreme pressure and I would be most grateful if the Minister would give favourable consideration to that sincere request from all of us.  If we cannot convince the Minister that we need extra facilities, as politicians we are in difficulty.  We are all trying to do a difficult job and I would greatly appreciate if he would give our complaints a fair a hearing and do something about the secretarial situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate. It strayed into areas other than those which are dealt with in the Bill, but I will try to refer to them.  Most Senators have referred to sections which are not now part of the Bill.  These are the original sections 7,8 and 9.  I respectfully say that most of the Senators who spoke appeared to speak from a position of ignorance or lack of knowledge of the circumstances in which the Government found and still finds itself.  After the last general election a former secretarial assistant took a court case against the Oireachtas to establish <Col N="1881" /> that she was a civil servant and that because the overall number of seats in the Houses had not changed, she was entitled to continued employment in the Houses.  The case was not brought by the Government but by a former secretarial assistant who felt aggrieved at being made redundant when her Deputy lost his seat.  The case went to court and the court found against the secretarial assistant. It made the judgment that this secretarial assistant was employed either by the politician concerned or by the party of that particular politician and not by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>There is also legal opinion going back some time which expresses the view that the system which we have in relation to secretarial assistants in both Houses is illegal in that it does not comply with Article 15.15 of the Constitution, where any facility made available to Members of either House has to be provided by way of law.  The court more or less said that the scheme had no legal basis &mdash; although I do not think that it went so far as to say that it was illegal &mdash; and that the issue had to be addressed.  The original proposals in this Bill were designed to redress that situation and to make it legal for Members of either House to have secretarial assistants.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that Members of this or the other House were being in any way malicious in what they said or that they were trying to mislead anybody. However, I think that they are misapprehending the situation.  There was no proposal to unilaterally change the terms and conditions of employment of the secretaries.  It was made quite clear in discussions which I and the other party Whips had with the union that the Whips, as the people who were dealing with the secretarial assistants for each of the parties on an ongoing basis &mdash; we cannot say employers &mdash; would have no part in any move which would remove any of the rights, privileges or terms and conditions which secretarial assistants felt that they had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each party has its own formal agreement with the unions.  It was made clear by each of the Whips, on behalf of each <Col N="1882" /> party, that whatever new legal arrangement was put in place would not mean any lessening of their rights.  I spoke on a number of occasions to two union officials and assured them of that.  I gave them in writing that we would not contemplate any proposal which would, as some Deputies and Senators, remove the secretarial assistants' legal rights under various labour legislation and would have secretaries employed &mdash; and the phrase was again used here this evening &mdash; at the whim of a Deputy or Senator.</P>
    <P>That was never the Government's intention and neither I nor any other Whip would contemplate that.  I want to underline that to Members of this House. If anything, the original sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill would have enhanced the protection of the secretaries, particularly during election periods.</P>
    <P>A number of other points were made in relation to the secretarial assistants which I want to briefly deal with.  No Member of this or the other House has security of tenure.  We would all like to think that when we come into this House we could be here for whatever length of time we like.  Our system means that we have to face the electorate and take the consequences.  We may end up not even lucky enough to be promoted to the Seanad but thrown out altogether. People such as secretarial assistants cannot in those circumstances expect to have the same tenure as any other civil servant might have and expect to continue in their job for 20, 30 or 40 years. That is not realistic.</P>
    <P>Some Members made the point that they should have Civil Service status.  I believe that Members should be able to choose their secretarial assistant, which is not an unreasonable point of view.  It would not be possible for Members to exercise that choice if secretaries were given civil servant status.  There would be a pool of 166 secretaries for Deputies and 20 for Senators, using the current ratios. A Senator made the point that 20 per cent of the Members of this House lost their seats in the last election and there was more change in the composition of the Dáil than ever before.  Can Senators <Col N="1883" /> imagine a secretary from the Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael groups being assigned to a Labour or a Green Party Deputy after an election?  Such a scenario would cause all sorts of difficulties.</P>
    <P>By and large the Civil Service is nonpolitical, especially higher up along the line.  In accordance with the rules and fine practice and tradition in this country they are politically neutral, although I know that they have their own political views.  If secretaries were civil servants, where would that leave Members at election time?  As civil servants they could say that they could not get involved.  I concur with all of the points which were made about how hard our secretarial assistants work.  When an election comes they feel free to go and work for their Deputy or Senator.  There are difficulties in what some Members were proposing in relation to civil servant status for secretaries.</P>
    <P>The decision of the court must be faced up to and a system will have to be put in place, which we have tried to do over the last three or four months.  We have been with the LRC.  The union and the Whips have made submissions.  We were moving slowly towards a common view but a number of matters arose which were outside the control of the Whips.  We decided then to reintroduce this Bill and remove those sections.</P>
    <P>The present position is that, having removed those sections from the Bill, this matter will have to be taken up between the union representing the secretarial assistants and the Department of Finance through the normal industrial procedures and the LRC, who have an understanding of the difficulties on both sides.  It will not be easy to resolve this problem.  I want to emphasise, as Members were concerned about it, that there was no desire on the Government's part to introduce a unilateral change in the secretarial assistants scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning made a point, which was echoed by Senator Belton and others about having three Senators to each secretary. All parties are given the same allowance on the basis of a three to one <Col N="1884" /> ratio.  The original Bill would have enhanced the position of Senators as the ratio would have been two to one.  The position can be re-examined in the future.  Each party is treated in the same manner.  If Fianna Fáil have a better ratio it is because they divert their staff in a different way.  However, the numbers and ratio are the same.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned the membership of committees.  If I understood him correctly, he was saying that Senators should become members of the legislative committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

      <P>Senator Daly mentioned secretarial assistants in the context of former Taoisigh. I accept his point about the amount of work former Taoisigh might have, but one is then treating one Member of the Oireachtas on a different basis from others.  The Senator also asked about section 4 (c) of the Bill, which states that an allowance will not payable to a Member of the Oireachtas who is the holder of an office referred to in Part II of the 1938 Act, as amended.  That simply refers to any committee chaired by an office holder &mdash; for example, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which is chaired by the Ceann Comhairle who is excluded from getting an allowance for that.</P>

      <P>I agree with the point made by several Senators that Members of the Oireachtas generally are overworked and underpaid.  I never make any apology for supporting improvements to Leinster House or salaries.  I have said privately, as a backbencher and again in my current position, that it is pointless having independent bodies conduct independent reviews of our wages and salaries if we only accept their recommendations in principle and do not implement them. They are either right or wrong.  If we set up these independent bodies we should all have the courage to stand by them and justify, as I believe we can, the level of salaries and so on we are getting.</P>
      <P>I did a quick calculation earlier.  I do not wish to suggest that I work harder than anybody else, but when I divided the number of hours I work into the combined total of my salary and allowance as a Minister of State, I found that I am paid about the same as a carpenter, which is approximately £10 per hour. That is totally wrong and I have no difficulty agreeing with the Senators who said that Members of the Oireachtas should not be slow to put forward their own case.</P>
      <P>Some Members mentioned, among others, the Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad.  As we are tied to groups like Gleeson and so on, the best approach Members could take is to make the case for themselves, either on an all party basis or through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, during the next review.  Senators seem to have got their act together for the last Gleeson report as they were given an 18 per cent increase while Dáil Deputies were allowed only a 3 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear so much unanimity in the House about being overworked and underpaid and the need for facilities and extra secretarial assistance for Senators.  If I could refer to the other House, it is a pity that we do not get the same cross party support when an effort is made to improve facilities.  When proposals were put to the other House about improving facilities for Members, the attacks made on the suggestion and on <Col N="1886" /> me did little credit to those who made them.  We are our own worst enemies at times.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of Senator Taylor-Quinn's points as she more or less confined herself to the secretarial assistants matter.  I take issue with her view that the changes are an attack on female staff.  There were a number of male staff involved and it was not an attack, as I have explained.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ross about the tension between constituency and parliamentary duties.  I am aware of the amount of work most Senators do. Members will readily accept that there are Senators and Deputies who are not as active as others, but getting the right balance between constituency and parliamentary duties is difficult.  We are approaching the correct balance in the other House through the committee system.  Members have to spend more time looking after their parliamentary duties, which is correct and should be encouraged in both Houses.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the major points raised by Senators.  If I have forgotten any points, I will deal with them as we go through Committee Stage.  I thank Senators for the points they have made and the general welcome for this Bill.  I look forward to returning to the Seanad and to discussing the facilities for Members.</P>

It has been the practice for many years to allow Members to claim travelling expenses in respect of journeys between a temporary holiday home and Leinster House.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to raise finance on a commercial basis for the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  The provisions of this Bill do not and are not intended to interfere with the planning process.  It has been reported that this Bill interferes with the planning process and, as a Minister who has practised transparency and openness, I take a serious view of such an unsustainable charge.  Notwithstanding that it was unnecessary to do so, I voluntarily submitted the project for planning permission in line with my policy of subjecting all such developments to the full <Col N="1890" /> rigour of the planning process.  This is in accordance with my philosophy of providing the maximum amount of transparency in respect of all matters within my responsibility in the Department of the Marine and the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>The ferry terminal project was granted planning permission by Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council last February. The decision was appealed to An Bord Pleanála and the board is at present examining the appeal.  I assure the House I will respect fully whatever decision An Bord Pleanála may make.  What is being sought here is a financial facility to allow the project to proceed in the event that the board gives it approval.  The enactment of the Bill is strictly without prejudice to that decision.</P>
      <P>This development is part of a comprehensive integrated strategy for the development of ferry services on the central corridor.  This complex strategy has become necessary in recent times because of modern technology and the state of the art ferries being brought into service.  It involves the parallel and complementary development of ferry terminals at Dublin port and Dún Laoghaire and also the additional development of Holyhead.</P>
      <P>The central corridor investment involves a number of elements, of which I will list the most important.  The first is the introduction by B&amp;I of a new large vessel which is being built at present at a cost of £45 million.  This new passenger and freight ferry vessel will substantially increase the existing freight capacity on the Dublin-Holyhead route and will also increase the tourist car capacity.  I thank B&amp;I for the manner in which it will introduce the vessel.  It is an expensive item but it is important for the future and the complementary development of the ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stena Sealink plan to introduce the first large fast ferry of its kind in the world on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route in May 1995.  This is subject to planning permission, as is anything I say which relates to the future.  I will accept the Planning Appeals Board decision without <Col N="1891" /> reservation, and that cannot be second guessed or gainsaid.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this vessel, which is currently being built at a cost of £65 million sterling, will transform maritime transport on the central corridor, reducing the crossing time from three and a half hours to one and three quarter hours. This will provide major benefits for tourism and trade.  These new state of the art vessels will put the central corridor at the forefront of modern ferry technology and services.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the Dún Laoghaire ferry requirements include a dedicated berth to be provided for the HSS vessel and improved passenger facilities, which means infilling an area of 1.5 hectares to provide additional operational area.  Due to the new technology and the new HSS vessel this area is two hectares smaller than that envisaged earlier. Previously, a far greater infill was intended and we should be grateful that the area necessary has been reduced.  It is more efficient, more realistic and environmentally more acceptable to the confirmation of Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>The HSS has been compared to a stadium to frighten people and to give an idea of what appears to be its excessive size.  It is important to remember the new vessel is approximately five meters shorter in length than a conventional ferry such as the <i>Hibernia</i>.  Where it does differ is that it has a broader stern, 40 metres as opposed to 21 metres.  That is 20 paces in layman's terms and in my terms, because I am also a layman in this instance.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that up to 150,000 trucks a year would come through Dún Laoghaire.  Present traffic is about 33,000 units per annum and this is projected to increase to about 45,000 over a ten year period.  Total RO/RO traffic on the central corridor at present amounts to about 150,000 units, but the vast bulk of this goes through Dublin port.  This position will not change, especially because of the proposed introduction of the new B&amp;I super ferry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> Section 2 of the Bill relates to planning issues and has caused rustling in the dovecotes. I find it difficult to understand the way people have read this section, perhaps not deliberately, to condemn the Minister's retrospective rights.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I understand and appreciate the concerns expressed, especially those regarding possible retrospective powers.</P>
    <P>As someone who lives in Dún Laoghaire and has a love of the harbour, I too would have reservations should this provision have the effect of legitimising acts in the past which were outside the powers of the Minister and which were clearly objectionable from the public viewpoint.  I am fully satisfied after extensive legal advice that this is not the case. I strongly advise any organisations concerned about this matter to seek legal advice, which I think will conform with the advice available to me.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 2 of the Bill and the definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo; in section 1 is to confirm and put beyond any doubt that the Minister for the Marine may carry out development works at Dún Laoghaire harbour.  In particular it will put beyond doubt that the Minister may undertake works under the sea bed.  The legal advice available to me is that the Minister for the Marine already has these powers in full.  Nevertheless, it is felt prudent to ensure that any risks in this regard should be removed.  This will mean the Minister, subject again to planning permission, may proceed with the business of developing the harbour.</P>
    <P>There is nothing sinister in this and it is not intended to subvert the planning process or to anticipate the decision of the Planning Appeals Board.  It is simply in order to proceed with the business of developing the harbour.  This is especially so in view of the major project now envisaged and the financial and economic risks involved for the harbour, the State and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>I see this as a national project.  Some political soothsayers have suggested that Deputy Andrews has been a representative for Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown for 30 years and wishes to leave a <Col N="1893" /> legacy to his vanity as a &ldquo;last hurrah&rdquo; in his long representation of this constituency. Naturally, I want to see a development in the constituency; for too many years projects have fallen because of lack of support or because of opposition, which in my view was ill-founded in a number of instances.  Here, however, we have a marvellous opportunity to put into place a facility which must be seen in a national context.  I am a Dáil Deputy for the constituency and for the time being I am Minister for the Marine.  That is coincidental to the coming on stream of this development, but I am proud to be associated with it, both as a Dún Laoghaire Deputy and as Minister, because I believe it is a first class facility in a first class harbour which happens to be in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>However, one is never found wanting for begrudgers, so this development is related to the fact that I happen to be the constituency representative.  It is said, therefore, that it is solely for that reason that I pursue this terminal project.  This is a misrepresentation because that is not my style.  I am not that dishonest.</P>
    <P>The provisions in sections 1 and 2 in this regard relate solely to Dún Laoghaire harbour and not to other ports or foreshore generally.  The reference to foreshore in section 1 is merely a convenient means of defining the seabed area as distinct from the land in Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the phrase in section 2 (1), &ldquo;and be deemed always to have had&rdquo;, be deleted.  The effect, however, of excluding these words would be to raise a possible doubt about the development activities in the past.  As I said earlier, the advice I have is that the Minister already had full powers to undertake all development which has been carried out.  However, there is a slim legal doubt which could invite challenge about development on the seabed.  I am not aware that any development undertaken in the recent past has been objected to in a serious fashion.  This section does not in my view trespass on the public interest in any practical or material way. I appreciate that some people may have <Col N="1894" /> serious concerns on the grounds of principle, but that is not a compelling reason for putting forward that point of view in this case.  People may put forward their views if they want to because that is democracy.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed that for a harbour such as Dún Laoghaire, with its unique mix of commercial and leisure users, there may be exempting provisions in the planning regulations which would allow it to bypass the public consultative process.  I would not countenance such a situation.  I assure this House that in view of the special sensitivities involved, I will examine this matter in the context of introducing amending harbour legislation in the next session.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that all future development in Dún Laoghaire harbour, whether by the Minister for the Marine or by a harbour company to be set up under the proposed revision of the Harbours Act, 1946, will be subject to the full planning process.  I want to acknowledge the support of all the political parties in Dún Laoghaire constituency and those representing the former Dún Laoghaire Corporation, which is now the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council.  They may have issued a caveat, but nevertheless there has been strong support from the Fine Gael Party, Democratic Left and the Labour Party, which I appreciate. They see it in a community context, in that what is good for the country is good for Dún Laoghaire.  As a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, I want to show my appreciation for this unanimous political support for this project from the representatives of the constituency.  They know what is happening on the ground and they know that the business people in the constituency want this development.</P>
    <P>The car ferry has been in Dún Laoghaire since the middle of the last century, and there is nothing new about this.  Is there any reason Dún Laoghaire and Ireland should not have a state of the art harbour to accept a state of the art vessel and to ensure it progresses to the next century?  For too long, the facilities in Dún Laoghaire harbour have been a <Col N="1895" /> shame to the local community.  The first sights of Ireland were the wretched piers. We are now transporting Dún Laoghaire from the 19th century to the 21st century without pausing for the 20th century.</P>
    <P>It is important to repeat my assurance to the House that all future development in Dún Laoghaire harbour, whether by the Minister for the Marine or by a harbour company to be set up under the proposed revision of the Harbours Act, 1946, will be subject to planning permission. In particular, I assure the House that any proposals for marina development will be subjected to the full rigours of the planning process and I will ensure full and open public consultation as a prerequisite to any such project going ahead.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say a few words about the principal provisions of the Bill. The main purpose of the Bill is to establish a funding mechanism for the development works at Dún Laoghaire harbour. The Bill provides for the establishment of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour (Finance) Board.  The Schedule to the Bill contains provisions in relation to the board.  The Schedule is well drafted and is understandable. It is not like other legislation which contains gobbledegook and leads, in terms of knowledge, to an inconclusive <i>cul-de-sac</i>.  In this instance, the Schedule is well drafted and sets out clearly what must be done.  The board shall consist of not fewer than three and not more than five members who shall be appointed by the Minister for the Marine.  The board, under the direction of the Minister, has the power to secure the necessary money to defray the expenses incurred by the Minister for the Marine in carrying out the development at Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the history of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  There has been a car ferry terminal in Dún Laoghaire since the middle of the last century.  An Act to amend several Acts relating to Kingstown harbour was passed on 20 August 1936.  This Act constituted Kingstown harbour and provided that it be governed by the Kingstown Harbour <Col N="1896" /> Commissioners.  The name was changed to Dún Laoghaire and the functions transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works under the State Harbours Act, 1924.  The Dún Laoghaire Harbour Act, 1990, transferred responsibility for Dún Laoghaire harbour to the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>Legislation is at present being drafted to bring about a major reorganisation of the commercial ports.  The new harbours Bill, preparation of which is well advanced, will set up commercial State companies to manage a number of harbours, including Dún Laoghaire.  It is hoped to publish the Bill at the earliest opportunity.  The harbours Bill is designed to facilitate commercialisation and a more customer responsive service. The main thrust of the legislation will be to relax ministerial control while increasing accountability for operational and financial performance.  This might allay the fears of those people who feel the Minister has draconian powers in terms of retrospection.  The proposed new Bill, which will subsume this legal mechanism, will lessen the influence of the Minister for the Marine in the harbour while increasing accountability for operational and financial performance.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Dún Laoghaire Harbour (Finance) Board will consist of not fewer than three and not more than five members who will be appointed by the Minister for the Marine.  The board, under the direction of the Minister, has the power to secure the necessary moneys to defray the expenses incurred by the Minister for the Marine in carrying out harbour development works in Dún Laoghaire.  For that purpose, the board may, with the consent of the Minister for the Marine, given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, borrow moneys from commercial sources up to a limit of £20 million.  The Minister for Finance may make loans to the board in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The other interesting aspect of this Bill is that it will not cost the taxpayer a red cent.  The Minister may by order appropriate to the Dún Laoghaire harbour <Col N="1897" /> Development Fund a proportion of the revenues payable from the harbour operations at Dún Laoghaire and with the consent of the Minister for Finance make non-repayable grants to the board.  The board is required to keep accounts, such accounts to be audited on an annual basis by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The audited accounts together with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report shall be laid by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Borrowings by the board may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. An annual report must be submitted to the Minister not later than three months after the end of each financial year in relation to the operation of the fund. Copies of the annual report shall be laid by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This proposed development of Dún Laoghaire harbour is an integral part of the Government's general strategy for the development of the maritime transport sector generally and more particularly ferry services on the central corridor.  The Bill facilitates this development. However I must reiterate that the commencement of the project is contingent on the outcome of the planning process.</P>
    <P>There has been some suggestion that this development in some way lessens the impact of Dublin Port in relation to its future.  I would like to assure those people who are concerned about Dublin Port and its future that I am equally concerned about it.  There is a role for Dublin Port, there is a role for Dún Laoghaire and there is a role for Holyhead in the context of the central corridor strategy which the Government is putting in place.</P>
    <P>Members may voice concern that the proposed investment in Dún Laoghaire will be to the detriment of Dublin Port but that is not the case.  Already significant investment has taken place in Dublin Port.  Under the European Union assisted Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989 to 1993, investment in facilities in Dublin Port amounted to £22 million of which approximately £10 million <Col N="1898" /> was European Union aid.  This investment covered the lo-lo ro-ro freight and bulk and the acquisition of a tug.  Further significant investment is planned under the 1994-1999 National Development Plan.  There are other facts and figures that I can give the House arising out of whatever contribution Members may make and any queries they may wish to put me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Each night we see action replays on the television from the world cup.  In this case the Minister gave us action replay in advance.  He has said many things here today that were said to me in the last week by people from the Dún Laoghaire area.  He has already heard the concern of people in Dún Laoghaire.  Some people objected strongly to this development.  The Minister explained today why this Bill had to be enacted while the matter is with An Bord Pleanála.  I think I am right in saying that the matter is with An Bord Pleanála at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of Dún Laoghaire are concerned about this development.  Other objections were to the increased traffic through Dún Laoghaire as a result of the development. Efforts are being made to revitalise the town, to bring it back to former glory, and extra traffic through the town will not help that.  It was also pointed out that Dublin Port could be used for this operation.  The overall development in increasing facilities for heavy traffic into Dublin is welcome and one can see the need for this.  One can see how, with the Channel Tunnel, we could link up and <Col N="1899" /> bring our country closer to Europe in terms of transport.  That is extremely welcome. The objections and concerns have already been already voiced, and I know the Minister is aware of them.  They are with An Bord Pleanála and that matter has to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this innovative legislation and compliment the Minister on his imagination and foresight in bringing it forward.  I do not wish to be patronising with the Minister because he does not believe in that kind of nonsense.</P>
      <P>Very soon after my appointment as Minister for the Marine he took me on a visit to Dún Laoghaire harbour and pointed out his genuinely held beliefs about the necessity to undertake a balanced development of Dún Laoghaire. At that time we had a project for the development of the whole harbour, including amenities which would enhance leisure and recreational facilities.  We had what I considered at the time to be some spurious objections which led to the demise of that project and, in my view, held back the development of leisure and amenity facilities in Dún Laoghaire for many years.  The Minister, Deputy Andrews, was totally committed to ensuring that the correct thing was done in Dún Laoghaire, recognising that Dún Laoghaire has had a proud tradition in maritime affairs dating back to 1860.</P>
      <P>I come from a western county.  I live near Kilrush and we have been endeavouring to develop maritime facilities there.  We have had some of the same type of objections there, spurious objections from people who felt that in some way modern developments would damage traditional culture.  The result of the objections to the proposed development in Dingle has been seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maritime developments bring out objectors we see very rarely and who vanish once they succeed in doing the maximum amount of damage.  It would be a pity if this very laudable, worthwhile development were to be hampered by that type of spurious objection.  Dún Laoghaire is an important for access harbour. <Col N="1900" /> This is not a local issue; it is a national issue.  Access through Dún Laoghaire has relevance to our tourism industry in the west.  We are heading into the start of the tourism season and the importance of access, especially this modern access, can be seen.</P>
    <P>This will be the first ferry of its type in the world, opening up the new generation of fast ferries.  High speed sea service is the coming concept in the development of traffic into Ireland and difficulty of access has been one of the greatest handicaps to the development of tourism nationally.  This must be dealt with effectively and the first step has been taken in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not familiar with the details of planning appeals but it would be a tragedy if this opportunity to develop the harbour in Dún Laoghaire with its consequent impact on tourism nationally &mdash; right over to the west &mdash; was to be delayed or frustrated for spurious reasons.  The harbour and its environs will be enhanced and the development of the facility will not only provide employment opportunities in Dún Laoghaire and the surrounding areas but will enhance the economy of the area and have a major impact on the development of tourism generally.</P>
    <P>In 1993 two-thirds of passenger ferry traffic came in through Dún Laoghaire. That gives an indication of the cross-channel traffic in particular.  It is important that we enhance this and put in the best recreational amenities to cater for that coming trend in international maritime affairs.  The Minister is to be congratulated and supported in the work he is doing in that regard.</P>
    <P>I note from contributions in the other House that this proposal has the support of the interim harbour board which was set up three or four years ago in response to public demand that there be some local input to help shape and plan the future development of Dún Laoghaire.  The responsibility for the operation of the board was taken over from the Office of Public Works when I was Minister for State and the Department of the Marine took responsibility at that stage.  I compliment <Col N="1901" /> the personnel in the Department. They have used a number of innovative ways to develop business in harbours; I have seen it in Drogheda and Youghal, for example.</P>
    <P>A few years ago when a dredging operation was taking place in Youghal the pier fell into the sea.  Had it not been for the imagination and initiative of the technicians and officials in the Department of the Marine it would still be in the sea.  Local people who use Youghal harbour were prepared to make an investment in co-operation with the Department and the Office of Public Works to put in an excellent facility which has been a tremendous success and has ensured that traffic, business and employment continued in Youghal.  The same approach has been taken in Drogheda and other areas where there were investment problems and the Government did not have the money to do the work needed.</P>
    <P>It is significant &mdash; and the Minister has underlined this &mdash; that this investment is not costing the taxpayer a penny.  The benefit to the economy and to tourism which will be apparent in employment opportunities is the underlying reason for this development.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to update the legislation governing the operation and management of harbours which dates back to 1946.  I notice that this legislation will not delay the work which is under way at present.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to modernise the harbours legislation to cover harbours such as the Shannon Estuary which has three harbour authorities, none of which has any clear line of demarcation.  It is urgent that a new estuarial authority be put in place which will develop the full potential of one of the best estuaries in Europe. The updating of the harbours legislation will be welcome and, I am sure, will be supported.</P>
    <P>In the development of the commercial potential of Dún Laoghaire there is no conflict with the development of leisure and amenity facilities.  There is space and opportunity enough in Dún Laoghaire for both.  It has been proven in other <Col N="1902" /> places where such developments have taken place that one can manage the relationship between commercial development in business and traffic, which generates employment and revenue for the economy, and the leisure and amenity development which is also important.  That can be done very satisfactorily in Dún Laoghaire and there is no need for people in boat clubs or yacht clubs to fear that such development might hamper their enjoyment of the amenities of Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for the Marine an international expert on maritime and marina developments told me that the problem with most of the areas where one tries to develop marinas is that there is too much water.  The way to get the best value from amenity, recreational and commercial potential of an estuary or harbour, such as the Shannon or Dún Laoghaire, is by utilising it to the best advantage.  I hope this legislation will provide one of the most dynamic developments we have ever seen.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and congratulate the Minister on his innovation and his foresight in bringing it forward.  I hope it will be successful and will bring about the desired results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House but I am not so sure that I welcome the development that is to take place in Dún Laoghaire harbour.  While the harbour board may have been behind the development, many of the residents are opposed to it, mainly on environmental grounds.  While an environmental impact study was submitted to the planning authority with the application, it was not very enthusiastic either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all glad to see the modernisation of Irish sea crossings.  It has, at one time or another, been a difficult crossing for most of us.  I am glad the crossing time is being cut dramatically but the catamaran is a new ship which has not yet had sea trials, which, I presume will take place in the Baltic Sea.  In inclement weather the catamaran which is sailing between Dublin and Holyhead cannot put to sea.  I have often had to <Col N="1903" /> transfer to the ordinary boat as the catamaran was unable to sail in what did not appear to be very high winds &mdash; force five or six which we often get on the Irish Sea.  We are putting great faith and enthusiasm into something which has not been tried on the Irish Sea and we know that there are grave problems with the catamaran operating there at present.</P>
    <P>The main reason most of those who object to the arrival of this catamaran is that so little thought has been put into dealing with the problem of increased traffic on the access roads to Dún Laoghaire.  Crofton Road and Longford Terrace have an enormous volume of traffic as things stand, and in the summer it increases.  The traffic management study carried out by the borough found that the traffic increase in the two years from 1992 to 1994 was about 124 per cent, and this only took cars into account, not lorries.</P>
    <P>When one considers that the plans for Dún Laoghaire proposed the pedestrianisation of George's Street and Marine Road and it is hoped that there will be a major development on the Pavilion site to bring more people into the area, one can understand why many of the residents on the other roads are extremely alarmed.  Not only is there chaos and confusion on the roads, but the increased traffic will bring extra noise, vibration and pollution.</P>
    <P>The present roads, as anyone coming in from Dún Laoghaire will know, are having grave difficulty in coping with present traffic levels.  This ferry is being put in place before anything has been done to ease that congestion.  This will become more serious if there are not only extra cars coming off this ferry but increased freight traffic as well.  From a commercial point of view this will have to happen, especially in winter, if the ferry service is to survive.  The Minister seems to have great faith in thinking that Ro-Ro traffic will not come into Dún Laoghaire and keep going to Dublin port. However, time is money in that business. They are always looking for the shortest sea crossing.  Crossing the sea takes up <Col N="1904" /> most of their transport time.  Not only will they want to seek the shortest crossing but also the one that in time will cost them the least money.  Therefore, because of those factors and the fact that the ferry owners would want to get as much freight traffic as possible, especially in winter, I can see a great increase in this kind of traffic.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about this new terminal increasing local employment. Most of the material I have read discussing local employment admits there will be little increase.  Certainly, there will be an increase in employment when the building work is taking place, but that will not last forever.  The environmental impact study on the matter says: &ldquo;While it is difficult to project accurately the future employment and revenue associated with the improved and extended ferry terminal development, it is likely that some increase will take place, or at least the existing economic benefits will be maintained.&rdquo;  This suggests that we will only maintain existing employment levels.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire is an important tourist attraction.  Many people go there for day trips or for holidays.  It has been suggested that we may get many people from Holyhead coming over to the town, but it only has a small population.  Even if they all came once a month, I doubt whether it would make much difference to the economic status of those with shops, guest houses and so forth in Dún Laoghaire.  One may also find that those people currently coming to Dún Laoghaire to enjoy this nice place may be driven away by this increased traffic.</P>
    <P>The residents have made petitions regarding the situation.  The Dún Laoghaire Residents Harbour Action Group says that the existing ferry is there and that activity will continue, even if the new ferry does not come in.  The level of ferry activity appears to be adequate and the ferry docks in a fine residential area. The level of activity proposed in this plan is 40 per cent greater than the maximum envisaged in the 1992 harbour development plan.  No one has ever proposed an increase in the number of heavy lorries <Col N="1905" /> on the roads between Dún Laoghaire, Monkstown and Blackrock, but it says this will almost certainly happen.  It also says that traffic flow has already greatly increased.</P>
    <P>The group points out that pedestrianisation of the centre of Dún Laoghaire will put more cars and lorries on the sea roads.  It does not expect to have much ferry-related employment.  After all, these big ferries employ fewer people. Naturally, one wants to keep them as economic as possible, but this will not help the people of Dún Laoghaire.  If due to the increased traffic Dún Laoghaire becomes less attractive for its residents to shop in, a large number will go elsewhere. There are plenty of other places, such as Stillorgan, Blackrock and Bray, for them to shop.  It has serious reservations as to how economically satisfactory this new terminal will be for them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say that the Dublin docks seem nearly moribund, but they are not exactly a hive of activity at the moment.  I am not sure what the situation will be regarding the ferry there if this superferry comes to Dún Laoghaire. How much traffic will go through there? Concern has been expressed to the Minister by the Docks, Marine and Transport branch of SIPTU, who are also worried about the effect this ferry will have on employment in Dublin docks.  Indeed, that employment has shrunk dramatically in the last few years.  No matter how desirable this new ferry or terminal may be, we are not sure whether it will be able to cross the Irish Sea.  There is also a lot of resistance from residents within the area.</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of this Bill.  I have not served this area as long as the Minister, but I support the developments in the harbour.  It is great that the Minister is in this Department, otherwise we would still be discussing these matters.  While everything in the garden is not rosy, at least matters are moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire harbour must move with the times if it is not to be left behind. These proposed developments are welcome and I hope they come on stream soon.  The planning process is currently taking shape.  There has been too much negative thinking in Dún Laoghaire recently.  There was a recent proposal in Dún Laoghaire on the Dominican site and this may well go back to An Bord Pleanála.  Any proposal where people are investing money in shop units, residential homes and new cinemas can only bring about renewed prosperity to the town.  If Dún Laoghaire does not get a financial injection, it will die.  I am not being disrespectful to other areas, but I would like to see the town prospering.  It should be a gateway for holidaymakers.  Once they come there, they will stay in the town for the first part of their holiday and they will not leave as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The harbour has a mixture of commercial and leisure users.  There must be a balance struck between recognising those who are already there, such as yacht clubs and small boat owners, and the great contribution being made by <Col N="1907" /> Stena Sealink.  However, Stena Sealink would move if it were more commercially profitable or if Dún Laoghaire did not respond in a positive way.</P>
    <P>What time scale does the Minister envisage for the development if it proceeds? When will the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Finance Committee be established and what provisions will apply regarding appointments to the committee?</P>
    <P>Regarding the development of the ferry services, shipping needs are changing. There has been a speeding up in the period of time spent at sea, and the proposed new vessel will contain considerable advances.  Senator Henry expressed some reservations as to whether the vessel had been adequately tested, but I would be happy to participate in the first voyage.  Hopefully it will not suffer the same fate as the <i>Titanic</i>.  Doubtless the Minister, being an entrepreneur, will have the necessary courage to undertake that voyage.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry's remarks on negative thinking require consideration, and some people in Dún Laoghaire wish to keep the situation as it operated 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  However, unfortunately, times change and circumstance must change with them.  If developments proceed as planned there will be a great injection into Dún Laoghaire.  There will be a boost to the local economy, to local hoteliers, publicans, guest house owners and so on.  The area will benefit from an increasing influx of people.  It will not be detrimental to the local residents.  Many of them are local business people.  The Chamber of Commerce has backed the development, as have members of the former Dún Laoghaire Corporation before it became the expanded into Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which has also backed it.</P>
    <P>More positive thinking is required on aspects of the Bill.  In this respect the south eastern motorway has raised concerns regarding traffic.  There are problems on this issue which must be addressed, and they are not going to be easily solved.  However the issue covers <Col N="1908" /> a small area of mileage and perhaps a programme of pedestrianisation may be the solution.  There is another problem with Georges Street, which is too narrow, as the Minister is well aware.</P>
    <P>However, instead of moaning and groaning about problems, attempts must be made to address them.  I ask the Minister to respond on the issue of the time scale for the development if it proceeds. Hopefully, matters will proceed relatively quickly and that he will continue to be Minister for Defence and the Marine when they do so.  Hopefully, also the Minister will ensure that the rights of the commercial and leisure users are protected.</P>
    <P>There is a planning and an appeals process to which the Minister and his Department are subject, no more or no less than anybody else.  However, it is time to be more positive with regard to Dún Laoghaire.  There has been too much negative talk for too long, and hopefully it will be possible to proceed with the development from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to those who contributed to this very important debate, which addresses the future of car ferries in this country, not only in Dún Laoghaire but in Dublin Port, Rosslare, Cork and so on.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave has a family tradition associated with Dún Laoghaire going back many years.  His contribution reflects the support for this project in the greater Dún Laoghaire area.  I appreciate his contribution all the more for that.  He knows what he is talking about.</P>
      <P>Regarding the matter of time scale, it is hoped that the project will be completed in May or June 1995, certainly not later than June 1995.  However, this is subject to planning permission.  Given that An Bord Pleanála will decide the issue one way or the other on 23 July 1994, and assuming that the board is positive, work will progress immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doubtless the people represented by Senator Henry will seek judicial review of the board's decision if it is positive, which will constitute another effort by <Col N="1909" /> them to stop the project.  I make no complaint on that.  Senator Henry is entitled to her view and is entitled to represent and be briefed by the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Action Group.  That is part of our democratic process.  I have responded in my address to the view she expressed on behalf of the group and I do not intend to waste any further time on them.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to progress the project as a matter of some urgency, despite the many representations and misrepresentations made in the context of traffic and traffic usage.  I have already set out in my address to the House, and it has been made clear to the Dáil, what is anticipated in terms of traffic, this year, next year and for the next ten years. Concern has been expressed that up to 150,000 trucks a year will come to Dún Laoghaire.  Present traffic is approximately 33,000 units per annum, which is projected to increase to approximately 45,000 units a year over a ten year period. Total Ro-Ro traffic at present on the central corridor amounts to 155,000 units, but the vast bulk of this goes through Dublin Port.  This position will not change, especially given the proposed introduction of the new £45 million B&amp;I Line super ferry.</P>
    <P>The essence of the matter is to have Dublin Port with its super ferry in competition with Dún Laoghaire and its super ferry.  The end product of this is the paying customer who will get a good deal from two good operators, the B and I Line and Stena Sealink.</P>
    <P>Most of the objections from the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Action Group relate to traffic problems.  Senator Henry is entitled to her viewpoint and I would not wish to dismiss it or be discourteous about it.  However, she did not say one positive thing in favour of the development. It was all bad from beginning to end, which appears strange to me.  I believed that she might have put the case for and the against, or might even have said one positive thing about the development. However, she did not see fit to do so, which is her entitlement as she is <Col N="1910" /> representing the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Action Group in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>However, the residents of Dún Laoghaire are in favour of this project. This was shown in a recent radio programme when Mr. Joe Duffy visited Dún Laoghaire on behalf of Mr. Gay Byrne and there was a strong volume of support for the project across a broad spectrum, including the local hotel and bed and breakfast trade, Dún Laoghaire Chamber of Commerce, political parties and local people who want to see continuous employment in the community.</P>
    <P>I have addressed the main elements of the points of view expressed in this debate.  I want to thank Senator Brendan Daly who set out his support for the project in a very clear contribution supporting what is intended in this new car ferry terminal.  However, the suggestion that an organisation like Stena Sealink, as mentioned by Senator Henry, would not send this ship for sea trials flies in the face of the facts.  This new Stena high speed sea service ferry, which is still under construction, will have sea trials next Easter.  I am not an expert in these matters, but I presume that when you build a vessel you put it into the sea to make sure it does not sink before putting passengers aboard.  That would be my instinct, although I have no particular competence in the matter.  It is a matter of fact that there will be sea trials for this £65 million state of the art car ferry &mdash; the first of its kind in the world &mdash; which is coming to our country.</P>
    <P>The distinct advantage of employing such a vessel is that it accomodates the traffic throughput by providing frequent high-speed, moderate-capacity sailings. The HSS is capable of carrying 375 passenger car units while <i>Stena Hibernia</i>, the multi-purpose vessel operating through Dún Laoghaire Harbour at present, carries 323 PCUs.  Employment of the HSS on the route, therefore, will result in the discharge of a maximum of only 15 per cent extra PCUs onto the road network per sailing.  Future ferry schedules will be designed as at present to avoid the arrival of a vessel during the identified peak traffic hours for Dún Laoghaire, namely <Col N="1911" /> 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. The local authority applied a number of conditions to the grant of planning permission requiring the Minister to make a financial contribution towards the necessary improvements in the port access route to accommodate the extra traffic. These conditions will be complied with fully in the event that these conditions or similar ones are confirmed by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>To respond to Senator Henry's representation on behalf of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Action Group, the Stena HSS project represents a technological breakthrough in the field of large high-speed ferries.  Conventional ferries typically operate at 20 knots while the High-Speed Sea Service or HSS ferry will operate at 40 knots.  Small fast ferries such as the <i>Sea Cat,</i> currently in operation out of Dún Laoghaire, travel at 40 knots, but due to their small size they are sensitive to rough weather.  Stena claims that the HSS will be able to operate in rough weather conditions.  The HSS differs from conventional vessels in that it is of a twin-hull catamaran configuration and is powered by water jets rather than propellors.</P>
    <P>The HSS can carry approximately the same load as a conventional ferry, namely, 1,500 passengers and 375 cars. The vessels are 124 metres long with a 40-metre beam.  Stena has ordered two HSS craft at a cost of £65 million sterling each.  The craft are currently being constructed at Finnyards in Ruama, Finland. In July 1993 Stena Sealink announced that it had identified Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead as the route on which it wished to introduce the first HSS car ferry.  Sea trials are scheduled for Easter 1995.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton raised the road issue which I have addressed, in addition to the question of the unified car ferry terminals for Dún Laoghaire.  It is important to place on the record of the House the situation in that regard.  A consultancy study of the ferry terminal disposition in Dublin Bay completed in 1993 concluded, on the basis of the information then available, that there was no compelling <Col N="1912" /> case for a unified ferry terminal in Dublin Port.  Developments since the completion of that study, particularly in relation to fast ferries, have strengthened the position of Dún Laoghaire.  The harbour has significant operational advantages, for example, in time savings which would permit five round trips per day for the HSS on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route rather than four such trips per day from Dublin Port.  Dún Laoghaire also has other significant operational advantages &mdash; for example, the ease of access and safety that originally gave rise to Dún Laoghaire as the gateway to Dublin and have maintained it in that position.</P>
    <P>The closure of Dún Laoghaire Harbour would have a severe and significant impact on the local economy.  Direct job losses and significant damage to the substantial business and tourist sector, including the hotel and B&amp;B trade, across a broad spectrum would have a catastrophic effect on the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>Those points respond to the various matters raised by Senators Belton, Cosgrave, Henry and my colleague Senator Brendan Daly.</P>

I was not negative because the very first thing I said was that any development which would assist in making traffic across the Irish Sea quicker and more comfortable has to be welcomed.  I then went on to express my reservations regarding this development. <Col N="1913" /> I would not like the Minister to think that I am an entirely negative person, but in this situation it was as well that someone should put forward the points made regarding this development by a number of residents who, as the Minister knows, have great reservations.  The fact that five round trips will be available would not be considered an advantage by people living near the ferry who already have to cope with the effects of four round trips per day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important <Col N="1914" /> matter, which I understand was raised in the other House last night.  However, there may be an advance in what this particular Minister has to say, despite the fact that Deputy Howlin is a caring and sensitive Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>This matter arises because of a demonstration held outside the gates of Leinster House last night by a group of approximately 15 people in wheelchairs. Before I get into the substance of the issue, I pay compliment to the staff of the Oireachtas who made it possible for the entire group to attend the debate late last night in the Dáil Chamber.  It was greatly appreciated by these people, among whom were a number of individuals personally known to me, including a gifted student of English literature at Trinity College, Dublin, and a member of the Council of State.</P>
      <P>These people had the courage and determination to stay up all night, although they are confined to wheelchairs, in pursuit of what they see as their rights.  I remind the House that this Chamber was not properly accessible to wheelchairs until the nomination of Senator Brian Crowley, when things changed very rapidly in a positive direction.</P>
      <P>This case involves the Irish Centre for Independent Living.  As the Minister is aware, this group has been established for about a year with Horizon funding from the EU.  It enables people with disability, particularly those confined to wheelchairs with serious physical incapacities, to take part in the life of the community, principally by providing them with personal assistants.  I was reprimanded by some of the people outside the gates last night for describing them as helpers.  They regarded that as patronising. They are personal assistants and there is an important and clear relationship between the persons in wheelchairs and their personal assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This allows the development of a new option because previously there were just two options for people in such situations. One was to stay full-time in a residential care setting and the other was to remain with their families in circumstances <Col N="1915" /> where perhaps family members who were carers grew older and less able to sustain the responsibility of looking after the disabled person.  The person consequently began to feel themselves a burden on that family.  The establishment of the Centre for Independent Living has enabled a third option to exist and allows people with disabilities to live in the community of their own choosing with the support of personal assistants.  This frees up the whole area of family relationships, places it on a more equal level and allows disabled people to participate fully in the life of the community.</P>
    <P>The Centre for Independent Living has completed the first year of its personal assistants programme for people with significant disabilities in Ireland.  Personal assistants facilitate individuals with disabilities in all aspects of daily living, whether it is personal care, meal preparation, mobility or assistance in the workplace.  Several of the people there last night told me how useful it was that the personal assistants called to the house, got them up, helped them in their toilet requirements, helped them to prepare meals, got them into the wheelchair, accompanied them to their place of work, allowed them to operate in the work environment, called for them in the evening, brought them home, prepared their meals, got them into bed and so on. They are able to participate fully in the productive life of the community in properly paid, meaningful jobs.</P>
    <P>This is not just something for the persons in wheelchairs.  It also offers a useful opportunity for the personal assistants, who are properly trained through the incare programme run in association with FAS and the NRB through the Horizon programme.  This has made an impact on both participants' lives; 30 people with significant disabilities have been inducted into the programme while 45 people are being trained under the personal assistants scheme.  Through this job experience they are also involved in approved City and Guilds training modules as personal assistants.  In other words, they are acquiring their own job skills and one hopes they will get long term employment as a result.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1916" /> The mature leaders, which is a designation indicating a person with a significant physical disability who requires a personal assistant, have just completed designing and devising a diploma in disability studies, independently living leadership and career development.  The Centre for Independent Living has just received confirmation of certification for this extra mural diploma from St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  They are currently processing applications for third level mainstream funding from the ESF for this training.  A significant level of academic recognition is coming now from Maynooth College and this is important.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland has the opportunity to be a type of world leader in this area.  The work that has been done over the last year with this pilot scheme has attracted a very high profile.  Working links have been established with groups in America, Denmark and the UK, including Scotland and Northern Ireland. I am sure the Minister will agree that it is a very good project, indicating cooperation between the two parts of this island.  Nothing could be more deserving of support and perhaps funding could be discovered through the American Ireland fund.  Perhaps some of the cross-Border co-operation schemes could be brought into operation in order to assist with financing.</P>
    <P>There have been requests from all over the country for information and advice on this programme.  I put it to the Minister that whereas there are now some 30 persons with disability and 45 personal assistants concentrated totally in Dublin, it would be a good thing if it could be extended throughout the entire country and available to people living in provincial and rural areas.  It should be so extended.  I understand from talking to my colleagues and friends at the gates last night that the total number of people who would benefit from this scheme is 250.  The Minister can do some costings on that.</P>
    <P>I understand the importance of cost effectiveness and return on investment in assessing the feasibility of such projects. However, when one takes into account a comparison of the cost of maintaining <Col N="1917" /> a disabled person in residential care as against the cost in accrued benefits &mdash; for example, the increase in personal control and quality of life of supporting a person with a disability in an independent living situation &mdash; the benefits are quite clear. We would also take a certain number of personal assistants off the live register and give them a possibility of positive creative involvement in a most helpful situation.</P>
    <P>An injection of £150,000 is required immediately.  This would carry the scheme forward until 31 December 1994. This money could and should be found. I am glad to say, having read and listened to reports of the debate in the other House last night, that the Minister for Health has indicated that money will be found from Rehab.  However, in a sense, that is just fire brigade action, transferring money from one charity to another. Consistent, continuous long term planning and funding is required.  This is a two year pilot programme, but it deserves this type of sustained planning and sustained finance in particular.  The Minister indicated last night that the shortfall of £120,000 arose because the centre took on commitments which it was not in a position to finance.  However, more power to them.  I am glad they did that because by taking on those commitments they enabled a number of extra people with disabilities to play their role fully as members of our society.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will find it possible to provide sufficient funding.  The situation is rather similar to that which existed for many years with the Rape Crisis Centre, counselling units and sexual assault units.  These matters are allowed to limp on, but eventually funding is provided. I hope this funding will be given. I believe we owe it to persons of such courage and dignity as we saw last night. I understand the requirement to monitor, examine and carry out a cost effectiveness evaluation.  I understand that as part of the Horizon scheme such an evaluation will be made.  I have every confidence that if the kind of criteria I have outlined are brought into play, it will be clearly demonstrated that such a <Col N="1918" /> scheme is cost effective and worthy of the support I hope and believe the Minister will indicate he is prepared to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deputising for the Minister for Social Welfare.  The Minister has followed with great interest the work of the Centre for Independent Living since its establishment in 1992, in particular the INCARE action &mdash; research programme.  The INCARE programme is a two year pilot programme funded principally by the EU Horizon programme, a Social Fund initiative designed to provide for the training needs of disabled and other disadvantaged people.  The programme involves training personal assistants to facilitate individuals with disabilities to live independent lives outside institutions.  The programme will be evaluated on completion as with all EU funded programmes.</P>
      <P>Central to the programme is personal care attendance, that is, the provision of a personal care attendant who helps the disabled person to carry out the various functions he or she would be unable to perform alone.  The disabled person, or user, also receives training in self-confidence, assertiveness and employer abilities so that the maximum mutual benefit may be derived from the partnership between user and assistant.</P>
      <P>Some 30 people with disabilities and some 55 non-disabled individuals received training in all aspects of personal assistance management under the programme. In most cases the personal assistant had been in receipt of unemployment assistance prior to joining the programme.  The Minister was pleased to be in a position to assist the project through two special allocations of £50,000 during 1993 under his Department's scheme of grants to voluntary organisations.  It is certainly in all our interests that the programme be completed in order that all of the lessons can be drawn out and that the policy implications for the future provision of health services for people with disabilities can be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On becoming aware of the funding difficulties currently faced by the centre, <Col N="1919" /> the Minister arranged for officials of his Department to visit the centre last week to ascertain the extent and exact nature of the current situation.  The Minister for Health also arranged a meeting between an officer of his Department, the Eastern Health Board and the centre.  On foot of this meeting, further detailed financial information is being requested by the Department of Health, particularly in relation to the management and administration expenses incurred by the centre. When those deliberations are completed, I am sure that Senator Norris will see further action in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his gracious reply.  I would be a little concerned if there was an implicit feeling that management were in some way lax and that this was a bad expenditure.  I do not believe this is the case.  I was contacted a year ago by Liam Ó Maonlaí, who asked if I would help in fund raising, and I committed myself to do so.  I will be doing a show for the centre, which will raise a few thousand pounds.  I believe many people in Irish entertainment will honour the commitments they have made to help to raise money in addition to that which the Government is prepared to give.  I welcome the positive assurances of the Minister this evening.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter of the need for the Minister for Justice to review the application for citizenship of a person of Irish extraction from South Africa and that the review be carried out with a view to issuing the applicant with an Irish passport. I am a little disappointed that the senior Minister is not here for this important debate.  In saying so, I do not wish to downgrade the Minster for State.  He knows I have the greatest respect for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> I have no intention of being controversial with regard to this issue.  As we all know, the political situation in South Africa has changed utterly since the elections this year.  White people are now living in a completely different milieu from that to which they were used.  Many of them are afraid that the new terms of reference which define their citizenship may threaten their very existence. Moving from a position of racial superiority to equality is very difficult for many of the white population to handle.  They feel threatened and insecure.  Many find it difficult to relate to the new state.  My information is that there is a small number of people there of Irish extraction. Some of them, in the interests of their future security, have been actively seeking Irish citizenship.  The case I am discussing is an example.</P>
    <P>I have discovered a wonderful romantic story which began in Capetown University and ended in, of all places, an old graveyard in Clones, County Monaghan. Mr. X and Ms Y became friends while they both attended this university.  They fell in love and eventually married.  X decided to trace his roots and discovered that his great-grandfather was born in Clones.  As a result, his father was able to obtain an Irish passport and did so. When X discovered exactly who he was, his wife became curious about her roots. Research followed and there emerged an incredible result.  Y's great-grandmother was also born in Clones.  It would seem that, being contemporaries, the great-grandparents probably grew up together before separately emigrating to South Africa, where they lived unconnected lives.  Members would agree that this is an extraordinary story.</P>
    <P>On my advice, Mr. X made an application for Irish citizenship through the consular office in Johannesburg on 29 September 1993.  The application would have been handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs under the foreign births register.  Without the exercise of ministerial discretion, it failed.  Mr. X corresponded with the Department of Justice in an effort to get the Minister for Justice to use her powers of discretion to offer him an Irish passport.  I have copies <Col N="1921" /> of the correspondence between him and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The first correspondence I have is addressed to the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan Quinn, and is dated 1 October 1993.  On 6 October 1993 a letter was sent from the Office of the Minister acknowledging receipt of the letter and stating that it was receiving attention. On 13 October 1993 a further letter was issued to him and was exactly of the same nature as the previous one.  On 12 November 1993 a letter was sent to him from the consulate in Johannesburg.  This pointed out that because he did not come within the terms of the legislation, he was not entitled to a passport under that legislation.  The consular office pointed out that he could directly petition the Minister for Justice for naturalisation.  He did this on 22 November 1993, giving full details of his case.  On 2 December 1993 the Office of the Minister for Justice, in the person of the Minister's private secretary, wrote to him stating that the Minister acknowledged receipt of the further letter and that it was receiving attention. No further correspondence has issued in the meantime.  The Minister has paid no attention to the request this individual made.</P>
    <P>I have resisted the temptation to become political about this matter.  We have had enough controversy about passports recently and I do not intend to engage in any such controversy. However, I want to cite the recent case where the Minister used her powers of discretion to offer citizenship to an Arab woman and her son.  Given the background to that case, I ask the Minister to exercise her powers of discretion by offering a passport to this applicant and I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The law concerning the acquisition of Irish citizenship is set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956-94.  Persons of Irish descent born abroad may become Irish citizens by registration in circumstances set out in that legislation.  These Acts allow a person born outside Ireland to register as an Irish citizen in certain circumstances. <Col N="1922" /> Citizenship is obtained by registering the applicant's birth with the Department of Foreign Affairs or with diplomatic missions and consular offices abroad.</P>
      <P>Under the 1956 Act, the right to citizenship by descent was very wide.  The 1986 Act tightened up the provisions to provide that a fourth generation applicant &mdash; that is, a person with a great grandparent born in Ireland &mdash; can be registered only if the parent through whom he or she is claiming Irish descent was already registered at the time of his or her birth.</P>
      <P>In the case raised by the Senator, I am informed that the person in question raised the issue of citizenship with our Honorary Consul in Johannesburg last September.  I am aware that Senator Cotter wrote to the consul with a request that the person be allowed to complete the relevant application forms for citizenship. The appropriate form with regard to registration was completed. The outcome was that the applicant was informed that he was ineligible under the relevant provisions of the legislation, primarily because the parent through whom he was claiming citizenship was not an Irish citizen at the time of the applicant's birth.</P>
      <P>At that time, a question was raised with the consul about the Minister for Justice using her discretionary powers with regard to naturalisation.  The person in question wrote to the Minister generally about citizenship.  However, no application form in relation to naturalisation was received by the Department of Justice.</P>

    <P>It may be that an assumption was made that, in referring to the discretionary powers of the Minister for Justice regarding naturalisation while applying for citizenship by registration, the applicant considered that he was effectively applying for naturalisation also.  However, the law provides that an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation is required to make a written application on a prescribed form which includes a statutory declaration made by the applicant in support of the application before a notary public, commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner.  It is, of course, open to <Col N="1923" /> any interested person to make such an application and, if the Senator so wishes, I can ask the Department of Justice to provide him, or the person in question directly, with the relevant forms.</P>
    <P>However, without prejudging the application, I would make the point that, in general, naturalisation is the most common method for a non-national residing in Ireland to obtain citizenship. An applicant is required to satisfy a number of conditions, including a period of five years residency in the nine years proceeding the application, with the last year being one of continuous residence. An applicant is also expected to have his or her usual residence in the State after becoming a citizen.  The Minister of Justice has power to dispense with the conditions in whole or part in circumstances which are defined by law, but the point I am emphasising is that naturalisation is generally a route towards citizenship for persons who are resident in the State.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I want to put a few questions to him.  I want to know why the person who petitioned the Minister on 22 November 1993 was not informed of those particular issues.  The Minister acknowledged the letter and left it at that.  It is disgraceful that the individual was not so informed. The application was received by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Surely, the Minister could have contacted the Department for details and contacted the individual again.  I am disappointed that the Minister has treated somebody with Irish roots &mdash; although they are distant &mdash; in such a way and I hope it never happens again.  No attempt was made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know the answer because there is incompetence somewhere. <Col N="1924" /> I have here all of the correspondence relating to this matter &mdash; names, dates and everything else.  I want the Minister to tell me why there was so much incompetence that office when dealing with this correspondence.</P>

      <P>The Senator was allowed to raise the matter on the Adjournment; the Minister replied and the Senator asked a question or two.  I regret to have to say that the matter ends there.  I am sure the Senator has other ways of raising the matter.</P>

      <P>I will just make an observation. Senator Cotter emphasised two or three times that he did not want to make a political issue out of this.  If he is really interested in the person whose case he is bringing and wants him to be helped, I have pointed out to him how to do it. Let us forget about the past and concentrate on getting this matter resolved.</P>
