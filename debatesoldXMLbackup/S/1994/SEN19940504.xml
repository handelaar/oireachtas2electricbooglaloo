      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to clarify the international status of &ldquo;Winrho&rdquo;, the anti D immunoglobulin recently introduced to Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the serious financial situation applying in the Lough Swilly Company in County Donegal and the threat to the 90 jobs, the need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to intervene in this serious matter to either give a subsidy to this company or to initiate talks with Iarnród Éireann to guarantee the <Col N="526" /> future of the services to the rural and urban areas of County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Henry as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Maloney as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993, between now and 6 p.m., Item 2, Order for Second Stage of the Protection of Occupiers of Land Bill, 1994, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot agree to the Order of Business today for a reason which all Members of the House will appreciate.  There are 36 Government amendments to this legislation which has 56 sections.  These amendments were only received by our spokesperson at 2 o'clock today.  That is not the fault of the Seanad office, which only received them yesterday evening, but of the Department. Departments cannot treat this House with contempt, as it is doing in this matter.  Some 36 amendments were submitted last night.  The Department of Justice has had ample notice of this important legislation, but our spokesperson received the amendments at 2 o'clock today.  I would prefer to do no work on this Bill this afternoon and to do something else instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair or right to ask Opposition spokespersons or Government backbenchers to deal with 36 new amendments <Col N="527" /> which arrived 30 minutes before the House was due to sit.  The Department concerned should be told this is unacceptable.  It should be given a flea in the ear by the House and told to treat it with manners in future.  We cannot agree to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party and I am sure with the agreement of the House, may I send our best wishes to the new democracy in South Africa after the successful, if spectacular, election process over the past few days.  We pay tribute to our suntanned colleagues who have returned after playing a small part in helping this exercise.  It is a matter of great sadness that a couple of hundred miles north of South Africa in Rwanda the barbaric slaughtering of people continues and the world is helpless or unwilling to get involved or to do anything to stop this slaughter.</P>
    <P>On the question of slaughter, this has become almost routine at this stage but not routine for the widow and five children of the Protestant man shot dead last night by the INLA in a brutal obscene fashion and for no other reason than that he was a Protestant.  We all despair in our weekly condemnations of the litany of terror and violence in Northern Ireland.  Again, lest we forget or become complacent, another person, a decent honest father of five, has been shot dead by these pathological murderers because he was a Protestant. We must send out our condemnation and sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning in his opposition to the Order of Business as presented &mdash; that we discuss the Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.  I made this point on several occasions and it looks as if I will have to continue to make it.  There appears to be a growing contempt for democracy in this country.  We have come to a sorry stage if Departments cannot take account of the workings of a sovereign parliament. Increasingly the Executive decides what should be before us and we merely assent to it.  That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> Our record in this House &mdash; I am sure the Cathaoirleach will agree &mdash; is of giving careful consideration to Bills and contributing to them in a balanced way but we cannot do this work effectively if business is ordered in this way.  I oppose the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>As regards South Africa, I share in the good wishes to the new Administration. I thank our colleagues for the work they have done in monitoring the elections. The elections appear to have been free and fair and I am sure our colleagues will bear that out.  In a large country it is difficult to do everything properly, but for a first effort it was magnificent.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach will write to our colleagues in South Africa to send the good wishes of Seanad Éireann to the new democracy and its leaders.</P>
    <P>We should also refer to the situation in Palestine and the Occupied Territories where transition is taking place and policing is being handed over to the Palestinians. Perhaps there are lessons for us in what is happening in these places.  We should again endorse the condemnation of the ongoing tit-for-tat violence in the North.  Although we may grow weary of condemning these incidents, we must continue to hope that we will shortly have peace in that part of the island.</P>
    <P>I was not here last week but I would like to join in the good wishes to Senator Hillery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate Senator Hillery.  I would also like to raise the question of the continuation of violence in Northern Ireland.  I raised this subject in the House many times very briefly and I get mail which is very nasty and unhelpful.  There are people out there who are not fit to live in a civilised society and the mail points that out.  I live very close to the North and I want to tell the House that the British would not keep an army in the North for one day if we could reach a settlement.  The only people preventing that from being accepted by the vast majority of the people, North and South, are the Provisional IRA.  It has to be said as many times as is necessary for them to get the <Col N="529" /> message loud and clear.  They are the only people who are preventing a settlement being reached.</P>
      <P>Many of our problems, such as unemployment, could be solved if we reached an understanding with the British.  The Downing Street Declaration is on the table and the IRA should be told to accept it because they will lose out long term.  It must be said in this House and on every platform that the people in the North of Ireland are sick of being held to ransom by the Provisional IRA who represent nobody.</P>

      <P>I call Senator Norris.  If possible I ask you not to make a speech on the Order of Business.  Your question to the Leader please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try not to make a speech, a Chathaoirligh.  You know me and my limited vocabulary and my restraint which I continually exercise in the House.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning and Senator Dardis in their protest about the way in which the Criminal Justice Bill has been handled.  It is some time since we debated Second Stage.  There was plenty of time for the Department concerned to put their amendments in order.  We have a considerable number of carefully phrased amendments in the name of Senator Neville, for example and if he could do it I do not see why the Department could not do it.  It appears that once again this House is being regarded as nothing more than a rubber stamp, we really do not matter and our debate is of no consequence. It is not possible to discuss amendments properly when we have only had them in our hands for about ten minutes or so.  It makes a farce of the whole exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also join in the condemnation of the killing by the INLA of a man accompanied by his wife yesterday evening.  These things happen so regularly now that language becomes redundant. I find the attempt retrospectively to justify this kind of thing by describing these people as legitimate targets by suggesting some connection with the defence <Col N="530" /> forces to be grossly offensive.  This is outrageous.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the situation in South Africa.  Senator Gordon Wilson and Senator Shane Ross represented the Seanad supervising the elections.  Perhaps some provision could be made for them to make a full report.  Perhaps the Leader would respond to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add to what Senator Manning, Senator Dardis and others have said about the late arrival of the amendments.  I am expected to deal with these amendments and it is an impossible task.  I have not had an opportunity to read them.  I learned of them at our group meeting at 2.15 p.m.  I have an impossible task.  I am expected to deal objectively, fairly and comprehensively with these amendments by virtue of my position.  I am not in a position to do so without proper study of them.  What I have been asked to do is very unfair.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I ask the Leader of the House when it is planned to introduce Item 6, the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1993.  That is the Alan Shatter Bill which has been passed in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to those sending our best wishes to the people of South Africa and also in congratulating those who went out as observers and supervisors of the election. The news from KwaZulu and Natal today emphasises the great importance of having these elections supervised fairly and openly, because it was essential that it should be seen to be fairly conducted. The part Members of the Houses played in that is significant and we should congratulate them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to go to South Africa; it was an experience I shall never forget.  I was heartened and delighted to be there and I can honestly say that South Africa is on its way to peace.  There will be bumps and bangs and some killings perhaps, but it is on its way.  I am all the more saddened seeing a country as vast as South Africa, with its history and its thousands of dead, that in a little garden of earth called Northern Ireland we cannot seem to find the way to peace.  I ask this House to go on saying and doing something about Northern Ireland because the violence is continuing.  I ask the Leader to provide <Col N="532" /> time at the earliest opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators have rightly said, it is important that we condemn out of hand what is happening just a few miles away as evidenced by yesterday's pointless murder.  We will have a further debate on Northern Ireland quite soon. With regard to South Africa the House congratulates all concerned and we thank all our colleagues who were there to ensure that there was a fair and free election.  We wish the South Africans every success in the future.</P>
      <P>Item 6 will be dealt with within the next two weeks.  RTE are often criticised but I would like to record our congratulations for the excellent production they staged last Saturday night.</P>

      <P>Amendment Nos. 1 and 19 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`Combat Drugs Fund' means a fund established under the terms of this Act for the allocation of certain moneys raised under the Act to organisations or groups working to combat the medical or social effects of drug abuse;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I did not receive a copy of the amendments until 2 p.m. today.  We made this point on the Order of Business but I wish to make it personally to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes the establishment of a combat drugs fund to allocate certain moneys raised under the Act to organisations or groups working to combat the medical or social effects of drugs.  The purpose of the amendment is to direct the moneys raised through the confiscation of assets to medical areas so that there are funds available for people who have suffered from drug related conditions, to assist research into drugs and ensure that assistance is given to the families of those affected by the drugs culture and the work of drug barons and those who bring drugs into the country, which cause extreme stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the intention behind the amendment. Senator Neville is attempting to make the punishment fit the crime.  Redistributing the money which the authorities confiscate from people who engage in this obnoxious trade to the community which has been damaged by it is sensible.  I will listen with interest to what the Minister says.  I am sure she will have a sympathetic <Col N="534" /> approach.  The amendment itself seems to be more a definition of such a fund than something which actually enables the establishment of one.  I am not sure whether it legally empowers the Minister as it stands.  I seek to be informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 which is being discussed with this amendment clarifies our approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The second of these amendments raises a very specific point in relation to actions for compensation.  The amendments essentially relate to what should be done with the proceeds of confiscation orders.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that proceeds of crime confiscated under this Bill should be earmarked for a specific purpose in the drugs rehabilitation area was first raised in the other House and I was very attracted to it.  However, at the same time I mentioned that it should not be forgotten that under the Bill the proceeds will go to the Exchequer which funds our health services and the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>While I continue to appreciate the thinking behind the amendments, the position is that I specifically raised the question of applying the proceeds of confiscation orders directly for drug related projects or other specific projects with the Minister for Finance.  He informed me that he would be opposed to any such proposal.  His reasons for adopting that view are not related to the merits of what is being proposed in the sense of the worthiness of the type of expenditure being proposed.  However, he has said that as a matter of general policy, any proposal to create a fund or other mechanism whereby money which accrues to the State could be expended in any other way than by way of the Estimates which are approved by Dáil Éireann could not be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also pointed out that any departure from the normal Estimates procedures would create difficulties from the point of view of accountability and would undoubtedly be of concern to the <Col N="535" /> Comptroller and Auditor General. While, as I have indicated, I had a certain sympathy for these amendments, the reality is that in the light of the views which have been expressed by the Minister for Finance I could not accept them.</P>
    <P>The remaining part of Senator Neville's amendment No. 19 raises a separate issue in relation to a court directing that money paid under a confiscation order be paid into court in connection with legal proceedings which a victim may have initiated and the use of such moneys to satisfy such judgment or order as the victim may obtain.  I have examined this matter and I believe it is already covered insofar as it would be practicable to do so under the existing provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should first make the distinction between a civil suit for compensation where victims on their own initiative take separate proceedings for compensation and compensation payable under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993.  Under the 1993 Act, a court on conviction of any person of an offence may make an order requiring that person to pay compensation to any person who has suffered injury or loss as a result of the offence. One of the purposes of making such a provision in the 1993 Act was to remove the need for victims of crime to have to take civil proceedings in order to secure compensation from an offender.</P>
    <P>A compensation order under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, would normally be made at the time of sentencing. Confiscation proceedings arise after sentencing and are separate proceedings. Under section 10 (3) (b) of the present Bill it is provided that before a court makes a confiscation order it must take account of any order, including a court order, involving any payment by the defendant.  This would mean that in assessing the amount of realisable property of a defendant, a deduction would be made in respect of a compensation order which had been made under the 1993 Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to pending civil actions for compensation, section 10 (1) provides <Col N="536" /> that when considering whether to make a confiscation order the court may take into account any information placed before it showing that a victim of an offence to which the proceedings relate has instituted or intends to institute civil proceedings against the defendant in respect of loss, injury or damages sustained in connection with the offence. That provision will ensure that the interests of parties who initiate civil proceedings against offenders are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>In his amendment Senator Neville has proposed that we should allow the proceeds of confiscation orders to be available for the satisfaction of civil judgments obtained at any stage by victims.  This would, in effect, mean that confiscated proceeds could be tied up indefinitely because of the possibility that a claim might be made against them in relation to a civil action taken against the offender.  In my view this would not be a realistic course to follow and I could not accept it.  As I have indicated, section 10 of the Bill already provides substantial protection from the effects of a confiscation order for compensation payments which may be due to the victims of crime whether they arise under compensation orders made under the 1993 Criminal Justice Act or out of civil proceedings initiated by a victim.  I consider that the provision we have made in this area in the Bill goes as far as it would be practicable to go and accordingly I would not be prepared to accept the Senator's proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister cannot accept our amendments. It is important that if funds are coming from the area they should be allocated to solve the extreme social and health problems that drugs and their illegal importation are causing.  Could the Minister even look at setting up advisory clinics for drug addicts as well as providing moneys for research into drugs?  Because of the level of drug smuggling and drug trading, substantial funds will be provided when the Bill becomes operational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> I can relate this to the roads fund which we debated already.  Almost none of the motor car taxation collected remains in the area in which it is collected because it goes into central funds.  It can be said that the money confiscated in the case of drugs, comes from a questionable source but, because it is coming from that area, it should be ploughed back to assist drug abusers and their families.  Whether that is done in the way I have suggested or through clinical research, the money should not be lost in the Department of Finance.  It should be used to solve the drugs problem, perhaps by assisting the Garda Drug Squad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to accept what the Minister says because once the Minister for Finance has set his face against it, that, effectively, is it; in practical terms the amendment is gone.  Senator Neville's analogy with the road fund is well made. It is a grievance that has long been felt in this country because people pay motor tax which disappears into the Central Exchequer and they do not feel that they get their money's worth.</P>
      <P>I would like to throw in the question of what constitutes a victim.  I presume people are principally regarded as victims if they have been the victim of violent crime, mugging and robbery related to drugs, but I think it would be quite difficult to tie it in with a specific drugs baron; or maybe it would not, I do not know.  What interests me is the class of victim.  I am thinking of people who have been deliberately introduced to hard drugs by these criminals.  They seem to be real victims and I would like to know &mdash; and perhaps the Minister or her advisers would tell me &mdash; whether they would have the status in law of a victim that would enable them to take action as a result of acquiring the addictive habit or damaging their health through acquiring the HIV infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the week I read a horrifying story in the newspaper about an inner city drugs baron.  I think I know the party referred to although I do not know the person personally.  This person does not take drugs himself but, ironically, <Col N="538" /> engages in sporting activities with young people in the north inner city and has a whiter than white lifestyle.  I understand that some of these people have now taken to giving heroin free to young people. Their addiction in many cases in the north inner city leads to the acquisition not only of a drug habit but also a virus which is almost always fatal.  A person placed in that situation by these wicked people should have the opportunity to strike back at them by seeking compensation through the courts.</P>

      <P>It would be nice to make funds available for victims who are caught in this vulnerable situation. However, there are many groups in the inner city areas who are helping to deal with this problem.  They are receiving funds from the national lottery, the Department of Education and the Department of Health and that money is allocated through the Department of Finance.  While I agree with Senator Neville's intention, the money is already allocated.</P>

      <P>Theoretically it would be possible for a person who was introduced to hard drugs and who became a victim, as has been outlined by Senator Norris, to take a case against the person who supplied him or her.  It would be a matter for the courts to decide whether that person was a victim.  It probably would be difficult because the pusher or drug baron could claim that the person took the heroin voluntarily.  It would be a difficult case to prove.  They are not the type of victims envisaged; the Senator was correct in his first definition of the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Senator Neville's proposal regarding advisory clinics and so forth, I have long held the opinion that we must hold a public health and education campaign about drugs and drug <Col N="539" /> abuse similar to that which was so successful in educating the public about smoking and its harmful effects.  I have had discussions with my colleagues in the Department of Education and the Department of Health to formulate a programme which would have the same visibility as the anti-smoking programme. It should show the evils and results of drug abuse and soft drugs being made attractive to young people.  It should also show the hardship, heartbreak, health hazards and fatalities that occur as a result of drug abuse.  We need co-operation from both Departments.  We have an advisory committee which has made a number of proposals in this area.  I would support such a programme.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris is correct in saying that when the Minister for Finance decided against the proposal, which was initially made in the Lower House and has now been made in the Seanad, there was no way I could pursue it further although I would have favoured it.  The Minister for Finance probably believes that if he gave in on this issue an analogous situation would arise where money taken in by a county in road tax would be demanded for investment in roads.</P>

It is one of the most vile things I have heard in a long time.  I also read the report mentioned by Senator Norris and it sickened me.  We should act immediately against such people.  I urge the Minister to root those people out and deal <Col N="540" /> with them in the most severe way possible.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Justice I accept responsibility for the fact that these amendments did not arrive until shortly before the debate began.  I regret that as do all Members on the Government side.  It was not possible to bring them here earlier due to difficulties we experienced.  Those difficulties were not within my Department but I am the Minister and so must take responsibility for the late arrival of these amendments.</P>
      <P>All the Government amendments have in one way or another arisen in response to the vigorous debate on this Bill in the Select Committee of the other House. Various proposals were made by Deputies and I undertook to examine them seriously with the parliamentary draughtsman before coming to Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad. The amendments propose stiffer penalties and stronger action against people involved in drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 and its related amendments are designed to supplement and strengthen the confiscation provisions of the Bill insofar as they apply to drug trafficking.  The main amendments are Nos. 4 and 5; the other amendments deal with various issues which follow from them.  The provisions of amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are extremely severe in that they allow the DPP to reopen an issue which has already been before a court.  This will only arise where the DPP can produce evidence not previously considered by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> We must also remember this involves depriving persons convicted of the evil trade of drug trafficking of their illgotten gains.  I listened carefully to the contributions made in this House on the Bill and I believe there is the widest possible support among Senators for measures which will have the effect of ensuring that wherever possible, drug traffickers are not allowed to hold on to their illegal profits.  In that context I considered whether further measures could be included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be unacceptable that a trafficker who has managed to conceal all or part of his or her proceeds should be able to avoid the making of a confiscation order or an increase in the amount of a confiscation order where additional information as to the whereabouts of concealed proceeds becomes available to the DPP.  This is the situation which is being addressed in the amendments and I hope they may prove acceptable to the House.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 comprise two new sections which will be included in the Bill in relation to the making of confiscation orders against persons convicted of drug trafficking.  Where a court which has previously determined that a person who was convicted of drug trafficking has not benefited therefrom, the first of these sections provides a procedure whereby the DPP can request the court to reassess that determination where he provides new evidence which was not considered by the court when it made its original determination.  If the court is satisfied on the basis of the new evidence that the defendant did in fact benefit from drug trafficking, it will be required to assess that benefit and make a confiscation order for the appropriate amount.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that payments received by the defendant after the date on which the court originally concluded he or she received no drugs benefit can be taken into account under the section. However the DPP will not be entitled to rely on the assumptions provided for in section 5 in relation to such payments. Also, the power to seek a reassessment under the section will only be available <Col N="543" /> to the DPP during the period of six years after the defendant was convicted.</P>
    <P>The second of the new sections is provided for in amendment No. 8.  On the basis that a person convicted of drug trafficking received a certain amount of benefit from that activity, it enables the DPP to apply to a court which has made a confiscation order against that person to revise the confiscation order based on additional information provided by the DPP which satisfies the court that the person's benefit from drug trafficking was under-estimated when the confiscation order was made.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the proposed section 7, the court will be entitled to have regard to payments received by the defendant since the earlier determination of his or her proceeds were made, but the section 5 assumptions will not apply in that regard.  Similarly, a six year time limit will apply to the DPP in seeking the revision of a confiscation order.  Amendments Nos. 2, 7, 11, 17, 20 and 23 are consequential on amendments Nos. 4 and 5, which are concerned with the changes required in the light of the insertion of the proposed new sections in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex change and I am disappointed I cannot respond. However, we will consider this change on Report Stage.  The Minister is introducing a facility whereby, if a person's benefit from the proceeds of crime has been under-calculated up to a period of six years, the situation may be reviewed. The reviewed figure or the balance between what has already been confiscated and the reviewed figure can then be confiscated.  There could be several confiscations of proceeds of crime during the six year period after a person has been convicted.  Is that a reasonable summary of the amendments before the House?  I cannot comment in detail because I only received the amendments at 2.15 p.m. for a debate at 2.30 p.m.</P>

Now that I have formally moved the amendment and explained what it proposes to do, I am prepared, as a gesture to Senator Neville and to the other spokespersons, including the spokesperson from my own side of the House, not to put the amendment until Report Stage.  That would give us a break between Committee Stage and Report Stage and allow the spokespersons an opportunity to consider the amendments in greater detail.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 4 (but in Part I), to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PART II</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.&mdash;The Minister is hereby authorised to create, by ministerial order, a Drugs Enforcement Agency which shall have responsibility for co-ordinating Government activities in combating drug trafficking and in promoting and assisting greater international co-operation in <Col N="545" /> relation to criminal law enforcement procedures related to drugs offences, such body to involve the Garda Síochána, the Customs and Excise, the Defence Forces, the Department of Health and other agencies as the Minister deems fit. The Drugs Enforcement Agency will have a maximum of 15 members and will come into existence by ministerial order following the publication of regulations to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to create a drugs enforcement agency which will enable the authorities to pursue drug barons to the countries which continue to export illegal drugs to Ireland.  Some countries export more illegal drugs than legitimate goods as part of their GNP.  Some are wealthy and use their drugs to purchase arms.  The European Union should not continue to trade for their legitimate products and turn a blind eye to the export of illegal drugs; if it does, it will mean that it does not care about the effects of such drug trading.  As a member of the European Union we must use our influence to change the Union's attitude to the present situation.  As a nation we should promote a European drugs enforcement agency which would cooperate with the US Drugs Enforcement Agency and similar bodies around the world.  We know the source of the drugs problem and we should deal with it.</P>
    <P>We have seen the problems caused by drug trafficking in the confiscations which have taken place off the south-west coast of Ireland.  It is frightening to dwell on the level of confiscations which are regarded as a small fraction of the total amount of drug trafficking and drug smuggling taking place off the south-west coast.</P>
    <P>The drugs enforcement agency should be an advisory body to the Government when it comes to control of the drugs problem.  It should be available to a cross section of Departments, including the Department of Health and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We hinted at <Col N="546" /> this earlier when we discussed the first amendment in relation to the combat drugs fund.  Such a fund might be made available if the Minister was in a position to take such a move, but, as she has already stated, she is not.  Moneys should be available to set up a drugs enforcement agency and part of its role would be as an advisory body to the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>We must take drug trafficking seriously and structures, such as I have outlined, must be set up to control the situation which has developed into epidemic proportions. It is impossible to calculate the cost of drugs control to the State.  Unless we get to the source of the problem, we are wasting our time.  Measures taken in the area of drugs control and the elimination of drug trafficking have failed. The drugs problem is increasing, but this amendment will make a real effort to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say there is some confusion as to whether we should have a drugs enforcement agency. Different people have different views about the role of such an agency.  For example, the US Drugs Enforcement Agency is used on a regular basis when people make representations to me.  It is a major organisation and its personnel have a specific operational role.  I seriously considered the possibility of setting up a drugs enforcement agency here after I paid a visit to the south-west last year.  I received considerable representations from Members of this House and the public about what was perceived to be the lack of co-operation between the three agencies involved &mdash; the Garda, the Customs and Excise and the Naval Service.  I also availed of the opportunity to meet representatives of the US Drugs Enforcement Agency who recently visited this country.  We discussed in detail the reasons it was originally set up, its operational role and how we might learn from what it was doing in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of positive things going for us, including the fact that we <Col N="547" /> have a single police force under a single command.  We would like to preserve this because we do not want a situation like that which exists in some European countries or in the United States where there are state police, federal police, municipal police and so on.  In the US a different section of the police force deals with a single area of operations, but there is a considerable lack of co-operation and a lot of jealousy and competitiveness.  I do not want to bring the Garda, the Customs and Excise or the Naval Service down that road because it would not benefit anyone.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville's amendment takes a different approach to that type of drugs enforcement agency.  He suggests a co-ordinating body with a maximum of 15 members, made up of the Garda and other specified bodies.  That is different to the US Drugs Enforcement Agency whose personnel is involved in a direct operational role.  It would be more appropriate to refer to the type of body Senator Neville proposes as a co-ordinating or a liaison committee rather than an enforcement agency.  Having regard to the limited type of agency Senator Neville proposes, I am not in a position to accept the amendment, not least because there is no legislation necessary or no amendment to the legislation necessary to establish the type of group he has in mind.</P>
    <P>I hope it is clear from what I have said that Senator Neville and I and Members of this and the other House share the same objective.  We want to secure the best arrangements possible for safeguarding our coast and country from the problems and detrimental effects of drug trafficking.  That is a matter which has been of concern to me since becoming Minister for Justice.  As I said, I visited the south-west and spoke to the three agencies involved, the Customs and Excise, the Garda Síochána and the Naval Service.  We have the highest level of co-operation at senior level between the Garda Commissioner, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Defence.  However, we need the same level of co-operation at <Col N="548" /> operational level on the ground where the immediate decisions are taken.  We must realise that Customs and Excise must enforce one aspect while the Garda Síochána has a different role.  The role of the Customs and Excise is to seize drugs and once that is done, its role is complete. The Garda Síochána on the other hand, is anxious &mdash; I am sure it has support in this and the other House &mdash; to get the drug traffickers and the drug barons who are bringing this misery into this country. It believes that if it can get these people out of circulation, it will have done a substantial job on behalf of the people. I, and Members of the House, support them in that regard.  The Naval Service provides support and backup for both agencies.</P>
    <P>We need a comprehensive system of liaison between the three groups.  We must have high level co-operation between them at operation level.  I want the three groups to achieve a cohesive and co-ordinated response to this scourge.  We do not want this country to be a soft target.  We are putting in place legislation such as this which will ensure that those involved in drug trafficking get severe sentences for their crimes.  We must also have in place a confiscation order procedure which will take away their assets which is the best aspect of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Looking at the situation I was conscious of the need to ensure a co-ordinated and a cohesive response.  I asked an assistant secretary in my Department to fully inform himself of the situation, how it could be corrected and what recommendations should be made to me which I, in turn, could make to Government. I received his report ten days ago. I am studying that report and as part of that study I have sent it to the three agencies involved and, indeed, to other agencies and Departments.  I want to ensure that it has been fully considered before I make a recommendation to Government.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that the co-ordinated effort and response in this area should be headed by one individual, in other words, one person should be made responsible <Col N="549" /> for all three agencies.  We can no longer have three different agencies going after a particular problem in three different ways.  We cannot have competition between the different agencies who, at the end of the day, are trying to achieve the same goal.  That is my view, but I await response from the various Government agencies, Departments and, in particular, the three agencies involved before I am in a position to put a recommendation to Government.  I want to do that quickly because I believe it is important.</P>
    <P>When discussing this we should be prepared to congratulate members of the Customs and Excise, the Garda Síochána and the Naval Service who were fully involved in a successful high profile case in the south-west some months ago and who brought it to a successful conclusion in the courts.  It was a significant, cooperative and co-ordinated response which I would like to see in all cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in congratulating the Customs and Excise, the Garda Síochána and the Naval Service on the work they do.  Our amendment seeks to put a drug enforcement agency as outlined and about which I spoke on a statutory basis.  The Minister stated that such an agency does not need statutory enforcement.  Given that the activities of drug barons and drug pushers, who generate vast amounts of wealth, affect many people, devastate many families and cause many deaths, we believe the enforcement and co-ordination of activities against such people should be put on a statutory basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust Senator Neville's amendment.  However, after listening to the Minister, I go along with her on the basis that we trying to pool information between the three agencies. I congratulate these agencies, particularly the Garda Síochána, on the work it must do each day confiscating drugs, going after drug barons and dealing with the victims who are usually in a very bad state.  I also must deal with this aspect of the drug problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> The Garda Síochána involved in this area has a huge body of people working in the area of the confiscation of drugs and combating drug barons.  I look forward to reading the Minister's report when published.  It is important that there is a body to correlate all the different segments because we need a referral group to outline the situation in regard to the drug problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was also interested in this amendment because I was anxious to hear the Minister's thoughts on this proposal.  I am pleased she is moving in the direction of trying to create an Irish equivalent of what is known in America as a drugs tsar who would be in position to co-ordinate the various agencies involved in fighting drugs.  I urge the Minister to go down that road because it is the way forward.  This is a small country and we do not have the same level of activity or operational procedures as in the United States which is essentially a federation where different police agencies operate, where different agendas are pursued by these agencies and where, perhaps, because of the vastness of the country, it was necessary to set up a Drugs Enforcement Agency.  We need greater co-ordination and rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must declare an interest because my brother-in-law is a Customs and Excise officer in Rosslare and has been involved in some of the successes of the Customs and Excise in the area of drug detection. I echo the congratulations to the various agencies expressed by Members on both sides of the House and by the Minister. This problem seems to be worsening. Because of our peripheral location, I hope that any decision the Minister takes will not only receive encouragement from her colleagues in Europe but also the financial backing required to ensure that once this co-ordinating structure is in place it will be effective because this is not just about law enforcement.  Tackling drugs and illegal trafficking involves surveillance and intelligence gathering; it is about long hours, days and months of operational activity involving various State agencies to ensure that the suspect <Col N="551" /> is caught and does not slip through the net.</P>
    <P>We all know the consequences of these drug activists slipping through the net. We heard about them earlier today from Senator Norris.  The Minister here and in the other House has outlined the horrific consequences of drugs going on to the <Col N="552" /> streets of our towns and villages.  I urge the Minister to ensure that once this report has been circulated and the proper consultative processes are gone through, this rationalisation and co-ordination of the agencies is set up under one individual in this country.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  The intention of the Bill is to ensure there is a mechanism available where people who have been convicted of serious crimes can be deprived of any material benefit accruing to them as a result of those crimes.  Very elaborate procedures are being proposed to try to achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> The District Court is a court of summary jurisdiction and, by definition, the offences with which it deals are less serious in nature. In the case of less serious offences, that court has a wide array of options open to it to ensure a person does not benefit from an offence.  This can be particularly reflected in the level of fine the court may impose.  Moreover, under the terms of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, it is open to the District Court, on conviction of any person of an offence, to require that person to pay compensation in respect of any loss resulting from that offence.  For example, if a person is convicted of larceny of £100 from an individual, the court can order payment of that amount to the victim as compensation.</P>
    <P>The key question which must be addressed on Senator Neville's amendment &mdash; I appreciate the thinking behind it &mdash; is whether the balance of advantage lies with providing a confiscation facility for the District Court in addition to the range of options already available to it. There are, of course, clear advantages with a court of summary jurisdiction. This enables relatively minor offences to be dealt with expeditiously.  There must be doubts about whether the use of confiscation procedure would be appropriate in such courts, especially given the danger that because of the nature of the procedure, it might contribute to clogging up the work of those courts.</P>
    <P>The type of detailed investigation of an offender's means which would usually be required for a confiscation order to be made could be greatly disproportionate to any benefit which might be gained in the case of minor offences.  Serious offences are generally dealt with by the Circuit Court and the confiscation procedure will be available there.  The District Court has already available to it the options I have outlined.  In deciding whether to proceed by way of summary trial or on indictment, the Director of Public Prosecutions, on exercising his discretion in these matters, could take into account whether there would be an advantage in proceeding by way of indictment <Col N="554" /> in terms of a subsequent application for a confiscation order.</P>
    <P>In all circumstances, our key concern to ensure that people do not benefit from the proceeds of crime can be met without accepting the terms of this amendment. As a general point, I would prefer to deal with the provision of any further options being made available to the District Court in the context of the forthcoming Law Reform Commission report on sentencing policy.</P>

      <P>These amendments are concerned with procedural matters that arise in the context of section 8 and are essentially designed to fine tune the arrangements already provided for in the Bill on the tendering of statements to the courts.  Senators will recall that section 8 of the Bill relates to statements which are submitted by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the defendant to a court which is considering the making <Col N="555" /> of a confiscation order.  Subsection (1) of that section provides that the DPP may submit a statement to the court which is relevant to the determination of whether the defendant has benefited from crime and the assessment of any such benefit. As the section is worded at present, the DPP could be limited to one statement in this respect.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to ensure that the DPP will be able to submit a further statement or statements to the court under section 8 (1) where it would be appropriate for him to do so.  This would be the case, for example, where fresh information about the amount of the defendant's criminal proceeds becomes available to the DPP after the original statement has been presented to the court and while proceedings were continuing.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 is consequential on amendment No. 8 and provides, in effect, that a follow-up statement tendered to the court by the DPP will be treated in the same way as his original statement. Thus the court will then be able to require the defendant to indicate whether they accept an allegation on any statement submitted by the DPP under section 8.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 is the counterpart of amendment No. 8 and allows a defendant to submit more than one statement to the court on any matters relevant to determining the amount that might be realised at the time the confiscation order is made.</P>
      <P>These are technical amendments dealing with procedural matters.  They do not involve any changes in principle to the approach taken in the Bill, but will improve the operation of section 8 in practice.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment and amendment No. 14, which are largely technical in nature, is to fine tune sections of the Bill.  They clarify further the procedure for the making of confiscation orders under sections 11 (2) and (4) of the Bill. Senators will recall that section 11 (2) enables the High Court to make a confiscation order against a person who has been convicted of drug trafficking or another offence on indictment, but who dies or absconds before the confiscation order can be made.</P>
      <P>Section 11 (4) enables a confiscation order to be made in the case of a defendant in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been instituted on indictment but who absconds before the proceedings are concluded.  At present, section 11 (2) and (4) provide that where the appropriate conditions are fulfilled, the High Court may exercise the powers of a court to make a confiscation order under this Act.  They do not, however, refer to the specific powers under the Act which are involved.  I have been advised that it might be better to make it clear that in the case of a conviction or proceedings related to drug trafficking, the powers provided in section 4 will apply. Where other offences are in issue, the provisions of section 7 will operate.</P>
      <P>This is the effect of amendments Nos. 12 and 14, which propose the deletion of the words &ldquo;under this Act&rdquo; in section 11 (2) and (4) and their replacement by new words along the lines I have indicated. What is involved is simply a clarification and an improvement of the existing text.</P>

      <P>This amendment makes it clear that a confiscation order will only be made by the High Court under section 11 (3) against a person who absconds before the conclusion of their trial if that person is being proceeded against on indictment.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide specifically for the procedure for the appeals against confiscation orders which will be made under the Bill.  The reason for making specific provision in this regard is that while in the normal course an appeal against a criminal conviction would be provided for under our Courts Acts, a confiscation order will not be part of any sentence imposed on a person for drug trafficking or some other offence. Accordingly, the amendment allows an appeal against a confiscation order to be made to the Court of Criminal Appeal. In addition, it enables that court to order the payment of compensation where an appeal in respect of the confiscation order is successful in whole or in part.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with the amendment.  It is a tenet of our legal system that we have the right of appeal <Col N="560" /> right up to the Supreme Court.

I understand, from my reading of it and the Minister's remarks, that the amendment would introduce such a situation.  This would suggest that an amendment of this kind is desirable under the course of natural justice.</P>

      <P>This amendment enables the defendant or the DPP to apply to the High Court to vary a confiscation order made against an absconder under section 11 (4) where the <Col N="562" /> absconder has returned and the court is satisfied that the amount of his or her benefit was overestimated when the confiscation order was made, or that his or her assets are not sufficient to satisfy the order.  Similar provision for the variation of confiscation orders is already included in the Bill in section 13 in relation to confiscation orders where an absconder is not involved.</P>
      <P>Amendments were made to the Bill in the Dáil to tighten up on the position regarding those who abscond and in the context of reviewing the overall effect of these changes I believe that a separate provision along these lines in relation to the cases of those who abscond is warranted.</P>
      <P>In this context provision is also being made for the payment of compensation where the High Court varies a confiscation order by virtue of section 11 (4). Compensation will be payable to a person who suffered loss as a result of the making of the order.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the thinking behind these amendments, we should not proceed with the appointment of court auditors as envisaged by Senator Neville.  Sufficient powers for appropriate persons are already contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Act, it will be a matter for the DPP to initiate proceedings for confiscations.  Those proceedings, although separate, follow on from court proceedings in which the prosecution would have been taken in the name of the DPP.  Not only would the DPP be best placed to decide on whether confiscation proceedings would be worthwhile, but also this decision is one that should lie with an independent law officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the assembling of evidence in connection with possible confiscation proceedings, the DPP will, of course, rely on the Garda Síochána to carry out the necessary inquiries.  Under sections 50 and 51 of the Bill, a member of the Garda Síochána can seek orders to make material available in connection with <Col N="564" /> such inquiries and for the issue of search warrants.</P>
    <P>Regarding court proceedings themselves under section 9, the court may order the defendant to provide information. In those circumstances it would appear that the only possible advantage which might be argued in favour of the appointment of auditors of the kind envisaged in the amendments is that it would bring a level of expertise to these matters which would not otherwise be available; but in reality that is a matter which can be dealt with administratively and no provision is needed in the Bill to achieve this.  For example, as part of the recent law enforcement package, I announced the decision to recruit three professional accountants for the Garda Fraud Squad.  Their expertise will assist members of the Garda Síochána, but there is no need for this to be placed on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>Equally, professional accountants could be used, where necessary, to assist in relation to investigations arising from this Bill without impinging on the role and powers being given to the DPP and the gardaí.  For example, if it were to be decided to set up a special unit in the Garda Síochána regarding confiscation proceedings, all relevant expertise could also be made available to it, including the appointment of accountants.</P>
    <P>The fact that it would be a matter for the gardaí or the DPP to attend court would have no implications for the effectiveness of such accountants.  It is also the case that the Bill will allow the courts to appoint receivers to realise a confiscation order.  In all the circumstances I do not believe that the amendments proposed by Senator Neville are necessary to ensure that appropriate levels of resources and expertise will be available to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are implemented effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the amendment will improve the effectiveness of the Bill. Its purpose is to empower the Minister to appoint an auditor to assess the wealth of the offender.  This auditor should have not less than seven years experience.  The <Col N="565" /> amendment refers to such an auditor as a court auditor.  It is necessary to ensure that those who benefit from the proceeds of crime, especially drug related crime, do not escape the effects of the Bill.  We must ensure, at a time when cash can be transferred relatively easily by electronic means from banks in this country to other countries, that court auditors shall, on application to the High Court, have full powers of discovery and, with the assistance of the Garda, full powers of research.  It should be an offence, punishable by a fine not exceeding £5,000 and/or imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months and on indictment a fine not exceeding £10,000 and/or imprisonment for a term of up to five years, to impede <Col N="566" /> the court auditor in the exercise of his or her duties.  It is important that the auditor is appointed to ensure the effectiveness of the legislation in tracing and knowing precisely the assets of a criminal charged and found guilty.  It is possible for criminals to have moneys stacked in offshore accounts and relatively easy to transfer money to these accounts.  If a person is dealing in international drug trafficking, he or she is likely to have a bank account in a country other than Ireland. However, if that person transfers cash, it is important that these movements be traced and a court auditor is available to the courts to do so.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 21 and amendment No. 22 in the name of Senator Neville provide for the registration of restraint orders made under section 20 of the Bill with the Registrar of Companies.  Senator Neville's amendment is identical to an amendment which was tabled by Deputy Gay Mitchell in the Lower House.  When the matter was discussed there I indicated that I was sympathetic to what the Deputy had proposed in his amendment <Col N="570" /> and that I would like to have the opportunity to have it discussed with the Registrar of Companies.  After detailed consultations I am satisfied that it would be feasible to have restraint orders registered in the Companies Office and the wording which is set out in my amendment has been agreed with the Registrar of Companies in this respect.  There is no real difference between my amendment and that proposed by Senator Neville but I believe it is necessary to go further than the Senator's amendment in providing for the action to be taken by the Registrar of Companies on receipt of notice of the making of a restraint order or any variation or cancellation thereof.  This is the approach which is adopted in my amendment and also in the provisions of section 21 which deal with the registration of restraint orders in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  In the circumstances I would hope that Senator Neville might see his way to withdrawing his amendment in preference to acceptance of mine.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the amendment.  She indicated on two occasions in the other House that she would look at this approach.  She has dealt with it in a slightly different and probably more comprehensive way.  It again highlights an issue which I and other Senators have brought up here on numerous occasions; that those of us on this side of the House do not have the facility to word amendments in a fashion which is legally acceptable.  In another jurisdiction or another state we would have some assistance from the State to help us in formulating amendments. However, we do not have that facility here and in many ways it inhibits those of us who are not legally qualified in wording amendments and in pursuing changes that we wish to have in Bills.  I thank the Minister for taking the amendment and I withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I enthusiastically welcome this provision the Minister is including in the Bill.  As Senator Neville has acknowledged, his intention and purpose <Col N="571" /> was the same.  The terminology here is very effective and tight.  The reason I am sure it has commended itself to the Minister is that registration of title is probably the most expeditious way of dealing with property.  Since the Registration of Title Act and all the regulations that followed from it came into place, the folio is the full story.  Everything that would operate or intend to operate to prevent conveyancing on properties should be registered on that folio.  Clearly the Minister's intention is to ensure that before any property which might be the subject of an interest on the part of a person who had ill-gotten gains from trafficking can be disposed of, the restraint order which has now been introduced is clearly registered on the title.  That is very effective and will mean that nobody can say, at any time, that they had neither notice nor knowledge because the folio itself dates conclusive evidence of the actual title and any inhibitions or restraints that appear on it are immediately effective to restrain.  This is an excellent provision and I am glad it has the support of all parties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 26, subsection (9) (a), line 28, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The penalties as they stand are very low for the types of offence that are dealt with in the Bill, especially money laundering which is a most serious offence. The international illegal drugs industry would not be at epidemic level if it was not so easy to launder money.  When this money is laundered it comes into mainstream business and competes with legitimate businesses which are contributing legally to our economy by employing people and paying taxes.</P>
      <P>People who are involved in drug pushing know they can convert their illgotten gains to legitimate use.  For this reason the penalties should be substantially increased.  The amendment increases fines from £1,000 to £5,000 while amendment No. 25 increases sentences from a maximum of 12 months to a maximum of two years in the case of summary conviction. It should be possible on summary conviction to impose a fine of up to £5,000 and apply a consecutive sentencing approach of up to two years.</P>
      <P>On many occasions in this House we have discussed money laundering.  It came up during the discussion of many Bills over the past five years.  Everybody accepts that it is very serious.  It is now being dealt with here and I believe that the fines and sentences &mdash; the sanctions imposed by this Bill &mdash; are not adequate to deal with the seriousness of the offences we are discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>People will sympathise with the intention of Senator Neville's amendment.  The Minister probably sympathises also.  However, the amendment applies only to subsection (9) (a) which deals with summary procedures. If the Senator looks at subsection (9) (b) he will see that the sentence to be imposed on conviction on indictment &mdash; in which case there is evidence of crime of a very serious nature although I am not saying that any offence covered in this section is not serious &mdash; is an unlimited fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years or both. The section provides for the effective and heavy sanctions we all wish to see implemented and which is clearly the Minister's intention.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be aware that a number of proceedings have been taken on a constitutional basis in respect of the rights of defendants on summary procedures.  The High Court has held &mdash; and I think the Supreme Court has also held when it has been tested there &mdash; that a summary procedure cannot be used for relatively serious offences.  If it is used there is a risk that the High Court or Supreme Court might strike it down.</P>
      <P>The fundamental rights of citizens, even those charged for an offence as serious as the one we are discussing, must be taken into account.  Adequate documents, notices and exhibits must be served on the defendant.  That is why summary jurisdiction limits the penalty to £1,000 or 12 months.  If the fine were increased to that suggested by Senator Neville &mdash; and I am not attempting to second guess what might happen in court &mdash; there would be a grave risk, having regard to current jurisdictions, that it would be challenged successfully in the High Court.  That would defeat the purpose Senator Neville and the Minister wish to achieve.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate Senator Neville's intentions, a series of court decisions on penalties that can be imposed by a court of summary jurisdiction make it impossible for <Col N="574" /> me to accept the amendment.  At present, the maximum sentence, which is generally provided by statute, that the District Court may impose is 12 months.  In practice, the normal maximum penalty which we include in legislation on summary conviction is about £1,000.</P>
      <P>The net effect of the judgments to which I have referred is that increases of the kind proposed in this amendment would be unlikely to withstand constitutional challenges in the context of their appropriateness for courts of summary jurisdiction.  The issues involved are not specific to this Bill and, to a large extent, the constraints which arise are outside the control of the Oireachtas.  In practice and as a matter of law, where a judge of the District Court regards the offence involved as being of a level of seriousness for which the sanctions available to that court would be insufficient, it is open to the judge to refuse jurisdiction and to refer the matter to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 28 places an obligation on certain bodies to take measures to prevent money laundering through, for example, taking measures to establish the identity of a person for whom they propose to provide a service.  The basic approach which the section takes at present is to specify in subsection (1) the bodies on which these obligations are placed and, as well as mentioning specific institutions, there is a power to prescribe other persons or bodies in regulations.</P>
      <P>The section arises primarily in the context of giving effect to an EU directive on money laundering.  Both before and since the Bill was published I have arranged with my Department to have extensive consultations with representatives of financial institutions and their regulatory bodies such as the Central Bank.  I appreciate the great co-operation which my Department received during these consultations.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 28, there was general agreement that the approach it contains was basically sound.  However, certain improvements were suggested which I agreed to bring forward in the present amendments.  The main effect of these amendments is to enshrine in the section a specific reference to the services covered by the EU directive on money laundering.  The directive defines those services by reference to two other directives and both of these are mentioned specifically in the amendments.  This will put beyond doubt the ability of the legislation to implement in full the money laundering directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition a power is being given to prescribe by regulation activities which will be brought within the scope of the reporting requirements of section 28. This will mean that in practical terms if it comes to light that there are certain activities not already covered by the <Col N="576" /> section which are liable to be used for money laundering, the reporting requirements of section 28 can be applied to them.  While the basic approach of section 28 is being retained, the amendments are practical improvements to it and I trust they are acceptable to the House.</P>
    <P>If Senator Neville would like to consider these amendments between now and Report Stage, I will be happy to withdraw them on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <P>It is significant and welcome that Senator Neville accepts the amendments.  This section is a comprehensive cover in respect of the directive and is entirely consistent with the purpose and content of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister, quite rightly, has reserved the right under section 28 (1) (m) to designate any other person or body prescribed in regulations made under subsection 9 of the section.  That is very important.  The nature of financial services, financial transactions and the bodies engaged in financial services is changing rapidly.  No matter how comprehensive a list may be, it is always possible that some other body or person could emerge who would not be within the scope of the detailed provisions in this subsection.  It is prudent that subparagraph (m) has been included.  It will enable the Minister of the day to prescribe in regulations any other person or body to be subject to the provisions regarding money laundering.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of these amendments is to make provision for the seizure of cash relating to drug trafficking being imported into or being exported from the State.  As Senators will be aware, large amounts of cash are generated by drug trafficking and supplies of illegal drugs are frequently purchased in cash.  As a result consignments of money derived from or intended for use in trafficking are moved across international borders.  With the removal of exchange controls in this country, our authorities are not in a position to seize those consignments when they are detected.  I believe this needs to be tackled and that is what is proposed in my amendments.</P>
      <P>I should acknowledge that amendments designed to have the same effect as these amendments were put down by Deputy Gay Mitchell and Deputy O'Donnell in the other House.  However, the scope of those amendments was effectively limited to the seizure of suspicious cash and they did not make provision for additional measures, such as the forfeiture of such cash, which are also required in this context.</P>
      <P>In the other House I explained I was not prepared to follow this path before having available to me the report of a senior official in my Department, which among other matters was to consider whether customs officers or the Garda should have such powers.  The draft report recommends that powers along the lines of these amendments should be available.  While I have not completed my considerations of other aspects of the report, I believe this recommendation should be given effect in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments comprise eight sections; the proposed new sections 34 to 41, inclusive, will form a new Part VI of the Bill.  The proposed new section 34 provides for the detention and seizure by a garda or a customs officer of cash being imported into or exported from the State, provided the amount is not less than a certain amount to be prescribed under section 40.  The garda or customs officer must have reasonable grounds for suspecting <Col N="581" /> the cash is derived from or intended for use in drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>An order of the District Court will be required to enable the cash to be detained beyond 48 hours.  An order for continued detention of the cash may be made by that court for a period of up to three months and further such orders may be made for a total period of two years.  A person from whom the cash was seized will be entitled to apply for its release to a district judge.  The cash will not be released if its forfeiture is being sought under section 35, or proceedings are being taken against a person for an offence connected with the cash.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section 35 allows a Circuit Court judge to order the forfeiture of cash held under section 34 if satisfied, on an application by the DPP while the cash is still detained, that it represents drug trafficking proceeds or is intended for use in trafficking.  The civil standard of proof will apply to an application under the section.  The proposed section 36 provides for appeals to the High Court against forfeiture orders made under section 35.  The civil standard of proof will also apply in respect of these appeals.</P>
    <P>The proposed section 37 requires cash detained for more than 48 hours to be placed in an interest-bearing account. The interest will be added to the cash on its forfeiture or release.  The proposed section 38 provides for the giving of notice of orders made by a district judge authorising the continuing detention of cash under section 34 (2) and for procedural matters.  The proposed section 39 contains definitions for the purposes of the new Part VI.</P>
    <P>The proposed section 40 sets out a procedure for prescribing the amount of cash in relation to which the power of seizure under section 34 will apply.  The proposed section 41 provides in standard form for the disposal of money forfeited under section 35.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, I believe there is a need to ensure appropriate measures can be taken to deal with the importation or exportation of cash connected with drug trafficking.  I hope the <Col N="582" /> amendments I have proposed to tackle the problem will be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>I fully accept the thrust of these amendments as outlined by the Minister.  They reflect many of my party's views on these issues.  I have not had the opportunity to consider the comprehensive detail of these amendments. I ask the Minister to give us a chance to look at and assess these provisions in detail before Report Stage, as she did with the earlier amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister is well disposed to doing as Senator Neville asks and has done so in relation to other provisions. We are moving into an era of more liberalised trade after GATT and the removal of exchange controls.  Since Ireland will want to operate as freely as possible for legitimate commercial and financial transactions there will be a risk that people who have earned ill-gotten gains as defined in this Bill could use the new liberalised trade regime to transfer and launder funds.  It is therefore important that in these new sections the Minister has introduced a series of effective and stringent provisions on confiscation and external forfeiture, not just within the State but in consultation and in conjunction with other states.</P>
      <P>Clearly, there is a degree of urgency associated with provisions of this kind, because of the abuses already taking place.  For that reason this legislation is needed now.  I am happy to note this Bill anticipates the need to update, review, revoke or amend as may be required in the light of experience or in the course of the operation of the Act.  The current section 34 (9) states:</P>
      <P>The Government may amend or revoke an order made under this section including an order made under this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is essential.  We need urgent and immediate action, but if it transpires that even stronger action is required or that we need to revoke a provision which did not achieve what it intended, it is good <Col N="583" /> the Government has reserved such power to itself here.  This series of sections dealing with international co-operation is long overdue, not on the part of this jurisdiction but of all the nations concerned about the awful spread of the drug trafficking virus.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment.  It arises because certain technical details in relation to extradition, which were included in the Bill as originally published, have been superseded by the recent enactment of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994. That Act made reference to section 24 of the Extradition Act, 1870, and section 5 of Extradition Act, 1873, both of which deal with the obtaining of evidence in the State for use in foreign criminal proceedings. As Senators will be aware, section 24 of the Extradition Act, 1870, and section 5 of the Extradition Act, 1873, are being repealed by section 39 of the Bill.  This amendment carries those repeals through to section 1 (3) (c) of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994. This is a tidying up operation which does not give rise to any point of substance. In the circumstances, I hope Members will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises from further consultation I had with the Garda authorities in connection with the Bill.  While the Garda authorities are happy with section 43 to the extent that it deals with searches for material relevant to foreign investigations, they have suggested to me that it would be desirable to make additional provision in that section in relation to obtaining access to information which is held in this country and is required for the purpose of investigating an offence committed abroad where a search would <Col N="585" /> not be required.  The type of situation the Garda authorities have in mind is one where specific records are being kept by an Irish institution such as a bank and it would not be appropriate for the Garda Síochána to seek a search warrant to gain access to them.</P>
      <P>I have considered this matter in detail and I am satisfied that it would be appropriate to allow the Garda Síochána, on behalf of a foreign law enforcement authority, to obtain access, with the authority of a judge of the District Court, to information relating to offences committed in other countries under the same conditions as they can secure such information where Irish offences are suspected.  In that regard, Senators will recall that section 50 of the Bill enables a member of the Garda Síochána to apply to the District Court requiring the production of material relating to drug trafficking, money laundering offences or other offences in respect of which a confiscation order might be made.  The amendment I propose would enable section 50 to apply in the case of corresponding offences committed abroad. The amendment represents a useful addition to the international co-operation measures in the Bill and I hope it is accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>As someone who argued for a drugs enforcement agency earlier in the debate and discussed the EU's involvement in controlling drugs inside and outside the EU by putting sanctions and pressure on those who engage in drug trafficking, I welcome this amendment. It allows the State to co-operate with other countries, which have the same objective, to control the areas covered under the Bill.  I ask the Government to encourage international co-operation, especially in the area of drug trafficking. I accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This provision is radical and sweeping and I welcome it.  This is an area where one requires radical and sweeping authorities; these are my words, the Minister might be more prudent. For the first time the Garda have <Col N="586" /> the power and authority to gain access to a bank's records and to transmit the information to a foreign enforcement agency.  This is revolutionary, but I am glad it is happening.  We expect this type of consideration from other jurisdictions in respect of offences committed here.</P>
      <P>I welcome this belated action on behalf of the community of nations, and I know the Minister has played an active role in bringing this about at European Union level.  If we expect access and support against drug traffickers and money launderers in relation to actions which originated here, it is essential that law enforcement agencies from other countries should have the same access here.  I am sure the financial services will recognise this as a revolutionary measure. Those who are engaged in bona fide operations have no need to fear.  If a foreign law enforcement agency has good reason to believe that a bank's records need to be checked, then they should have access to them, through the Garda Síochána.  If this was happening in any other area, we would say it was a radical measure and we would be reluctant to give an authority such power.  However, we are enthusiastic that this facility should be made available through the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 42, before section 44 (but in Part VI), to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>()&mdash;(1) The Government may by regulations make such modifications of this Act as appear to it to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of adapting any of the provisions of this Part of this Act to enable the State to provide co-operation under those provisions for an international tribunal or other body established for the prosecution of <Col N="587" /> persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed outside the State.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under subsection (1) of this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of such draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this amendment is to enable this country to comply with certain obligations which apply to us in relation to the establishment of a special international tribunal to deal with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.  As Senators may be aware, the tribunal has been established by United Nations resolution which requires states to provide the tribunal with assistance in its investigations and other work.  A number of these forms of assistance are provided for in Part VI of the Bill in respect of international co-operation in criminal matters, for example, the taking of evidence for foreign courts.  However, as Senators will be aware, Part VI only applies in the context of co-operation between states at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it best, therefore, to take the opportunity presented by this Bill to enable this country to enshrine in our legislation a capacity to co-operate fully with tribunals set up to deal with the type of unspeakable and horrific war crimes which have been committed in the former Yugoslavia.  In the circumstances, I propose to amend the Bill to enable Part VI to be modified by way of Government regulation which will allow appropriate assistance to be made available to the United Nations tribunal and to any such body which may be set up in the future to prosecute persons responsible for war crimes or other serious violations of human rights.  Given that in particular circumstances fairly extensive modifications of Part VI may be required for that purpose, my amendment also provides <Col N="588" /> that any regulations which are made by the Government in this respect must be approved in draft by each House of the Oireachtas before they are made.  I hope the amendment will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this allows the State to respond and co-operate under the provisions of an international tribunal established for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed outside the State.  On many occasions Members have expressed disgust, shock and, indeed, shame as members of the human race about what is happening in former Yugoslavia and in East Timor, which was discussed last week.</P>
      <P>We support any legal assistance which will enable the Minister to co-operate fully in bringing those involved in the perpetration of inhumane acts to justice. We are happy to support the Government in its role in co-operating with the international tribunal set up to deal with the situation presented.  We recognise there will be a check on it because the Houses of the Oireachtas must agree to the regulations of the Minister in this area.  The Oireachtas will be able to check the Government's and the Minister's regulations in any area.  The principle dealt with in this section is of full co-operation in international tribunals set up to deal with violations throughout the world, including those being perpetrated in former Yugoslavia and in East Timor. We support this principle and the check which states the Oireachtas must approve any regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One may wonder why a provision relating to vigorous co-operation in a war crimes tribunal is included in legislation, the purpose of which is mainly to deal with drug trafficking, money laundering, the ill-gotten gains of drug trafficking and such matters.  It is clear that an unacceptable development, which is of concern to the people, is the horrific level of war crimes which are a feature of this time.  Because of the urgency of this, I welcome that the Minister <Col N="589" /> is taking this initiative and the Government is proving to be an initiator and not just a reactor in this area.  It is a shame on the community of nations that during what we thought was an enlightened period of co-operation, horrific murders, genocide and unspeakable things are being done on our doorstep in Europe, in Rwanda &mdash; it is important not distinguish one from the other &mdash; and, as Senator Neville rightly pointed out, in East Timor.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the people are becoming more aware and concerned.  Over the years, in UN services, in voluntary activities and in a range of areas, the people have proven that they are not only concerned with what happens in their jurisdiction. True republicans &mdash; I use that word deliberately &mdash; are concerned about the well-being of every citizen in every country and about the horrific things being done to some.  As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and as someone who has been involved in European co-operation over the years, I am appalled by the inadequate and ineffective response of the EU heretofore in relation to developments in former Yugoslavia, in Rwanda and elsewhere.  Wherever we see injustice, we should be the first to condemn, take action and, if necessary, to penalise ourselves in the pursuit of the abolition of such injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we celebrated the emergence of freedom in South Africa and I hope the transition to democracy will be peaceful. However, when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1977 to 1979 I got no co-operation from EU members states when trying to impose sanctions on South Africa, particularly in respect of sporting contacts.  We paid a price in this regard and I was privileged to propose something which the Government adopted.  In 1978 a world cup golf promotion was to be launched here.  State agencies, including Bord Fáilte and An Bord Bainne were promoting it.  However, a South African team was involved and I suggested &mdash; this was not fashionable at the time &mdash; that the Government withdraw all official association with that awful regime although only two people were involved. <Col N="590" /> It was essential that we stated our principle at that time.  Consequently the golf tournament went elsewhere and some other country got all the publicity which we could have enjoyed in Waterville &mdash; I was conscious of the cost to Waterville. What was right was more important than what was immediately beneficial to us.</P>
    <P>This measure is the same and it is essential, given the lack of effective action on the part of the EU in the past and at present in respect of Bosnia.  It grieves me to hear people I knew as foreign ministers make almost <i>ex cathedra</i> statements that they will achieve something overnight and then withdraw from what they said.  I am speaking about the former British Foreign Minister, Lord Owen.  Each time statements were made, the EU did not implement the purpose of those statements; that is worse than making no statement.  The world knows &mdash; this is not trial by television &mdash; the savage brutality which has been visited on old women, young children and defenceless people in Bosnia, which is on our doorstep.  Yet we are ineffective in dealing with it.  The reason is that we are concerned that the consequences of effective action might spill over on us in some way.  That is not a good enough reason because there is always a price to pay for appropriate action.</P>
    <P>For many years larger EU member states were concerned about the consequences for themselves in regard to other countries, particularly South Africa where no sanctions were imposed on trade or armaments.  The view was that someone else was suffering far away which we did not know about.  I am glad to say that amorality has been undermined.</P>
    <P>I am happy this view has been promoted in this legislation by the Minister and the Government, who are consistent in this regard.  Ireland has a role to remind colleagues in the UN or in the EU that certain developments are not consistent with the principles we stand for as nation states or as a community of nations in the EU.  I do not accept our indifference or inability to do anything about the awful events in Bosnia over the past two years. <Col N="591" /> I visited former Yugoslavia many times. Each time I hear about these events, I wonder how many of those I met and worked with are now subjected to this awful brutality.  That is only a personal reflection.  I have not visited Rwanda, but to stand back from the horror of what is happening there undermines the order of nature, never mind a civilised society.  I hope this provision relating to co-operation in war crimes tribunals will be acted upon.  No voice is more consistent or entitled to be consistent than the Irish voice and I hope others will follow, because if we just consider our own immediate interests then we are conceding to savages.  I use the term &ldquo;savages&rdquo; meaning those who have repudiated everything civilisation stands for.  If we concede to them on the basis of not risking our own interest, then we are conceding everything.  I hope we will not see again the shame of a European Community that was so ineffective in implementing the actions that were proposed; the same criticism applies to a lesser degree to the United Nations. Unlike the European Union, the United Nations is not a co-ordinated, structured empowered organisation.  It has only the authority that is given to it by the sum of its member States.  It cannot exceed the rights of the Security Council and the plenary groups of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Although we have a great record of independence in foreign policy and nonalignment in military action, I hope any exception to that record would be in the context of devoting ourselves to doing what the generations before us did, that is, opposing injustice wherever we find it, at whatever cost to ourselves.  I welcome these provisions enthusiastically.</P>

    <P>(4)  In the case of a person who was in employment at the relevant time, it shall be a defence to a charge of committing an offence under this section that the person charged made a report of the type referred to in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, as the case may be, to another person in accordance with an internal reporting procedure established for the purpose specified in subsection (3) of this section.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable reports of transactions where there is a suspicion of money laundering made to the Garda Síochána under section 44 of the Bill to be made in accordance with internal control procedures established by an employer in order to facilitate the operation of section 44.  As Senators may be aware, an amendment on similar lines was put down by Deputy Gay Mitchell in the other House.  In response to that amendment I indicated that I accepted in principle what Deputy Mitchell was trying to achieve and that I would be prepared, in consultation with Garda authorities and other parties, to consider bringing forward an amendment to deal with the matter.  The amendment I am proposing fulfils the commitment I gave to Deputy Mitchell in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a strong case to be made in support of the amendment.  In particular I am sure Senators would accept that it would be preferable, as would be achieved by this amendment, for the Garda to receive reports under section 44 from designated persons within institutions who would be experienced in the operation of the section and would be aware of the type of information that should be provided in such cases, rather than to have individual employees from all over the country telephoning <Col N="593" /> Garda headquarters, or perhaps their local Garda station with details of suspicious transactions.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on the amendment I should mention that it provides protection from conviction of the offence of failing to make a report under section 44 for an employee who makes an appropriate report in accordance with internal control procedures established by his or her employer.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 43, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  In determining whether a person has complied with any of the requirements of this section, a court may take account of any relevant supervisory or regulatory guidance which applies to that person or any other relevant guidance issued by a body that regulates, or is representative of, any trade, profession, business or employment carried on by that person.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that in determining whether a person has complied with the obligation to report suspicious money laundering transactions to the Garda under section 44, a court may have regard to any professional rules or guidelines which apply to the person in the conduct of their business.  The amendment is designed to ensure that persons who are covered by section 44 are not obliged to take unreasonable measures in order to avoid prosecution under the section.  I believe that where a person takes steps to detect and report laundering which are in line with the best practice in their particular business or profession, that factor would be taken into account by a court in deciding whether a person has met their obligations in terms of section 44.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> I might mention in this connection that even in advance of this Bill becoming law, a steering group with representatives of the Department of Finance, my own Department, the Central Bank and of the institutions likely to be most affected by the reporting arrangements in relation to money laundering specified in the Bill, has been established to begin the process of drawing up guidelines for the various sectors involved.  I believe that it would be appropriate in the Bill itself to give statutory recognition to the existence of such guidelines.  I hope Senators might be able to agree to my amendment.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister is being sensitive to professionals, such as lawyers or doctors who are dealing with people who may be sensitive to disclosure of information by virtue of their professional relationship with the person involved.  I take it that the court can take this into account but without this amendment the court could refuse to take such a position into account.  I am asking this question because I have not had the facility to study this heretofore.  If the Minister confirms this I am quite happy with the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister is taking a radical and original approach to what up to now were regarded as sacred principles that should never be breached. Professional bodies have professional obligations.  They have a competence and a responsibility, particularly of maintaining confidentiality.  That is the basis of our professions.  Anything entrusted to doctors, lawyers, accountants and other professionals in their relationships between a client or patient and the professional concerned must be treated with the utmost confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that I would be very concerned to see those sacred principles being changed in any way I am happy to find that the only exception to this rule is where somebody discloses information that could lead to the conviction of <Col N="595" /> people engaged in drug trafficking and money laundering.  I am happy that the well established confidentiality rule to that extent, and to that extent only, is being put aside.  This is essential.  I did not think I would see the day I would support a provision of this kind, but I am happy to support it in this context as Senator Neville obviously is.</P>
    <P>While the purpose of this Bill is to elicit information in relation to drug trafficking and money laundering, it would be unthinkable if those who helped, and perhaps even initiated, the inquiries were subject to sanction under existing law or statutory instrument.

      <P>In the course of our Second Stage discussion here and the extensive debate which took place on the Bill in the other House, reference was <Col N="596" /> made to the very valuable and significant part the Naval Service has played in helping to combat drug trafficking.  We are all aware of the success the Naval Service has achieved in that area and we hope it will be maintained.  The purpose of amendment No. 47 is to strengthen and clarify the position of the Naval Service in preventing illegal drugs from reaching this country.  In that regard, I propose to amend the First Schedule to ensure that the powers of an enforcement officer under section 31 of the Bill in relation to measures against drugs transported on ships will be specifically conferred on members of the Naval Service not below the rank of petty officer.  Senators will be aware that section 31 in conjunction with the First Schedule enables an enforcement officer to stop and board a ship and to search and detain it in connection with drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>At present, the definition of an &ldquo;enforcement officer&rdquo; in the Bill applies to members of the Garda Síochána, customs officers and other persons specified by ministerial order.  In the context of the report which has been completed by an official of my Department which dealt specifically with inter-agency co-operation in this area, that definition should be extended to include in the Bill itself rather than in subsequent regulations appropriate members of the Naval Service to give clear recognition to the vital role of that service in the fight against drug trafficking.  Accordingly, I would be grateful if that amendment could be favourably considered.</P>

The Second Stage of this Bill is being treated in the same way as a non-Government motion and the same procedure will apply for speakers.  Time allocations are different to motions.

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the law in relation to the liability of farmers and other property and land owners concerning all accidents occurring on their property.  Farmers are currently liable for all accidents occurring <Col N="598" /> on their lands, even if the person who has an accident and is making a claim is trespassing.  This is totally unacceptable and this Bill attempts to change it.  Farmers and property owners should not be asked to take the legal and financial risks involved.  The Bill will regularise the situation. We have a long history, a Chathaoirligh, of allowing sporting and recreational events to take place on farms.  It would be a pity if these activities were curtailed, but we are currently facing a curtailment of opportunities for such activities on the land.  However, this Bill will change that.</P>
      <P>Many farmers have expressed their concern at the present ludicrous situation. Traditionally, there is a high level of goodwill between the farming community and the various sporting organisations. The opening of our lands for anybody to enjoy for recreational or sporting activities is a tradition which goes back many centuries.  This is now under threat.  This issue has been a concern of my party for some time.  In November 1992, we proposed a motion calling for a change to this legislation. My colleague in the other House, Deputy Deenihan, pioneered a lot of research in this area and has produced in the Dáil a Bill similar to ours and has campaigned at length to change the law.  I take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the Deputy for his work in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are undergoing the biggest crisis in unemployment in the life of the State. One of the ways of creating durable employment is in the tourist industry.  We are encouraging farmers to develop agri-tourism and are inviting tourists to the countryside to enjoy the scenery, to climb mountains, to see our rivers, visit our national monuments &mdash; we had a debate on the difficulties arising because of the absence of this legislation during the debate on the National Monuments Bill &mdash; and invite them to visit our old castles. These activities are in jeopardy at present and will be eliminated if farmers decide, as they must eventually do unless this Bill is accepted, they can no longer tolerate people coming on to their lands because <Col N="599" /> of the situation prevailing with regard to liability.</P>
    <P>The Bill accepts that the occupier owes it to a person invited on to that property to take reasonable care to protect that person; there should be proper insurance cover for that eventuality.  However, we do not accept they have a responsibility for those who, without permission, come onto the land or who are trespassing.  It is amazing that this law has not been changed, as is the case with many other European states, including the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic increase in the level of personal injury claims.  We are developing a mentality which is almost making an industry out of litigation. Some local authorities are only too aware of the burden of claims for personal injuries placed upon them. Indeed, many Members of this House would know of it.  It is generally accepted that many of these claims are fraudulent, but this is hard to prove.  The farming community is afraid that such an approach will spread to people who go on to land and that people will specifically go on to farms and fake injuries to make claims.  While I accept there should be adequate checks and balances within the insurance system to look into these claims, the insurance companies tell us of the difficulties they experience in trying to ensure that all claims paid are genuine.</P>
    <P>The law in this area is still governed by Common Law precedent, as established by judicial decisions handed down in court cases.  The situation has been updated in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  They have taken care of the problem and regularised the situation by statute law, namely the Occupiers Acts, 1957 and 1984.  It was tidied up in the UK ten years ago.  It is 35 years since they first tackled the problem.  A farmer in England, Wales or Northern Ireland has available to him a clear legal statement of his rights, obligations and potential liability towards authorised visitors, and to a lesser extent, trespassers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> This Bill caters for the protection of occupiers of land.  This includes structures on the land, such as posts and fencing as well as buildings, that would be purely subsidiary and ancillary to the land.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with both trespassers and those allowed onto the land with the occupier's permission but with no material benefit for the occupier, such as members of sporting organisations and so on.  The Bill provides that the occupier of land will have no responsibility for trespassers, but he or she will not be entitled to intentionally harm a trespasser, except in necessary self-defence, defence of another or in defence of his property.  Regarding people who are on the land with the permission of the occupier, the occupier shall not be under any obligation to the individual, except that he shall be obliged to give warning of the existence of any concealed dangers which exist on the land and which are known to him.</P>
    <P>If the present law continues, most landowners will have to choose between allowing access to their property and running the risk of civil claims for breach of the common duty of care, or, on the other hand, refusing access.  There is a growing tendency in recent times to refuse access, and unless the law is changed, this will be the norm.  If access to the land is limited by landowners because of the fears of being sued, the potential of Ireland as a major destination for activity type holidays will be seriously impaired. I am sure the Minister is well aware of the concerns which all property and land owners have regarding this area, and it has been well highlighted in the past.</P>
    <P>Farmer organisations have been especially vigilant, and I commend them for their work in this area.  I also commend the tourism industry, the country's sports associations, such as the Federation of Irish Field Sports, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and all bodies which have an interest in ensuring that those who enjoy country field sports of every kind, including walking and picnicking, continue to have access to our beautiful countryside, that <Col N="601" /> tourists continue to have such access and that farmers and other property owners do not feel that they are put under such risk of future claims and unnecessary demands on them that they have to bar access to their land.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to bring clarity to the area of liability of occupiers of land.  The duties owed to licensees and trespassers are clearly stated in unambiguous terms. Invitees are not included in the Bill.  The duty owed an invitee is a high one.  The occupant must protect the invitee from unusual danger of which the occupant was aware or ought to have been aware.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to the benefit of the occupiers of the land in so far as it states the duties that they owe.  It is also of benefit to the licensee and the potential trespasser, as they know exactly what duty is owed to them, and it acts as a disincentive on the part of the trespasser to bring a speculative claim against the occupier of the land.</P>
    <P>Regarding the sections to the Bill, section 1 is the short title to the Bill. Section 2 deals with interpretation. Section 3 deals with the entry of land.  It states the occupier of land should not be under any obligation to a licensee to make it safe for use by him or in regard to anything that may be in, or on, or over the land, and shall be obliged only to give warning of the existence of any concealed danger which exists in the land and which is known to the occupier.  The section also determines that the occupier of land owes no duty of care to a trespasser, but is not entitled to intentionally harm a trespasser except in necessary self-defence or in defence of another person or in defence of his property.</P>
    <P>Section 4 ensures that nothing in the Act shall restrict, prejudice or affect the functions of the Minister for Finance or the Commissioner of Public Works regarding national monuments or any particular such monument, and section 5 states that the Act shall apply to State land, which is an important area.  This section would also cover land owned by local authorities or similar bodies, such as harbour boards and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> There are many areas regarding this issue which cause concern &mdash; for example, people who travel over occupier's land to get to seasides.  If people are debarred from going over such land, access to many quiet seaside resorts which people frequent will be limited. Most of the bigger resorts have public access, but many of our most beautiful resorts have private access only, or access over land owned by individual property owners or by the State or local authorities.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the farmers and land owners I appeal to the Minister to accept this simple but comprehensive legislation. It has been requested over many years.  The House was promised it in a debate on the 4 November 1992, almost 18 months ago.  I recall that the House debated the issue at length on the night that the Dáil fell.  The then Minister promised early legislation.  My party has had discussions on this issue and has raised it in the House on numerous occasions.  My colleague, Deputy Deenihan, has raised it on numerous occasions in the Dáil and still nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>I therefore appeal to the Government to allow the Bill proceed to Committee Stage where it can be amended if necessary. In the interests of law reform there should a unity and an openness by the Government in accepting the Bill.  The Fine Gael Party has received widespread support for the Bill from all of the national farming organisations and I appeal to the Minister to carefully consider the party's views on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Neville on a speech which was reasonable in tone and which indicated that he has clearly given some thought to the problems which require to be addressed in the area of occupier's liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the concerns which prompted the Senator to introduce his Bill and I am acutely aware of the anxieties felt by the farming community especially as a result of the unsatisfactory state of current law on this matter. <Col N="603" /> However, for the reasons which I will outline, the Government will not be accepting this Bill.</P>
    <P>This should not be interpreted as casting any doubt on the Government's commitment to change in the area.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> makes it clear that the Government will bring forward legislation during this year to reform and update the law in this area, taking into account the Law Reform Commission's report.  Within my Department a good deal of preliminary work has already been done and I am simply awaiting publication of the report of the commission in order to complete my proposals and seek Government approval for the drafting of an appropriate Bill.</P>
    <P>In this context, I stress that the matters under discussion are of broader import than the text of the Bill now before the House would suggest.  This is not just a problem for the farming community, although I would concede that farmers see themselves as being in an especially vulnerable position.  I have met with representatives from the farming organisations in the past and I have been struck by the genuine concern of those organisations to ensure that farm land continues to be available to the widest possible extent for a variety of sporting and recreational interests.  Indeed, I will be actively canvassing their views once the final report of the Law Reform Commission is published, which will be, I understand, in the course of the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>However, I emphasise again the importance of bearing in mind that the law of occupier's liability is concerned with the duty of care owed by all occupiers of premises or land towards entrants, whether invited or uninvited, who suffer either personal injury or property damage during the course of their visit.  It is concerned with striking a balance between a wide range of competing interests and should be seen in the context of the reasonable expectations of both occupier and entrant in a variety of domestic, social and commercial settings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> It was because the Government of the day recognised the fundamental complexity of this issue that a decision was taken to invite the Law Reform Commission to examine the law on occupier's liability and to make recommendations as to possible future courses of action. In its preliminary report, which ranged widely over the relevant law in other countries, the wisdom of entrusting this task to the commission was demonstrated clearly.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations of the commission, which are of course provisional, may be summarised as follows: legislation should provide for two classes of entrant onto premises &mdash; visitors and trespassers; the term &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; would essentially cover the old categories of invitee and licensee.  The duty owed to such an entrant would be the common duty of care and circumstances relevant to the discharge of such a duty would include the degree of care ordinarily to be looked for in such a visitor.  Warnings may also be sufficient to relieve an occupier from liability, provided that in all the circumstances they were enough to enable the visitor to be reasonably safe; the duty of an occupier towards a trespasser would be not to injure him intentionally and not to act with gross negligence towards him.  A special duty focused on the concept of reasonable care would apply in the case of foreseeable child trespassers under the age of 15; an occupier would be free to extend or reduce his statutory liability to an entrant by agreement or notice although, in the case of a reduction, such reduction must, in all the circumstances of the case, be reasonable and an occupier would not be under any obligation to discharge the common duty of care to a visitor in respect of risks willingly accepted by the visitor as his.</P>
    <P>The recommendations also cover more technical issues relating to an occupier's liability for the negligence of an independent contractor employed by him and the duty of an occupier, in a contractual situation, towards a &ldquo;stranger to the contract&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> The commission's recommendations must be seen against the background of the existing law on this issue since it is only through some understanding of that law that a genuine appreciation of the context within which change is being sought can be acquired.  Apart from contractual entrants, where the general rule is that the rights of such entrants are to be regulated by reference to the contract, persons who enter onto property have traditionally been classified into three categories &mdash; invitees, licensees and trespassers.</P>
    <P>In general terms, a person is an invitee where his or her presence on the property is likely to convey a material benefit upon the occupier, for example, a person who enters a shop in order to buy goods. Here, the duty of the occupier is to use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual dangers of which he knows, or ought to know.</P>
    <P>By contrast, a licensee is a person who is permitted to be on another's land but whose visit does not materially benefit the occupier, for example, a person who makes use of a public park or playground. The occupier's duty in this case is essentially to warn of concealed dangers of which he or she is aware.</P>
    <P>Finally, we come to the category of trespasser which, traditionally, was seen in terms of a person who goes onto property without an invitation of any sort and where the duty of the occupier was limited to not injuring them by intentional or reckless conduct.</P>
    <P>This formulation of the duty towards a trespasser did not, of course, take into account that trespassing activities could vary from the very innocent, particularly in the case of children, to the blatantly criminal.  In consequence, over the years, the courts have tried to ensure that deserving child plaintiffs were not denied a remedy at law.  It was in a case in the mid-1970s which involved injury to a child trespasser &mdash; McNamara <i>v</i>.  Electricity Supply Board &mdash; that the Supreme Court articulated clearly the legal basis of the duty which a defendant might owe in such circumstances.  In summary, the kernel of the judgment was that the occupier <Col N="606" /> owes a duty to trespassers whom he or she could reasonably foresee and that the duty in such a case was to take such reasonable care as the circumstances demand.</P>
    <P>The McNamara case, however, did not explore the issue as to whether a similar duty applied in relation to invitees and licensees and subsequent cases have not brought about a clear resolution of this matter.  In the absence of much statute law touching upon this issue &mdash; the Hotel Proprietors Act, 1963 being a notable exception &mdash; we essentially have a situation where the law has evolved as a result of various court decisions in the last few decades.  Many of those decisions have dealt with the position of trespassers and appear to suggest that, in many ways, trespassers may aspire to a higher duty of care than other more lawful entrants onto the land.  Clearly, this is an unsatisfactory situation both for landowners and for lawful entrants alike.</P>
    <P>Because of the worry which the current state of the law engenders, it is sometimes easy to forget that not every action for damages which comes before a court will necessarily be successful.  Similarly, it should not be automatically presumed that, in applying the current law to the material facts of an individual case, the courts will inevitably come down in favour of the plaintiff.  I think it is fair to say that the courts are not in the business of making substantial awards to plaintiffs whose claims lack substance.</P>
    <P>There can be very few Senators who are happy about the current state of the law on occupier's liability, but that is not the real issue we are debating tonight.  If it were, I believe there would be a fair degree of consensus on the matter and the rationale for this debate would be non-existent.</P>
    <P>What is, however, the real issue is the path of reform which we should choose to follow.  The law here is governed by decades of common law tradition.  It is clear that this tradition is no longer serving us as well as it might.  While statutory intervention is not always necessary in order to clarify matters, it can sometimes serve a useful purpose.  In the area of <Col N="607" /> occupiers' liability in particular, it is obvious that it would help to resolve much of the uncertainty which is at the heart of so much of the unease and disquiet which informs the debate on this topic.</P>
    <P>Aside from the valuable material which the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper has already offered to us, there are models for reform in other common law jurisdictions which have also been examined for the help they can offer.  The model which exists in England, and has been followed in a number of other countries, would seem to be working with a reasonable degree of success. In that country, in the 1950s, the state of the common law relating to the liability of occupiers of premises to their visitors had given rise to such a degree of criticism that the Lord Chancellor felt obliged to refer the matter to the Law Reform Committee. The recommendations made by that committee were in substance provided for in the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>The main change effected by that Act was to replace the rules of the common law under which the duty of an occupier differs according as the visitor is an invitee or a licensee.  Section 2 (1) of that Act provides that the occupier of premises owes the &ldquo;common duty of care&rdquo; to all his lawful visitors.  That term is defined as the duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purpose for which he is permitted or invited to be there.  An analogous duty has been extended to trespassers by the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>This approach is clearly a very flexible one.  The duty of care required will inevitably vary with the circumstances so that in the normal course of events there will be an expectation that a child will be less careful than an adult and that an adult will be alert to any special risks incidental to his visit.  Under the English legislation, it is also open to non-business occupiers, or business occupiers who allow visitors to enter free of charge, to historic sites, <Col N="608" /> for example, to exempt themselves from liability.  Landowners may also relieve themselves from liability in respect of risks which are willingly accepted by persons going onto the land.  Furthermore, in appropriate cases, the landowner may also discharge the duty of care which he may owe to entrants by erecting warning notices.</P>
    <P>Many American states also have legislative provisions relating specifically to entrants who use land for recreational purposes.  The feasibility of some such provision in this country is also being explored by me.</P>
    <P>I now turn specifically to the Bill which is the subject matter of this debate.  A Bill in similar terms was introduced by Fine Gael in the Dáil last year and the criticisms which I voiced on that occasion remain valid.  Indeed, the Law Reform Commission was able to consider that Bill in the context of its consultation paper.  As it points out, it reduces the duty of care to lawful visitors to that at present owed to licensees and it removes from an occupier any obligation not to show reckless disregard for trespassers, the only duty being not to harm such an entrant intentionally.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, matters are rather more complex than would appear from a perusal of Senator Neville's Bill.  There is a need for reform in this area but it has to be more substantial than is provided for here.  The Bill before us largely preserves the traditional distinction as between trespassers and licensees. However, it is silent as to the duty owed to invitees and I must admit to being somewhat unclear as to what their situation would be were this Bill to become law.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also a very blunt instrument which does not distinguish between the position of a child who may go onto property to rescue a ball and a burglar who comes with the intent to steal.  While there may well be some who take the view that young children, if injured by the reckless actions of an occupier, should not be entitled to seek to recover damages, I am not one of them and I am sure that many who pause to consider the <Col N="609" /> matter carefully will also be worried by the course of action proposed here.</P>
    <P>On matters of detail, there are some problems with the interpretation section of the Bill; there is no attempt to define what is meant by an occupier nor is there any recognition that claims can arise other than in relation to land.  Also, the Bill, because of its abbreviated nature, fails to consider fully all the various ramifications of the occupier-entrant relationship. For example, where the occupier of premises is bound by the terms of a contract to permit persons who are strangers to that contract to enter onto his premises, there is the question of the nature of the duty in that case.  There is also the question of the liability of a landlord where he or she may be under an obligation to keep in repair the premises occupied by the tenant.  Again, if legislation is to be meaningful and helpful in this area it must address these issues or, at the very least, it must be made plain as to why it is not addressing them.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be unduly harsh in my criticisms of this Bill.  I recognise what Senator Neville is attempting to do and I am sympathetic to the concerns which motivate him.  However, I do not favour the precise approach which he is taking to solve what are very real problems.  I am in favour of legislative reform in this area.  I want landowners to have a clearer sense than they have at present about where their responsibilities lie in relation to those who come onto their land.</P>
    <P>I intend to do as much as is feasible to ensure that land can continue to be available for recreational pursuits without fear of vexatious litigation.  However, if the law in this area is to be got right, it is necessary to put together coherent legislative proposals which will deal with all the issues raised by this matter.  Such legislation will be brought forward by me this year and I look forward to debating it in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not use all of my ten minutes because I have only a few words to say.  They are supportive of this Bill and the tenor of its objectives.  The Minister has already complimented Senator <Col N="610" /> Neville on the purpose of this Bill and the moderate tone of his words, which I also support.</P>
      <P>However, it seems that there is a serious need for urgency in this matter. It is outrageous and ludicrous that we have allowed a situation to continue which forces occupiers to block access to beaches, farms, rivers and the countryside. Such access has been traditional and established over many years.  Good citizenship should not be punished.  An act of generosity which has been traditional in Ireland should not be banned because of the way the law would appear to have moved in recent years.  We have allowed this situation to develop because we have not stressed this urgency.</P>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Neville and the very committed concern which he expressed, I came here tonight to support this Bill.  However, I also listened to the Minister who referred to Senator Neville's Bill as being simple.  This Bill will need some further comprehension.  I gather that the Minister, in his words, has responded to the urgency which Senator Neville has placed upon him.  However, I was surprised to learn only now that a similar Bill was introduced last year in the Dáil.  I am delighted to hear the Minister giving us his word that a Bill will be initiated this year and will depend on the Law Reform Commission's report.</P>
      <P>I stress the need for urgency.  The situation which Senator Neville has described here is placing many of the traditional rights of our people at risk and this Bill is clearly long overdue. However, I find that this has been put on the long finger for many years although Britain and many other states in Europe have introduced legislation to attempt to solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by the Minister's words tonight and the care which he has taken to ensure that he will act immediately on the Law Reform Commission's report which is expected in a few week's time.  I congratulate Senator Neville for drawing attention to this need for legislation and I also congratulate the Minister for responding.  We in this House have learned in the past that on occasions <Col N="611" /> Ministers have not always been able to find the legislative time to get these Bills passed.  I urge the House not only to encourage the Minister but to insist that he demand Cabinet and Oireachtas time for the legislation which he promised today, I suppose because of the urgency of Senator Neville's insistence.  I believe that this Bill will be introduced this year. I welcome the Minister's commitment to do so.  On those grounds, I think Senator Neville's Bill will have achieved its objective, if not today then certainly later on this year.  I congratulate the Minister on his response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going to divide in this House on whether it was right for Senator Neville to present a Bill or whether the Minister should have had an opportunity to do so.  The issue is bigger and much more important than that and I welcome the Minister's positive response.  He has given the House an undertaking that he will bring in a Bill; I welcome that.  This matter is very important. We all come from different walks in life and those who are interested in the tourist industry believe that tourists should be able to climb mountains and so on.  That is a point of view which can be commended.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for having consulted with the farming community. However, he said that he had &ldquo;been struck by the genuine concern of these organisations to ensure that farmland continues to be available, to the widest possible extent, for a variety of sporting and recreational interests&rdquo;.  The Minister must be given enough time and must consult with the parliamentary draftsman. The Bill must have open and honest debate and everybody's concerns must be on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see tourists using our beaches and mountaineering &mdash; which is a big part of tourism development. However, I also see that farmers have a genuine problem.  I am a farmer, of a kind, myself.  A farmer must be protected in case he sprays his land and somebody goes onto the farm uninvited and claims <Col N="612" /> damages, injury, or whatever, afterwards. A farmer must be protected in case somebody travelling on the road, opens a gate to go into a farm to spend a penny and falls into a drain or injure themselves.</P>
    <P>Farmers must be consulted in the widest sense and their interests must be totally protected.  There are a hundred and one different reasons.  I have a farm which is beside a golf driving range and it is common to see missiles coming across. There is no fear there but I am thinking of all the different aspects of the problem which can arise.  I had an experience where dogs came onto the land and chased an animal.  The animal went across a ditch, was injured and had to be put down.  Where does one go for compensation in such a case?  Where is the farmer's protection?</P>
    <P>This is so wide an issue that, while I believe Senator Neville is sincere in bringing the Bill before the House, the Minister must have time to make a proper study of the matter.  All the interests involved have to be protected.  These include tourist interests, national interests, landowners and the problem of conacre farmers.  In my own county there is a substantial number of conacre farmers. There are also people with small holdings who have to emigrate and lease their land for a longer period.  All aspects of the problem will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I see a great difference between farm land, beaches and mountain ranges and these should be categorised for access purposes.  When the Bill is being prepared the widest possible consultation should take place with all interest groups. The bottom line is that the landowner who is responsible must be completely protected from any kind of damages arising directly or indirectly.  The origins of claims are too numerous to mention but practical farm work involves drainage, farm machinery, sprays, pesticides and other items.  A dangerous animal may attack someone in a field.  It is not enough to expect the farmer to put up a notice and expect everything to be all right thereafter.  That is not a solution.  The landowner must have a protection that is <Col N="613" /> clearly understood by everybody.  This is an important, fundamental right of a citizen and the land he owns.  I welcome the opportunity to express my strong views about this.</P>
    <P>I know from his contribution that the Minister understands it is too simple to come in with a proposal which goes through when it is seconded.  Everybody in the House would warmly welcome a Bill of this nature, which is long overdue. It is clear that the Minister is interested in putting a Bill before the House that will be broadly welcomed and will cover the situation that has been awaiting legislation for so long.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the co-proposers of this Bill I am very interested in what the Minister has to say.  The absence of a Bill in relation to the liabilities of farmers, property owners and trustees of playgrounds, public authorities and others, for all accidents occurring on their property &mdash; and in particular where the injured party is a trespasser &mdash; is an absolute disgrace.  This Government and the previous Government can be accused of gross negligence and incompetence for neglecting badly needed amending legislation. Apart from political organisations, numerous groups have pressured this Government and the last Government to bring forward the necessary amending legislation but all to no avail.</P>
      <P>There is great public disquiet in many areas regarding this issue.  If we look at our neighbours in Britain and Northern Ireland we find that legislation is in place whereby property owners have a clear understanding of their liabilities in respect of claims.  In order to convince the Minister and the Government of the importance of this issue I will attempt to outline the many categories that are badly affected.  They include all property owners, all sporting organisations who provide facilities for the general public, public parks, rights of way, and other areas frequented by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past ten years the general public have become very conscious of <Col N="614" /> their rights to make claims against other people.  I accept that due care should be taken by owners of property who allow the general public to frequent their property, but I feel strongly about claims taken against property owners by people who injure themselves while trespassing on that property.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about liabilities we must ensure that reversible liability is established as well.  If someone comes onto my property and damages it, it should be clearly established that I am entitled to compensation.  I wish to point out to the Minister the damaging effect that this issue has on agri-tourism.  Heretofore farmers allowed easy access to their hills, rivers, bogs, forestry plantations, farmyard enterprises and their beautiful countryside sites.  With so many people, particularly from our cities and towns, visiting the country, farmers and other property owners feel that such is the risk of potential claims and unnecessary demands upon them that they now safeguard themselves and their families from public liability claims by closing their property to access by the general public.  Would the Minister blame them?</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to bring to the Minister's notice is the problem of public parks and children's playground areas which are essential facilities in any built-up area and are widely used by the general public.  So many claims have been successful that the cost of public liability insurance is prohibitive.  Most of these parks are under the control of either local committees or trustees.  We now find that some are being closed and in other cases facilities for children have been removed, rendering these parks useless in certain cases.  This is as a direct result of the present situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to give an example I found in our own town.  We have a very nice park in Gorey for which public liability insurance started at £1,000.  Within a period of five years the insurance company raised it to £3,000 so the committee, mostly made up of trustees, shopped around but could not obtain cheaper cover.  In fact, other companies seemed to increase the premium quoted.  As a <Col N="615" /> result of that the committee removed all the facilities for children and were advised by their solicitors to close the park.  They then came to the county council, of which I am chairman, and we agreed to carry the can just for this year. This facility in Gorey is an important one. If the law is not changed soon I can see a situation arising where parks and playgrounds around the country will have to close because of high claims and high premiums for public liability cover. Nobody will be in a position to raise that type of money to pay for insurance.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>The same situation exists in most towns.  Trustees are in a delicate position because claims can arise for £100,000 for an injury to any child, and they are liable if the insurance will not cover it.  Many insurance companies find it extremely difficult to quote for any public liability. They see the red light immediately when you try to move from one insurance company to another and they are not prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with national monuments under the control of the Office of Public Works.  A large number of these monuments, such as castles, are situated on farmers' private property a long way from a public road.  No doubt the Minister is familiar with the difficulties faced by the Office of Public Works &mdash; the State body responsible for our national monuments and national parks &mdash; in relation to claims.  The Office of Public Works is dealing with public money but what about the ordinary farmer or landowner with one of these monuments on his land which the public are continuously crossing to gain access? Who is carrying the liability for any claims that may be taken in such cases?  I am reliably informed that the farmer is responsible as far as access is concerned. It is all right for the Office of Public Works to carry their share because they are dealing with public funds but, unfortunately, the ordinary farmer is liable for any injuries sustained by people while crossing his land.  This is a completely unacceptable situation and one that will <Col N="616" /> result in these monuments being fenced off and signs requesting the general public not to cross such lands.  This would be an awful loss as some of our beautiful historic monuments will be fenced off thus barring the public from access to our own heritage.  This would be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Farmers with national monuments, which could be described as Government property, situated on their lands are at great risk.  They are seeking a statutory provision which will exempt them from any liability or duty of care in respect of trespassers, people who use their lands for sporting or recreational purposes and visitors to their property.  Such provisions are included in our Bill.  It is a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>Fox hunting and beagle hunting also take place on land.  There is a great tradition of fox hunting in this country.  It is fundamentally important to the Irish horse industry.  Last weekend I spoke with the chairperson of the local fox hunting organisation.  He said that approximately 50 per cent of all lands are prohibited to the hunt due to the public liability situation and that percentage is increasing each year.  He said that if it continued for the next four or five years, only about 20 per cent of land would be accessible to the hunt.  This will, he believes, finish fox hunting in the area.</P>

      <P>These matters cannot be ignored by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are not the only people who are unhappy with the present law on occupier's liability.  A number of Departments are concerned.  The Department of Energy is concerned with the claims made against the State in respect of injuries suffered by people in State forests. Restrictions have been placed on public access to certain State lands, which include forest parks and amenity areas, as a result of the present law.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has expressed concern about the possible adverse implications for the growth of <Col N="617" /> agri-tourism and what is perceived to be a high duty of care on the occupier.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education has expressed concern about the impact of the law on outdoor sporting activities. Sporting organisations are concerned about the effect dissatisfaction with the present law will have on the activities of their members.  Gun clubs have been particularly perturbed by farmers' threats to cut off access to their lands.  They have supported calls from the farming community for an easing of the duty of care on farmers in respect of trespassers.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot continue to say that the question is being examined by the Law Reform Commission.  How long must we wait for this legislation? How much damage must be done in the intervening period?  The Minister said the matter is being actively considered. However, on Wednesday, 4 November 1992, the Seanad was given the same reply by the previous Minister.  This is unacceptable.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this Bill on Second Stage.  We are prepared to be reasonable.  I would accept a waiting period of two months &mdash; I am not speaking on behalf of Senator Neville &mdash; to give the Minister time to formulate his Bill.  Amendments can be proposed which, if they are reasonable, will be accepted.  Do not let this matter drag on as it has for the last five years. The Minister would have to go to the country to understand the degree of public concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I appreciate Senator Neville's concern about this matter.  People who have monuments on their land have brought to my notice their concern about people <Col N="618" /> who visit such monuments and the problems that may arise subsequently.</P>
      <P>Everybody remembers that, as children, they used shortcuts across their neighbours' lands.  Thanks to the motor car the use of such shortcuts is not as prevalent now.  Everybody remembers going for walks in the countryside; some people may have gone hunting.  Many of our national games would have been lost but for the goodwill of land owners who allowed young fellows to play on their land.  In those days there was little heard about litigation or compensation.  Goodwill prevailed between owners of land and visitors to the land.  We do not want to lose that great facility of goodwill and we appreciate that legislation on this matter is necessary.</P>
      <P>If legislation is not introduced soon sports, such as fishing, fowling, hunting, open coursing, drag hunts, orienteering and even visits to the seaside, could be severely curtailed.  Biology or geography teachers often take children onto farms or mountains for educational visits.  Such activities and school outings will be stopped if adequate legislation is not introduced.</P>
      <P>Historic sites are the cause of greatest concern.  Farmers see people arriving on their land and possibly climbing old ruins and there is a serious danger that the wall might crumble beneath the visitor.  Many farmers are seriously considering fencing off such structures.  That will be a severe loss.  Visits to holy wells, old castles, historic sites and so forth may be finished for good.  There is also a danger that a person, mindful of the danger, might decide to bulldoze the historic structure so that people will no longer visit it. There are always dangers for the visitor or tourist on the land and we need legislation to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether injuries are serious or slight, the greatest curse is claims for compensation. Many claims have been made; there is a question whether some claims were justified.  As the Minister said, there is a big difference between a child going onto a property to retrieve a ball and a burglar who trespasses with the intention of stealing.  We need comprehensive <Col N="619" /> legislation to deal with that.  This matter will be dealt with under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The farming community and property owners are concerned that something be done.  The Minister has promised that comprehensive legislation will be introduced this year.  The Law Reform Commission is examining the situation.</P>
    <P>We need such legislation to deal with the many situations that arise involving, for example, the visitor to the land, the person who implies that they have a right to visit because there is a historic site on the land, people who use a shortcut across a field to reach a site, visitors travelling through different fields to reach a site etc.  It is important to note that if legislation which closes the loopholes is introduced it will be the answer to an important problem.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Neville's concern. He knows what people want and I believe the Minister will introduce comprehensive legislation in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <P>The Progressive Democrats support this Bill unreservedly.  On 1 December 1993 my party moved a motion in this House.  It stated among other things that&mdash;</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to... bring forward effective legislative proposals... to provide for more realistic duties of care for landowners, employers and owners of premises in respect of liability to the public and employees;</P>
      <P>That motion was accepted by the Government.  I was very encouraged by the reply given by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Seamus Brennan. However, time has moved on and nothing has happened.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform is now with us, so one wonders who has responsibility for this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the appreciation shown for Senator Neville and his Bill, I am disappointed the Government did not come in with a concrete alternative proposal. <Col N="620" /> Even accepting that more comprehensive legislation is needed in this area, this Bill would be a good start because this matter is of serious concern to landowners all over the nation.  It would be good to begin with what we have before us.  This matter has been debated repeatedly in this House over an extended period and we have had indications at all times that it is being sympathetically considered. Yet still nothing happens.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> deals with this issue and that it is intended to bring forward legislation this year to reform and update the law in this area.  I accept that assurance, but such legislation is totally overdue.  There can be no degree of pride in telling the House of this intention.  We have gone past the stage when something should have been done.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, given the numerical strength of the Progressive Democrats in Seanad Éireann, it was not possible for my party to bring forward a Bill so we dealt with this matter by way of motion. Concern has frequently been expressed by different parties on this side of the House on this issue, and those attitudes have been supported by those on the other side of the House this evening.</P>
    <P>I am a landowner, although I am not sure that I can be called a farmer.  My land borders on the River Liffey.  I want people to enjoy the land of Ireland and to fish on the water running beside my land.  Regrettably, I increasingly find myself in a position where I may be forced to deny people access to something I believe to be a right &mdash; the right to access to the countryside.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious in all the rhetoric spouted about promoting tourism, it is only reasonable to expect those who come to visit our country should be able to enjoy the countryside and have access to it.  Effectively we are denying them access because I have to seriously consider putting up a notice saying &ldquo;Keep out&rdquo;.  I do not want to do that, but it is what I am being forced to do.  Senator McGowan raised the question of leasing <Col N="621" /> land.  I lease land from other landowners and I have to take out public liability insurance on that land.  I am prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>This issue has become a nonsensical quagmire.  The North Kildare Trout and Salmon Anglers Association has access to the waters of the Liffey.  That association takes out its own public liability insurance, and as a trustee of that association, I ask at each annual general meeting whether the insurance is in order, because I am the person liable under law in the event that it is not.  Association members who fish the waters are covered by the association's public liability insurance and by my public liability insurance as a landowner.  However, the poacher who comes across the land is not covered by insurance and I am supposed to pay that bill.  This is ludicrous and no one could defend that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no poachers on the Liffey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly knows the current position in Clare is that landowners are denying people access across their land to reach monuments.  How does this fit in with the rhetoric about developing our tourism resources?  It does not add up.  If someone wants to organise a rural show, the first matter they must address is the bill for public liability insurance.  When a community comes together to raise money for itself, it is prevented from doing so by the law.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given us a legal treatise, and I am sorry I am not a law student because the current legal position has been clearly explained.  That is not at issue because the law needs to be changed.  The Minister said the law in this area is governed by decades of common law tradition, but it is clear this tradition is no longer serving us as well as it might. In truth it is not serving us at all.  That is why the Bill before the House in Senator Neville's name should be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One clause in the Bill covers State property.  The public liability insurance premium for Kildare County Council is £525,000 per year.  In addition to that the council must find a further £100,000 to <Col N="622" /> pay the first £5,000 of claims.  There is something seriously wrong when one county must pay a charge of £625,000 and this is the reason for the urgency in the pleas to the Government to bring forward the legislation.</P>
    <P>Once again we hear about the Law Reform Commission report.  We suffer from having too many reports &mdash; the Culliton report, the Moriarty report, etc. When we ask the Government to do something the standard response is to produce another report.  It takes a year to produce the report and it may take another year for the Government to act on it, if it does so at all.  By that stage the Government has changed and the process starts again.  This is a recipe for doing nothing, a sclerosis of the system.  We will gradually grind to a halt if we cannot address and deal with these problems effectively.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned the question of putting up warning signs.  I have a slurry lagoon on my land and I have put up warning signs advising people of this danger.  Those signs have been vandalised. In the event of an accident I do not know whether I can be said to have taken reasonable care.  These are serious questions for landowners and they are concerned about these issues.</P>
    <P>The onus should be on the person entering the land, including those invited on to the land.  By all means there should be a duty of reasonable care on the landowner, but there should also be an onus on the person going onto the land.  At present the onus is in the wrong direction, not least because it is affecting employment, tourism and the economic life of the country as well as affecting individuals.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he accepts the broad import of the Bill and I take that statement in good faith.  In those circumstances, and if the Government cannot accept this legislation, it is under a serious obligation to bring an alternative Bill to the House.  I do not see evidence of that this evening and I see only limited evidence of a will to address that problem in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The question of playgrounds has been dealt with by Senator D'Arcy, and what he said is correct.  What is the point of <Col N="623" /> people banding together or of local authorities providing facilities if those facilities are closed down for insurance purposes?  Those who are injured should be compensated, particularly when children are involved who may not know the implications of entering property.  Something is seriously amiss and the problem must be tackled quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chuir roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach agus comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Seanadóir Neville maidir leis an mBille. This is a timely issue we are discussing because it is a big problem for the farming community.  I am delighted the Minister has been so positive and has said he will introduce a Bill this year.  I am also pleased that he has not brought in a Bill too hastily.  Some might ask why we cannot deal with this issue quickly, but this is a complex problem.</P>
      <P>Mountain climbing and orienteering have been pastimes for adults and school groups for many years.  Mountains were previously regarded as commonage and people walked across paths and fields. Our show committee in Grange is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year but we are finding it difficult to get insurance. For the first 30 years we never had insurance and no one looked for it.  Children often went home from school across the fields, but no one looked for compensation if someone tripped across a fence and cut their leg.  There is an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today about a person who took an action against the local authority because he fell on the footpath while playing football.  He got £7,500, although he admitted in court that his injuries had healed and he was in perfect health.  I am sure it was only a scratch like we all got on our knees when we were young.</P>
      <P>When these claims have been completed, how much does the injured person get and how much is given to the legal profession?  The Minister could answer that question, but he probably will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the valuation business does not get the same amount of work as the legal business does.</P>
      <P>We are living in an era where people want to claim for everything.  Sheep owners who own land on a mountainside can be prosecuted as a group.  This is a complex area, therefore legislation must be introduced to cater for such open territory, which everybody feels they are entitled to use.  People can claim against a group of individuals.</P>
      <P>Over the years problems have arisen about monuments on land in County Sligo because the Office of Public Works would not erect stiles and make pathways to them, as I suggested at a county council meeting.  This could then be used as the official entrance to the monument and anyone injured outside this area would not be able to claim compensation because they should not be there.  This should be incorporated in the law.</P>
      <P>There are many angles to this problem. Trespassers who go into a field where there is a bull or a cross cow could get injured.  If a dog runs under a gate into a field and a child runs after it, he could fall and risk injury.  I agree with the Minister for highlighting the report from the Law Reform Commission because this situation must be teased out carefully and we must ensure that farmers in all circumstances are protected.  A business premises is a confined area which people may go into as often as they like, but a farm could stretch for miles along a road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to build paths to monuments because no visitor should have the right to wander over a man's land.  Farmers could have sprayed the land with weed killer and it could be poisonous.  If someone chewed a blade of grass, which people did long ago, one could be poisoned.  One cannot pick up a golf ball now and lick it clean, as was done in the past, because herbicides are used on the land and one could become seriously ill.  These angles must be considered. Long ago there were specific paths and stiles to monuments so that people did not go through a farmer's land.  However, at present there are no designated paths to these monuments. <Col N="625" /> We cannot afford to refuse access to them because they are a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies are to blame for some of these problems because they will settle a claim for less than £10,000 and they will not go through the courts.  This encourages people to settle for £7,000 or £8,000.  As a result, a person's insurance is increased.  The insurance company does not ask the person for his opinion, but he is paying the Bill.  There is a saying that the man who pays the piper calls the tune.  However, this is not true of the insurance company, which calls the tune and the person pays the bill.  The Minister is correct to carefully examine this.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville is correct to bring this Bill before the House because it is a serious problem in rural Ireland today. Because farmers are worried that people will get injured on their land, they have erected notices which state that no trespassers are allowed.  However, I am told these signs do not give them any protection, but at least they warn people that they are entering land at their own risk. However, a farmer would need a notice at every gap on the land because one is not sufficient.  One notice is sufficient if there is poison on the land because it is someone's bad luck if they get poisoned. The law is clear in this regard, provided one has erected a notice stating that the land is poisoned.  However, I am not sure if a notice which states that people are entering at their own risk is sufficient in the eyes of the law.</P>
    <P>Shooting has been a great pastime in the country over the years.  Gun clubs are now taking out insurance and they are organising their activities in conjunction with the farmers.  However, if someone who is not a member of the gun club poaches on the land and gets injured, the farmer is blamed because the gun club insurance will not cover him.  The same applies to fishing, as Senator Dardis said.</P>
    <P>There are many serious situations which must be considered, because any Bill we introduce must be watertight and it must ensure that the farmer is protected. Farmers were always willing to allow people through their land and they never refused access to it.  However, fear is now preventing them from continuing to do so.  I am glad the Minister will <Col N="626" /> introduce a Bill before the end of the year which will safeguard the farming community in this country.  I thank the Minister for the interest he has shown in this issue.  As an eminent lawyer, I am sure he and his draftsman will look at this worthwhile legislation.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill because this matter is important to everyone.  I congratulate Senator Neville for introducing this Bill again and giving Members an opportunity to vote on the important matter of occupiers' liability.  Fine Gael feel strongly about this issue.  This matter was raised in the other House by Deputy Deenihan.  He pressed this matter and a full discussion took place, but unfortunately the Government voted against it.  I gather it intends to vote against Senator Neville's Bill this evening.  Perhaps the Government is unhappy with some of the proposals contained in Senator Neville's Bill.  However, he is someone who is most accommodating and I ask the Government not to vote against the Bill, but to allow it to reach Committee Stage.  Fine Gael &mdash; and I am sure we have the support of other parties &mdash; will try to bring this Bill to Committee Stage.  It is important for everyone.</P>
      <P>In Ireland there has always been a proud history of allowing people enter onto lands to shoot, hunt, fish, swim or walk for exercise.  The farming community has always been generous in this regard.  In the past people did not damage lands.  This issue first arose 12 to 14 years ago when someone broke their leg walking in County Wicklow.  A case was taken to the High Court and £14,000 was awarded. From that point on there has been a huge amount of litigation on this issue.  I was amazed by that decision.  However, if one had the opportunity to listen to all the facts one might arrive at a different decision and I am sure the correct one was reached in that particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> At present the law is unsatisfactory and it must be changed.  I appeal to the Minister to concede that the Bill Senator Neville presented is one which is worthy of approval by the House and that we proceed with it to Committee Stage. Farming organisations are concerned about the unsatisfactory state of the law. It brings the law into disrepute if a trespasser who enters lands and is injured can claim against the farmer who may be at home in bed or at home with his family. This injury may be received through no fault, or through little fault of the farmer, because the injured party must prove negligence.  The farmer is faced with defending the action even if there is no decree against him.  Although the individual taking the case may have no means, the farmer must defend himself and he may incur a lot of expense.  That unsatisfactory situation must be looked at.</P>
    <P>I come from the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly and tourism is important in this area.  Clonmacnoise, the Slieve Bloom Mountains and the River Shannon are located there and farmers are developing their farms as open ones. Many people grant holiday makers, including a lot of foreigners, permission to enter onto lands.  However, the situation is so unsatisfactory that farmers are beginning to prevent people from entering onto their lands.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator Neville for introducing this Bill.  Given that the Government will not introduce its legislation before the end of this session, another summer will pass with farmers being left in a state of limbo.  I appeal to the Government to accept this Bill.  We do not want to sound triumphant; we want commonsense and sanity brought back to an area which is at present a minefield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that the people are able to freely enjoy the environment, something which we all aspire to, and that we are able to develop our tourism industry.  This is not possible and that is why this legislation is before the House.  I congratulate Senator Neville, Senator D'Arcy and Deputy Deenihan, in particular, for initiating this in the <Col N="628" /> other House.  This has been a matter of great aggravation and public discussion for a long time.  This Bill should not be before the House because the Government has had plenty of time to bring forward its legislation since Deputy Deenihan brought it to the attention of the other House.  Given that the Government has not done so, we ask that it use this legislation as a basis to produce what it would deem to be the finished product. This should be done immediately, because the Government has not yet reacted to this urgent matter.</P>
      <P>We all agree that we must take responsibility for guests &mdash; people we invite into our houses or onto our property or lands.  However, it is untenable that it could cost a person a large sum of money if someone goes onto their land without their knowledge.  There are two sides to this: first, the proprietor should not be faced with that type of problem and, second, there should be some degree of protection for an injured individual if the law decides that protection is necessary.</P>
      <P>This issue is a minefield and it is preventing the development of the tourism Industry.  There are many lakes in County Monaghan which provide good fishing grounds but to gain access to them one has to cross someone's property. Until now the situation was relaxed and people allowed strangers access, although they were worried.  People are always talking about preventing access and in some cases this has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a hotel whose public liability insurance is offered on a month by month basis.  That is only one hotel, but I have heard rumours about others.  As far as the insurance company is concerned, the hotel should get its act together or close. How can a hotel cope with the strain which exists because of the epidemic of claims in certain areas?  The situation is detrimental because the cost of public liability insurance is enormous and it limits development.  This illustrates the type of difficulties faced by those who own property and who must cover huge claims made by people on their property without their knowledge.  I ask the Minister and the Government to accept this Bill and to amend it if necessary.  It is <Col N="629" /> essential that this matter is dealt with now so that we are fair to every citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy both with the Minister and with Senator Neville in trying to put down a legal framework that will in some way deal with the situation in which we find ourselves. I do not wish to unduly delay the House as a lot of what I would say is repeating what has been said here already.  This matter must be dealt with urgently.  The situation is serious and positive legal action must be taken to deal with the problems that are arising in what has been described here as a complex situation.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, when the decision was made to refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission, it was anticipated that the Law Reform Commission would deal expeditiously with this and would come up with a report very quickly.  This did not happen.  It was several years before the recent report of the Law Reform Commission was made available. I would like to share the Minister's optimism that we will have a final report from the Law Reform Commission within the next few weeks and that in a very short time after that, the Minister, with his own professional advisers, will produce a Bill to be brought before the House here.  I would very much like to think that will be the case and I support him in taking whatever action is necessary to ensure that happens, but we have waited a long time to get the initial report from the Law Reform Commission.  I read that report in so far as I could.  It was a complex report which raised many very relevant but nonetheless complex issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the view that has been expressed here by some speakers that we should take Senator Neville's Bill, good as it may be, and because of the absence of some other framework use it as a first step.  It is important, since we have already waited so long, that we await the final report of the Law Reform Commission and the considered views of the Minister.  I strongly suggest that the set up a select committee of the House to examine the report and put a final formula in place.  I recommend the greatest urgency in dealing with the situation <Col N="630" /> because it is one that people are getting very impatient about and quite a lot of damage may be done in many areas unless it is speedily dealt with.</P>
    <P>This time last year I attended a meeting of the Clare Tourism Council which expressed very grave reservations about the situation.  They pointed out that many of the important historical and tourism sites in the county have been fenced off because of the absence of legislation in this area.  Access to important sites like Leamaugh Castle and the Poulnabrone dolmen was not provided last year because it was unclear what the liability position was.  Many more areas will be fenced off this coming season.</P>
    <P>I attended a very important meeting of the Clare branch of the Irish Farmers Association a few nights ago, when the President of the IFA spoke out very strongly about this situation and demanded some Government action to deal with it.  I say these things to underline the gravity of the situation that we are faced with and the necessity of dealing with it urgently.  I urge the Law Reform Commission to speed up the final report.  Let us have a clear indication from the Law Reform Commission in the next few weeks as to how they suggest this should be dealt with.  The matter is one for the Minister after that.</P>
    <P>In the event of this report not being available in the next few weeks I strongly suggest that the Minister set up his own advisory team of professional people to advise him in this area, because I would not go through the embarrassment again &mdash; we have had it before on a number of occasions &mdash; of having to come in and on the basis that Government legislation will be forthcoming, vote down genuine legislation put forward here because people in the Opposition feel the necessity to deal urgently with matters of this nature. Further delays in this area are just not acceptable.  I strongly suggest that in the event of the Law Reform Commission not bringing forward their report within the next few weeks, as the Minister has indicated here tonight, he take some professional advice that will bring forward a solution in a few weeks or months so that we can see a framework of legislation before the end of this year.  These promises <Col N="631" /> have been made and the people are expecting some action on them.</P>
    <P>I am quite sympathetic with the Minister's position.  I understand that it is a complex area.  The law here is not clear, but when the law is not clear in matters of this nature it brings the law into disrepute, or at least brings an increase in litigation and claims.  The enormous number of claims which have arisen in this area over the last few years has indicated very clearly that there are very grave doubts about what the law is. People will endeavour to get the benefit of the doubt in legal situations like this.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why it has not been possible to use the model the Minister mentioned here tonight, that is the legislation which was used in the United Kingdom almost 40 years ago.  Occupiers' liability legislation was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1957.  The same kind of legislation operates in the northern counties.  The situation in the United Kingdom has been largely regulated because of that and further legislation which was introduced in 1984.  That model, plus a number of others, could be examined and could provide a satisfactory solution to this problem.  A totally satisfactory solution to this problem will never be found but a solution could be found that will make it quite clear what people's liabilities and responsibilities are.</P>
    <P>While I fully believe that owners have liabilities and responsibilities, some latitude must be allowed and the State must have some involvement as well, especially in areas where public monuments and people's property are involved and where public rights to beaches and other places are concerned.  Quite near to my home access to one of the most important beaches in west Clare has been fenced off for a number of years because of a claim which was brought arising from injuries to people in the sandhills.  These are legitimate claims, and if I were in a similar situation I would do the same. But the Government has a responsibility to deal clearly and effectively with this, and to do so urgently and quickly.  We do not want to find ourselves back here in a year's time, with legislation again before <Col N="632" /> the House, still relying on the fact that the Law Reform Commission are the professional advisers and that the Departments do not have to come up with a formula to deal with this.  It has gone beyond that stage now.  I want to impress upon the Minister my full support for the position he is adopting.  I am not satisfied with the Law Reform Commission because we are waiting years for this report.</P>
    <P>It is not the best procedure to adopt a measure simply because it is on the table. The Government must table a well thought out and researched Bill.  It will probably be necessary for the Opposition to amend that Bill when the time comes. I am prepared to go along with the Minister's comments here tonight.  I have every sympathy with him in the difficult task he has ahead of him.  He can be sure of our support, but I would like to see the Bill introduced speedily and urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I must put on the record that, as a spokesperson for Democratic Left, I support the Bill.  The most urgent need, if this Bill is to be voted down, is for the Minister to bring in alternative legislation.  For some time past the issue has become very contentious.  There is a lot of tension and ill will developing.  We do not want tension between the urban and rural communities.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a statement to the effect that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> makes it plain that the Government will bring forward legislation during the year to reform and update the law in this area, taking into account the Law Reform Commission report.  I ask that a specific commitment be given in that regard, that the Bill will be introduced in the next session, and that it will be introduced if Senator Neville's Bill is to be voted down this evening.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the situation in England where it is open to non-business occupiers or business occupiers to allow visitors to enter free of charge an historic site, for example, to exempt themselves from liability.  One can rest assured that in this country we will never succeed in getting the voluntary assumption of risk because that is the attitude we have adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> The gun clubs are well organised and disciplined and they have their own insurance cover which is adequate. However, they have expressed concern on this matter.  In my area of north Cork there are many national monuments. Among them is Spencer's Castle and it was only recently pointed out to me that we might not have access to it.  The landowners in that area are reasonable people but that could change.  The most concern is being shown by landowners who have land adjacent to residential developments where there is the likelihood of young people going onto the land and, naturally, young people might show less care than older people.</P>
    <P>In discussing this contentious matter with some landowners in my area I have tried to argue that the onus is on the trespasser to prove negligence but they would not listen to that.  If we were to debate the Bill on Committee Stage section 3 (1) would be the subject of a lot of debate.  It includes the condition that an occupier must &ldquo;only give warning of the existence of any concealed danger which exists on the land and which is actually known to the occupier&rdquo; which would be contentious.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I, appeal for legislation to be introduced expeditiously if this Bill is to be voted down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply although I do not agree with it.  I thank the Senators for their kind remarks and, especially, Senator Quinn, Senator Dardis and Senator Sherlock who supported me although they are not members of my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of liability is complex and this is why we chose the landowners' aspect of it.  This is important because this aspect concerns more people than any other. We accept that the matter is complex and we believe our Bill can form part of more complex legislation.  However, it is necessary to introduce our Bill immediately to cover the most important aspect of the matter.  There is an immediate problem and, as Senator Enright said, another summer will pass without anything being done.  Many people will be concerned; many tourists will be prevented from <Col N="634" /> seeing our national monuments; many people will be refused permission to go onto land to view the scenery or to walk to lakes to fish.</P>
    <P>Parts of the Minister's speech were supportive of the contents of the Bill and I thought he might accept it but, unfortunately, he did not.  His reservations relate to certain aspects which could be fully catered for on Committee Stage.  One of those was that &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; was not defined in the Bill, although this could be done by means of a simple amendment.  On Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993, earlier today we had 36 amendments.  Of those, 26 were Government amendments.  If that many amendments can be proposed in the Seanad to a Bill which had already gone through the Dáil, it should be acceptable to amend this Bill to deal with any reservations the Minister might have and improve the Bill.  If the Government accept the Bill I will fully accept that it can be improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister and others spoke about the commitment to introduce a Bill to cover this issue by the end of the year. On 4 November 1992 this issue was debated in the House and a reply was given by the then Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea.  I quote from the Official Report, 4 November 1992, Vol. 134, col. 1001 where he said:</P>
    <P>Finally, I should state that the Government are committed to acting on the commission's recommendations within the timescale of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I would remind Senator Calnan who spoke about having this introduced under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> that this legislation was promised in the previous Government's <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The then Minister of State continued:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I can commend the amendment to the motion before the House in unequivocal terms on the basis that the situation is currently under... review and there is a commitment to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals before the end of <Col N="635" /> next year that is, before the end of 1993].</P>
    <P>Nothing happened.  We asked in the course of various debates when the legislation was likely to be introduced and we got not positive reply.  It was promised at the end of 1992 and we are now almost half way into 1994.</P>
    <P>We have had promises about other legislation at other times in the House. On 10 November 1993 we introduced the Refugee Protection (No. 2) Bill, 1993, and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, said at col. 321, Vol. 138 of the Official Report of 10 November 1993:</P>
    <P>The Minister agrees with the principle behind the Bill and with many of the measures proposed.  As I made it clear, however, the Minister agrees that our procedures for dealing with refugees and asylum seekers should be given statutory effect ... The Minister does not necessarily agree, however, with all the provisions of the Bill now before the House and she also feels that it is not comprehensive.</P>
    <P>He then committed himself to introducing a Bill by Christmas.</P>
    <P>Another example which I raise often is the Bill to decriminalise suicide which I introduced in December 1991.  The then Minister for Justice promised us that if we withdrew the Bill he would introduce a similar Bill by Christmas of 1991.  The Bill was, finally introduced in mid-1993 after two further Bills were proposed from this side of the House, one of which was withdrawn only because the Minister announced a Bill on the same day.  The two previous Bills were, however, voted down.  It took a year and a half to satisfy a three weeks' promise.  I hope the Minister does not mind my saying that I am sceptical about commitments made by Ministers. They may have been made in good faith at the time, but in my experience of introducing legislation during Private Members' Time, we get promises but little action afterwards.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy raised the issue of Parks and national monuments.  All of us in local government are only too aware of the difficulties that arise with regard <Col N="636" /> to parks we supervise and own and of the various claims made against us.  It is putting an extra burden on local authorities because of high insurance costs and is taking money from areas we need to service.  I need not remind the Minister of State again &mdash; she will be the one allocating the Structural Funds &mdash; that we need money for our county roads.</P>
    <P>Sporting organisations have made many statements on this issue and have urged reform in this area.  Some have said that we may be running counter to some of the views of these organisations.  That is not the case.  These organisations want and require this legislation because their traditional access to land is being removed in many areas.  Senator D'Arcy mentioned that 50 per cent of landowners in County Wexford have stopped some sporting organisations from entering their land.  It is predicted that within a short period of time that figure will increase to 80 per cent.  That highlights, as Senator Daly said, the urgency and the seriousness of the situation.  We fully agree with that and we suggest the Government accepts this Bill as a first step, as Senator Enright said, a towards making progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Our main concern is the occupation of land.  The other area is complex and can be legislated for, as the Minister said, by the end of the year.  The matter of land is causing extreme concern to landowners, sporting organisations and the agri-tourist and activity tourist businesses. Recently I brought some tourists to a castle near my home and after reaching it, the landowner told us to leave.  He did not realise that his neighbour was among our party.  He was extremely embarrassed when he became aware of this and immediately apologised to us.  However, he was right to ask us to leave.  Indeed, because of our previous debate on this matter, I told him that I fully understood his position.  The castle we visited was a 13th century castle, which would be of great interest to many tourists.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that farmers and landowners are forced to stop people from visiting such places because of concern for their own position.  I fully understand their actions.  If a farmer were to ask me for advice about whether he should stop <Col N="637" /> people from going over his land to see such monuments, to go fishing, shooting or to do any other activity sports, I would have to cover both myself and him by telling him not to permit it.  That situation must change, and change quickly.  If it is not changed now, the practice of not allowing people onto land will develop.</P>
    <P>There is a wide acceptance at the moment that people can go on to land. Farmers welcome people to go shooting, hunting, fishing, walking and mountain <Col N="638" /> climbing on their land.  However, if this practice of not allowing people onto the land develops further, it will not be reversed, no matter what type of legislation or cover one introduces.</P>
    <P>I wish to share the rest of my time with Senator Taylor-Quinn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While I am not under the illusion that the Members of the Seanad rely on me for medical opinions, because of my medical qualifications I try to be especially careful when speaking on health matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister spoke in the Seanad on 23 February on the Anti D immunoglobulin and hepatitis C problem, I supported all he had done.  I praised him for alerting women rather than having them in a state of alarm and I praised the transparency of his Department in this situation.  This was a contrast to the problems we have had in obtaining information in the past.  I still support the line he has taken.  I was delighted to see that in the programme, <i>Shaping a healthier</i><Col N="639" /><i>future &mdash; A strategy for effective healthcare in the 1990s</i>, the Minister has set up an expert group to advise him on this problem.</P>
    <P>While I support all he has done, I was under the impression when I spoke on 23 February that the Anti D immunoglobulin which was being introduced into the country to replace our own product, even though the latter appeared to be all right, had the approval of the US Food and Drugs Administration.  This body was established about 50 years ago and has the highest standards for verifying the qualities of any drugs or products.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly stressed that from the date he learned of the problem with our own Anti D immunoglobulin, albeit in the past, one of his immediate concerns was the protection of all future recipients of the product.  Quite rightly he said that despite everyone's best endeavours all over the world, the use of blood and blood products carry some risks and the benefits of treatment must be weighed against any risk.</P>
    <P>For women who may have received Anti D, the benefit of treatment with Anti D immunoglobulin is enormous for Rhesus negative women who give birth to Rhesus positive children.  I am old enough to remember in the 1960s the sad situation of it being virtually impossible for women who had one Rhesus positive child to have subsequent children; there could be subsequent miscarriages, stillbirths or the birth of children with brain damage.</P>
    <P>While I am not suggesting that the product involved here &mdash; WinRho &mdash; is in any way suspect, I would have asked far more questions on 23 February if I had not been under the impression that it had FDA approval.  I realised it could not have been evaluated in this country because it was brought in over a weekend and there was no possibility of the National Drugs Advisory Board being able to evaluate it in such a short period. We cannot expect everything to be evaluated by the board.  One must consider not only the number of products but also that we could lose out on very good drugs because it costs money to have a drug <Col N="640" /> evaluated by the NDAB.  If the company involved does not think it is worth while having a drug investigated, we might lose out.  I find it perfectly acceptable that the product might not have been evaluated by the board.</P>
    <P>Last week I visited the FDA in Washington about a different matter.  While there, I discussed with FDA officials the Anti D products which are available.  To my astonishment I found out that WinRho did not have FDA approval but that approval was pending and it might be a month or more before a definite decision was made.  While I cannot definitely say that this is why it is pending, I got the impression from my detailed discussion with the officials &mdash; they discussed with me methods of production and I believe the method of production of WinRho is very similar to our own &mdash; that the delay was probably because the manufacturers of WinRho had asked for a second use for it, that is, in the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura.  This is an unusual condition. The delay has probably occurred because the FDA insists that not only should a drug be safe but it should also be efficacious.</P>
    <P>On my return, I immediately wrote to the Minister to ask him to check the FDA status of WinRho and asked when he spoke in both Houses on the topic, did he think it had FDA approval.  On Saturday morning one of his officials kindly phoned me.  This showed that the Minister took immediate action, for which I was grateful.  I know it was impossible to contact the FDA for some time because it was closed due to the funeral of Richard Nixon, former President of the USA.  The official told me that I was right in saying approval was pending.  Because I had been so positive in my support for the Minister's actions, I felt I should inform the House as soon as possible &mdash; which is today &mdash; that, while I stress I have no reason to be suspicious of the drug, I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify its international status.  There are three FDA approved Anti D immunoglobulins widely in use in the United States.  I do not know why one of them or one of the well monitored European brands was not chosen.  Is WinRho considered <Col N="641" /> to be the drug of choice in the USA and Europe?</P>
    <P>Contamination of blood products by hepatitis C appears to be of international concern.  I am sure this is being carefully monitored by the Minister and his Department.  I do not suggest that these are fly-by-night products.  An extremely good gamma globulin called Gammagrad had to be withdrawn the other day because of contamination by hepatitis C.  This is a difficult problem.  If we are not producing a drug what criteria do we lay down before we accept products from abroad?  Do we require FDA approval or do we seek approval from another well established authority in Europe?  I am not suggesting that Canadian approval is inadequate, but I would be very grateful for clarification. Should we not aim for the highest standard? The FDA is reckoned to be the gold standard for approvals.  Thanks to the vigilance of the FDA, there are no thalidomide children in the USA. Unless we have an emergency, we should go for the highest possible approval status of any drug we might import.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this matter.  I know she shares my concern that the highest possible standards are applied to every product made available in this country.  This is our joint purpose.</P>
      <P>The Seanad will be familiar with the background which gave rise to the urgent need for the Blood Transfusion Service Board to do find alternative sources of Anti-D immunoglobulin to meet the needs of Irish patients following the recently identified risk of hepatitis C infection from the product then in use.</P>
      <P>Following extensive inquiries by the Blood Transfusion Service Board for a suitable replacement product, I understand the board decided that the most appropriate one available was that which could be supplied by the Canadian company, Rh Pharmaceuticals Inc., under the name WinRho SD.</P>

    <P>I have been informed that the product is licensed for general supply in Canada by the Canadian Ministry of Health and <Col N="642" /> Welfare and that the manufacturing facility of the company is licensed and subject to periodic inspection by the Canadian authorities.  I understand also that an application for licensing approval by the United States Food and Drugs Administration is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>I have been informed also that the product has been sold in ten countries on four continents without license on the same lines as the exceptional permission arrangements provided for in the Irish regulations.  This arrangement allows a product, which has not been licensed by the Minister for Health, to be supplied by a doctor to a patient under his or her professional care.  These countries include the UK, US, Saudi Arabia, Germany and France.  The position in Ireland is that an application for a product authorisation in respect of the product is currently being assessed as a matter of priority by the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the product is licensed for use in Canada, it is necessary that a full and detailed assessment be carried out by the NDAB before product authorisation is issued in this country.  However, as I have already stated, the process of such assessment is being treated as a priority by the NDAB and an early decision is expected.</P>
    <P>In the mean time, the product is being made available to patients on what is commonly referred to as &ldquo;a named-patient basis&rdquo;.  Under the Medical Preparation (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984, a medical preparation may normally only be supplied provided it is the subject of a product authorisation granted under the regulations. The normal criteria for the granting of such an authorisation is that the Minister for Health be satisfied on the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board as to the safety, efficacy and quality of the product.</P>
    <P>However, under article 5 (b) of the regulations, the requirement for a product authorisation shall not apply in respect of &ldquo;the importation or sale of a medical preparation by or to the order of a registered medical practitioner or registered dentist for the treatment of a patient under his care&rdquo;.  It is under this <Col N="643" /> provision that the product is currently being supplied here pending full assessment of the application for a product authorisation by the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>It is essential that an Anti D product be available in order to save lives and I recognise the importance which the Senator attached to this.  As I indicated earlier, this product has been licensed in Canada and used in ten countries and the National Drugs Advisory Board is carrying out a thorough examination which is being conducted as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I know his concern is as great as my own.  Frankly, I do not think the situation is satisfactory.  It is entirely unsatisfactory to have something still being supplied on a named patient basis to thousands of women three months after it has come into the country.  I have used drugs on a named patient basis on, let us say, five or six patients a year. This is what is meant by &ldquo;on a named patient basis&rdquo;.  I know the Minister knows this; I am not getting at him about this.  I do not care if it is used in 500 countries.  It appears to me to have only one authorisation, which is in Canada.</P>

      <P>My only concern on hearing that there was a doubt about the Anti D immunoglobulin in use in Ireland was to have an absolutely safe alternative. That was my instruction to the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Its advice was that this is the best product available. It is virally inactivated in the most sophisticated way possible using solvent detergent. As the process is new the level of technology needs to be assessed.  It has been assessed and approved in its country of origin, that is, Canada.  The professional advice which I was given by the experts is that this is the most suitable product.  That was their recommendation which I must obviously approve.</P>

      <P>Senator <Col N="644" /> Neville has a matter of concern regarding video nasties.  He has two minutes to make his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Justice to ensure that the office of the national censor is given all the necessary resources to ensure that the law is fully enforced in relation to video nasties.  The Minister must also introduce legislation to exclude all children from the adult section of video shops and libraries.  New and strict controls must be put in place at all distribution outlets with severe cash penalties for anybody breaching the controls. Steps must be taken to ensure that all outlets are licensed and a separate licence must be required for each outlet. Appropriate taxation measures must be introduced to put all video nasties beyond the price range of young people.</P>
      <P>In a report published recently, Professor Elizabeth Newson, head of the child development unit at Nottingham University, established a clear and direct link between the tragic murder of Jamie Bulger and the video viewing habits of the children who perpetrated the horrendous murder.  The report stated that &ldquo;a large number of children today are already totally desensitised by violence&rdquo;. One must be concerned with the implications of this.</P>
      <P>There is a large number of children who in moral terms do not know the difference between right and wrong.  That is a shocking indictment of the manner in which children are being raised in this generation. There is a large body of expert opinion which argues that there is a clear and direct connection between the viewing of pornographic material and the rising incidences of rape and related sexual degradation of women and children.  The Minister for Justice must act to ensure that the present law is applied to the fullest extent and that adequate legislation is introduced to control this situation.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 May 1994.</P>
