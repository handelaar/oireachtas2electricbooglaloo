      <P>I have notice from Senator Cregan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline to the House the up-to-date position in Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Magner of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the developments, if any, which have taken place since the publication of the report on the Oireachtas Library facilities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to support Resolution 47/19 of the United Nations General Assembly entitled Necessity of Ending <Col N="1926" /> Economic, Commercial and Financial Embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to take note of the difficulties facing both the settled population and itinerant families because of the very poor conditions at the halting site outside of Castleblayney, County Monaghan, and the danger of a complete breakdown of inter-community relationships.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cregan's and Senator Magner's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Neville and Senator Cotter may give notice on another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It would be wrong if this morning I did not mention the events last night in Orlando.  While disappointed with the result, as all in the country will be, the House can have pride in the soccer team and the fans in that they were fantastic ambassadors worldwide.  They have given all of us, young and old, a fantastic summer and we wish them well on their way home.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 3, Item 1, Investment Limited Partnership Bill, 1993, by agreement, all Stages will be taken today; Item 2, Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, 1992, Committee and remaining Stages; and Item 3, An Bord Bia Bill, 1994, all Stages.  It is proposed to take a sos at the conclusion of Item 1, to take Committee and all remaining Stages of Item 2 at 2 p.m. and to proceed to Item 3, with the Adjournment Matters at the conclusion of business. It is proposed also to allow 20 minutes for party spokespersons and 15 minutes for remaining speakers on Items 1 and 3.</P>

      <P>I join with the Leader of the House in expressing the great pride we all feel in the exploits of the Irish soccer team, not only over the past couple of weeks but over the past number of years.  The team has given great joy and happiness to millions of Irish people all over the world.  They have served as a unifying force, as nothing else in our lives has, over the past number of years. Regrettably, the only discordant note was the racist remarks of Peter Robinson and the begrudgery of some other members of the DUP, but that is a small price to pay.  It is a shame that all groups on the island could not join together in harmony on this issue.</P>
      <P>Well done to the team, and welcome home.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed on condition that all business comes to a natural conclusion rather than by the enforcement of what my party terms the guillotine but is given another term by the Leader of the House.</P>

      <P>Senator Cregan has been granted permission to raise the question of Irish Steel on the Adjournment, so the matter will be on the Order Paper today.  Given the importance of the issue perhaps that matter could be discussed with the Whips after the Order of Business.  Nobody wants to exacerbate a difficult situation or to hamper attempts to resolve this crisis.  However, since time is being made available, it might be possible to allow greater participation in the debate.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for arranging the debate on Northern Ireland for Thursday.  On a point of information, I presume that it will not be item 6 on the agenda, that it will be a new motion?</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Manning and the Leader of the House in supporting the welcome home for the Irish football team.  It was not just the team but the supporters who were the unifying force during this wonderful summer.  I had the pleasure of attending the first match and it was a joy to see our well behaved supporters.  They have given Ireland a wonderful image and have also given us a pride in ourselves that we did not always have in the past.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about today's Order of Business, particularly with regard to the An Bord Bia Bill, 1994.  To have everything rushed through in one day makes it impossible for this House to give this important Bill the attention it requires.  I have tabled amendments which I hope we will have a chance to debate but that may not be possible when all Stages are rushed through in one day.  Perhaps the Whip could try to avoid a recurrence of this.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed as far as I am concerned.  We all took enormous pride in the events in the United States.  The team, management, FAI officials and supporters all deserve congratulations.  It has done a lot for our national self-confidence and is another small step towards defining what we are. Everybody involved deserves the utmost credit.  I hope the Tánaiste does not readily identify with people who drop the ball, but that is by way of an aside.  I also hope that the lark in the park proceeds, but people who organise parties should first make sure that the guests are available. That would strike me as a basic precaution which in this instance does not seem to have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should record our congratulations to the Palestinian people on the establishment of a Palestinian government in Jericho.  We should also send our good wishes to Chairman Arafat on that event which is of major international significance. There are lessons for us in what has taken place.  We hope that the peace that has been brought to that area will continue to grow and develop and that the Palestinian nation will be able to <Col N="1929" /> express its individuality within the international community.</P>

      <P>Could the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the National Road Authority's plan for the next five years?  I understand that Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal have been poorly treated and will receive inadequate provision in the next four years.  The Members of this House should have an opportunity to express their disappointment and hopefully focus attention on the need for a vast increase in road improvement grants for national primary roads in those counties.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Cregan in raising the issue of Irish Steel. I hope that the timely intervention of congress may bring about a successful conclusion to this problem which will have a lasting effect on the economy of Cobh and the surrounding area.  Could the Leader arrange a debate on the economy given the publication of the Exchequer returns for the first six months?  It is important that issues like Irish Steel and TEAM Aer Lingus are kept out of the political field and that people do not take advantage of what is happening to them.  We should have a debate on the economy and on the issues which are very close to politicians and public representatives.  I hope the Leader will respond to this.</P>

      <P>I concur with the words of congratulations to the Irish team which brought us together in a spirit of unity. As politicians we should analyse what happened and see whether the Irish psyche can maintain that kind of a positive spirit with no begrudgery, apart from what Senator Manning mentioned.  There may be a lesson here at which we all need to look because the team brought us all together in a way which has not happened in the recent past and it is to be congratulated.</P>

In relation to Irish Steel, we will communicate with the people involved after the Order of Business. Item 6, Statements on Northern Ireland, will be dealt with on Thursday and orders will pertain that all can contribute to that debate.  It is my desire that the An Bord Bia Bill will be given full attention and I have no doubt that in the hours we have put aside for what Senator Quinn rightly calls very important legislation, it will be dealt with properly and fully.  On the other items mentioned, I will come back <Col N="1931" /> to the various Senators before the end of the week.</P>

    <Title>Investment Limited Partnerships Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is divided into seven parts.  Part I refers to preliminary matters, as is usual; Part II deals with the constitution of an investment limited partnership; Part III relates to its formation; Part IV concerns the administration of an investment limited partnership; Part V outlines the powers of the Central Bank in this area; Part VI deals with the dissolution of an investment partnership and the circumstances in which this may happen.  Part V outlines the powers of the Central Bank in this area; Part VI deals with the dissolution of an investment limited partnership and the circumstances in which that may happen; and Part VII deals with miscellaneous matters.</P>
      <P>The object of this innovative legislation is to provide a new mechanism called an investment limited partnership, ILP, for investors to come together with the aim of investment in property, bonds, securities, etc.  The purpose of the Bill is to add investment limited partnerships to the number of collective investment mechanisms available in the IFSC and the Bill, together with this year's amendments to the 1989 Finance Act provisions, provides that addition to the business of funds management carried out in the IFSC.</P>
      <P>This Bill is of general application and it would be possible to have a domestic investment limited partnership with resident limited partners.  However, such a combination of partnership would only qualify for the tax treatment at the usual domestic rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> The Bill provides for four principal participants in the existence of an investment limited partnership &mdash; general partners, limited partners, custodians and the Central Bank.  &ldquo;General partners&rdquo; might be termed as directors or management under the Companies Act.  They assume unlimited liability for the debts of an investment limited partnership should it fail.  &ldquo;Limited partners&rdquo; might best be termed, in corporate parlance, as shareholders or unit holders.  Their liability, in general, only relates to the amount that they contribute to the investment limited partnership.  &ldquo;The custodian&rdquo;, or trustee in other legislation, is the person in whom the assets of the investment limited partnership are entrusted for safe keeping.</P>
    <P>The authorised investment limited partnership and both the general partner and the custodian will be subject to the supervision of the Central Bank.  The bank is the authority which will, by the issue of a certificate of authorisation to a proposed general partner, create an investment limited partnership.</P>
    <P>I would like, at this stage, to emphasise that an investment limited partnership can invest in &ldquo;property&rdquo;.  For the purposes of this Bill, property may be regarded as stocks, shares, bricks and mortar and securities.</P>
    <P>The genesis of the Bill emanated from the IFSC/Paircéir working group in December 1993 which proposed that a further measure was required to entice certain aspects of the collective investment funds industry to use Ireland as a location for activity.  They felt, and the Government subsequently agreed, that the use of the partnership concept, which is used particularly in North America, merited specific application to the needs of the financial services sector.  The thinking behind the introduction of this proposal is that the greater the range of options available to that sector the greater the incentive for financial institutions to locate in Dublin or Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House addresses the principal limitations, in respect of international limited partners, which exist under current Irish law in respect of the international financial community. <Col N="1933" /> These limitations, evident in the 1907 Limited Partnership Act, relate to the number of partners, the involvement in the management of partnerships and the withdrawal of funds.  I must stress that the 1907 Act is still in existence and will remain in existence after the passage of this legislation.  Currently, that legislation has over 200 limited partnerships registered with the Companies Office.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that this Bill will be used primarily by investors located in the International Financial Services Centre. Over 260 projects generally have been approved to operate in the IFSC and 220 of those are being actively pursued at present.  These active projects have committed to creating 2,800 new, incremental jobs in the next few years.  Of these, in excess of 1,400 people are now employed in IFSC companies, and this figure does not include the number of indirect jobs created in the accounting, legal and general support services.  Direct employment within the funds sector in the IFSC amounts to circa 600 people spread over 20 plus companies.</P>
    <P>In promoting this legislation, the Government is aware that this Bill will enhance the attractiveness of the IFSC and create a further small number of jobs without costing the Irish taxpayer a penny.  The activity will create not only a small number of jobs directly but also ancillary job opportunities in the legal, accountancy and services sector.</P>
    <P>Another area of benefit to the economy will be the inflow of fees to the general partners, service providers and custodians.  The activity will create not only a small number of jobs directly but also ancillary job opportunities in the legal, accountancy and services sectors.</P>
    <P>Another area of benefit to the economy will be the inflow of fees to the general partners, service providers and custodians.  That inflow of funds will attract a tax liability which will be to the net benefit of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As indicated earlier, this Bill, while it can be used domestically, will generally be used by investors attracted to the International Financial Services Centre from other jurisdictions.  The Central <Col N="1934" /> Bank will authorise the entities and the entities so authorised and located in the IFSC-SFADCo zones will attract certain advantages, but no more so than is currently available to other areas of the IFSC or SFADCo.</P>
    <P>At this stage the principal market opportunities are in the US market.  The investment limited partnership tool is designed to be a vehicle by which multiple investors can pool their capital resources and avail of the same professional asset management expertise while benefiting from economies of scale.</P>
    <P>There is $14 billion in Irish domiciled funds with administration, fund accounting and custody located there, in over 160 funds and almost 400 sub-funds.  A further $4 billion of funds domiciled elsewhere are also under administration in the IFSC.  The growth in Irish domiciled funds in terms of value under administration has amounted to a remarkable 143 per cent during the calendar year 1993.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasis a number of matters in relation to the Bill under consideration which relates to investment limited partnerships.  Section 44 of the Bill has the decided merit of requiring the Central Bank to provide an annual report on the operation of this legislation. That report will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>These entities will be subject to appropriate Central Bank regulation.  This regulation will be appropriately balanced and will ensure that the Irish reputation in respect of supervision of entities, both within the IFSC and otherwise, remains at its current high standing.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Members will be concerned with regard to the end 1994 deadline for the IFSC.  I understand the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, is in contact, as necessary, with the European Commission regarding certification matters with the IFSC and the Shannon customs free airport zone.  A joint review with the European Commission arranged some time ago has already begun in regard to the end 1994 approval date for service companies wishing to establish in <Col N="1935" /> the Shannon zone.  The similar approval date for the IFSC will receive attention in that context also.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, in his 1994 budget provided the tax application in respect of ILPs which exit for other collective funds vehicles in the IFSC-Shannon zone.  I wish to stress that investment limited partnerships will not attract any additional tax benefit currently not available to collective funds vehicles located in the IFSC-Shannon zone.</P>
    <P>Particular points which warrant consideration, are that the provision of this type of organisation relates to the number of jobs which can be created, income by means of fees charged which can be brought to Ireland and taxation generated, will have arisen at no cost to the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>From a marketing point of view the construction of the Bill is all embracing in that everything required by promoters and users of the legislation is set out within the one set of covers, thus not requiring references to copious other European directives or primary legislation. In effect, it is a logical extension of the one-stop-shop principle and should considerably help the marketing of the investment limited partnership vehicle to overseas users.</P>
    <P>In commending this Bill to the Seanad, I wish to bring to the attention of the House a typographical error at page 34, line 5, which should read &ldquo;1851&rdquo;.  I understand that the correction can be made under Standing Order 100 of the Seanad by the Clerk, under the direction of the Cathaoirleach, and does not require to be made by way of formal amendment.  I would request that the House accede to my request to have the necessary correction made.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Members' contributions as a result of their study of the Bill.</P>

      <P>As regards the last point made by the Minister, Standing Order 100 reads: &ldquo;During the progress of a Bill corrections of a verbal or formal <Col N="1936" /> nature may at any time be made in the Bill by the Clerk under the direction of the Cathaoirleach.&rdquo;  I will arrange for the necessary correction to be made.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the Bill since the financial services centre will lose its designation at the end of 1994 and new companies will no longer be entitled to tax exemptions.  Any measure that increases the ability to provide employment in the centre is welcome.</P>
      <P>The delay in introducing the Bill has to be questioned.  As the Minister said, it was to be introduced late last year.  It is clearly being rushed at this stage which suggests that someone failed in the planning and introduction of the legislation. It will be a major task for the IDA and other agencies seeking to sell this measure to complete the necessary marketing and attract companies by the end of the year.  This concern must be expressed.</P>
      <P>This is a good occasion on which to raise the recent serious concern about the lack of regulation of investment intermediaries. Ireland has no system for regulating such operations.  Those involved in the business can put a plate on the door of a building and operate without regulation.  It is somewhat ironic that while this House is introducing legislation which requires people selling oranges and bananas on the streets to have tax clearance certificates, there is no system to regulate those who establish themselves as investment experts selling large scale investment products to a sometimes unsuspecting public.  In the recent past we have even sold passports which is significantly different from selling bananas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newspapers recently reported two incidents where investment intermediaries who were fined and prevented from operating in the UK transferred their operations to Ireland.  It would appear that they are operating similar businesses to those for which they were struck off in the UK.  Some were gambling <Col N="1937" /> on movements in the stock exchange and such investments clearly offered no security to people who had entrusted their hard earned savings to the people running the schemes.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely damaging to Ireland's reputation if such incidents became a regular feature of the activity of investment intermediaries here, particularly in the city of Dublin.  Too many people overseas would be pleased to see the financial services centre in Ireland, which is attempting to develop a successful industry in this area, run aground and its reputation damaged. Some UK security regulatory boards have circulated notices warning about Irish based operators who are not to be favoured in handling savings.</P>
    <P>Confidence is the key ingredient in successfully attracting investment.  The onus is on the Government to move speedily to ensure the highest level of confidence in investment intermediaries operating in Ireland.  We have to establish credible and effective regulations and we should take the opportunity presented by this Bill to do so.  If steps have not already been taken in this area, something must be done because we are all aware of scams which have taken place both here and abroad.</P>
    <P>I query the future of the financial services sector.  Tax concessions in the financial services centre will cease at the end of the year and no further companies will be able to avail of them.  I realise that investment limited partnerships under this Bill are unlikely to be seriously damaged by the loss of tax concessions. However, many companies involved in this type of business may have other investment activities which could be adversely affected by the tax changes. To what extent are the activities in the financial services centre tax dependent and vulnerable to changes in the tax regimes in other countries?  More importantly from the point of view of developing the centre, has the Minister taken action to renegotiate the cessation of tax concessions with the European Commission?</P>
    <P>It appears that we are only starting to develop the Financial Services Centre as <Col N="1938" /> a successful location for doing business. From the Minister's figures it appears that an additional 200 people have been employed in the past 12 months &mdash; a substantial increase on the employment level in the previous 12 months.  Clearly the Financial Services Centre is in its infancy and the Minister has stated that over 200 companies are in negotiations with the IDA at present.  We must ask ourselves if we have done enough up to the end of 1994 to capitalise on the opportunities and, if not, can we renegotiate and gain an extension of time for the concessions given to companies heretofore.</P>
    <P>It is embarrassing that excessive rents have given rise to problems in the Financial Services Centre, apparently curtailing the relocation of companies which committed themselves to establishing in the centre.  They have not moved in and I would be interested to learn how many companies who committed themselves to the centre have not located there at this stage and if that is because of the excessive rents.  If the level of rents is the source of the problem, can a system of arbitration of rents be established?  The Government must take action to ensure that the potential of the centre is not damaged by the apparent lack of competition in the provision of sites and rent charges.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would give an insight into the area of vacant space in the centre and how close we are to meeting the projections for the building programme and occupancy rates.  It is important that we know the facts because we are approaching the last six months of the scheme which provides the tax concessions and, if there is a problem, we should be looking to renegotiate, we need to know the figures.</P>
    <P>The vulnerability of these operations to tax changes must be ever present in the minds of policy makers.  Recent changes in the tax laws have damaged Irish companies.  We need to get our act together and, if necessary, renegotiate the tax concessions with the Commission. Luxembourg is an impressive example to follow in this regard.  They employ about <Col N="1939" /> 18,000 people in the financial management sector.  Admittedly, Luxembourg is well ahead of us in experience and has established a network over a number of years.  However, we would have advantages because of our traditional links with the US.</P>
    <P>This Bill is particularly welcome in that we are getting an opportunity to land mobile investment management projects for Ireland.  Increasingly, multinational companies seem to want to centralise the management of pension funds, other funds and share options.  If they centralise all their multinational operations in one country clearly the location of the central management is highly mobile and, should we be able to offer the best package, we can land employment for Ireland and increase the numbers in the IFSC substantially.</P>
    <P>This investment vehicle provides extraordinary concessions in that projects will not be liable for any of our taxes &mdash; capital gains tax, VAT and stamp duty. We need an assurance that such companies and partnerships cannot be used as offshore companies for purposes we would not like.  It is heartening that the Central Bank regulations will apply but, effectively, without a great deal of debate, we are giving extraordinarily generous tax concessions to a certain type of investment vehicle.  The House would need assurances that the vehicle would not use those concessions for purposes for which they are not intended.</P>
    <P>In light of recent statements made by the Taoiseach about bank charges, etc., I hope something will be done to deal with the problems that many people have in that regard &mdash; especially small business people each of whom employs a few people.  The charges imposed by the financial institutions are exorbitant and they are causing substantial long term hardship and action rather than words from the Government and the Minister for Finance would help.  Regulations should be introduced by the Central Bank in negotiation with the financial institutions so that people will not be ripped off in the future.  Many jobs are on the line due to <Col N="1940" /> the continuation and increase in the level of charges which, in real terms, are causing hardship for many companies.  As a result, people who would otherwise be employed are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading through the Bill this morning, it occurred to me that it is a particular example of legislation that should have been referred to a different type of legislative arrangement.  It highlights the need for some form of committee system which would examine highly technical measures, such as this Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the purpose of the legislation is relatively simple and straightforward.  It adds to the menu of investment formulae or devices available to the Irish financial services sector both in Dublin and at the centre in Shannon. To that extent, it is obviously welcome. The aim of the Bill is to effectively attract international funds into companies based in Ireland.  The funds will be used for investment purposes and the revenues which will accrue to the Irish side will come from the management of those funds.  It is an important adjunct to the menu of devices available at the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Farrelly that the Bill raises a number of issues.  All Members would agree that it is important to ensure that any new partnership set up under the terms of the Bill would, in all regards, be above board and clean.  I am sure the Minister shares the priority of wishing to protect the good name and reputation of Ireland in general and of our financial services in particular.  While it is important to put down a marker in that regard, we should not to conjure up problems which may not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrelly focused on the problem of financial intermediaries under EC legislation in the Treaty of Rome and the provisions relating to freedom to provide services, rights of establishment and freedom to move across borders.  It seems to me that he was mistaken in trying to tie his concerns about this issue to this Bill. They are two entirely different matters <Col N="1941" /> without a direct or immediately evident relationship.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the limited partnership device is one which has been well used in the United States and which has developed particularly there.  In that regard, as a good deal of the funds which we will try to attract over the next few years into the financial services, to be used by companies based in that sector, are US based, the decision of the Government to move in this direction is prudent. The Bill is highly technical and its genesis was the report produced by Séamus Paircéir. He is a fine public servant who, unfortunately, was hit by turbulence arising from another investment decision by a State enterprise.  The Paircéir report made it clear that movement in this particular direction would be one of a number of devices which Governments would have to consider if we were to put the full range of investment opportunities, which are available internationally, in place in the financial services sector.</P>
    <P>The Government has acted prudently. It has tried to create between two covers user friendly legislation relating to a specific and highly technical area.  The Minister could have used another method and made a series of amendments to other legislation dealing with partnerships in general but he was prudent to choose the device used in this Bill by putting a specific user or client oriented set of rules relating to a particular form of investment relationship into one piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Irish financial services sector in general, one of our biggest problems whenever we discuss this area is our tendency to make prophecies of doom. We look at the time constraint at the end of this year and we tend &mdash; although it is not deliberate &mdash; to talk down the very real success of the IFSC.  Hundreds of companies which operate in the financial services sector in this country would not be located here were it not for the International Financial Services Centre. Thousands of people are employed there and many thousands of the jobs are new <Col N="1942" /> or additional jobs.  The centre has proven to be a remarkable success.</P>
    <P>I visited the centre recently with an Oireachtas group and I was pleased to note that there are cranes on the site again and that building is taking place there.  I share Senator Farrelly's and the public's concern about the almost monopolistic operations regarding office space in the centre.  I would also share a concern that high rents would undermine the efforts of successive Governments to make the centre a successful operation. However, that is a short term problem which will be resolved in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the main aim of the Bill is to create a new device to assist in creating an inflow of funds to be positively used by management companies in this country.  The benefit to this country will be the creation of additional jobs. The Minister has been candid in this regard.  He has pointed out that since this is a highly technical area, the number of additional jobs will not be great. However, the important element is not the jobs but the provision of a wider range of investment possibilities in financial services in this centre, a range which is comparable with that available in other countries.  It guarantees the continued success of the centre.  The other benefit will be the revenue from taxes which will attach to the fees.  The fees on the levels of funds involved will be considerable as with the potential tax revenues.</P>
    <P>This highly technical legislation is welcome. The Minister has made it clear that the necessary protections are provided in the Bill and in the financial services sector in general to guard against the type of problem rightly pointed out by Senator Farrelly.  We have foreseen the likelihood of such problems and we have put protections in place.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical and complicated Bill for people who are not involved in this sector.  Our concept of the activities of a financial centre is somewhat abstract because a financial centre deals in money rather than in objects.  It is <Col N="1943" /> probably quite difficult for many of us to comprehend the detail of it but the Bill, in essence, offers an additional option to investors which has the potential to bring money and jobs into the Irish economy. We should support this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is important to offer options which investors are willing to consider.  The Minister called it an extension of the concept of the one-stop-shop; people are given all the detail in one Bill and they can comprehend the intention and the content of what is being offered to them. The main source of funding is the US.  It is relevant to talk about the US in the context of the Shannon section as well as the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin because for many years much of the investment in the Shannon region has been made by US based companies. The midwest has received much from that country, for which we are grateful. A good deal of money has been invested over the years and provided valuable jobs for many people in my part of the country.  That continues, in the Shannon area and in the technological park close to the University of Limerick; the university has also received financial investment from the US.  It is appropriate to continue to source whatever funds we can from the US but also from other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that there will be no cost to the taxpayer, there is all to gain from this move and nothing to lose.  He also indicated that 2,800 new jobs are committed to the financial services sector.  I take on board the concerns of Senators Farrelly and Roche but it is a substantial number of posts and we should encourage that investment to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it is a detailed and complicated Bill, I am glad it encourages a level of transparency, including supervision by the Central Bank, the requirement to keep books and records and make them available to the bank.  If it sees the need, the bank has the power to appoint inspectors to the various companies to ensure everything is above <Col N="1944" /> board and carried out according to the regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill also details the responsibilities of the different sectors of the companies involved, the obligations of the general partner, the custodian and the other levels of responsibility within these partnership companies.  This transparency is essential to ensure everything is done according to the rules.  It is also welcome that an annual report will be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas, in line with the need to monitor and ensure public accountability.</P>
    <P>The simplification of paperwork is important because it means people with substantial funds for investment will know the regulations.  They do not have to look for EU directives and other legislation; everything is in the Bill.  This will be an encouragement &mdash; often people are not aware of all the red tape and the regulations but that problem is dealt with in this Bill.  Investors are, therefore, encouraged to put their money into Ireland, in the financial services sector, the Shannon free trade zone or elsewhere. The Minister indicated this Bill can apply to other parts of the country but normal tax payments would apply elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We must encourage as much investment as possible to Ireland.  Ours is not a rich economy; not many people in the indigenous sector have huge amounts of money to invest.  We have all spoken in this House about the importance of strengthening and developing indigenous firms and encouraging Irish people with money to invest it.  However, it is equally important to continue to encourage people outside to put funds into this country and, as a result, to bring jobs and money into the economy.</P>
    <P>If the downward trend in the unemployment figures over the last six months continues, we should continue to make these legislative changes to facilitate investment.  On that basis I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in welcoming the Minister.  I am enthusiastic about the Bill although I represent <Col N="1945" /> a part of the country which is far removed from the financial centres.  Most people realise the financial services centre has been a success story, it is competing on the world stage.  It has also done great work for the taxpayer &mdash; 10 per cent of all tax now collected comes from the financial services centre.  That is important to everyone, whether they live in Donegal or in Dún Laoghaire.  Like Senator Roche and other Members, I also visited the centre and was impressed with the air of prosperity and confidence there.  We should support and encourage those involved in its promotion.  Its establishment was timely and I shudder to think that we could be without that centre today.</P>
      <P>The one-stop-shop, which the Minister described, is one aspect of the International Financial Services Centre which is of interest to me.  I encourage such development at Government level because there is much duplication of effort in this country.  For example, a developer in my county may approach the IDA, Forbairt, Teagasc offices, county enterprise partnership boards, county development teams, tourist boards, etc. for assistance.  This area must be more focused and having listened to the Minister's speech, I am convinced that the Government is moving in this direction.  I hope this does not stop at Shannon or at the International Financial Services Centre because there is a greater need for such development where jobs must be provided in rural areas.  There must be direction, but not duplication and confusion and the buck must not be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the establishment of local or regional organisations, there is an air of confusion about financing and direction, the relationship with central Government and the administration structure.  I welcome the extension of the one-stop-shop and hope the Government sees fit to set up one in every county. We need a professional central service in every county so that a positive answer can be given to people who want to know about finance, training or the preparation of submissions for EC or local funding. <Col N="1946" /> We must remove the duplication which gives committed people the run-around. The Bill suggests the Government is moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In the United States, many different offices were trying to do different things. I was glad the Taoiseach opened a one-stop-shop in New York last March.  We all saw the need to tidy up our business, to adopt a new approach and to set up a more businesslike centre where people could get information on how to go about their business.  I see the value of this Bill and am glad the Minister has emphasised the value of the one-stop-shop.  This legislation is timely and I congratulate all those involved.  Our best wishes go to those developing the financial centres and affairs of this country.  I hope we can look forward to increased revenue from the activities at the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their welcome for this complex Bill.  The phrase &ldquo;financial engineering&rdquo; comes to mind as a description of what is in this Bill.  It is necessarily complex because the world of international finance today is complex.  Having said that, the idea behind it can be put very simply.  In the International Financial Services Centre at the moment there are a number of products on offer for would-be investors. An international player can go there and set up a captive insurance company, for example; a fund management, treasury management operation can be set up to manage the currencies of international firms.  At the moment it is basically a centre of companies that manage international funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator McGowan said, it needs to be said more often that what has happened here in the past few years is truly remarkable in Ireland.  With skill and know-how and well educated, skilled personnel, we have won a reputation worldwide for being able to professionally manage funds.  At present US $14 billion of funds are under administration at the International Financial Services Centre. <Col N="1947" /> They do not own that money but they manage its administration on a day to day basis.  When I say &ldquo;manage&rdquo;, I mean that the treasury manages it, it deals with the various hedges and other currency protection measures, it deals with reinsurance, it replaces the insurance already laid with insurance companies and it carries out the ordinary fund management. What is going on there is truly remarkable and I take this opportunity to note that.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly asked about the regulation of investment intermediaries. Legislation is being planned to regulate intermediaries based on both EU directives to be implemented and the recommendation of the working group established under the aegis of the Irish Association of Investment Managers. The Senator is right to draw attention to this.</P>
    <P>We have introduced legislation in a number of areas, for example, insurance. I was involved in introducing legislation some years ago to regulate insurance intermediaries but there are other intermediaries who are not now so regulated. For example, people who sell non-insurance investment type products like unit trusts, or UCITs, are not at present regulated but it is proposed to regulate them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked about the end of 1994 status.  I pointed out that the Minister for Finance is in contact with the European Commission regarding certification within the centre and in Shannon and that we are undertaking a joint review with the European Commission in this area.  I am reluctant to say any more about that lest I give the wrong impression.  The legal position is that the deadline occurs at the end of 1994.  All I can and will say at this point is that the Minister for Finance is watching that situation very closely and is in touch with the Commission on what options are available to us.  I want to pick my words carefully there lest any company misread that intention.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly also asked about the progress of the centre and the rental situation. <Col N="1948" /> Considerable construction work is going on in the centre.  Work on the sixth office building, known as Harbourmaster Three, is well under way and it is now almost 100 per cent pre-let.  The next phase of the office development will entail the construction of buildings in the George's Dock section of the area, the marketing of which will be starting shortly.  Some good progress has been made also on this issue and I am confident that, with further space becoming available, more IFSC companies will locate in the centre.</P>
    <P>In addition to the office building programme which I mentioned, the refurbishment of one of the old warehouses was completed last month.  The Dublin Exchange facility is now operating from that building.  The first tenant of the Exchange, Finex &mdash; a division of the New York Cotton Exchange &mdash; commenced business there on 17 June.  Finally, a licensed premises is being developed at the centre and residential units are now being marketed also.  It is unusual for the Irish not to put the pub in first and the buildings afterwards, but at least we now have both.  It could be called an investment in liquid engineering.</P>
    <P>The Senator hinted at what was happening in the Consumer Credit Bill in regard to bank charges and so on.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, is currently briefing the Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on that area and the Consumer Credit Bill, which will deal with the financial charges issue, is due very shortly.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Roche for drawing attention to the Paircéir report.  I have arranged, under a request from the Dáil, to publish that report and since it has been formally laid before the Oireachtas it is available to every Member.  It was from that committee that this new structure came about.  The question of supervision was also mentioned.  Section 44 lays down that the Central Bank shall carry out supervision in this area under the legislation.  That is important.  It is well versed in supervising financial companies <Col N="1949" /> and there is no difficulty with this one.  It has been pointed out to me that section 44 does not specifically cover Central Bank supervision, but the Central Bank will be supervising these partnerships.</P>
    <P>Attention has been drawn to the success of the centre.  I thank Senator O'Sullivan for focusing on the fact that there are jobs here.  There may not be as many as we would wish, but when you add them all up there are up to 1,400 people employed in the centre, and that is direct employment.  There are also spin-off jobs for those in finance, accountancy, law, etc.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan drew attention to the fact that over 10 per cent of the corporation tax collected in the State now comes from this centre; this is remarkable. From Ireland's point of view what is happening in the International Financial Services Centre is all win, because profits made on the international funds managed in Ireland are subject only to 10 per cent taxation.  If we did not have that regulation or the centre we would not have those funds and there would be no corporation tax from that area.  Generally people realise that because I do not see any criticism of the taxation rate on international funds.  It is widely accepted and I hope we can hold on to it for as long as possible.  Overall, as Senator Roche put it, this is another item on the menu that the International Financial Services Centre have to sell to international funds who want to have their funds managed at this centre and in Shannon.  They may set up these funds outside the centre but if they do they will not get the special tax rates.  This means there is no loss to the economy in that case.</P>
    <P>What does Ireland get from it?  We get the 10 per cent corporation tax which is very substantial, we get highly skilled jobs and many spin-off jobs, a great deal of credibility and, increasingly important, we get the fees.  The companies based here get fees for managing US$14 billion and those fees are Irish income. The subject matter of this Bill is necessarily complex in that you have a limited partner and a general partner.  For <Col N="1950" /> example, the general partner is the same as directors in a company; the limited partner is the same as shareholders; there is a new animal there called the &ldquo;custodian&rdquo;. The custodian is like a trustee so there is a balance of power between the three elements of the limited partnership, all of which are necessary for balance and a separation of powers with final responsibility at the end of the day for supervision resting with the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>My thanks to Senators for their consideration of the legislation.  Once we pass it and receive the necessary signatures, the International Financial Services Centre and SFADCo can go out and market the new product.  I apologise to the Seanad for rushing this legislation. The reason is that those bodies have already targeted some business and want to get on with it over the summer.</P>
    <P>It is useful legislation and will help the centre to grow.  Proper supervision has been put in place and this legislation will further enhance our reputation as a financial services centre.  I thank the Senators for their comments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 40 (b) states that a guilty person will be liable &ldquo;on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 15 years&rdquo;.  This is a substantial amount &mdash; 15 years in the clink would cause anybody to pause for thought.  However, in the previous paragraph covering summary convictions, the fine is £1,000 and the prison term cannot <Col N="1951" /> exceed 12 months.  There seems to be a certain disparity between these two.  I know there is a difference between a summary and an indictable offence but can the Minister comment on this?  I can see that paragraph (b) would cause people to be more careful.  However, does paragraph (a) seem unduly lenient in view of the substantial fines and imprisonment in paragraph (b)?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>These limits are a great increase on existing financial legislation, and rightly so.  The distinction between summary conviction and conviction on indictment is standard in almost all legislation. There are fixed limits which concerns the court where one is charged.  It is not possible to have higher figures on summary conviction than these because they are legally set as applying to the lower courts, whereas conviction on indictment is obviously a High Court procedure. Obviously, they both relate to criminal acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement.  I was aware the limitations, especially in paragraph (a), were set because of the limits on the court.  Any criminal activity in this area will have a greater impact than its immediate effects. It could destroy the whole perception of the Irish financial services.  I realise the Minister's hands are tied.  The lower courts do have limitations in this regard. Could we consider making special arrangements at some future stage where the punishment, both on summary and indictable offences, could fit the crime? The Minister more than adequately covers this in paragraph (b).  Somebody who operates criminally in this area deserves to be locked up.  They will imperil the livelihoods of thousands of people.  Because of the limitations of our judicial system, paragraph (a) seems, on the surface, to specify rather more lenient punishment.  Other Senators have referred to these concerns to ensure everything in this section is clean and that <Col N="1952" /> anybody who steps out of line is shown to be visited with the full opprobrium of the law.</P>

      <P>Section 40 (b) of the Bill would only apply in the most serious cases.  A report would be made to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who would decide whether to take the charge. Once the DPP is involved, it is a serious criminal charge.  If there is a conviction, one would then be talking about a fine of £500,000 or 15 years in prison.</P>
      <P>In section 40 (a), only the District Court will be involved.  This will apply to a minor offence, where it was not felt necessary for the DPP to take a charge and was dealt with more by way of administration than by direct involvement of the DPP.

      <P>Under section 1 of the Bill the definition of EU Directive 92/46/EEC, laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of milk and milk based products, must be amended by the addition of the words &ldquo;as modified by Council Directive 92/47/EEC of 16 June 1992 (2)&rdquo;.  This arises because the Bill requires that establishments in which milk is pasteurised for liquid consumption must be approved under the directive.  However, there is provision under EU Directive 92/47/EEC for temporary and limited derogation from the full provisions of the directive until the beginning of 1998.</P>
      <P>Inspections of establishments carried out in implementing EU Directive 92/46/EEC revealed that some of the smaller ones did not comply fully, and Ireland has recently obtained EU Commission approval to avail of derogations under EU Directive 92/47/EEC in these cases.  In order that these establishments may lawfully continue in operation it is necessary that the Bill be amended to take account of the fact that they are operating under this derogation.</P>

It would be very serious if it became apparent that some pasteurising plants would not qualify under the new regulation and would not obtain a derogation. Will the Minister advise how many plants would be on the border line, who has authority to grant the derogation and would it have to be approved by the EU?</P>

      <P>A serious situation could develop for some plants regarding this matter.  Having read the Bill I was unaware of this as it was not pointed out in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Bill or in the Bill itself. Presumably under EU regulations the amendment must be inserted, but hopefully the Department will be sympathetic to some of the plants which cannot reach the standard, that a period of time will be granted to them to do so and that they would be entitled to the derogation until the standard is increased to the required level.</P>

The Bill as originally drafted referred to EU Directive 92/46/EEC.  Another directive has now been introduced which is contingent on it, EU Directive 92/47/EEC.  Hopefully there are no EU Directives 92/48/EEC, 92/49/EEC and 92/50/EEC hidden in the undergrowth of which the House is unaware.</P>
      <P>There is a small figure (2) placed at the end of the amendment.  In the original draft of the Bill, where a small figure (1) appeared, an explanation was provided. There is no mention in the amendment to what the small figure (2) refers.  Will the Minister clarify this point because given that the figure is in the amendment, the reference should also be included?</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 33, after &ldquo;Directive&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including milk to which has been added flavouring, vitamins, minerals or other substances, provided that these substances are not used to replace in part or in whole any milk constituent&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In section 1 the definition of &ldquo;heat-treated&rdquo; milk is amended by the addition of the words &ldquo;including milk to which has been added flavouring, vitamins, minerals or other substances, provided that these substances are not used to replace in part or in whole any milk constituent&rdquo;.  This amendment will <Col N="1956" /> broaden the range of products &mdash; that is, whole milk, semi-skimmed or skimmed milk &mdash; for liquid consumption to which the Bill already applies.  Contracts for the supply of milk tend to specify that only milk which is actually used for liquid consumption will be paid for at the higher liquid milk price, the balance being paid at the manufacturing price.  Products such as flavoured and vitaminised milk are becoming popular and are accounting for a growing share of the drinking milk market.  Accordingly, it is considered equitable that they will be recognised as milk for liquid consumption under the Bill.  We are merely taking account of some developments in the industry where flavourings, vitamins or calcium are added to milk.  There is a growing market for these types of milk, especially flavoured milk which is becoming popular in schools.  It was for that reason that this addition was added to the designation of milk.</P>

    <P>What has the Minister in mind in respect of this type of representation?  The Dublin Milk Board, as constituted at the moment, represents the trade by and large.

      <P>They are indeed.  We, in Ireland, are very high <i>per capita</i> consumers of milk; only Finland is higher. The consumer member will be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of consumer interests.  I will invite nominations from various consumer interest groups around the country to ensure that there is balance on the board and that it will not be confined to producers and distributors.  The consumer member will be there to ensure that those who drink the product &mdash; the most important section &mdash; are represented.</P>

The situation with regard to the consumer member is straightforward since there is the Consumers Association of Ireland, but over time there may well be other interest groups. The distributors have their own association as do the retailers.  We do not envisage a panel of members from which the agency would be appointed.

      <P>There will be five producer members who will be elected on the nomination of farmer organisations, for a maximum of 12 months.  These organisations will include the main ones and some others.  After the first 12 months, the five members will be elected by producers registered with the agency. When the agency is set up, farmers who are liquid milk producers will become registered and will elect their five members.  As I said, the first five will be elected on the nomination of various organisations, including the main farming organisations, but this will only be for a temporary period of 12 months.  From then on the liquid milk producers who are registered members of the new agency will have their own election to appoint their five members.</P>

There are three organisations representing producers, the ICMSA, the IFA and Macra na Feirme.  I see a problem in relation to the producer members.  Heretofore, the liquid milk producers of Leinster and Cork were represented on the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards, respectively.  This was simple and easy to manage.

      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (3), line 42, after &ldquo;effect&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to subsection (7)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clear up any ambiguity about how the proceeds of the sale of the boards' ancillary business should be utilised.  Among other things, section 3 <Col N="1962" /> (3) provides that section 4 of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1941, shall continue to have effect notwithstanding the repeal of that Act by this Bill.  One of the provisions of that Act is a requirement that any money remaining in the hands of the Minister after disposing of the assets and discharging the liabilities of an abolished board, shall be applied for the purposes of agriculture or other rural industries within, or in connection with, the abolished board's production area.  However, section 3 (7) of the Bill provides that all money received by the Minister on the sale of the boards' ancillary business shall, after payment of necessary outgoings, be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.  This amendment removes any ambiguity by making it clear that the disposal of any proceeds from the sale will be governed by section 3 (7) of the Bill rather than by section 4 of the 1941 Act.</P>
      <P>While there may be an immediate positive financial balance on the sale, because the proceeds of the sale are likely to exceed the cost of the voluntary redundancy package, this is not likely to be the case over time when account is taken of the assumption by the Exchequer of responsibility for the superannuation rights of all the boards' staff in respect of their service with the boards.  In the first place, the Exchequer will have to meet the cost of pensions for about 50 people from the time they go on voluntary retirement until they reach normal retirement age.  Second, the Exchequer will take over responsibility for the superannuation rights of all the boards' staff from their normal retirement date.  It is estimated that the pension funds which the Exchequer will take over will not over time be able to finance those superannuation rights.  Accordingly, what seems to be an immediate positive net balance from the sale is likely to prove a negative net balance in the longer term. It is extremely unlikely, when pension and superannuation matters are taken into account, that there will be any surplus cash for redistribution in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1963" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister's assessment of the situation with regard to superannuation rights and pensions. In the 1970s, the Dublin District Milk Board acquired a very large 450 acre farm in County Meath and spent £1 million on the construction of a bull station and £1 million on bulls.  I am not sure what the assets are at present but my understanding is that the redundancy payments are costing the Exchequer in the region of £1 million &mdash; these are the Minister's own statements &mdash; after that, it is only responsible for pension funds into which people have paid over a very long period of employment.</P>
      <P>I am very worried by this section and the Minister must also be worried when he is trying to insert this amendment.  I am worried that the Exchequer will have the authority to take over funds which are in excess of the expenditure on redundancies and pensions.</P>
      <P>I cannot put a value on the assets but I have no doubt that the Department has valued them.  I spoke to some of the people this morning.  There is a huge farm, the bull station and 60 to 70 bulls worth in the region of £3 million to £4 million; there are also five or six other stations and ancillary items in respect of the property of the board.  The Minister and his officials know that not one penny of taxpayers' money went into the Dublin or Cork District Milk Boards.  It was financed mainly by the farmers but it seems that the return from this asset will go into the Exchequer.  I do not approve of that because there is an enormous need for investment in research and development, particularly in respect of artificial insemination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department must take some blame for the current backlog.  The Minister stated in his speech on Second Stage that the board lost £500,000 over a period of five years.  However, the Department must take some responsibility for the five years of uncertainty where nobody knew what was going to happen.  We knew there was an EC regulation under which the board had to be dispersed and put into private hands.  However, the Department spent five years negotiating with <Col N="1964" /> these people.  I know it was not all his Department's fault &mdash; the Department of Finance dug in its heels and refused to give these people the same status as civil servants.</P>
    <P>As a result of the time lag in reaching the agreement a great deal of damage was done to the service itself.  I am a user of the service and feel very strongly about this.  The Minister and his Department know that cattle are being purchased from Germany, Holland, France and elsewhere because of poor quality straws from the AI stations in this country. Research and development did not take place over the period.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he believes the assets of the board, once the pensions and redundancy packages are paid, will be a minus rather than a plus for the Exchequer.  I do not accept that because there are between £5 million and £10 million worth of assets to be disposed of by the board.  The Minister is appointing three people from his Department to oversee this in the interim period, and I accept that is normal procedure. However, I am not pleased that a penny of this money should go back to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>When I was on that board in the early 1970s, the Department of Finance did everything it could to stop us purchasing the farm in Meath.  As I had a very friendly relationship with Mark Clinton, the then Minister for Agriculture, I was able to walk into his office and persuade him.  He said to me, in front of his officials, not to come back looking for money.  I told him we did not want his money as we could produce the money ourselves, which we did.  We sold 50 acres of the land in Balgaddy, bought a 450 acre farm in Meath and spent £1 million on a bull station which was paid off within a few years.  The trouble only began when the uncertainly set in and that uncertainty will remain until this Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>The Minister should protect farmers' money.  The Exchequer is entitled to take its expenses for redundancy payments and pensions.  However, it should not be allowed to confiscate money as it never contributed a brass penny to the development <Col N="1965" /> of the board.  I make those points in the light of my experience of having been a member of the board and a user of the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>While we all recognise that there was a delay, we are all happy that everything worked out to everyone's satisfaction.  Senator D'Arcy mentioned that the Department dragging its feet was the cause of so many cattle, especially breeding cattle, being imported.  I do not agree with importing cattle, especially Friesians.  There is poor quality semen in the AI stations because of the uncertainty that prevailed.  However, there is good quality semen available which farmers may purchase.  It need not come entirely from the AI stations.  Other agencies are providing good quality semen which would produce better cattle than those which are being imported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator D'Arcy said.  I am convinced that the moneys which accrue from this should be retained within the Department, especially to research the whole area of disease.  As we are aware, there is a great deal of concern in the farming community and the Department about the importation of cattle because of the new regulations. Any available money should be used to ensure that we do not overexpose ourselves to the disease levels of some countries in Europe, which is the way we are going.  The money should be used to improve and further agriculture, an important industry, and to research the implications of exposure following the change in the rules with regard to the importation of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure if the controversy in relation to the importation of cattle has a great deal to do with this Bill.  I agree that we have first class cattle and many of the cattle which are imported are not of the high quality which is available in Ireland.  There is a kind of inverted snobbery about this question of farmers importing cattle and I know they go very long distances and <Col N="1966" /> they pay large amounts of money for embryos.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Bill, the first immediate draw on the money is for the lump sum payments for those taking voluntary redundancy which is estimated at £1 million; the second draw on the money will involve the liability for staff pensions. There will not be enough in the current pension fund to meet these draws.  We got an actuary to estimate the shortfall and he said it will be in the region of £3 million.  That is a total of £4 million.  We also have employed accountants who got estate agents and auctioneers to assess the value of the assets, which remains confidential because they will be put up for competitive tender.  Based on the liabilities, as has been shown to us by actuarial assessment, and the estimated value of the assets, it is our information that there will be no net assets available or surplus cash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely worried by such statements.  The Minister said there was a shortfall of £500,000 over a period of about four years and that the place is over-staffed, which I accept. According to his figures, if the board continued to operate in this way, it would be completely insolvent.  I do not accept that.  Although I am not a director at present, milk producers have a director representing them on the board and I have not received that information.  Had things been put right five years ago, the board would be making a profit now.</P>
      <P>All 125 employees of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards are making a contribution to their pension but the State also has a duty to make a contribution. If in his calculations, the Minister did not take into account the contributions made by the employees over the years &mdash; some are near retiring age &mdash; then the figures are coming from the wrong direction.  This assessment does not seem fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worrying to hear the Minister say it is his belief that liabilities outweigh assets in the Dublin District Milk Board. I presume the same situation applies to the Cork District Milk Board because <Col N="1967" /> both are run on the same basis.  During my term on the Dublin District Milk Board, borrowing was low, the operation was well run and contributions were made by producers each year and the board could finance the purchase of a farm, the building of a station and the purchase of bulls.  Listening to the Minister I realise there is something wrong here of which I am not aware.  I will check with our representative on the board to find out what the position is in respect of the Dublin District Milk Board.  We must get an accurate assessment of what is happening.  The Department of Finance never helped the board; in fact, it was a great hindrance.  It is using its own valuers and assessments and using the figures to suit itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is a £3 million shortfall for pensions and £1 million for redundancies, totalling £4 million.  Does that figure take into consideration pensions contributions made by employees of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards?  The State must also make a contribution because it enjoys the money, while people wait for their pensions. Were the State's and the employees' contributions taken into account in the calculations?</P>

      <P>I introduced this Bill to the House two years ago.  At the request of Senators, I negotiated with the staff of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards to reach a consensus and agreement on where we should go.  After two years of talks, we reached agreement. This allowed me to reintroduce the Bill to the Seanad.  Everything was done with the agreement of the staff.</P>
      <P>As regards pensions, it was not a Department of Finance estimate; this was done by an independent actuary.  The findings were agreed by the staff and the board.  Contributions were taken into account but there was a gap between contributions and liabilities.  It was estimated independently and objectively that the gap would be approximately £3 million and that was accepted by the staff and all those concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3 (a):</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) Each member of the staff shall be furnished with a personal guarantee signed by or on behalf of the Minister covering all guarantees to each transferee, including the right to return to the public service in the event of the failure of the new employer.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that lengthy negotiations took place in respect of staff. The staff of the Dublin District Milk Board was, and still is, one of the best in Ireland.  I accept that it may be over-staffed at present because of the uncertainty over the five year period to which I referred.  These people have worked night and day.  The only two days on which this service was not available were Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day. The AI stations were used each day of the year and provided a valuable service for farmers.</P>
      <P>I want to ensure these employees are protected when it comes to pensions and redundancy rights, although the Minister may say the Bill covers that.  However, on behalf of the staff, I ask him to insert this simple amendment which will not cost him a penny but will give the staff a written guarantee from the Minister that they will get their pensions when the time comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to something pointed out to me by a Minister in this Government which I found disturbing.  The Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, recently stated on <Col N="1969" /> radio in relation to a query concerning B &amp; I employees that he was not responsible for any commitments made by a previous Minister during negotiations for the privatisation of that company.  That is worrying for staff of the boards.  It only come to light in the past three days as a result of the statement made by the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>Many employees have given 40 years service to the Dublin District Milk Board and are now entitled to their pension. However, I am worried about the 70 members who will transfer from the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards to the private sector.  These people have worked hard, night and day.  Although they start work at 7 a.m., the last artificial insemination may not be carried out until 10 p.m.  I appeal to the Minister to include this amendment to safeguard these people and their families in view of the prevailing circumstances and the statement made by the Minister for the Marine, in particular within the last fortnight. I tried to get the reference for that statement this morning and I will try again if it is required by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">

      <P>The Department spent the past two years negotiating with the staff.  I had no difficulty with that and I told the House I would return after agreement had been reached with the staff involved.  Although it took two years, we did reach agreement on the grounds that the rights of staff transferring to the private sector were subject to an agreement with the trade union.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive agreement on all staff matters was reached between the Department and the staff under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. The terms of the pension rights are clearly outlined in section 4 of the Bill.  All concerns have been examined in great detail and agreement reached on them.  I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not asking for more than the existing agreement and the Minister has accepted that.  Since there is enormous uncertainty and insecurity in <Col N="1970" /> employment generally outside the public sector, it is not unreasonable to incorporate some guarantee for employees in this legislation as it makes a fundamental change to their position.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to have no problem with the detail of Senator D'Arcy's amendment.  We ask him to incorporate this amendment in the legislation, just as he incorporated the changes to the boards and the other changes necessary for the amalgamation of the two public organisations.  It is not unreasonable that the staff be given the security of legislation to cover the changes to their conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>While this request does not have financial implications, it is very important to the employees who are being transferred from the public to the private sector.  In terms of security there is a big difference between working in the public sector and in the private sector.  It is totally different. The laws of trading and commerce apply more rigidly and have more effect in the private sector.  The private sector is obliged, because of its vulnerability and exposure to commercial forces, to respond to change.</P>
      <P>The concern of these employees is understandable, regardless of any agreement. Agreements are made and changed all the time.  However, this agreement could be enshrined in legislation. If the Minister is concerned about making an indefinite commitment, the guarantee could be confined to current employees and future employees need not be covered by such a regulation. Many of the difficulties would then be overcome and the current employees would not feel as vulnerable or insecure about their transfer from the public to the private sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Neville said, this amendment has no financial implications. We are not asking the Minister to add one pound or one penny to what he has already included in this legislation. We are asking for guarantees.  The Minister may say that negotiations were carried out on his behalf but I have spoken with the unions and they are very worried. <Col N="1971" /> They asked me to propose this amendment which would give the employees some guarantees.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have no problem with the amendment as the legislation has yet to go before the Dáil.  If it had been before the Dáil, the acceptance of an amendment in this House would entail returning the Bill to the Dáil for approval.  This is not so in this case.  The Minister should have no problem inserting this guarantee.  As I said, the acceptance of the amendment will not cost anything.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the amendment.  I do not want to press it to a vote but I, and those involved, feel very strongly about it.  There are 17 employees being transferred from the public to the private sector and all they are asking for is a guarantee.  It is not extraordinary but I appeal to the Minister to accede to their request.</P>

      <P>It was my concern for the rights of staff which delayed this Bill. I could have forged ahead with it and said that the position of staff would be subject to a subsequent agreement. However, I decided to get agreement first and then introduce the Bill.</P>
      <P>After two years and under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission an agreement was reached with the staff and their unions.  The unions have not been back to the Department expressing concern since the agreement was reached.  I would like to read the core section of the agreement which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the transfer, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will furnish to each employee transferring to the new enterprise a <Col N="1972" /> formal written undertaking that, in the event of his/her being made redundant, redeployment in the public sector (as specified at 4.3(e) (ii) above) will be among the options open to him/her. The names and grades of all transferring employees will be registered in the Personnel Division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>There is a gilt edged written agreement which covers all the rights and concerns of the staff.  It was agreed by their staff association or union under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.  I believe that is adequate, as do the staff association or union.  I see no necessity for the amendment and therefore have to reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement that there is a guarantee. There is an industrial relations agreement between the employers, in this instance the public sector or the Minister, and the trade union.  However, industrial relations agreements can be changed. The employer is entitled to renegotiate any agreement, otherwise industry and commerce would grind to a halt.</P>
      <P>Agreements are changed regularly throughout private industry and often must be changed.  However, we do not want the Minister to change what has been agreed in this instance.  We accept his bona fides but ask him to go one step further to ensure that any future Minister must come back to this House and to the Dáil to change this agreement.</P>
      <P>We want to prevent a situation where the new board writes to the trade union saying it has difficulties with the agreement and wants to negotiate to change it.  This happens all the time in industrial relations and possibly should take place in a normal situation.  Circumstances change in organisations and two to ten years from now circumstances will change within the new organisation.  A new board or management might want to change the agreement and under present circumstances they are entitled to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1973" /> Industrial relations involves free agreement between both sides to a set of regulations or proposals.  An agreement is freely entered into by both sides and one side can ask to change it.  This happens all the time and is currently being done in TEAM Aer Lingus and in Irish Steel. They are typical examples of agreements which it is now proposed to change.  Two or three years ago those employees understood that they had binding agreements; the agreements were as binding as they can be in industrial relations. An industrial relations agreement is an agreement freely entered into under the circumstances which prevailed at the time.  We are concerned that a future board and management of the new <Col N="1974" /> agency will want to change that for whatever reasons.  It should not be changed without coming back to the Dáil and the Seanad.  This amendment will not cost the Exchequer a penny but it will give the added security of legislative sanction to the agreement into which the Minister has rightly entered.</P>
    <P>As the Minister entered into the agreement prior to coming here, it should be easier to accept the amendment which confirms the agreement he has entered into with the trade union; it is not asking him to do anything other than to give the agreement the status and protection of legislation.</P>

      <P>This is a purely technical amendment.  In section 5 (1), the words &ldquo;subsequent provisions of this section&rdquo; are to be replaced with the words &ldquo;subsection (2)&rdquo;.  Section 5 (1) is a core provision of the Bill which provides that heat treated milk shall not be sold for liquid <Col N="1975" /> consumption unless it is purchased either directly or indirectly under a contract registered with the agency.  It winds up by referring to exemptions from this provision, which are set out in section 5 (2). There are a further four subsections in section 5 which have nothing to do with the exemptions.  It is considered highly desirable, in order to forestall the possibility of a fractious legal challenge at any stage in the future, to make it plain that only subsection (2) relates to exemptions and hence the revised phraseology.</P>

      <P>Section 5 (2) specifies the exemptions to this requirement in order to cater for islands or other remote parts of the country in times of scarcity for home consumption of milk by producers and for milk otherwise legally imported into the State.  The last mentioned exemption is necessary to avoid creating an obstacle to inter-union trade, which would be in contravention of European Union law.  This exemption does not alter the competitive conditions under which domestic and imported milk will have to compete.  Therefore, it does not place domestic milk at a competitive disadvantage. The exemptions are outlined in section 5 (2).</P>

      <P>Section 5 (2) sets out exemptions from the provisions of the Bill.  One of these, &ldquo;(d) heat-treated milk legally imported into the State&rdquo; is being amended to refer to &ldquo;milk legally imported into the State&rdquo;.  In section 1 milk is defined as raw milk or heat-treated milk.  This amendment will mean that not only imported heat-treated milk will be exempt but also imported raw milk intended for heat treatment as drinking milk in the State.</P>
      <P>In practice this amendment will merely facilitate the <i>status quo</i> in so far as existing trade in importing raw milk from Northern Ireland for pasteurisation at a few small establishments mainly in the Border areas is concerned.  Moreover, without this amendment the provision would be interpreted as making illegal the import of raw milk from other member states.  This would be contrary to European Union law.</P>
      <P>There are a number of small plants in Border areas which receive their milk from across the Border, sometimes directly from farms there.  Nothing can be done about that under European Union law.  Similarly, we can export milk, either pasteurised or raw.  A number of our co-ops have acquired a fairly large portion of the liquid milk market in the UK and if at any time they wished to export longer shelf life milk by tank or otherwise they would be entitled to do so under European Union law.  The same principle applies to the small amounts of milk being imported from across the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is relevant to the type of container used for milk sales. What emphasis is put on the use of glass containers?  Plenty of work has and can be created by selling milk in glass bottles. I am annoyed that we do not put enough emphasis on the sale of milk in a glass bottle.  It has an environmental benefit because the bottles can be used several times and the use of the glass bottle can create jobs.  In County Cork, if only glass bottles were used, the same bottle could be used about eight times.  My local dairy puts strong emphasis on the use of glass bottles.  Unfortunately, it is not general policy in the country.  In America the glass bottle is used and people are conscious of the benefit of its use.  It is a policy that creates plenty of work.  If this country used glass bottles exclusively about 300 extra jobs would be created. Is there a policy for the delivery of milk in glass bottles?  Has the Minister a view on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have strong views on how I take my drink.  Naturally, I like it in a glass, usually with ice and water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Senator.  The glass bottle is the traditional means of distributing milk, particularly in doorstep deliveries.  I would like the average usage figure for the bottle to be greater than eight, although the number can be less than that.  If the figure was about ten or 12 it would be a good achievement.  The difficulty arose from catering requirements and the homogenisation of milk. Milk deteriorates very quickly in glass bottles; it has longer shelf life in opaque cartons.  They are the practical considerations. <Col N="1978" /> In addition, advertising and coupons are carried on cartons while it is difficult to put logos on glass bottles. Many practical considerations are involved in this question.</P>
    <P>It was always recognised that one could judge the compositional quality of milk from the size of the cream line in the glass bottle.  Some people mischievously suggest that the cartons were introduced so that people would not know whether there was fat in the milk; it could not be detected in the cartons.  However, the change to cartons is the result of commercial considerations.  The plastic bottles are the worst because they are thrown everywhere and add to our litter problem. There is usually no such difficulty with glass bottles.</P>
    <P>It is a question for individual dairies. The Senator's local dairy continues to use glass bottles.  I do not know to what extent this policy affects its share of the market.  I do not have the same personal interest in that area of activity now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the environmental situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the plastic bottle and the commercial value of the carton.  However, extra work can be created by, for example, the collection of bottles.  Even the milkman admits that his job can be eliminated through the use of long life milk.  We have seen it being used in other countries, particularly those with high prevailing temperatures. However, milk from a glass bottle is better, particularly if it is kept chilled. Long life milk is not kept chilled.</P>
      <P>In Spain one can purchase milk and use it three months later.  That frightens me.  More jobs could be lost because the use of long life milk is beneficial to cardboard manufacturers and printers.  Can we formulate a policy to emphasise the use of the bottle?  Can we, for example, offer milk in a glass bottle at a cheaper price?  Can we encourage people to use glass?  It creates more work.  America is way ahead of us in terms of commercialisation, yet there is an emphasis there on the use of the glass bottle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk in a glass bottle is fresher and people should be made aware of that; it <Col N="1979" /> is also beneficial from an environmental point of view; milkmen calling to peoples' houses every morning can keep an eye on the elderly and, most importantly, if we used bottles more people would be working.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Minister should be looking for opportunities to use glass.  I do not want to give people more opportunities to destroy our environment. We should help those who provide environmentally clean work.  Can we encourage, demand or recommend the use of glass bottles?  Are we serious enough about this issue?</P>

      <P>No, I exclude present company in order to be fair.  Certain supermarkets, Dunnes Stores in particular, lay low waiting to catch out the co-ops on prices.  All supermarkets are in a good position because they enjoy a most unreasonable 30 per cent discount from the co-ops.  They also have a period of three months to pay for the milk.  They enjoy benefits in buying milk from which the consumer, to a greater or lesser degree, is not benefiting.  Supermarkets are scooping the money for themselves.</P>
      <P>What control if any has the Department over below cost selling of milk in supermarkets?  This is a dangerous practice which has caused great damage in other areas and it should be avoided. I do not laud any supermarket which engages in below cost selling.  It may get extra business but it damages the trade to such an extent that the trade finds it hard to recover from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have avoided it thus far although Dunnes Stores tried to take on the co-ops but failed badly.  With the exception of one co-op in North Donegal which <Col N="1980" /> gave Dunnes a small milk supply which did not last long, the co-ops stood shoulder to shoulder in that period.</P>

      <P>On the same issue I have asked this question of another Senator, an operator of a leading chain store, but failed to get an answer.  In County Donegal milk, some of which is exported to Northern Ireland is sold at a retail price for two litres of milk of between £1.12 to £1.16, whether in a supermarket or a small shop.  Milk exported to the North is being sold according to a newspaper advertisement at 99 pence for three litres in Dunnes Stores.  Last week, Wellworths in Strabane sold two litres of milk for 48 pence.</P>

      <P>Why does this happen? The producer does not benefit.  I am told the chainstores get a 30 per cent discount, but there is a difference of over 130 per cent between the prices of 48 pence and of £1.16 for two litres of milk.  This is a serious discrepancy.  Milk is a fundamental family need.  Rather than joke about the matter in the House, I ask the Minister to enlighten the people on this differential in prices.  I have asked my learned colleague&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree that undercutting the price of milk can damage the industry. It may benefit urban areas where people are close to the supermarket chains but rural people with door to door delivery pay more for their milk.  It is unfair to have varying prices for different sectors.  Because it is a perishable commodity, milk cannot be supplied at a <Col N="1981" /> below cost rate to everyone so something should be done.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill but I must say a word on behalf of the shopkeeper.  One matter mentioned last week by Senator Kelleher and by others today was a three month delay in payment to the dairies.  I am delighted to know of this delay.  Now people who do not receive this credit of three months will insist on it in future.</P>
      <P>If shops sell milk at too low a price it appears to cause problems for producers. If shops sell at too high a price they are criticised by people like Senator McGowan speaking on behalf of consumers. This area would be better served by less rather than more regulation; it should be left open to market forces.  In doing so, we will get a competitive market which will not please both producers and consumers but it is probably the ideal position.</P>
      <P>That is my word on behalf of the poor downtrodden shopkeeper, who is never appreciated.</P>

      <P>In case the Minister gets the wrong impression, this is not a local war between small producers where the market is over supplied.  The advertisement refers to the sale of milk by a large multiple store.  This is not a case where the milk is about to go bad and is down in price.  This sale of milk has been advertised in a reputable national newspaper.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to become voluntarily caught in the crossfire of this milk war.  As Senator Quinn said, the price of milk is a matter for market forces.  If there is a difficulty it is a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs; it is not a function of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or of the new agency.  The purpose and role of the agency is to ensure that producers get adequate payment for the supply of milk all year and that people in urban areas will be able to have an adequate supply of milk all year round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> Retail price control was abolished in 1988 and disputes are now resolved by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Difficulties flare up from time to time but they are resolved in due course and I am sure that will continue to be the case.  In any event, this agency has no role in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the producer would get adequate payment all year round.  What exactly does that mean?  Is there a difference between the price for the summer months and for the winter months and is it being regulated by this authority?  If so, what is the authority's power in the price of milk?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The producer price of milk is to be decided between the agency and the producers.  As already said the agency will be represented on the board by producer interests.  It will naturally have to skew the price to give adequate compensation for winter milk production. In other words, there will be a higher price for those months.  That will be decided between the registered liquid milk producers and the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Door to door delivery is the traditional way of supplying milk in Ireland, although the practice is declining.  I do not know if it will continue in the long term because younger people may not like to get out of bed at four o'clock in the morning to deliver to individual houses.  Another commercial consideration will be long life milk, although it tastes burnt and unpleasant to the Irish palate.  Labour costs are a large part of an enterprise and commercial considerations must be taken into account. Finland is the only country in this hemisphere which drinks more milk <i>per capita</i> than we do.  Milk is an excellent product and its use should be encouraged.  The National Dairy Council promotes milk and milk products and we are near the top of the international league in that <Col N="1983" /> regard.  Door to door deliveries contribute to that and I hope they continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the National Milk Agency and setting a price, a surplus system operates during the summer months, but one must produce a certain quota of milk during the winter months. Will that system still apply?  A registered milk producer under the new agency could decide not to supply milk.  Will penalties be imposed on a producer if he does not fulfil his obligations to produce milk during certain winter months? Under the present system, a person will be penalised because he will have extra surplus during the summer months at a lower price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point, but we should not say that the sale of milk is decreasing.  We have a surplus of milk, which the EU must store for us, and it is a product from which we create other products.  Does the Department place any emphasis on the fact that the sale of milk from door to door creates an opportunity to work.  The Minister's statement that young people do not want to get out of bed early to deliver this product is nonsense.  People want to get out of bed and work is an incentive.</P>
      <P>Milkmen work a four day week and this should be increased to six days.  The use of glass bottles would create a six day working week and milkmen prefer them. This country, through the EU, should place more emphasis on selling milk in glass bottles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to those who will introduce the Ethics in Public Office Bill, I want people to have the opportunity to do something for themselves.  I do not want particular groups availing of the opportunity to eliminate the employment of people selling milk from door to door, although that is already happening because of lower prices in some areas. What can the Department do to stop this and to create more jobs through the use of glass bottles and door to door deliveries? The Minister should not forget that more than 52 per cent of our people are <Col N="1984" /> under 25 years of age and many of them would be able to get up at three o'clock in the morning to deliver milk, if they thought they would make money from it. That is not the problem.</P>
    <P>In America, milk is still delivered and bottles returned the following day.  Its system is itemised which shows its important to this society.  We should create such a policy so that the rest of Europe can learn from it.  We should not capitulate to the carton on the shelf or long life milk, which tastes burnt, as the Minister admitted.  I do not want that and I demand a glass bottle from my milkman because the milk tastes better.</P>

      <P>Previously, prices were fixed by order of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Senator Kelleher made an important point about liquid milk producers being obliged to produce enough milk for the winter.  It is acceptable to produce milk in the summer because of the seasonality of the industry, but it must also be produced in the winter.  There is a greater demand now for liquid milk, particularly in the winter months.  Section 6 (2) (c) states: &ldquo;...in the opinion of the Agency, provides adequate compensation to the producer for raw milk supplied under the contract throughout the year, taking into account, in particular, in relation to the winter months, the economic cost of production of raw milk of suitable quality for heat treatment for liquid consumption all the year round;&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to this section because we are talking about the price of milk.  I am sure that all aspects of <Col N="1985" /> the industry, production costs and liquid milk, will be taken into account by the agency when it decides the type of incentive it will give, by way of a bonus, during the summer months to produce milk in the winter.  However, it is costly and hard earned.</P>
      <P>The agency will decide the price the producer will get for the milk.  Senator Quinn always likes to protect the consumer, but the agency cannot decide what the consumer will pay for it.</P>

      <P>On Senator Cregan's request that door to door deliveries and glass bottles be promoted, the National Dairy Council is charged with the promotion, extra sale and consumption of milk and milk products.  It is doing that and in some of its advertisements a milkman or milkwoman is at a door with a number of pints which seem to be in glass bottles.  We cannot legislate for this.  It is a matter for the milkmen because some of them are friendly and provide a range of other services in addition to supplying milk.  They could increase their sales by showing flexibility in many areas.</P>
      <P>As regards the points raised by Senators Kiely and Kelleher about the provision of milk in urban areas throughout the year, section 6 (2) (b) states that the contract drawn up between the agency and the producer shall be &ldquo;for an unbroken period of 12 months or more which provides for supply all the year round by the producer of raw milk with a specified minimum percentage of the producer's production being supplied during a prescribed period (the &ldquo;winter months&ldquo;) or for supply during the winter months only;&rdquo;.  There is no question of someone using the seasonality of supply and grass based milk production during the summer and leaving the consumers in urban areas high and dry during the winter.  This will be a matter for the new agency and the producers.</P>

      <P>A contract will be between the producer and processor, based on a guarantee of a certain supply during the winter months.  In respect of some of the pasteurising plants which also have a manufacturing plant and where registered milk producers supply liquid milk on the one hand and manufacturing milk on the other hand, what kind of inspectorate is in place in the Department to control that?</P>
      <P>If a liquid milk producer is supplying liquid milk under contract the seasonality factor comes into play straight away.  The producer is forced to supply 40 per cent of his milk through the winter period. He is entitled to higher payment at that stage.  I am not accusing anybody of doing anything wrong but there is always a danger that the pasteuriser will use manufacturing milk for the liquid trade.  What kind of guarantees has the Minister put in place in respect of this issue?  Can he guarantee that the producers who sign the contract and are paid the extra price will provide all the liquid milk supplied to that plant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the point Senator D'Arcy is making.  Some multipurpose groups now produce both manufacturing and liquid milk and there is some suspicion that some farmers are paid the manufacturing rate while the milk goes for liquid consumption.  Under this legislation the agency will have its inspectorate.  The agency will carry out its own monitoring as to the volume of milk sold to consumers and the volume of milk purchased at liquid milk price.  If there is a variation they will have to check it out further to ensure there is a clear delineation between manufacturing milk and liquid milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is concerned about and has a role in ensuring that standards are maintained and that they are up to a minimum level, but the agency will monitor the volume of milk going into <Col N="1987" /> the liquid milk stream and ensure that it is paid for at liquid milk price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">

There is a dangerous situation in that where a farmer registered as a liquid milk producer dies, the agency has the authority to say that the contract automatically goes.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister giving a guarantee that the contract will automatically go back to the next of kin on that farm?  If that does not happen a dangerous situation could develop where the agency could get its own pool of milk.  The farmer would be a very big loser in that regard.</P>

      <P>The question of funds and the levies payable by processors is covered under section 8, which goes into great detail.  All moneys received by the agency, essentially the levies described in section 8, must be paid into a fund.  From this fund the agency must make any payments required under this Bill and meet the expenses it incurs in carrying out its functions.  The agency may borrow on the security of the fund, but only with the consent of both the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance. Any surplus in the fund may be invested in trust funds and the agency may manage a portfolio of investments.  All interests and dividends received as well as the proceeds on sale of investment must be paid back into the fund.  The matter is covered adequately in section 8.</P>

      <P>The agency may, with the consent of the Minister, alter the rate of levy on giving two months' notice in writing specifying the altered rate and the date on and from which it is taking effect to each registered producer and registered processor of the agency's decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The present levy is around .82 per cent which is, of course, confined to the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards areas.  Under the new agency, it will apply to the whole country, supplying to Galway, Limerick and other urban areas.  Indeed, it is envisaged that the levy will be substantially less than <Col N="1990" /> that.  A figure of .3 per cent may be closer to the mark, but that will have to be fixed between the agency and the registered producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he expects the levy to be much less than .82 per cent.  The inspectorate, based in Dublin and Cork cities, will now have to go to every small town and processor in the country. Does the Minister not think there will be an increased expense involved for inspections?  The real costs will arise there.  The inspectorate, when dealing with the huge dairies in Dublin and Cork, operated in a confined region. Under this Bill, they will have to visit every processor.  They will now be dealing with about 240 processors, as opposed to 20 to 30 in the past.  Was there any assessment made of the cost involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The main idea of the agency was to ensure there was an adequate milk supply for consumers all year round.  Great care was taken to set up a small agency of no more than five to six people, which would be self-financing by way of this levy.  Additionally, the old levy was also used in connection with other activities of the board, some of which may have been profitable at times but not at others.  Therefore, there was some degree of cross-subsidisation.  For all the work we will carry out with this relatively small body, the amount of levy will be small.  Producers and farmers would object to another agency with a large levy.  Farmers, and registered liquid milk producers, will, on the whole, ensure it remains at a relatively small rate.</P>

I do not remember people having to appeal under a certain section of the Act if there was a problem with their contract.  Why did the Minister include this section?  I presume there is a reason.  Was there a similar provision in the last Bill?  To my knowledge, there was not, but I am not sure.</P>
      <P>The present operation consists of a type of gentleman's agreement between the registered producer and the board and there has been little conflict.  I hope the Minister does not foresee such conflicts. I accept the present EU standards are high.  Under the somatic cell count system, if a farmer does not go under 400,000 gallons by the end of this year, they will not be allowed to produce liquid milk.  There is also a certain bacteria count level the EU are prepared to accept.  I agree with the stringent regulations the EU have imposed on the production of liquid milk.  However, we should not have these clashes.  The section proposing the establishment of an appeals mechanism through the Minister's Department worries me.  What is the reason for it?  Did it operate in the past and can it operate effectively now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides a mechanism for appeals against decisions of the agency by either producers or processors. The decisions in question will relate to a refusal to register a contract, the cancellation of registration, the alteration of an entry into the register of the agency or the cancellation of an entry. The appeal will be heard and determined by an officer of the Minister appointed for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is different to that of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards, which had a minimum producer price order.  Therefore, there was no conflict on that.  In this case, one has individual contracts between an agency and the registered liquid milk supplier.  I would not envisage a dispute occurring often, but if there is one such as a farmer not <Col N="1992" /> reregistered, refused registration &mdash; when a son takes over from his father, for example &mdash; or have it cancelled, it is only prudent to have some appeals system.  An aggrieved individual can go to an independent officer and have the appeal determined.  Under section 19, &ldquo;the appeal shall be heard and determined by an officer of the Minister appointed by the Minister for that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable to have an appeals system because it can act as a recourse in the event of a grievance. However, section 13 states the appeal is confined to subsections (2) and (3).  This suggests that the agency can &ldquo;cancel the registration of a person in any register upon the application of that person or, in the cases of an individual, that person's personal representative or, in the case of a body corporate, the liquidator or examiner.&rdquo;  If the decision goes against the personal representative or the body corporate, am I correct in assuming there is no recourse to appeal?  If this is the case, it is a deficiency in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am a little worried about this provision.  These problems were always dealt with by the producer representatives on the board.  If there was a genuine problem, they could, in conjunction with its chairman, interview the farmer and processor concerned and iron it out.  Putting a Department inspector into this role would make the situation more difficult.  The official may not be that well equipped to deal with it.  The official may know the regulations, but may not be able to understand the farmer's problems.  If a producer was refused registration up to now, the two representatives of the board and the chairman would call the processor and see where the difficulties lay.  The Minister is putting an inspector into that role.  I am not pleased with this section; it certainly did not apply under the old regulations. Where did it come from?</P>

      <P>On Senator Dardis' point, a producer or processor who is <Col N="1993" /> dissatisfied with a decision under this section may appeal to the Circuit Court against it or have an appeal heard and determined by an officer of the Minister appointed for that purpose under this section.  Under section 13, the agency shall give the registered person representation and is obliged to appoint a personal representative. There is no requirement for appeal under this section.  If there are any further concerns on that matter, I will be glad to take it into account when the Bill goes back to the Dáil.</P>

    <Title>An Bord Bia Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Brian O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I addressed the House on 11 May 1994 on the subject of the Report of the Expert Group on the Food Industry I indicated that the Bill to establish An Bord Bia had just been introduced to the Dáil and that I hoped to bring it before the Seanad very quickly. I now have great pleasure in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill stems from one of the two central recommendations made by the <Col N="1997" /> Expert Group.  This was that a new single food promotion and market development agency should be formed by amalgamating CBF and the corresponding units of similar agencies dealing with other sectors of the food industry.  The Expert Group's other main recommendation was that an integrated development programme for the food industry should be established under the new round of EU Structural Funds.  As I have already advised the House, this is being done.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the provisions of the Bill I should like to remind the House that the Expert Group on the Food Industry dealt in some detail with the institutional framework within which the industry operates and made several recommendations for improvements in that area.  However, it took the view that, by and large, those improvements could be implemented administratively.</P>
    <P>Consequently the Bill focuses on one element only of the institutional framework, that of promotion and market development.  This is, however, as the House will agree, an element of vital importance.  Our food industry has been making rapid progress but in the context of CAP reform and of the GATT agreement it faces major competition and challenges. The Government is determined to provide properly focused State agency back-up for the industry in its efforts to develop and expand markets, particularly in Europe.  An Bord Bia is the instrument designed to achieve this.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Bill proposes in the first instance to combine CBF and the food unit of ABT, and to include certain export promotion functions of An Bord Glas.  Provision is also made for the possible inclusion of other relevant agencies' food functions as and when appropriate.</P>
    <P>In the drafting of this legislation, particular care has been taken to maintain the structures, mechanisms and market information systems that have worked well in CBF.  In this connection it will be noted that a subsidiary board for meat and livestock is specifically provided for. I do not envisage additional Exchequer expenditure arising from the legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> With regard to the text itself, part 1 contains, in sections 1 to 5, fairly standard provisions relating to the short title, interpretation of the main terms used, the making of ministerial orders and provision for expenses incurred in administering the Act, to be met from voted moneys.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with a range of matters relating to the establishment, organisation, procedures and functions of the new agency.  Section 6 provides for the establishment of the agency and for the dissolution of CBF on the establishment day to be fixed.  Of course, this does not mean that any of CBF's current functions will be abandoned or lost sight of.  On the contrary, it is intended that these functions will be strengthened and extended to other sectors of the food industry.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the general functions of the board while more specific functions are contained in section 8.  The specific functions which are without prejudice to the generality of section 7, and, therefore, non-exhaustive, cover the whole range of activities appropriate to the type of agency envisaged.  These include promotion, market intelligence, market development, symposia, publications and quality assurance.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the transfer of certain functions of An Bord Glas to the new agency.  An Bord Glas itself will remain in place; only those of its functions that relate to the export marketing of edible horticultural products are being transferred.  The remit which An Bord Glas has in relation to the home market is much wider than that proposed for An Bord Bia.  It also has substantial functions in regard to non-edible horticultural products such as nursery stock.  Those activities will not be transferred.</P>
    <P>In the same section, there is provision for the assignment to An Bord Bia, at a later stage, of other functions related to food marketing.  This would cover, for instance, the case where, following the review of BIM's functions, currently in progress, it might be decided to transfer to An Bord Bia responsibility for fish as a food.  This power could be exercised <Col N="1999" /> only with the consent of other Ministers responsible for bodies from which the transfer of functions might be proposed, and with the specific consent of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 10 allows for assignment of additional functions to the new agency where these are incidental to or consequential on the functions assigned by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11 requires An Bord Bia to act in co-operation with other bodies that have functions relevant to its own.  What is intended here is that close and effective co-operation will be maintained between An Bord Bia and An Bord Tráchtála, especially with regard to the use of facilities abroad and, indeed, with An Bord Glas and BIM.</P>
    <P>Section 12 empowers the new agency to charge for its services.  The intention is that fees under this section will be charged for services provided to those sectors which do not contribute to the new agency by way of levy.  It is not intended that the section should operate as a means of applying a double levy system.  The level of fees to be charged would be drawn up by the board but subject always to ministerial approval. While, obviously, the level of fees should not be exorbitant or act as a deterrent, at the same time I would expect them to make a substantial contribution to An Bord Bia's budget.  I should mention here also that I expect the board to benefit substantially from EU funding to be provided under the Structural Fund Food Sub-Programme.</P>
    <P>Section 13 imposes on the board the obligation to set up a subsidiary board for meat and livestock which would maintain and continue the current functions and focus of CBF.  It also empowers the board to set up, with ministerial consent or on ministerial direction, subsidiary boards for other sectors.  As my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, already indicated in the Dáil, in view of the emphasis which the expert group on the food industry placed on the prepared consumer foods sector and the very specific recommendations which it <Col N="2000" /> made in the context of the establishment of the new agency, it is expected that the board will move very quickly to set up a subsidiary board for that sector.  It is also intended that levies collected from particular sectors, for instance those of meat and livestock, should be used for the benefit of those sectors.  Subsections (1) and (5), together with the right of the Minister to specify conditions under subsection (3), will allow that procedure to be observed.</P>
    <P>Sections 14, 15 and 16 deal with the appointment and terms of office of the chairman and members of the board and subsidiary boards.  The essential qualification for membership is that the persons to be appointed should, in the case of the main board, have knowledge or experience of the food industry and, in the case of a subsidiary board, of the particular sector for which it is being established, but with all appointees being required to have knowledge of the consumer requirements.  The appointments to the main board will be made by the Minister and those to the subsidiary boards by the board.  The provisions in relation to the meat and livestock subsidiary board mirror those currently applying in CBF.  In that way the aim of preserving in the meat sector the focus and producer links that have worked well in CBF will be achieved.  Those provisions also take account of the important CBF levy arrangements that will be carried into An Bord Bia, and of the representational pattern which that implies. To ensure effective links between the main board and the subsidiaries, the chairmen of the subsidiary boards will be appointed from the membership of the main board.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 to 20, inclusive, deal with a number of matters common to the board and the subsidiary boards such as eligibility of outgoing members for reappointment, conditions of office, casual vacancies and remuneration.  Remuneration and allowances for expenses will require the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 cover accounts, audits and annual reports as well as the <Col N="2001" /> supply of any information about performance of the functions of the board and of the subsidiary boards that the Minister may require.  Section 23 allows the board to borrow money but only with the consent of the Minister and of the Minister for Finance.  Section 24 lays down some framework provisions as regards meetings and procedure within which the board, or a subsidiary board, will be free to determine its more detailed procedures.  Section 25 contains stringent provisions to guard against conflicts of interest on the part of members of the board or of a subsidiary board or of the staff of the agency.  Section 26 will prevent incorrect disclosure of information by any of those persons.  Section 27 allows investment of funds by the board in the manner of a trustee.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for setting up committees to assist and advise the board or a subsidiary board.  This is similar to the existing committee system employed by CBF and which has proved useful and effective in practice.</P>
    <P>Under section 29, the board and the subsidiary boards are required to comply with any ministerial policy directives. This is a standard provision for bodies of this kind but one which I would not envisage being used to any significant extent.  This Bill sets a clear framework for the board and it should be allowed to operate freely within that framework. Thus the power under this section would be used only for necessary policy directives.</P>
    <P>Section 30 empowers the board to accept gifts but only if any trusts or conditions attached would not be inconsistent with the board's functions.</P>

      <P>Section 31 applies to the board, the subsidiary boards and the staff of the new agency, the standard provisions to cover the situation where a member becomes a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 32 and 33 enable the board to appoint a full-time chief executive and <Col N="2002" /> other staff members, with remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions subject to national or governmental guidelines and ministerial directives.  Section 34 enables the board, or a subsidiary board, to perform its functions through authorised staff members.</P>
    <P>Under section 35, the board is required to draw up for its staff a superannuation scheme or schemes which will be submitted to the Minister and, after approval, laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It will be noted that the preexisting superannuation entitlements of staff transferred to An Bord Bia are safeguarded under section 35 (7).</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides for grants-in-aid to An Bord Bia from Exchequer funds, as is already the practice for CBF and ABT. While it is expected that the greater part of the new agency's resources would come from levies, fees for services and EU Structural Funds, there will also be an annual grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, dealing with levies on livestock and agricultural products, is largely based on existing legislation relating to CBF, legislation that will become inoperative once An Bord Bia is established and CBF dissolved.  The specific amounts of levy per animal shown in section 37 (2) are the present statutory amounts operated by CBF, and the present practice whereby those amounts are charged to the vendor of livestock for slaughter is taken up under section 38 (7).  It is also present CBF practice, however, to collect a voluntary, i.e. non-statutory, levy from slaughterers and that latter charge is not intended to be passed back to the vendor.  Sections 38 (7) and 38 (8) taken together enable the Minister to put the latter non-statutory levy on a statutory basis.  It is the intention that this would be done in the event of the voluntary arrangement being discontinued or not working satisfactorily; however, any order varying the current statutory levy amounts would, in accordance with section 37 (4) be subject to a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas as also would any order on recoverability under section 38 (8).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> The other provisions of sections 37 to 44, inclusive, relate to the mechanics of the levy on livestock, such as records, offences and penalties, powers of authorised officers, estimation of levy where necessary and evidence in proceedings. These are similar to existing provisions governing current CBF levy collection, except that under section 38 (10) (c) cancellation of the stamps by means of which levies on exported animals are paid will be effected by staff of my Department instead of Customs and Excise staff as is the case under the existing CBF legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides for a levy on agricultural products.  This is to cover the situation where it might prove more convenient or desirable in sectors other than the livestock/meat sector to introduce levy arrangements for promotional purposes rather than to charge fees.  An order under this section would require prior consultation with the producer, processor or trade interests concerned, as well as a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In Part IV of the Bill, which deals with transitional provisions, section 46 means that the initial staff of An Bord Bia would be the existing staff of CBF together with An Bord Tráchtála staff members designated by ABT itself.  As regards the latter, the intention would be that the current food unit of ABT would be transferred to An Bord Bia on the establishment day.  As I indicated earlier when speaking about section 35, transferred staff will run no risk of losing out on superannuation rights.  Neither will they be at risk as regards their remuneration and conditions of service.  Section 47 provides that they will be no less favourably treated than before in those respects.  I do not anticipate that the transfer of functions from An Bord Glás would necessitate any transfer of staff from that organisation.</P>
    <P>In section 48, the central provision is that in subsection (1), which transfers CBF property to An Bord Bia.  The effect of the reference in section 48 (3) to the Finance Act, 1985 is to exempt An Bord <Col N="2004" /> Bia from liability for stamp duty in respect of any transferred property.</P>
    <P>Section 49 transfers the rights and liabilities of CBF, as well as any pending legal proceedings it might have, to An Bord Bia.  Since ABT is not being dissolved, the transfer of any rights and liabilities from that agency will be dealt with administratively.  Section 50 provides for the final audited accounts of CBF, after its dissolution on the establishment day, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Schedule attached to the Bill, relating to levy on livestock exported live, deals with the forms of adhesive stamp to show that levy has been paid, as well as the document to which they would be affixed.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the beginning, the establishment of An Bord Bia is but one element in the programme which the Expert Group on the Food Industry set out for the development of the industry over the next five years or so.  It is a key element, however, in that without it the other measures recommended by the group, almost all of which are now at various stages of implementation, would not have their full or optimum effect.  I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>This area is very important and fundamental to our economy. There is great potential for job creation if we can capture the markets available to us in Europe and further afield.  The Bill is disappointing.  It derives from the recommendations made last year by the Expert Group on the Food Industry.  As a means of making these recommendations concrete, the Bill has a number of defects.  Like other Bills presented by the Government, it is excessively bureaucratic. The Government has a fatal tendency to find the most bureaucratic way to introduce what I consider to be easy regulations.  The Bill illustrates that Fianna Fáil has given way to the Labour Party, which always seeks the most bureaucratic way possible of doing what it sets out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> This was clear from the Minister's speech.  I have rarely heard an introductory speech say so little about the inspiration behind the measures taken.  It is appalling that there was no suggestion of any notion of enterprise or development. The Minister blandly told us that the Culliton report had made certain recommendations, as had the expert group.  He then gave us an expanded version of the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill.  He did not give any of the reasons for what is in the Bill.  I suspect this was for a good reason. God knows there was enough debate on it.  Had the Minister waited longer, he might have found a few more things to throw in.</P>
    <P>I can see no plan in the Bill.  It is a random collection of what exists.  It will not change the world as far as the promotion or marketing of agricultural produce and food is concerned.  If the Bill did nothing but change the style of the organisations, it would not be too bad. However, it is important to bear in mind that the recommendations of the expert group, on which the Bill is founded, were made as part of a strategy.  There is other material in the group's report but the Bill bears little relation to much of it.  There is no indication that the Government is pursuing any particular strategy.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published, while it had some defects, it was a good and well articulated.  Those who produced it have every right to feel disappointed and let down by the way it has been brought forward, both in the Dáil and the Seanad. I was expecting to hear more from the Minister, as a result of the debate which took place on the Bill in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The group highlighted the absolute necessity of reducing seasonal imbalances in beef and milk production, if we are to maximise added value from food production.  It recommends that we should aim to reduce the percentage of milk used for butter from its present level of between 60 to 65 per cent to between 50 to 55 per cent over a three year period. It also recommends that we should reduce our share of European Union butter production from 8 per cent to 6 <Col N="2006" /> per cent and try to increase our share of semi hard cheese production from 3 per cent to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill, or anywhere else, to indicate that the Government has taken any action, either at European Union or national level, to bring about these most important changes. If we do not do so, then it does not matter what we call the board, how it is appointed or the amount of funding it will receive &mdash; it will not make much difference to the value added by our dairy sector to the economy.</P>
    <P>The group recommended that we should aim to ensure that 20 per cent of slaughterings would take place in each of the first three quarters of the year.  Very little progress, if any, has been made in that direction since the report was published. The excessively rigid retention period, which is still insisted on under the beef premium scheme, is a major obstacle to achieving such a pattern in our beef output.  As repeatedly pointed out to the Minister, those excessive retention periods are a very real obstacle to the ordinary marketing of our beef and, therefore, to expanding and increasing added value in food production.</P>
    <P>The beef industry is still trying to come to terms with the fall out from the humiliating defeat of the Minister in the carcass weight issue; a defeat which we could all see staring him in the face long before he even recognised that a problem exists. This is another factor which will militate against the kind of strategy set out by the expert group and which makes this Bill irrelevant in terms of any strategy to develop the food industry.</P>
    <P>The expert group proposed that development agencies should consider supporting final processing and marketing activities abroad.  There is no evidence that anything of that kind has been undertaken or contemplated by our development agencies, we all know that they are only now finding their feet after the erroneous and useless shake-up which the Department imposed on them. We now have the IDA and other organisations; committees spawning in the bowels of the Department of Enterprise <Col N="2007" /> and Employment; the county enterprise boards and other boards at county level which, as far as I and most people are concerned &mdash; and I am a member of a couple of them &mdash; duplicate each other, which is a great mistake.  I expected that at this stage the Government and the Minister would have seen that these boards serve a useful purpose but that four or five of them cannot duplicate each other's activities in the same area.</P>
    <P>The evidence is that, so far, nothing has been done which even goes in the direction of the group's recommendations. The expert group recommended the creation of a substantial branded product development fund from extra European Structural Funds.  The report was published in April last year but nothing like this has happened to date.  On the contrary, we now know that the amount of Structural Funds will be considerably less than the amount which the Government dishonestly claimed that we would receive, even at the time that the expert group's report was published.</P>
    <P>We also know that the amounts allocated to the various programmes set out in the spurious National Development Plan are in danger of being cut but of course, we do not know from where the cuts will come.  Fianna Fáil, Labour, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Minister for the Environment and the Taoiseach have all refused to give even the slightest idea of which part of the National Development Plan will be cut by 8 to 12 per cent or whatever percentage is forced on the Government as a result of its stupidity in the handling of the Structural Funds episode.</P>
    <P>The climate has changed utterly since the day the expert group proposed we should have a substantial product development fund from extra EU Structural Fund resources.  We now know that there are no extra resources and, as far as I can see, no consideration has been given to the creation of a branded product development fund.  Another important piece of the strategy set out by the <Col N="2008" /> expert group on food production has been totally ignored, another reason the Bill has serious defects.</P>
    <P>Neither the operational programme for the food industry nor any other operational programme has been published. We do not know the kind of development funds the Government has in mind for the food industry or any other sector of the economy.  We have no idea of what the development climate will be for the next new body which the Government intends to cobble together for the various bodies now in existence.  We do not know the kind of framework under which this body will work.  How, therefore, can the Minister expect this House to give him its views on the body or how can we have an informed view of the kind of role which it should have?</P>
    <P>The food industry is not the only sector in which there is uncertainty in the context of this infamous and spurious National Development Plan.  The expert group said a number of wise things about the necessity for port development.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, should look again at the report as he has a constituency interest in this matter.  We do not know what will happen in this regard; what the operational programme in the relevant sector will be or the level of funding which will be available for port facilities.  The food industry does not know what kind of improvement it can expect in terms of the facilities at its disposal to expand exports.</P>
    <P>Given the uncertainty about the national development plan and the Government's failure to make any significant progress with the other parts of the strategy on which the whole idea of putting this new body in place was built, it is nonsense for the Minister to introduce the Bill at this time.  The Minister referred to the Culliton report.  I invite him to look again at that report and the Moriarty report &mdash; the report to the Government on the Culliton report. There is a yawning chasm between what the Government has been doing for the past year and the recommendations in these reports.  It is nonsense for the Minister <Col N="2009" /> to come forward with a Bill which pretends to be part of a strategy for the food industry.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal more in the Bill which fails to match up to the report of the expert group published in April 1993 referring to food safety, quality and nutrition.  Recommendation number 27 refers to minimum safety and hygiene standards for food.  What is the Minister doing about that?  Is anything planned in that regard which would help the new body to promote and market Irish food abroad?  As far as I know, the Minister has not brought anything forward.</P>
    <P>In recommendation number 31, the expert group makes wise remarks about topics which should be included in the syllabus for second level schools.  It is proposed that the Minister should make nominations for the council for vocational education awards; that FÁS should establish a 16 week foundation course for food and that the Dublin Institute of Technology should provide pre-entry training for meat factory operatives. Has any of that been done?  That was not mentioned in the speech which the Minister made to the Dáil or here today.  Will this new board have any say in that or is this just another pious platitude?</P>
    <P>Recommendation number 33 of the report of the expert group is an interesting one, part of which states that £15 million per annum, in addition to the EU funds, for food research and development should be included in the new EU Structural Funds framework.  The food industry has lacked research and development for the last 15 years, as the Department of Agriculture well knows. That was never mentioned.  If we are to retain and gain markets in Europe, we must invest in research and development. That is not something new which I brought to this House, it is something which everybody knows.  I am greatly disappointed, having read the Minister's speech and listened carefully to the speech of the Minister of State, that that was not even mentioned.</P>
    <P>This is a far cry from the initiative which the Minister announced earlier in <Col N="2010" /> the year about research and development when, if my memory serves me correctly, he spoke of approximately £7 million. What is the Minister doing about that? He is not even going half way to meet it and appears to have a different type of research and development programme in mind.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 10 that &ldquo;The Minister may by order assign to the Board such additional functions as the Minister considers to be incidental or consequential on the functions assigned to it by this Act.&rdquo;  This is another dubious provision allowing the Minister to have second, third or fourth thoughts, to come back in a year and decide that something which was left out of the Bill should be inserted.  Such a power should not be inserted in this type of Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 states: &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2), the Board may make such charges as it considers appropriate in consideration of the performance by it of its functions, the provision by it of services and the carrying on by it of activities.&rdquo; The Minister said he hoped these charges would not be excessive, but there is no provision in the Bill to have them controlled or inspected by anybody.  The Bill provides the proposed new board with powers to enforce these charges.  I am not talking about levies, but about fees which the board is empowered to charge for its services, if it can find unfortunates in a position to want to avail of them, particularly when it is operating within the type of policy vacuum which I spoke about earlier.</P>
    <P>I listened to what the Minister said about this Bill and its provisions.  He spoke at length about charges or levies. Given that structures already exist, I do not understand why the Minister is now talking about bringing in part of Bord Iascaigh Mara.  I was a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture for three and a half years.  When I took office in 1983, I found there was little or no attempt to sell fish abroad.  I set about doing that, but I did not want a lot of legislation of this type.  It required looking at markets to find out what the requirements were and then to sell fish. <Col N="2011" /> I do not claim to be an expert, but Bord Iscaigh Mara had experts.  The Minister spoke about setting up an overall board with responsibility for all exports, including fish.  This will be so bureaucratic that by the time it is set up the markets will be gone.</P>
    <P>I headed a delegation from Wexford County Council which visited Germany last week where we spoke to industrialists. The markets are there, but we are not ready to take them up.  The research and development aspect of the food industry has been neglected by successive Governments and the food industry itself.  This is partly explained by intervention.  Those involved in processing consistently use intervention instead of using research and development to sell meat on the open market.  I will not oppose the Bill because it has already gone through the Dáil and I would like it go through this House. However, I am greatly disappointed by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak and I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome this important legislation which arises from the report of the expert group on the food industry which reported to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in 1993.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to set up a single body which would be responsible for the expert promotion of food.  The Bill is most timely; it could be argued that a single food industry promotion body should have been set up before now. Regardless of developments in EU agricultural policy in the past year or two, the need for a single body is clear.  The dramatic changes which have taken place in CAP, the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the demands of the Single Market place additional pressures on our food industry.  This industry is in the business of increasing the value of output and sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill aims to unify and make more effective the services provided to the food sector by the different agencies.  In that <Col N="2012" /> context, the Bill represents a considerable step forward.  Given the challenges which face the food industry following CAP reforms, GATT and the need for our food production to compete successfully in the EU, we must now streamline the backup given by State agencies.</P>
    <P>We have something which many other countries seek &mdash; the green image, which is the envy of the world.  The green image is associated with Ireland and it is an invaluable asset in the promotion of Irish food.  We must build on this image in the future and I hope the board will make use of it.</P>
    <P>The food industry has undergone enormous changes in recent years.  I understand there are 40,000 to 50,000 people employed in the industry, but considering the number of subsidiary industries involved, employment in the food industry would be closer to 100,000.  There is great potential for job creation in this industry, which has undergone major changes in the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>Gone are the days of creameries in each parish, especially in the Munster area where I live, when farmers transported milk by horse and cart or by tractor and trailer.  At the creamery, farmers might have got a newspaper or engaged in a social conversation about the price of cattle at the fair or a hurling match. Gone are the days when farmers had three or four sows and would sell the progeny to other farmers or else fatten them themselves.  In those days it was a sideline industry to boost their main industry, which was dairying, so as to have an income to maintain a good standard of living.</P>
    <P>Over the years the dairy, pig and other industries have been rationalised. Instead of creameries in each parish, there are co-operatives and most are based in Munster &mdash; Golden Vale, which is adjacent to me, Kerry Co-Op, Dairy Gold and Waterford Foods, which the Minister is familiar with.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as small producers in the pig industry.  It is concentrated on big producers producing fatteners for the pig meat factories. <Col N="2013" /> Because of these developments, our food industry is in many respects starting from a position of strength.  Research on European markets indicates that our food is perceived as wholesome, of high quality and produced in a healthy environment. Because many consumers are preoccupied with health considerations, our food has the type of image which suits them.  The reality may be somewhat different, but that is how our food is perceived.  It is essential that we maintain that image.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent crackdown on the abuse of angel dust.  Having regard to its long term effects, it is regrettable that such abuse should take place.  It would be disastrous if European consumers perceived a problem in regard to Irish food produce.  I also welcome the action taken by the Department in respect of BSE which is a major concern for consumers. It could be said that it is folly to adopt a policy of depopulating entire herds having regard to the small number of cases.  However, that type of radical action is necessary to ensure there is no doubt in regard to our meat products. Such action may be expensive in the short term, but it is wise in the long term because it protects the image of our food products and, more importantly, it protects the consumer from risks associated with this disease.  The small number of cases is tailing off because of action taken by the Department and I congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>A heading in my local newspaper yesterday read: &ldquo;Pledge By Minister In Fight Against Mad Cow Disease&rdquo;. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, reiterated his commitment to finding Euro-wide solutions to mad cow disease at the Munster Agricultural Society summer show in Cork at the weekend.  Earlier this year the Minister gave assurances on the safety of Irish beef.  CBF launched a major marketing campaign to boost its image among German consumers.  I commend the Minister for doing a good job because the export of beef to Germany was under threat.  There are also problems in Britain <Col N="2014" /> and I heard on the news today that there may be problems in France.  The Minister's action ensures the protection of the image of Irish meat.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn always expresses his concern about consumers.  Consumers are important and their concerns are paramount.  There are two types of consumer in Ireland: the urban consumer and the rural consumer.  They are different. The urban consumer is more convenient to towns and large big supermarkets where goods can be bought cheaper than elsewhere.  We spoke earlier about door to door delivery in the context of the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill.  This is essential in rural areas and definitely costs the consumer more.  In the final analysis it is the consumer who call the shots because they decide on which product they will spend their money.</P>
    <P>Hygiene standards in retail outlets is another area of concern.  Everyone working in the food industry should have a knowledge of food hygiene.  I am not suggesting that they attend intensive courses but the basic principles should be understood by those who sell food.  From my limited experience I believe that hygiene standards in supermarkets and many of our retail outlets are high, although there might be room for improvement in some areas.  It would be a good investment if people were required to attend a short course on food hygiene.  Further education in this area is needed because some people working with food handle it in a manner that would not be recommended in text books.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous change in the eating habits of Irish people, particularly the young.  Ten to 15 years ago people would not have been aware of pizzas.  The number of Chinese, Italian and other type restaurants is growing. While bacon and cabbage is still very popular, people's eating habits have changed and there is a preference for variety.  If people eat bacon and cabbage at home, they might change to Chinese or Italian food when they eat out.  It is important that the food industry take <Col N="2015" /> cognisance of this and meet the changing demands.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the transfer of certain functions of An Bord Glas to the new agency.  As the Minister said:</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas itself will remain in place; only those of its functions that relate to export marketing of edible horticultural products are being transferred. The remit which An Bord Glas has in relation to the home market is much wider than that proposed for An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas did a good job promoting horticulture and home made products but it should be in a position to do more work especially in the area of potatoes and vegetables.  It is impossible to get home grown new potatoes in any shop or supermarket but that may be because of our climate.  Ensuring a better supply of home produced horticultural products would also create employment.</P>
    <P>There is concern about the environment and the agricultural sector is often criticised for causing pollution.  I welcome the £230 million package for an agricultural environment programme which will give farmers an opportunity to consult and co-operate with people who care about the environment.  Grants will be provided for conservation and the protection of the landscape, wild life habitats and endangered species of fauna and flora.  It is important to protect the environment while trying to improve our industry.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with membership of the board.  Ordinary members shall be appointed to the board, one of whom shall be an officer.  People will be anxious that specific interests, such as the consumer, be represented but I believe producers should have representation on the board.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Bill stems from recommendations made by the expert group who recommended that a new single food promotion and market development agency should be formed by amalgamating CBF and the corresponding units of similar agencies dealing <Col N="2016" /> with other sectors of the food industry.  I would like to put on record our appreciation to CBF for the excellent work.</P>
    <P>Their recent annual report states:</P>
    <P>Irish livestock and meat industry achieved an outstanding export performance in 1993.  Exports of cattle, beef, lamb, pig meat all grew and gained increased market shares in key overseas markets.  Overall livestock and meat exports grew by over 20 per cent in 1992 and reached £1.6 billion.</P>
    <P>That is to be commended.  We must recognise the great work CBF have done for the meat industry.  I welcome section 13 which provides for a subsidiary board for meat and livestock.  This board will carry out work previously done by CBF. Section 46 recognises the work done by the staff of CBF.  It provides that the initial staff of An Bord Bia will be comprised of the existing staff of CBF.</P>
    <P>This Bill is most welcome and very important.  The Minister recommended it to the House and I am happy to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, to the House.  I enthusiastically support the activities of An Bord Bia.  I want to go straight to the heart of the matter and make a plea that this new organisation will be market driven and not producer driven.  That is the crucial factor that will decide its success or failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can fall into a number of traps when considering the food industry and one of those is to look at what is there and ignore what might be there.  If we look at the food industry as it is we see that it is overwhelmingly concentrated at the commodity end of the spectrum.  The other end of that spectrum &mdash; value added &mdash; is at present only a small fraction of the overall food industry.  If we were happy about that state of affairs we would not need An Bord Bia.  We need such a board primarily because we have signally failed over the last 25 years to make any significant inroads to the value <Col N="2017" /> added end of the food business.  We have made some progress but it is as nothing compared to what it could be or should be.</P>
    <P>The value added end of the food business is crucial and critical to success in the future because it is the only part of the food industry that offers us the possibility of creating a significant number of jobs.  Many were surprised when the Expert Group on the Food Industry, of which I was a member, concluded in effect &mdash; against many expectations &mdash; that there was little or no job creation potential in the food sector and that the challenge was likely to be to hold onto jobs in the face of the inevitable rationalisations that were taking place and continue to take place in that sector. That may be true, but the value added element of that sector is the exception. In that sector we can create many new jobs if we take an aggressive and imaginative approach &mdash; the approach I hope An Bord Bia will take.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia must be concerned with the entire food industry and I hope the slightly ridiculous situation where An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is left out of this reorganisation will be swiftly corrected; I note Senator Dardis has tabled an amendment in that regard.  I know it is the intention to correct it but I would like to see it done sooner rather than later. While An Bord Bia's remit is with all the food industry, its priority should be to develop the value added sector; that should be reflected in this Bill but it is not.  There is nothing in the Bill about that.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive list of aims and objectives of An Bord Bia does not even mention the critical issue of new product development which is the core of the effective approach to solving the value added problem.  For this reason I have tabled an amendment to those aims on which I hope the Minister will look kindly on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In making value added food products its priority, I hope that one of the first things An Bord Bia will do is to ask why we have failed in this area in the past. Why has Ireland done so poorly in the <Col N="2018" /> value added food markets of the world? The answer will come as a surprise to nobody.  We have failed to penetrate the value added food sector and markets around the world because we have not approached the challenge from the perspective of the consumer.  In that regard I support Senator Rory Kiely when he spoke about the value of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Time and again we have continued to approach this problem from the perspective of the producer; not even that of the food producer but that of the agricultural producer.  We have looked on the food marketplace as somewhere to sell our products and not as somewhere we can make profits and create jobs by meeting customers' needs.  Food marketing must start with the consumer.</P>
    <P>About six or seven years ago I visited what was then called Leningrad &mdash; now St. Petersburg &mdash; and asked to see a supermarket.  Arrangements were made in the then communist system to take a group of us to see a supermarket.  We went into a very unimpressive supermarket and were introduced to the manager and spoke to him through an interpreter.  I asked him how many customers he had each week and he replied immediately 10,400.  I was impressed that he knew this and I wondered if he used the same technology as we did, although I realised that since he had old fashioned cash registers that it was unlikely.  I asked him how he knew the figure.  He replied that it was easy to know &mdash; it was the number of people in the town.</P>
    <P>As he said it I thought &ldquo;Surely they do not all shop here&rdquo;, but I realised that of course they did.  That was precisely what went wrong with that system &mdash; it was being governed centrally and not being driven by the consumer.  Eventually, that broke the system.  If we are not driven by the customer and what the consumer wants, we may find something that is right in the short term but not in the long term.  We have to make sure that we do not end up in the wrong situation with An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>The basis on which we must start is to find out what the customer needs and what are the customers' emergent or <Col N="2019" /> latent needs.  We must then seek to compete successfully in meeting some, if not all, of those needs.  That requires new product development.  It was interesting to hear Senator D'Arcy concentrate on the need for research and development. That requires innovation and a constant, non-wavering concentration on customer focus.</P>
    <P>The marketing of value added food products has little to do with agriculture. Agriculture will provide many of the raw materials for those products, but if agriculture ends up calling the shots in An Bord Bia we will continue to fail as we have in the past.  The purpose of the food industry is not to act as an outlet for agricultural products; its purpose, from a national point of view, is to create jobs and wealth by meeting customers' needs. That is why I wrote a minority report on the work of the expert group.  To put An Bord Bia under the tutelage of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is to condemn it to being producer rather than customer driven.  It is the Department's job to be producer driven &mdash; it is not expected to be any other way.</P>
    <P>I hope that the worst does not happen and that in our oversight of this new organisation we will be vigilant against the dangers of An Bord Bia ending up as a plaything of the farming interests.  With the structure this Bill gives it, An Bord Bia will have to work hard to become and to remain customer driven.  Its most critical first challenge is to succeed in doing that.  If it is not customer driven it will just have been an expensive waste of time.  Having said that, I am pleased that the Bill has already been amended to include references to knowledge of consumer requirements as a criterion for the selection of some board members.  That shows an awareness of the issue and I welcome it as a start.</P>
    <P>In watching the football in the last few days it reminded me of my teacher in Newbridge College who trained us in football.  On one occasion when giving us a training lesson he referred to the attacking team and the defending team. <Col N="2020" /> I asked him which was the attacking team and if it depended on where the ball was on the pitch.  He thought for a moment and replied that it was not; he said that the attacking team is the team in possession of the ball, even on its own back line.  The Department and the Irish food industry will have possession of the ball when this Bill, if correctly amended, becomes law.  With the legislation and An Bord Bia we will be in a much stronger position to create the jobs, the wealth and the success in the food industry of which we are capable.  I wish the Bill well.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to welcome An Bord Bia Bill.  As other Senators and the Minister have pointed out, the agri-food sector is one of the linchpins of the economy.  It is opportune that we discuss this Bill on a day when there are further indications that the Irish economy is in a strong state in the form of a £137 million budget surplus in the first six months of the year. We have one of the strongest economies in Europe, with a growth rate averaging 5 per cent and a large annual trade surplus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The trend is falling, unemployment and employment have been stimulated by a net growth of 56,000 jobs over the last six years.  They are mere statistics but they are clear indications of the Government's productive stewardship of the Irish economy and of its determination to produce jobs and <Col N="2021" /> growth.  Part and parcel of this process is the fostering of our vital natural resources.  As outlined, one of our greatest natural resources is agriculture.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil and this Government have always recognised the significance of the agri-food sector, both to rural Ireland and the Irish economy as a whole.  This commitment is evident in the fact that between 1987 and 1993, £323 million was invested in this sector alone.  In addition, the forthcoming programme for competitiveness and rural development will maximise the contribution of farming, food and forestry.  However, marketing promotion is a key element of any concerted drive to boost the agri-food sector and that is why An Bord Bia is so significant.</P>
      <P>The legislation is welcome because for too long boards of various forms have marketed different commodities.  We must realise that food and its overall context is very valuable to this country.  Agriculture is our greatest natural asset and it should be marketed by a single board. I congratulate the Ministers involved and the Department for bringing this about, a move which was recommended in several reports.</P>
      <P>The establishment of An Bord Bia marks a major step forward in the development of the agri-food sector.  In particular, I welcome that this new body will be allocated substantial funding.  This is an acknowledgement that agriculture and the agri-food sector are areas in which employment can be created and where growth is perceived.  This is borne out by the establishment of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Bia represents a major streamlining and restructuring of the State's input to the agri-food sector.  It involves the amalgamation of CBF, the food marketing and promotion functions of ABT and the export market development functions of An Bord Glas in so far as they relate to edible horticultural products. As a result of the review of the activities of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, it is not yet possible to conclude whether its market development and promotion functions will be transferred to the new board.  The Bill contains a provision which would <Col N="2022" /> allow this to happen.  This is an acknowledgement that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara plays a major part in marketing a substantial natural resource.  I welcome that provision.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of these bodies is most important.  Synergy is a fashionable word in business and management circles these days.  An Bord Bia will create synergy in growth and jobs by binding together and capitalising on previously disparate and diverse strands of agriculture and the food sector to create a real dynamic for growth and enterprise.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture is operating in an increasingly competitive market.  This is evident throughout the EU at present where prices are being generated in the main by consumer demand.  This matter was discussed earlier.  We will not win these markets easily and we must aggressively promote our products.  We must focus on marketing, use creative and dynamic promotion and take an innovative approach in seeking out new markets. These traits must be at the heart of the new body.  When the board is established, I hope adequate funding will be provided so that measures can be immediately implemented.  While surpluses have been created in the EU, there are still food deficits in the global sphere. Marketing and the creation of new export opportunities are vitally important.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the importance of the agri-food sector to the rural economy. However, the growth of the sector is intrinsically linked to the ongoing wellbeing of rural Ireland.  Schemes and support programmes are important but they only go part of the way.  A strong future for rural Ireland will stem from indigenous rural enterprise, creating indigenous rural jobs.  The agri-food sector can provide these jobs if it develops accordingly. An Bord Bia has a responsibility to create a market which is sustained by profitable and enterprising jobs.</P>
    <P>I hope the work of An Bord Bia will develop along the lines of a new Leader programme.  The present Leader programme is expected to create over 2,200 jobs when completed and the forthcoming programme will offer greater job <Col N="2023" /> potential to rural Ireland.  In essence, both An Bord Bia and the Leader programme have job creation at their cores. I am confident they will be successful if, as the Minister outlined, everything is taken into account, funding is made available and the board is speedily established.</P>
    <P>On an Adjournment debate some months ago I asked the Minister of State to convey my views to the senior Minister and the Cabinet for seeking An Bord Bia to be located in Cork.  I did not suggest this for political purposes but rather from a deep belief that An Bord Bia, as a marketing body for food, should be located in an area where food is produced. Unfortunately, there are not many food production units in Kildare Street.</P>

      <P>An Bord Bia should be established in Cork, which has the Moorepark research facility and a food section in University College Cork.  I hope the Minister of State will convey these points to the Department, the Minister and the Cabinet.  Everybody requires food but if it is not properly marketed, it can be difficult to sell.  I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider Cork as the location for An Bord Bia, not for its job potential but because it can market and sell food naturally produced.  The fact that consumers want food produced by the Irish is an issue which has been discussed many times in this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2024" /> I ask the Minister of State to take cognisance of my plea to locate An Bord Bia in Cork.  Kinsale is the gourmet capital of Ireland, if not the world.  The recognised chef, Keith Floyd is based in Cork, which also has the Moorepark research facility, UCC and a large agricultural hinterland. These are of prime importance in the marketing of products abroad.  The Minister of State should take note of all I have said in relation to An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill a speedy passage through this House.  It is imperative that all the measures outlined by the Minister of State are implemented without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <P>I agree with Senator Kelleher on one matter &mdash; the value of the Leader programme and what it has done and has the potential to do for rural Ireland.  Unfortunately, I see no relationship between the success of the Leader programme and what is proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the board's headquarters should be in Cork and that Moorepark is of value in that respect. Under this Bill agricultural research is specifically excluded from having any input into the composition of the board and its operations.  The most favourable location one could choose for the board is one which is most adjacent to an airport because the board's work is about getting out of this country and selling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kelleher was not listening to me.  I did not exclude Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I favour a single agency for all food products.  However, that is not being established in this Bill.  This Bill gives us a single marketing and promotional body.  The Minister said that An Bord Bia Bill, 1994, focuses on one element only of the institutional framework &mdash; promotion and market development.  It does, but it does not do so for the entire food industry.  We have excluded several commodities.  This is a commodity board for the export of some food.  It is a comnationa <Col N="2025" /> modity board and not a food board.  It focuses on commodities and on nothing else.</P>
    <P>We have created another bureaucratic colossus.  Will it achieve its objective?  I doubt it.  We must focus on our objective. We are talking about a market of 350 million people in Europe.  We are talking about an island whose main economic activity is the production of food.  If this island were to regard itself as Ireland plc and were to set out to achieve an extra 1 per cent penetration in this market of 350 million people, it would believe it possible to achieve that target.  If we could do that there would be incalculable national benefits, far more than will result from the economic growth to which Senator Kelleher referred.  That is the prize before us.  Do we have the political will and the legislative armoury to achieve that?  In this legislation we do not.  We are merely shifting the furniture, no more than that.  We are not taking the fundamental radical decisions we have been asked to take to promote this industry.</P>
    <P>To his credit the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, did not chant the mantra of Culliton, a mantra which has been chanted during every debate in this House on agriculture, economic activity and even on the postal service.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications told us, when we discussed the increase in telephone charges, that all the recommendations of the Culliton report would be adopted.  Everybody speaks about the Culliton report and everybody is in favour of implementing it.  However, on reading the Culliton report one will discover that it is not being implemented at all.  The Minister of State did not mention Culliton although the Minister did when he spoke on this Bill in the Dáil.  What does Culliton say?  We should look at what he said instead of what he is supposed to have said.  He says:</P>
    <P>The problem has been that cohesive action programmes have not followed the recommendations.  The reasons for these have been two-fold.  ... [He <Col N="2026" /> cites one relating to the difference of interests between producers, consumers and processors.] ... the fragmentation of the State policy formulation and support system for the food industry which involves: 4 Cabinet Ministers, 5 Ministers of State, 4 Government Departments and 10 State sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Have we done anything to address that problem in this legislation?  We have not. We will leave the fish sector under the control of the Minister for fish and ships. We will leave An Bord Tráchtála under the control of the Minister for Tourism and Trade and we will leave everything else with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  That does not address the problem.</P>
    <P>Culliton also says:</P>
    <P>Given the size of the product development challenge facing the Irish food sector the focus of existing State R&amp;D supports is not adequate.  ... There is a need as indicated earlier to co-ordinate and integrate State aided agency support for overseas food marketing and to relocate State assistance to the genuine development of marketing skills within companies.</P>
    <P>Where is there anything about marketing skills in this legislation?  Where is there anything about research and development? The food section of Teagasc should be part of this establishment. People are going in different directions. The core of this issue is product development and it is not even addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill talks about journals. We will provide for the publication and distribution of magazines, journals, reports and similar documents for the purpose of encouraging the increased consumption of food.  Glory alleluia, we will produce books.  That will not sell food.  We must have the right product in the first place and without basic research how can we have the right product?  We are doing to the food sector what we did to industry when we introduced more bureaucracy with the establishment of <Col N="2027" /> Foras, Forbairt and IDA Ireland.  This is layer upon layer of bureaucracy and I put the blame where it belongs &mdash; with the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Culliton talked about seasonality. Where is that problem addressed in this or in other legislation?  Import substitution is discussed in the Culliton report.  Where does this Bill address that problem?  Culliton discussed the question of the environment and suggested that we should be proactive and not just reactive to European developments.  Is there anything in this legislation relevant to those issues?</P>
    <P>Let us get rid of the myth that the Culliton report is being implemented. The most basic aspect of the Culliton report is not being implemented.  It recommended fundamental tax reform and we all know what happened in that respect in last year's budget.  We did not have anything approaching fundamental tax reform.</P>
    <P>What do we have in this legislation? We have a commodity based approach. In an era when the industry is moving away from a commodity based approach, when intervention is disappearing and when the consumer decides, we are sticking with a commodity based approach. We do not even have a full commodity based approach.  Nobody has mentioned Bord Bainne.  It goes its separate way; it is not part of this scene.  What about the expertise that has been developed in that organisation over the years and the success it has achieved?  We will not even incorporate it in this legislation.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas is fractured into two separate elements.  We debated the legislation establishing An Bord Glas at length in this House and what happens? One area of Irish horticulture in which there is likely to be significant success is the export of nursery stock.  Now we will separate the food section &mdash; and I accept that we must do so if we adopt this particular approach &mdash; and leave An Bord Glas with the nursery stock.  I can only imagine the funding An Bord Glas will be given when it is left in that state.  As an aside, one can question the relevance <Col N="2028" /> of our debate about representation on An Bord Glas.  Will we leave the food producer representatives on the board in place, although the board will now deal only with nursery stock and non-food items?  I do not know where we are going with this Bill.</P>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is left afloat somewhere in mid-Atlantic.  We must formalise our position with regard to the fish sector.  Fish is a food and it should be treated as a food.  If we are to have one food board it should be a board for the entire food sector.  We also have the food unit in An Bord Tráchtála.  Research and development, which is the foundation for growth in this industry, has been completely left out.  How will we move from the intervention market to branded products if we do not have the necessary research and development?  That research and development must be related to the work of this board.</P>
    <P>The main defect in this legislation is that it ignores the consumer.  A minimalist gesture was made in the Dáil to give consumer representation on the board.  Section 14 (5) reads:</P>
    <P>The chairman and the persons appointed to be ordinary members shall be persons having knowledge or experience of the food industry and of consumer requirements.</P>
    <P>When the board is established someone from a meat factory or a processing plant will be regarded as having knowledge or experience of consumer requirements. The person will have such knowledge and experience but he will not be a consumer.</P>
    <P>I read an interesting article in a magazine to which Senator Quinn contributed to the effect that on a regular basis, consumers are brought to the Superquinn boardroom and asked what they think of the service they are given and the products they buy.  We too must allow the consumer to decide.  We are deceiving ourselves if we think European consumers will behave on the basis of intervention or of how matters were run in the past.  We must compete in the market and sell our quality goods produced in an environmentally friendly fashion.  We can <Col N="2029" /> stand over our products I agree with Senator Kelleher that we must be aggressive, but this legislation is not aggressive and does not give us the armoury to be aggressive in those markets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the minimal improvement in bowing to consumer requirements but the consumer should be represented on the board.  If that means another person giving way, so be it, because otherwise we deceive ourselves.</P>
    <P>On 10 May in the Dáil, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, spoke about a subsidiary board for prepared consumer food products. He said this would be among the first matters on which he expected An Bord Bia to take action when set up.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea said something similar today.  Will we be able to do that under EU law?  Will the subsidiary board be allowed to work for branded products?  Perhaps the Minister can outline whether that can happen and how it will happen.  How will we make the jump from our approach in the recent past to producing branded products and getting them into the market?  The Culliton report pointed the way in suggesting links with international companies.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the representatives from the food interests in the horticulture sector of An Bord Glas?  Will they remain in place although An Bord Glas will have no function in the food area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but a large number of daffodils, although not tulips, are exported to markets as far away as America. My objective is that the entire horticulture industry should prosper.  What has been done to An Bord Glas will prevent that prosperity.  I accept the difficulty about covering the non-food elements of that industry in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fish should be within the scope of the Bill, as should the food research arm of Teagasc.  Further, what will we do about ostriches?  There is a great deal of interest in ostrich production in farming circles.  I <Col N="2030" /> do not know whether ostriches constitute poultry or meat but section 2, the definition section, should include ostriches. They are extremely efficient converters of food into meat, far better than pigs or other forms of livestock and should be considered by research workers.</P>
    <P>I welcome several provisions of the Bill including section 8 which deals with quality assurance, which is at the foundation of what we are trying to achieve as a food exporting country.  We must be able to ensure its quality and these schemes should be of assistance to us.</P>
    <P>CBF is to be dissolved and then reestablished almost as before, with extra work in livestock promotion.  Why was it not left as it was, since An Bord Bainne was left alone?  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>This does not mean any of CBF's current functions will be abandoned or lost sight of.  On the contrary, it is intended that these functions will be strengthened.</P>
    <P>How will CBF's functions be strengthened under this legislation?  It is not apparent from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy dealt with the levy. The other factor is the Structural Funds débâcle.  There we had an opportunity to assist the research and development I advocate for the industry.  That does not seem to have been done effectively.  The Structural Funds saga has seen a succession of missed opportunities, but in that respect we could have done something dramatic and radical.</P>
    <P>I have worries about the colour of the stamps &mdash; a deep yellow, yellow, a fascinating colour called cyan which is I believe a mid-blue, etc.  Are these precise technical definitions?</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister made considerable play of the fact that the title of this body was in English as well as Irish; as well as an Bord Bia, it is called the Irish Food Board.  Senator Quinn wants to change that and I agree with him.  It was said it would be helpful on international markets to have a name in English. It would be even better, and would indicate a positive attitude towards marketing, if we had French, German and <Col N="2031" /> Japanese versions and as many others as we need.  The French would probably not be too impressed by the Irish Food Board.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not achieve its objective. The philosophy behind it is defective. The same defect was evident in FORFÁS, Forbairt and the IDA and now the same bureaucratic syndrome is developing in the food industry.  It makes me apprehensive for the future of our food exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Brian O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who spoke on Second Stage.  Certain threads ran through all the contributions and by and large the objectives of An Bord Bia are agreed.  There were questions about how the board may or may not implement these desirable objectives.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked how we envisaged strengthening the functions of CBF in the context of An Bord Bia.  That is to anticipate the synergies which will occur with other food sectors as part of the new board.  This is a rationalisation process; it also brings together the various skills in the food unit of ABT, CBF and An Bord Glas.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis was concerned about ostriches.  At a recent function in Kilkenny in connection with a Leader project, I had an interesting conversation with a person from Scotland who is involved in breeding them and, from what I was told, there seems to be scope in this area.  Although ostriches are not included in the definition of poultry, I am sure it would not be a problem to add them by way of ministerial regulation later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator also mentioned the legal problems in relation to subsidiary boards for prepared consumer foods in terms of European law.  An Bord Bia is a promotion and market development agency; it cannot sell products. <Col N="2032" /> Sales are the responsibility of the individual companies.  This board is concerned with the development of markets. I announced last week that Forbairt had set up a group on prepared consumer foods.  This group is weighted in the direction of industry and it is a valuable touchstone for Forbairt in terms of the development of its internal policies.  It now has a group to advise it on where resources should be focused at various times.  That high powered group is in place in Forbairt.  An Bord Tráchtála is assisting in the marketing of branded products.  I do not envisage the difficulty in European law to which the Senator referred.</P>
      <P>The functions of An Bord Glas go beyond promotion and market development because it also has a production role.  This Bill will transfer its export functions in the edible horticultural produce area to An Bord Bia.  The entire home market will still be the area of activity for An Bord Glas.  The Senator will be aware that, in terms of structuring the industry, there is a vital role to be played in improving standards in the horticultural sector. An Bord Glas has been successful in this role.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators mentioned research and development.  In my view, research and development is the engine room of our progress.  If, at the end of this tranche of Structural Funds, our scientific research and development community, whether in the research units and universities or in-house units in our companies, has not reached a standard which is acceptable at international level, then we will have failed.  There are two areas where research and development is being catered for under the operational sub-programme for the food industry.  First, there is research and development for the public good, the type of research and development which will be available to the industry, and its diffusion will be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced the formation of a committee which is weighted in the direction of industry as opposed to academia because criticism has been made that too much emphasis has been placed <Col N="2033" /> on the academic area.  This year £7 million is available and the committee we have put in place is considering its mandate. Questions, such as where does an agricultural product end and a food product begin must be addressed.  The committee will invite submissions from the research units, such as Teagasc, and the universities and it will adjudicate on what projects should be funded.  Central to this is that we achieve critical mass.  It is not enough to spread the money around on a number of small projects.  We need something substantial which will be of real benefit to industry.  I would also envisage contracting out in the sense that this could be done through a regional college or the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that no provision is being made for research and development. Research and development will be available for the public good.  Funds will also be available through Forbairt for research and development by private companies, whether in-house or commissioned research.  This is an important area of the sub-programme.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Senators that our fundamental objective must be to rapidly extend our portfolio of value added products.  These must be quality products at a price which the European consumer is prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>I take the point Senator Quinn made in relation to where An Bord Bia should be located and the conflict he sees between the interests of the producer and the industry.  There is integration in the food industry which does not exist in other areas.  Under CAP reform, we operate in a system where production is limited.  We must increase the wealth we create from that limited production. Research and development on product portfolio is important.  With intervention now receding as a market outlet, we must go this road if we are to dispose of our products.  Senator Quinn said we were market-led and that is true.  Unless we respond to what is required by a more demanding consumer, in terms of our range of products, we will not be able to <Col N="2034" /> sell our produce.  Market forces push us in that direction.</P>
    <P>Although it is not at the most sophisticated level of research and development or of value added products, last year the Irish meat industry made a significant move away from intervention into the commercial markets.  Our exports were worth approximately £400 million.  This was achieved in the multiple sector in Europe and our objective was to look for a premium market.  CBF did that on behalf of the Irish economy and succeeded in developing it.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis said An Bord Bia was only a commodity board.  That is not the case and I dealt with this matter.  The issue I dealt with most in relation to An Bord Bia was the location of its headquarters. I reiterate that it is our intention to appoint people to the board who can rapidly market the products we must develop.  An Bord Bia should have a say in where its headquarters is located.  If we appoint people who know the business and will do the job for us, the location of their headquarters is of strategic importance.  This matter will be referred to the new board.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bainne was mentioned.  Our difficulty here is that An Bord Bainne is a private company.  The State can amalgamate State agencies where there is agreement but Bord Bainne is beyond that.  It would be wrong to take the view that there has not been co-operation in the past between the food unit in An Bord Tráchtála and An Bord Bainne.  I would see that type of linkage developing in the future.  The whole range of products comes within the remit of An Bord Bia, which will have a presence in all our major markets.  As we envisage the board, it will encompass those private interests which at present we cannot make a statutory part of what we are doing.</P>
    <P>It needs to be emphasised that this board is not about selling.  That is a matter for the private sector.  For instance we made significant headway in the Italian market last year.  There is now a full <Col N="2035" /> time presence of four Irish meat companies in that market.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the expert group in relation to education were also mentioned.  I have already discussed these recommendations with the Minister for Education and we have made a submission to the Department of Education in that regard.  We can lose sight of the fact that there are 54 recommendations in the expert group report and that these recommendations are being put in place. An Bord Bia is a very large part of the strategy and the sub programme based on the Structural Funds deals with the other areas.  That needs to be emphasised again.</P>
    <P>The expert group recommended that the food functions of Bord lascaigh Mhara become part of An Bord Bia.  As I mentioned in my opening address, a major review of all the functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is going on.  That will not be completed until the end of the year but the legislation provides that with the agreement of the Minister for the Marine those functions can come in by agreement at a later stage.  I am disappointed that such functions are not included now but as the situation stands it is not possible to move down that road.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis and Senator D'Arcy made points in relation to seasonality. The slaughter premium has been of assistance in achieving 20 per cent of the kill in the first three quarters of the year. The seasonality of milk becomes of pivotal importance when we talk about the softer cheeses which have a much shorter shelf life than cheddar, our main cheese product.  The availability of high quality milk throughout the whole year is of great importance.  That issue is best left in the private sector and it is an area that Waterford Foods plc, the major plc in my area, has addressed in the context of its product development.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy complained that the Bill does not give effect to the expert group report.  I have dealt with that in some detail in my reply.  There are two major areas of recommendation.  One is the setting up of An Bord Bia.  The other <Col N="2036" /> is the operational programme and that is very well in hand in terms of the Structural Funds.  There are 54 recommendations and it takes time to put them all in place.  That is the mandate of the office of the Minister for Food and we are moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy also claimed there would be no control of An Bord Bia charges.  Section 12 (2) provides that the amounts of charges shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their positive acceptance of the need for a single body for the whole area of market development of Irish food products.  We have our disagreements, with Senator Quinn in relation to where it is to be located and with other Senators as to its functions, but we all have the same objective.  We are doing our best to achieve very important objectives.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

It should not be stuffy and, more importantly, it should not be internally focused. The Irish Food Board is not a good name in marketing terms.  That should be the only consideration.  The name should be <Col N="2038" /> a good one in marketing terms.  The word &ldquo;board&rdquo; is the problem.</P>
    <P>It is pure Civil Service speak.  It seems to love this word which appears at the end of the titles of many organisations and does not serve any purpose except the cost of putting an extra five letters at the end of a nameplate.  When An Post was set up in 1979, we were lumbered with the name &ldquo;An Bord Poist&rdquo;.  Nobody could get it right because in Irish, &ldquo;Oifig an Phoist&rdquo;, the genitive case, had a &ldquo;h&rdquo; in it but &ldquo;An Bord Poist&rdquo;, did not.  It caused chaos and we refused to accept it because we knew such a clumsy and bureaucratic name would hinder our marketing efforts.  That is how the name An Post came about.  A tourist walking down the street looking for a post office could easily pick out these words.  There is a similar need here.  Instead of &ldquo;The Irish Food Board&rdquo;, why not call it &ldquo;Food Ireland&rdquo; which focuses on the product being marketed, which is one step on the long road to being customer driven?  This name is already in existence; it has been used for several years in promoting our food abroad.  If one lumbers the organisation with the title &ldquo;The Irish Food Board&rdquo;, it will still have to use &ldquo;Food Ireland&rdquo; as a kind of brand name.  We will end up with two names when one would have done.</P>
    <P>I was in Los Angeles last year and saw an advertisement for the Industrial Development Authority the purpose of which is to bring industrial development to Ireland.  The only word that really mattered in Los Angeles was &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;. However, the organisation called itself the Industrial Development Authority although it later ran another slogan under the advertisement mentioning the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We should just call the organisation &ldquo;Food Ireland&rdquo; and be done with it.  It makes a great deal of sense and is logical. It certainly does not make sense to have the words &ldquo;company&rdquo; or &ldquo;board&rdquo; branded as a title of an organisation like this.</P>

      <P>I see much merit in the thrust of Senator Quinn's argument.  A catchy slogan is immediately associated <Col N="2039" /> with its product, it is a valuable marketing asset.  I have had a short time to consider this proposal.  The term may be too general in describing the board, but to be constructive, I will refer Senator Quinn's thoughts on the matter to the new board. There is nothing to stop it from using this type of slogan or theme or variations of it for promotions.  I will refer the thrust of the Senator's argument to the new board for examination.  It will come back with a suitable recommendation in the context of its multiannual strategic plan, which will be the first task assigned to it and will cover a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's sympathetic approach to the matter, but I am not only referring to marketing.  The essence of this organisation is to market and promote.  We should not lumber it with a name similar to the one we gave to the Industrial Development Authority.  It makes sense to have this title, not only as a promotional tool, but to ensure it can be identified and readily understood. I urge the Minister to do more than refer the title to the board, but to make the change himself.  It is the sensible thing to do.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Quinn on this matter.  I have visions of somebody attending a trade show &mdash; the Green Week in Germany, for example &mdash; wandering about the stands and deciding where to stop.  Obviously, the visual impact will be the first element to catch their attention.  If I passed a stand titled &ldquo;The Irish Food Board&rdquo;, I would be inclined to pass it by unless something significant caught my eye.  We have to consider modern marketing and the elements involved in it.  In that context, I would support Senator Quinn's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the Minister is trying to facilitate us and that he will go to the board and make a recommendation to it. However, I would put it in stronger terms.  As Senator Quinn said, the title &ldquo;The Irish Food Board&rdquo; reminds one of a hospital board.  Admittedly, it is better <Col N="2040" /> than &ldquo;The Meat and Livestock Commission&rdquo;, which is the name of the British equivalent.  Nevertheless, I would get rid of the word &ldquo;board&rdquo;.  The only way to do that effectively is to have words like &ldquo;Food Ireland&rdquo;, as suggested by Senator Quinn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">

      <P>I also agree with previous speakers on Senator Quinn's amendment. It is a reasonable request.  The Minister stated he is prepared to recommend this to the board.  However, it would be better if he could accept the terminology.  &ldquo;Food Ireland&rdquo; is an attractive title and would attract the attention of people walking by stands at food fairs in different cities.  The Minister should do more than recommend it to the board to consider it as a slogan.  It is worth more than that; it is a good name and I fully support it.</P>

      <P>In this amendment, I am being asked to change the English translation of the name of the board.  First, the Irish version takes precedence and &ldquo;The Irish Food Board&rdquo; is the English translation of that.  I am trying to be helpful but there are constraints on me in terms of what I can accede to.</P>
      <P>I take the importance of having finely tuned market slogans.  I also see merit in the thrust of Senator Quinn's amendment. I do not want to make hard and fast recommendations to the board.  It is the general thrust I will be recommending. &ldquo;Food Ireland&rdquo; is the slogan put forward by Senator Quinn and the board could come up with a similar slogan or a variation of it.  The thrust of a good, modern and impacting slogan is vitally important.  In a constructive spirit, I will convey those views to the interim board as part of the area I wish it to consider in its multiannual plan.</P>

      <P>Section 7 states: &ldquo;The functions of the board shall be to promote, assist and develop in any manner which the Board considers necessary or desirable in the marketing of Irish food and livestock.&rdquo;  I have a query on this section.  Currently many boards including An Bord Bainne, operate on an individual basis across the country.  Milk products are currently becoming increasingly attractive and there is huge competition from the French in that area in the British market.  What type of promotion assistance, financial or otherwise, could An Bord Bainne expect from the board in respect of promotions in a foreign market?  Will the approach come from An Bord Bainne rather than An Bord Bia?  How will the promotion side of it operate?</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned development. What is meant by &ldquo;development&rdquo; in the section?  Does it mean that financial assistance will be given to research and development in respect of a certain product for advertising or promoting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will specifically refer to An Bord Bainne, a private organisation which has in the past used the good offices of the food unit of An Bord Tráchtála for promotion purposes.  It is open to An Bord Bia to avail of the services of An Bord Bainne for a range of activities and it will be encouraged to do so.</P>
      <P>Market intelligence for An Bord Bia is very important.  In this respect not alone must there be use of the intelligence which measures the present market, but trends and demands should be anticipated. This market intelligence should be conveyed to the sectors of the industry which would benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of markets requires a knowledge of consumer demand, ensuring that products are produced to the standard and price which the consumer will buy and assisting the private sector to sell to such markets.  In this respect, An Bord Bia will not be selling but it will facilitate in every way our food companies to capture more market share and identify the direction which product <Col N="2042" /> development should take in the context of developing markets, creating wealth and, consequently, creating the jobs that, as Senator Quinn indicated, can be created in the value-added area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Bainne is well equipped for research and development work and also in respect of knowledge of foreign markets.  What role does An Bord Bia have to play in respect of this area? The Minister indicated that An Bord Bia will undertake research and development, but An Bord Bainne is already involved in this on a wide scale.  It has its own promotion unit, together with a research unit working on the requirements of specific markets.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bainne can teach An Bord Bia a few things regarding research and development and marketing.  In view of the Minister's remarks there may be duplication in the work undertaken by the two boards which should be avoided. All available resources should be fully utilised to the benefit of everybody, rather than allowing a duplication of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The elimination of unnecessary duplication is vital in terms of obtaining the best possible value from the resources of An Bord Bia, whether such resources derive from the EU, levies or tax payers.  The board cannot be established immediately because various legalities require to be undertaken.  An interim board has been established in the meantime, and it is our intention that the very best people, in terms of their knowledge of marketing, be appointed to the board.  We will be asking them to develop strategies to examine the situation. We will also provide broad policy directives, and policy directives may be given from time to time.  In this respect, the legislation seeks to provide the optimum framework in which the board can operate and to give the board the resources and support it requires to proceed with its task.  In addition, duplication <Col N="2043" /> from all areas of marketing of the food business will be eliminated.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) encourage and assist the development of new food products, particularly products with high added-value&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is necessary because it goes to the heart of the issue as to whether An Bord Bia is to be market driven or not.  In the list of specific objectives of the board, which are many and varied, there is no mention of developing new food products.  This is a serious omission because all of the other objectives of the board, and of the Bill, assumes that what is to be marketed by the board exists.  It is almost like saying, &ldquo;we have the food, just go out there and flog it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A key part of what needs to be done is to develop new products to meet consumer's changing needs, especially the high value-added products which the Minister and myself spoke of earlier in this debate and where, as I remarked on Second Stage, the sole job creation potential lies.  The omission of new product development from the objectives of the board is a dramatic example of the product driven agriculture mentality, rather than the mentality that is driven by the wish to develop the food industry by identifying and satisfying customer's needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 15 years ago, McDonald's opened their first restaurant in Dublin and there was an outcry when it transpired that the company was using imported potato chips from Holland or elsewhere.  The company responded that it was importing the chips because they <Col N="2044" /> provided the taste their customer's required.  Those of us in the business considered the company to be insensitive, but that company was so market driven that it required this product.  In response we, the Irish agricultural industry changed by developing and adopting to the type of potato the company requires.  In consequence, it is now selling Irish chips.  This did not happen at first because the company made clear that it had to provide what its customer's required.</P>
    <P>The area of development and developing products to suit the customer's needs must be driven by the market, but this has been omitted from the Bill.  While it can be argued that An Bord Bia will have the power to encourage, and to assist new product development under the general empowering clause, this power is not the point I am making.</P>
    <P>Section 8 marks the cards of An Bord Bia as to what the priorities of the board will be.  If new product development is omitted from the section a totally wrong signal will be sent to the board and to the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment as it is very important that new product development be encouraged in every way.  There is an important role for the new board in this area.  An official of a French company advised me that it could cost up to £100 million to advertise, through the press and television, a new product and try to place it on the market which indicates the huge expense involved in this kind of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If market share is to be obtained, especially in respect of the European market, new products must be targeted, and these are numerous at present.  In this respect the amendment proposes to &ldquo;encourage and assist the development of new food products, particularly products with high added-value&rdquo;.  This is a reasonable proposal, although the last clause could be deleted.  However, the <Col N="2045" /> first clause is most important and is fundamental to the food industry.</P>
    <P>I hope the green image of the country prevails and in this context new products must be introduced on the market.  To date the industry has been slow to penetrate these markets, which is very difficult to do, especially in Europe, which are our most important markets.  The board can assist greatly in breaking into these markets.  The Minister should be encouraged to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the thrust of the Senators' arguments. As I said earlier, there are two major recommendations for encouraging and assisting the development of new products, the promotional and market development board and the operational programme for the food industry.  The development of new products would, in the first instance, be in the remit of Forbairt, working in conjunction with companies. The integration comes with the office of the Minister for Food and the operational programme.  Forbairt's representative and high-powered group on prepared consumer foods is now in action.  One of the first committees to be set up, after the meat and livestock sub-board, will be the sub-board for prepared consumer foods which will advise An Bord Bia.  There is provision under the legislation for further sub-committees to be set up and, though it may not be readily visible from the legalistic terms of the legislation, this area is catered for. That is the thrust of the expert group's report and the type of development that the office of the Minister for Food will be promoting.  The thrust of this amendment is something with which we all agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To facilitate Senators, I will raise their points on the value added area with Forbairt and Teagasc.  The elements of what Senators are seeking are contained in the operational programme on the food industry and the links with the various agencies involved.  An Bord Bia will achieve the focus that the amendment <Col N="2046" /> seeks.  The generalised functions are included in section 7 of the Bill while they are laid out in more detail in section 8.  However, section 8 does not exclude anything that comes within the generality of section 7.  I know this is legalistic language but I assure Senators that the development of the wider portfolio of value added products is paramount.  It is the engine room of the progress we will make in the food industry.  However, including this amendment will not change the scenario or the emphasis in any way. As Minister for Food I am committed to developing this area.  It is no use endeavouring to sell in the market if you do not have a range of products to command the required market share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am even more pessimistic now than I was on Second Stage about where this bureaucracy is leading.  The Minister made a point about Forbairt's functions in the development of food products.  Forbairt is not answerable to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, but to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Section 14 of the Bill mentions the composition of the board and is a victory for the Minister for Tourism and Trade in that he will appoint a nominee, while the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will not.  We are again getting into compartmentalisation and Culliton's criticism of the fact that no less than four Ministers and five Ministers of State are responsible.  The issue is spreading in all directions and is not being focused to maximise the market penetration we need as a food exporting country, the substance of this amendment. Before the Minister spoke, I was prepared to accept that perhaps under the generality of section 7 we might be able to overcome this problem but it is getting worse.  Teagasc is answerable to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and Forbairt to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  We are getting into a quagmire and losing sight of a basic element for the success of the <Col N="2047" /> enterprise, which is the development of new food products.  The amendment is reasonable and should be incorporated in the Bill.  Unless we develop new food products we will come to a halt.  The vista of an attractive market in which we can compete is fading rapidly because of this type of set-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more concerned now than I was earlier.  Senator Dardis put his finger on it, and it seems to me too that bureaucracy is going wild.  Even if we create an organisation called the Irish Food Board &mdash; or Food Ireland as I want it to be called &mdash; whose job would be to sell what already exists, it will still be the job of somebody else to encourage the development of new products and will only be a small part of their overall remit. That is why Culliton recommended an expert food group to consider the food industry and why the expert group said the development of food is so important. Food has always been the lost cousin of the pharmaceutical and computer sectors but now, suddenly, the development of new food products will be left to Forbairt and An Bord Bia's job will be only to sell what is produced elsewhere.  The Minister must think this problem through more deeply.  The development of new food products has to be part of An Bord Bia's remit.  If not, we will end up believing that marketing is only about selling whereas it is about listening to customers' complaints.  That is what spurs people on the development side of the business to improve the situation.  However, if the person whose job that is does not even report to the same Minister, we have very little chance of getting this off the ground. An Bord Bia's role must include the discovery and development of new products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Forbairt reports to the Minister for Food in food matters.  That has been the practice and will continue. There will be a representative of the <Col N="2048" /> Minister for Enterprise and Employment on the board and while that provision is not included in the legislation it will be done by way of agreement.  We need to further clarify the role of An Bord Bia as envisaged in the legislation.  The development of value added products, and products in general, is an expensive business where one can be lucky or unlucky.  It is the private sector which sells to the multiples.  We are endeavouring at the moment to sell to the independent chains, which account for an extensive part of the market in Europe.  The market intelligence role of An Bord Bia will enable the scope for value added products to be identified and fed back to industry.  When industry requires funding for product development <i>per se,</i> it will not go to An Bord Bia but to Forbairt, the agency which will provide funding for the research and development of products.</P>
      <P>In the general sense, An Bord Bia will promote Irish products.  It will engage in generic type marketing, stressing our clean, green, pollution free environment. Issues such as animal welfare, how animals are reared and the green agenda are of growing concern to consumers.  An Bord Bia will have a large role in relation to these concerns.  At the end of the day the board will be a facilitator in the sense that it will bring companies that produce products into contact in the most beneficial way with those who will buy their products, identify what the product range should be and relay this intelligence to industry and to Forbairt so that the allocation of resources follows the pattern that emerges from this type of market development.  It is a complete overplay to suggest in any way that the value added agenda and the research and development which leads to the widening of our product portfolio in terms of value added products as against commodities is not the whole thrust of the expert group report.  This is exactly what the thrust of the report is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> It can be stated that there appears to be layers of bureaucracy.  However, when one is setting up a board such as this, there are all sorts of legal questions which must be addressed right down to the rights of those who are at present employees of CBF and ABT and the issue of superannuation.  Section 7 gives the bottom line mandate to An Bord Bia. This board is part of the overall blueprint developed by the expert group on the food industry.  I do not have the time to talk in great detail about what we have been doing but those various elements are being put in place in a way which will as far as possible remove any bureaucratic restrictions, allow those charged with doing the work to do so in as unconstrained a way as possible and enable the various agencies to dovetail in with the private sector.  At the end of the day it is the private sector which will produce the products and which is the last point of sale.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia will have the role of developing markets and generally promoting Irish products.  It is not a question of intruding on the mandate of existing agencies such as Forbairt.  The office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food will assist in dovetailing between the agencies and through the agencies to industry.  I suggest to Senator Quinn that what he is seeking to achieve in his amendment is well catered for, not alone in the legalistic terminology of the Bill itself but in Government policy and the report of the expert group, which has been accepted as Government policy and has become part of the National Plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the functions of the board will be to survey, investigate and develop markets and potential markets for food.  The functions do not include encouraging and assisting the development of new food products, which I would like to be included.  I cannot believe that we can ask the board to survey, investigate and develop markets and not ask them to encourage and assist <Col N="2050" /> the development of new food products.  I have huge difficulty with what we are asking An Bord Bia to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take the Minister's point that the State is involved through not one but several agencies in some of these activities, it is appropriate that the State be included in section 8, as proposed by Senator Quinn.  I accept that it is expensive to develop products and I can even accept that there is a responsibility on private industry to do so, but the State is already involved and has a responsibility to bring forward products in those areas where private industry cannot, to do this effectively.</P>
      <P>I will give a good example of where the private and public sectors are at odds. I have seen a person in County Laois produce a cheese called abo blue brie, which is a cambazola.  The large co-ops were not able to produce it but this person did it in his own mobile home by growing this mould in a cupboard in his bedroom.  This was a little like inventing the light bulb or the telephone.  There are geniuses who can do things which very large companies cannot do.  They are the sort of people who should be encouraged and whom the State should be involved in helping.  The large multinationals can look after themselves, even though they need help at times.  This product has the capacity to absorb large amounts of milk and export it to countries in the form of a cheese which is a high value added product and is demanded by the market. A large internal co-op tried to develop this cheese and was not successful but this person did it on his own.</P>
      <P>That is the coalface where the State must be involved.  If the State is already doing this type of thing through Teagasc and Forbairt, it should bring this function under one umbrella and include it in this section so that it services the people who are trying to get products into the market place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>New product development is outside the mandate of An Bord Bia.  If it were to become involved in this, it would duplicate the work of Forbairt. Senator Dardis spoke about cottage cheeses.  We should welcome in every way we can the type of person he mentioned who developed a product and process. The cottage cheese sector was worth about £2 million in 1992.  A group representing this sector has been set up and is seeking ways of expanding its role and markets.  We should give every assistance to niche operators, whether it is Country Butter in Mayo, Farmhouse Cheeses in Waterford or any other product.  One of the directives to the new interim board will be to use every means possible to help these people.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, they have to develop a local and national market and then they have to make the quantum leap beyond that.  Some of them have very humble beginnings, as the Senator outlined. At a recent launch for this type of product there was very fulsome praise for Senator Quinn's retailing operations and how helpful he is to people with such products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Dardis thinks I do not listen to Senator Quinn he is mistaken.  This is an area which needs to be developed.  There are structural problems.  For instance, in Mayo there is Farmhouse Pantry where a number of products, with different producers, are brought under one label.  There are difficulties in relation to sharing overheads. Some of these producers are in fairly remote areas and may not have three phase electricity, etc.  There are many difficulties.  I am totally committed to An Bord Bia playing a very full role in assisting this type of operator.  It was one of the areas which the expert group did not address.  We tended to address the larger producers.  It is an area which possibly <Col N="2052" /> warrants setting up its own expert group to come up with recommendations.  I have spent a great deal of time looking at it and there are many difficulties there. However, there is also a great deal of potential.</P>
      <P>It is an area which is very dear to my heart because it provides the opportunity to create jobs in fairly isolated areas. In the British market, for example, the independent sector &mdash; convenience shops which stay open late at night &mdash; has at present about 3 per cent of all sales and 10 per cent of food sales.  However, the graph suggests that by end of the century they will have 20 per cent of food sales. Their customers have above average incomes because many of them work and do their shopping in the evening.  I see potential there.  A number of products have got into that area fairly successfully.</P>
      <P>Our discussion is opening up areas. However, I see An Bord Bia as an agency which will have the top people &mdash; that is the firm intention.  It will have its own momentum and expertise and will range across various areas assisting niche operators, identifying product areas for value added and so on.  We can become a little too narrow and legalistic in how we approach it.  This board will not be the subject of any interference.  It will be charged with doing a job and given every assistance to do that job by this Government.</P>

      <P>It will not, with respect to Senator Quinn.  However, development of products <i>per se</i> is an area which belongs to Forbairt.  This board is concerned with the development of markets and the promotional area.  However, there is a vitally important interface between this promotion agency and the development agency.  In that context, the <Col N="2053" /> catalyst is the private sector, in my view. If I shared his fear, I would accept his amendment.  However, the fear he expresses is not one I believe will have any relevance in practice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 23 to 35, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  On the establishment day, those functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara which relate to the export marketing of fish and fish products shall stand transferred to the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The intention of this amendment is clear. This section of the Bill refers to An Bord Glas how it stands on the establishment day, the functions, etc., which will be transferred to An Bord Bia.  Precisely the same situation should apply in the case of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in terms of the export marketing of fish and fish products.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister stated that this section would cover, for instance, the case where, following the review of BIM's functions which is currently in progress, it might be decided to transfer to An Bord Bia responsibility for fish as a food.  I am saying that that should be done now.  I do not see why there should be a delay.  Fish is a food and is included in section 2, the interpretation section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2054" /> There is huge potential in this area.  If, as we hope, An Bord Bia is going into the export markets and effectively promotes and markets our food, the whole fish product end of the business should be involved in that.  There is huge potential, for example, in fish farming &mdash; although as a practising angler for sea trout I have difficulties with what has happened with salmon farming.  However, it is producing a valuable product.  There is the undoubted potential of the shellfish area. Because of our clean waters we can produce very high quality fish.  I appeal to the Minister to include An Bord Iascaigh Mhara under the same terms as An Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>Earlier, the Minister spoke about the rights of employees in some of these bodies and what might happen to them. The virtue of including BIM here is that such difficulties are provided for in the Bill.  Section 9 (2) (c) states that:</P>
    <P>An order under this subsection may include provision fro the employment by the Board of members of the staff of any body to which the order relates who are designated by that body for such employment.</P>
    <P>The inevitable difficulties which would arise are, therefore, covered.  There are significant advantages to be gained by including the export functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis. I am very enthusiastic about An Bord Bia but unless we are very careful, we will end up with a bord bia which does not include anything that An Bord Bainne does &mdash; for which we have had a very understandable explanation; it does not include the development of new food products &mdash; for which we have had an explanation; and it does not yet include fish but perhaps it is understandable for there to be a delay until the report of the investigating committee is presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Dardis's view that fish should be included.  Perhaps that <Col N="2055" /> could be catered for by including the words &ldquo;within one or two years or as soon as the report has been presented&rdquo;. It seems wrong to have a food board which is responsible for fish, the development of new products and dairy products. We are ending up with a very badly structured organisation.</P>

It is disappointing that we are not in the position to give An Bord Bia the marketing functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and I outlined why earlier.  When the review is complete and with the consent of the Minister for the Marine, those functions can be given.  As it stands, I am not in a position to accept the amendment much as I would like to.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by order assign to the Board such additional functions as the Minister considers to be incidental to or consequential on the functions assigned to it by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suspect a hidden agenda in this short section, which does not explain anything. What has the Minister in mind in this section?  I always worry about provisions to make orders because it gives the Minister full authority under the Act.</P>

      <P>Senator D'Arcy's party spokesperson in the Dáil tabled an amendment on section 9 which I conceded. Under the section any order will need the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This section is effectively a tidying up one and any order made under it would not be of any great consequence. It would apply if, for example, the marketing functions of Bord Iscaigh Mara were subsumed into An Bord Bia and if an area, such as pensions, was overlooked in the order which gave effect to that.</P>
      <P>The wording &ldquo;incidental to or consequential on&rdquo; makes it clear that nothing substantial is envisaged.  Requiring an affirmative order from both Houses of the Oireachtas would be an overkill in this area.  I conceded an amendment to section 9 in the Dail because the arguments advanced were substantial.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) One ordinary member shall be appointed to represent the views and interests of consumers.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The consumer should be directly represented on the board.  As I said on Second Stage, I realise the Minister made a minimalist advance in the Dáil by including subsection (5) which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The chairman and the persons appointed to be ordinary members shall be persons having knowledge or experience of the food industry and of consumer requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meat processor or someone involved in processing other agricultural produce or food has, by definition, a knowledge of the food industry and consumer <Col N="2057" /> requirements if they are selling a product. However, I would go beyond that.</P>
    <P>The consumer must be directly represented for some of the reasons we spoke about on Second Stage and because the primacy of the consumer is paramount.  I do not suggest as a representative someone who wanders into one of Senator Quinn's supermarkets to buy off a shelf &mdash; although it may be desirable to have some of that nature &mdash; but a representative of perhaps the Consumers' Association of Ireland or some such body, someone with a degree of expertise.  It would strengthen the focus of the board and would assist it in its remit to market effectively.</P>
    <P>There are precedents for this, the most recent being in the Bill we passed this afternoon, the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, 1994 where the Schedule states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The appropriate number of first and subsequent ordinary members nominated by processor, distributor, retail and consumer interests shall be appointed to the Agency by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are not asking for something new.  It was done in the case of An Bord Glas and, more recently, in the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill passed last week giving racecourses representation on the Authority.  There are many precedents and in this case the argument is more compelling than in the others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned on Second Stage that I would like to see the consumer's interests being represented on the board of An Bord Bia.  Section 14 (5) adequately ensures that consumers will be represented.  It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The chairman and the persons appointed to be ordinary members shall be persons having knowledge or experience of the food industry and of consumer requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis wants to ensure there is a representative of consumers on the board.  If that was included, others, including producers, retailers, etc., <Col N="2058" /> would look for representation.  Consumers are adequately covered by section 14 (5).</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis will be disappointed that I do not support him.  In seeking a board, the Minister will seek the best people for it.  As Senator Kiely said, there is a danger that if a person is appointed to the board as a representative, he is obliged to represent that view.  The consumer is well covered as it stands.  There is a danger in asking people to represent a view.  I am happy to support steps the Minister has taken, which take into account that consumer experience and expertise is on the board at chairman's level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill and the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, which relate to sectoral areas.  This Bill has a larger remit.  The board may comprise a chairperson and nine members or a chairperson and 11 members.  Whichever model we choose, three places are already spoken for &mdash; an officer of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, a nominee of the Minister for Trade and Tourism and a nominee of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. That reduces the scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Kiely and Quinn pointed out that if we decide to follow a sectoral model, there are so many areas of interest, it would be impossible to cover them all within the size of board envisaged here.  If we increased its size, it would become unwieldy.  I introduced an amendment in the Dáil which Senator Dardis said was minimalist.  When examining amendments I focused on the fact that the consumer we are talking about here is not primarily the Irish consumer and a knowledge of consumer requirements in major markets in which we need to get a share is paramount.  We need to get a much bigger market share.  Some people advance the argument that, at the end of the day, we are all consumers, which is true.  I ask Senator Dardis to accept that it is the firm intention of both <Col N="2059" /> the Minister and myself to establish a board that will do the job.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed by two contributions in the Dáil.  The first was that of my constituency colleague and former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, who strongly warned against sectoral nominees.  The second was by one of my predecessors, Deputy Kirk, who made the same point on Committee Stage.  The Minister has to be free to put the best people on the board.  I accepted the thrust of the arguments in the Dáil and included an amendment which provides that there should be knowledge and experience of consumer requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept much of what the Minister said.  I appreciate the difficulty because if we open the door, everyone will want to get in.  Deputy O'Malley made a similar point on the Horseracing Industry Bill where he said the Minister should appoint people rather than giving numerous agencies nomination rights.  I ask the Minister to be careful about the sectoral interests which might be introduced when appointing a person with knowledge or experience of consumer requirements.  As far as possible, he should step back from some of those sectoral interests.  For example, I would hate to see the chairman of a meat factory being defined as the person with the knowledge and experience of consumer requirements.  While I accept that they have knowledge, I am looking for a person with a slighter broader focus.  To be fair to the Minister, his comments indicate that this is also the type of person he will seek.  In that context, I will not press the amendment.</P>

    <P>I certainly do not want a plethora of committees but I believe the calibre of person we intend appointing to this board will ensure that this will not happen.  If I understood the Senator, his point was that we should not have a plethora of boards which effectively would not be serving any useful purpose.  That is certainly not the intention.

They would come within the definition of the &ldquo;home market&rdquo;.  The legislation applies to <Col N="2062" /> approved abattoirs.

There are two levels: the approval of the abattoir and the licence to operate. A licence could be withdrawn on foot of representations but this is distinct from approval for the abattoir.  Certain works would have to be carried out in the abattoir before a licence could be restored. Does that answer the Senator's point?</P>

      <P>This is only a minor point and I do not wish to detain the House unduly but it relates to something I said on Second Stage about the colour of stamps with which I have terrible difficulties. The 10p stamp is deep yellow, a £5 stamp is yellow and a £20 stamp is cream.  I can imagine some people who might be using these stamps having them on the back of their Mercedes 500 exposed to the sunlight and the shade of the stamps might become difficult to distinguish.  Does the Minister think that the differences are adequate to readily distinguish the denominations of the <Col N="2063" /> stamps?  I notice that there are no green stamps for instance which would be easy to distinguish from red or pink stamps. Part III of the Schedule refers to mid-blue as being cyan &mdash; I talked about that earlier.  I did not know what cyan was.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this matter to be raised in the House.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, I am annoyed that the responsible Minister is not in the House for the debate.  I understood as early as 1 p.m. today that he would be here.  I am surprised he is not present as I saw him in the vicinity in the past few minutes.  If he wishes to treat Irish Steel with such contempt it is an insult to this House and to the workers in Irish Steel.  I hope that is not his way of dealing with the matter.  It is unfair that the Minister who is dealing with the problem and is up to date with it is not present.  The House deserves an explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current state of affairs of Irish Steel is very serious.  I would not want to undermine discussions that are, I understand, to start in the morning.  I welcome that the relevant parties pushed to bring in the ICTU into the matter.  Why was Congress not brought in sooner?  The goalposts were changed speedily on Sunday and to expect an agreement to <Col N="2065" /> be reached in six to eight hours is not realistic.  It is obvious that agreement could not be reached between management and particular unions.  Management was having discussions with one union in one part of the building where the meeting was taking place and with other unions in another part of the same building.  I welcome Congress intervening because all unions should have met for discussions.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel is important to the Cork region, particularly to the lower harbour area.  It is not just the 550 people who work there or the number who will be working there if it is saved that is in question, but Irish Steel is important to many semi-State bodies, to many people in the Cobh area and in the lower harbour area of Cork.  It is important to the ferry companies and to Irish Rail &mdash; its loss could mean the end of the Cork-Cobh line.</P>
    <P>There is a general impression that there is a death wish, whether on the part of management or workers.  Some Oireachtas Members met both parties yesterday for discussions about the situation. It is disturbing to think that after 27 meetings between the parties involved nobody could say that anything had been agreed and that people can get together again within a short time of Congress becoming involved.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate if the Minister of State would convey to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment that in discussions Congress should be talking to both parties, and report directly to the Minister.  A total of 27 meetings have taken place, 25 of which were called by one group and not by management. There was an agreement on Sunday that basic pay would be left as it was.  Another suggestion being considered is that more workers should be let go.  It baffles me, and anybody who has any sense of logic, that there should have to be an agreement on that within six hours, and that we were brought to that point before a management decision, whether in discussion with the Department or not.</P>
    <P>Obviously, discussions took place with the Department on Monday to put the <Col N="2066" /> workforce on protective notice and the plant is now only working at half strength.  No raw materials were bought today.  That is bad when people are prepared to compromise and there will have to be a compromise.  I do not deny that fact because I am a realist.  People should come together and discuss matters.  I agree that as many jobs as possible should be saved.  Irish Steel's costs are too high, but everybody is responsible for that situation, including the management and the Department.  This issue raises a number of questions, such as whether the Department wants Irish Steel to continue in existence.  Does it think Ireland should have a steel plant?  We have a duty to tell the EU and others that there should be a steel plant on this island.</P>
    <P>The crisis does not just involve the workers at Irish Steel but the entire area. Approximately 600 other people are directly involved in providing services to the company.  For example, the harbour commissioners will lose somewhere in the region of £500,000-600,000 a year in Cork port.  It also has implications for Irish Rail freight, involving a loss of £700,000 a year.  Hammond Lane, which employs 50 people outside the door of Irish Steel, will close.  Serious consideration must be given to this aspect.</P>
    <P>The attitude of both sides late on Sunday night is also a cause for concern. Admittedly both sides may have been tired but they should have rested.  Instead a situation was created where protective notice was issue and the plant is without half its workforce.  It is most unfair and bad policy.  Why were moves not made earlier to get congress involved?  Was the Labour Relations Commission really committed to the problem?  Can it operate in a way that will ensure people come together?  How is it, after 27 meetings, that nobody can say progress was made?</P>
    <P>We met the unions and management yesterday morning.  Both sides were at loggerheads to such an extent that I believed they had a death wish for the company.  The people who have put their lives into Irish Steel and the people of the region deserve better.  Questions must be posed.  Were the Department's actions <Col N="2067" /> sincere and why was congress not brought in earlier?  Congress is capable of bringing all trade unionists together.  We understand there was a problem with the craft unions in that they were not prepared to enter discussions with the other unions. If that is incorrect, I would like clarification. Of the 27 meetings held, 25 were called by the workforce while management only called two.  Does the management have a commitment to Irish Steel or has it been told to forget about the company, that we would be much better off without it?  That is the concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State knows that I hold him in high regard but the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who is in the vicinity, should be here to discuss this matter and to explain exactly what is happening.  It is a very serious situation and I do not want it to go the same way as TEAM Aer Lingus.  People are committed to the success of the company.  Of all the people Oireachtas Members from Cork met yesterday, not one said they did not want the company to succeed or that it was not worth it.  It is a vitally important firm to the area.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we receive proper answers and that all sides are brought together to work through the problem.  We must ensure there is rational thinking.  Neither side has engaged in such thinking.  I do not carry a flag for anybody but I met the management and unions yesterday.  The unions specifically said that management walked out of the meeting early on Sunday morning, stating it was closing down the plant.  That is most unfair, given that it moved the goalposts a mere six hours earlier.  The workforce said it was prepared to consider anything, so long as every effort was made to ensure the plant remained open.  There is a demand for a 20 per cent reduction in the basic rate.  It is unfair to expect anybody to agree to that without something in return.  It took 27 meetings before a compromise was reached and the management agreed that the workforce was entitled to the basic rate and could retain the 20 per cent. However, six hours later, management <Col N="2068" /> walked out.  Somebody must be held responsible.  They have a duty.</P>
    <P>We need proper answers.  The Department is responsible on behalf of the taxpayer. It is the owner and therefore in a position to tell people to get their acts together.  There is sincere commitment on the part of all those concerned but the risk is that over 200 people will lose their jobs.  Those involved are conscious of that fact and it is not easy to eliminate any job.  There should be proper commitment on everybody's part and I ask the Minister of State to bring this point to the senior Minister, who is not prepared to come into the House.  That is an insult to the Cork region.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Cregan for allowing me the opportunity to address this most important issue.  I am very aware of the concerns of all the Oireachtas Members in the Cork area. I have been asked by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who unfortunately cannot be here, to make the following statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's position on Irish Steel is well known.  It regrets that to date it has not been possible to reach agreement on the £8.4 million cost reduction package needed to achieve viable commercial operation.  It welcomes the initiative from congress earlier today, which has allowed for the reopening of negotiations.  It also welcomes the executive chairman's statement that talks will recommence tomorrow.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Government hope that the resumed <Col N="2069" /> negotiations can be speedily and successfully concluded.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator Cregan and the other Members join me and the Government in that hope.</P>

I ask the Minister of State to emphasise to the senior Minister and the Department that congress is in a position to tell both sides to get their acts together.  The Minister should recommend that congress report back to him and hold discussions with both parties.  I understand that discussions between both sides will be held in the morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is opportune to raise this matter, given the announcement this morning that there will be an Exchequer surplus.  Senator Manning and I plead with the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Finance our request that a tiny portion of that surplus be given to enhancing the Library services in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive report was produced on March 1, which was debated in this House, regarding the need to upgrade and update the facilities.  The report was compiled by my colleague, Senator Manning, and adopted by the Joint Services Committee and this House as a very positive contribution in trying to put together a Library that would create an even playing pitch between the ordinary Members <Col N="2070" /> of both Houses and the Executive branch.  It is no longer acceptable that people who are expected to comment and dissect legislation should be at such a serious disadvantage in relation to research and information.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the goodwill of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues and I appreciate the efforts being made by the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey.  I welcome the envisaged substantial expenditure on new buildings.  Everybody accepts that the provision of such buildings is long overdue.  No company could survive the lack of facilities with which this House appears to have survived for so many years.  It is a tribute to the patience and adaptability of the Members and staff that Governments have got away with providing so few facilities.</P>
    <P>We promised the committee at its last meeting that we would continue to bring this matter forward.  We do not do so in an antagonistic manner but the issue must be addressed.  The amount of money we seek to begin the process of modernising the Library facilities in this House is relatively small and will enable the Members to involve themselves in a way that is constructive in terms of their contributions to legislation and their role as watchdogs of Governments.  That has been a vital role and it is even more vital now because of the very complicated legislation being introduced by our Government and in Europe.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State convey our plea to the Minister for Finance that a sum be set aside in the 1995 Estimates for the Library?  The Minister of State has had a long and successful day.  I congratulate him on the An Bord Bia Bill, 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Magner for agreeing to share his time with me. Once again I pay tribute to him for the lead he has given as chairman of the Joint Services Committee.  He has brought a great spirit of innovation, indeed almost a spirit of capitalist enterprise, to bear on his task and we are the beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> The members of the joint committee were asked by the Dáil in a motion on 24 November 1993 to report to both Houses on the adequacy of the resources available for the Library and research services and to report on how these services might be improved.  Our report was published and adopted by the Joint Services Committee and debated fully and well in this House although the debate in the other House was not on the same level.  I am already in trouble because I said on a recent television programme that one tends to meet a better class of person in the Seanad.  However, in this case there was a better debate in the Seanad on the fundamental needs of the library in a modern parliament.  The Dáil also approved the report.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner and I are determined to press ahead with this matter because we want serious consideration to be given to the 12 specific proposals in the report. The report is an attempt to provide for a thoroughly comprehensive and professional research and information service for Members of the Oireachtas which will serve them well into the next century. In our research we found huge inadequacies in the present service which has been starved of funds and professional expertise over a long period of time. Everything we said in the report had the full endorsement of the Library staff so our findings were not in any sense a criticism of the staff.</P>
    <P>There were two aspects to the report. The long term aspects require planning to put changes into effect.  That planning must be started immediately and the necessary funds provided.  There was also a number of urgent short term recommendations. One referred to the condition of the material stored in the basement and during the debate Senator Magner displayed some of the valuable artefacts which are almost dumped &mdash; or stored &mdash; in the basement area.  We made specific proposals to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat what was said during the debate.  Our work was undertaken on the instruction of the Dáil.  We <Col N="2072" /> made specific proposals which are in the best interests of all Members &mdash; not just current Members but those who will be Members in the future.  We wish to ensure that our report will be taken seriously and will not be subsumed into the longer term overall plans &mdash; which we welcome &mdash; for the Oireachtas announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey.  This report should be treated as an entity.  It should not have to wait for the more dramatic developments envisaged for the Oireachtas to be implemented and its urgent proposals should not be neglected.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to convey our views to the Minister for Finance and to report back to this House with proposals for action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Magner and Senator Manning for their contributions and for giving me the opportunity to address this important issue.  I appreciate their points not only as a Member of the other House and a former Member of this House &mdash; I will not comment on the calibre of the personnel in either &mdash; but also as a former teacher.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Services Committee was charged, on 1 April 1993, with the task of reporting to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the adequacy of the resources available for Library and research services for Members and how they might be improved.  The committee laid its report before both Houses in February 1994 and it was the subject of a debate in this House on 30 March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Services Committee's report on the Oireachtas Library facilities was compiled in consultation with the Oireachtas librarian and the head of the information technology section in Leinster House.  In its deliberations, the committee examined in detail the Library facilities and resources available in Westminster and other parliamentary libraries.  I thank the Members of the committee who gave their time to help to produce this important report and who visited the House of Commons Library <Col N="2073" /> in the course of their work to see the facilities available to members of Parliament there.</P>
    <P>The report of the Joint Services Committee highlights the importance of an efficient, comprehensive and up-to-date Library as an essential support service for the modern Parliament.  Its main recommendations concern staffing and financial resources for the library and improvements in the quality of the accommodation provided.  The committee and other Members of this House have been loud in their praise of the Oireachtas Library staff, whose services have always been of the highest quality. However, because of financial constraints, standards of accommodation and availability of resources for the library have not been quite as satisfactory in recent years.  I hope that the report of the JSC could be a first step on the road to providing a more satisfactory Library and information service to all Members and staff of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of accommodation, the development plan for the Leinster House precinct approved by the Government earlier this year includes a proposal to relocate the Oireachtas Library in the existing College of Art premises.  This would result in a considerable improvement in the standard and quality of accommodation for Members and staff and facilitate the important links which are to be established between the National Library and the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>One of the principal issues highlighted in the JSC's report was the slow pace of computerisation in the library and the lack of a computerised cataloguing and indexation system.  I am happy to report that considerable progress has been made in this area since.  After extensive evaluation of library software, a system called Unicorn was selected as the most appropriate to meet the requirements of the Houses and in February 1994 sanction was received for its purchase and installation. The hardware was installed in April and the software installed in May. The system provides facilities to catalogue and search all material held in the <Col N="2074" /> Library on subject matter, author, etc., and shows the availability and location of material.</P>
    <P>There are modules to control circulation, acquisitions and serials.  There is an easy to use search system which will enable members to complete searches for information, print reports and reserve or order material.  Total expenditure on computerisation to date has been £60,000.</P>
    <P>The next task to be undertaken will be the data capture of the existing Library material.  As was mentioned in the Joint Services Committee report, one of the main problems is that much of the existing material has not been catalogued. Samples of the existing material has been sent to some data capture companies who specialise in cataloguing library material. It is hoped to have quotes from them shortly.</P>
    <P>If costs permit it is intended that existing material will be catalogued externally and loaded into the system.  It is envisaged that the main book catalogues, containing about 10,000 entries, will be entered before the end of the year.  In addition, parliamentary debates are currently being entered onto databases and the Library will shortly have search access to this material.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, only Library staff have access to the computerised Library facilities.  However, it is intended over the next six months to connect Members' PCs into the computer network to give them access to the Library databases.</P>
    <P>With regard to staffing, discussions are taking place with another Government Department with a view to acquiring a professional librarian with expertise in library information systems to advise on and assist with implementation and future development of the Library's automated information system.  Library staff have just completed a training course in the new system and a further course is scheduled for October.</P>
    <P>Measures are also being taken to preserve the valuable historical collections housed in Leinster House.  A 17-volume <Col N="2075" /> set of the 18th century <i>Parliamentary Register of Ireland</i> has been sent to a quality book binding firm for restoration and binding, at a cost of approximately £850.  Conservation measures such as this <Col N="2076" /> will continue to be taken as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 July 1994.</P>
