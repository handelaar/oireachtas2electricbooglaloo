      <P>I understand that, before the Order of Business, there will be an expression of sympathy on the death of a former Member of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally propose a vote of sympathy to the widow and family of the late Senator Willie O'Brien.  I wish to extend to his widow Philomena and daughters the sympathy of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I join in the vote of sympathy to the family of the late Willie O'Brien.  I had the honour and pleasure to serve with Willie O'Brien in the Lower House for a number of years.  He was a Member of both Houses.  Willie O'Brien was a man who received little formal education but he had tremendous intelligence and common sense as well as a great dedication to his own county of Limerick.  He had a great respect for the traditions of this House and gave total loyalty to the party which he served so well over such a long period. Willie O'Brien had an infectious enthusiasm for anything he did and a tremendous sense of humour.  He greatly enjoyed the simple things of life, <Col N="838" /> including hurling, a game of cards and the company of others.  He was a tremendous practical joker and many of his colleagues suffered &mdash; gently but with a little barb &mdash; as a result of some of his elaborate and very successful practical jokes.</P>
      <P>Willie O'Brien did great service to this country when he &mdash; an unlikely person to get the job &mdash; chaired the all-party committee on marriage breakdown in the 1980s.  He brought to that difficult task a great sense of diplomacy, bringing together different points of view and producing a wise report which was, in many ways, ahead of its time. That was one of his greatest contributions.</P>
      <P>Most of all, those of us who knew Willie O'Brien will remember him as a warm, enthusiastic person of great good humour, a person of loyalty above all else to his party, to his county and to his country.  On behalf of my colleagues I extend our deepest heartfelt sympathy to his widow and family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, exactly &mdash; trying to reflect changes in other places.  We will be having a Front Bench meeting later on this afternoon to arrange things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a serious note, none of us on the Independent benches had the experience of working with Willie O'Brien but we would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to his family.  We wish to recognise also the input made by politicians of any hue &mdash; Independent or party members &mdash; to Irish politics.  We are happy to be associated with the vote <Col N="839" /> of sympathy and would like that to be conveyed to his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, both nationally and locally, we send our deepest sympathy to the family of Willie O'Brien.  As Senator Manning said, Willie O'Brien was a great man who worked hard for his constitutents. He was a man whom I had the pleasure of knowing.  I worked for a period in Limerick County Council and met him there &mdash; on the other side of the fence as it were.  He was a gentleman.</P>
      <P>In extending our sympathy to the family, we must also extend our sympathy to the Fine Gael Party and in particular to Senator Dan Neville who was a particularly good friend of his.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I wish to join in the tributes paid to the late Willie O'Brien, to extend our sympathy to his widow and daughters and to the Fine Gael party. He dedicated his life to serving the people of his constituency at county council level, in this House and in the other House.  His death is deeply regretted by everybody who knew him.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan, I should not call you but you indicated that you wish to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking because the late Willie O'Brien worked with my father in CIE in Limerick.  He was an excellent Member of this House and the other House.  He was a superb public representative.  I do not wish to be facetious but I met Willie at the funeral of a cousin of mine one day and I am sure that Willie enjoyed it as much as I did.  As we walked into the church he asked me why I was there.  I was at that funeral because a cousin of my mother's was related to Sylvie Barrett; Willie's wife was related to Donal Carey, so there was an amalgam of political influences at the funeral.  Willie stood for everything that was good in Irish politics and in Irish life and he will be missed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pay my tribute to the late Willie O'Brien and to convey my sympathy to his wife, Phil, and his family, Annette, Mary and Mary Rose. Willie O'Brien was a Member of this House from 1969 to 1977 and at one election got two quotas on the Labour panel; he was a Member of the other House from 1977 to 1987.  He was a member of Limerick County Council from 1960 to 1989 and was also a member of the Mid-Western Health Board on several occasions.  He was a most professional politician.  He had a great sense of what people felt, how the grassroots in his constituency felt and he also knew how State institutions should respond to the needs of his constituents.</P>
      <P>He was a most caring and compassionate person.  He worked very hard and had great concern for the underprivileged; he did everything he could to assist them.  He was a very public man. He enjoyed meetings; he enjoyed the banter of the council and, as Leader of the Fine Gael group for many years on that council, did excellent work and really enjoyed that type of work.  He treated everybody equally.  He treated the very poor the same as the captains of industry.  It did not matter what colour, creed or politics a person was, Willie always wanted to work for everybody.</P>
      <P>He was, as Senator Manning said, a very witty person.  He enjoyed the practical jokes, he enjoyed parties of all types.  He was always the life and soul of every party.  As Senator Manning says, in the mid-1980s he was asked by his great friend, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, the then Taoiseach, to chair the committee on marital breakdown and did excellent work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was, above all, a great family man. It is difficult sometimes for politicians to pay attention to their families, as we all know, but Willie was, above all, very close to his family.  He cared about them and was always with them.  As I said, he was a very friendly man and enjoyed company; he enjoyed social occasions.  I was honoured since my early teens to be a very close friend of his.  He has been <Col N="841" /> a great influence in my life, especially in the area of political activity.</P>
    <P>I again wish to convey our sympathy to Phil, Annette, Mary and Mary Rose. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam dílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the family of the late Willie O'Brien.  I knew him before anyone in this House did.  We were not close in age but I remember playing against him on the hurling field.  Through our association with the GAA we developed a great friendship.  Despite our different political persuasions, we always maintained a good friendship.</P>
      <P>I was elected to the Seanad in 1977 and Willie O'Brien was elected to the Dáil.  He was a gentleman, a great politician and loyal to his friends.  I wish to convey my sympathy to his widow and family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my sympathies to the family of Willie O'Brien who I knew very well.  I had many chats with him and always enjoyed his company immensely.  Again, I extend my sympathies to his family and to the Fine Gael Party.</P>

    <Title>Death of Former Member. - Order of Business</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, the Maintenance Bill, 1994.  With the agreement of the House, all Stages will be dealt with today and the Private Members' Motion and Adjournment Matters will be deferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  It is one of the ironies of our constitutional tradition that we are on the sidelines today while momentous events are taking place in the other House.  I do not propose to comment on what is happening because there is still a great deal which we do not know and there are questions to be answered and explanations given.  It would not help if <Col N="842" /> we were to say anything which would distract from the answers we seek.  I hope in the national interest full answers can be given and some credibility can be restored to a political system which has been badly battered over the past week.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Leader of the House to Item 26 on the Order Paper in the name of Fine Gael Senators which was put down a couple of weeks ago.  If it is appropriate tomorrow, I ask that time be given for a discussion on this motion.  It is a matter of major concern and tomorrow we will know more about the facts.  I ask for time for a discussion tomorrow on Item 26 or a similar motion to that on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a different view to Senator Manning.  The matters being discussed in the other House have a direct impact on everyone in this Chamber and in the State.  This House should be offered an explanation and the opportunity to discuss the extraordinary events taking place.  It is not good enough in an age of transparency and openness that these matters are confined to the party rooms of political parties because there is more involved, we all need to know and to be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the Government parties are settling in well together and they are back in the big House together.  When they settle their business &mdash; it is important that they do &mdash; it is critical that we get a full explanation and the chance to explore and to have defined those issues which created a problem. There is great unease and we must reflect that in the House.  In our discussions on topical issues, we must be able to offer a view.  Every Member of this House has not only a right but a duty and a responsibility to offer a view and a response to the extraordinary sequence of events.  I appeal to the Leader to give a commitment today that we will have an opportunity to discuss this issue tomorrow.  I am not asking for it to be discussed today.  I recognise that the business of this House today may <Col N="843" /> necessarily, and quite rightly, be truncated in order to allow for ministerial involvement in the support of the arrangements of Government.  I recognise and accept that those arrangements are necessary but I ask that we get the opportunity tomorrow to deal with these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is being very optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the extraordinary political crisis, it is very unreal to proceed with the ordinary business.  The failure of the State to extradite somebody who was wanted for child sexual abuse has shocked the entire country. We should have a full discussion of that in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we ought to have a debate.  I accept, of course, what my colleague Senator O'Toole says, that there must be facilities for Ministers to engage in discussions and take their proper place in the other House.  However, I believe we should have a debate on the events leading up to today.  There are a number of serious questions about the Taoiseach's statement yesterday and the Attorney General's statement prior to that which we are well able to discuss before the events unfold this afternoon.</P>
      <P>Unless we are to become a completely redundant appendage to the Government, we ought to be here discussing these matters this afternoon.  We do not need the presence of Ministers to so do and because I believe this, I tabled a motion under Standing Order 29 at 2.30 p.m. &mdash; which, I presume, I will read out at 3.30 p.m. &mdash; seeking the Adjournment of this House on a matter of national importance.  We should be here discussing the matters which have been revealed over the past few days if we are serious about the role of this House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not just to be spectators in the Dáil.  I was in the Dáil yesterday and there were not that many Members of this House there, and I would be surprised <Col N="844" /> if everybody wants to go and watch the blood sports taking place down the corridor this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael view is that we want full information before we debate this issue here.  Our party leader made it quite clear that he wanted full information before he would debate it. We have asked for a debate on the issue tomorrow when the full facts will have been revealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago when this business first became public I asked the Leader of the House to find out for me &mdash; it seemed impossible at the time &mdash; if those with responsibility for these matters issued any guidelines regarding the employment of people who were under suspicion and coming before the courts as accused of being paedophiles.  I have not heard from the Leader or from the Minister for Justice.  I would be very grateful to know if he has any information for me on this matter.  This is another case of people with authority refusing to take responsibility and, apparently, those with responsibility not having any authority over the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not an appendage to the other House of the Oireachtas.  We are part of the administration of law and justice in this country. I reject the suggestion by Opposition Senators that we are an appendage to the other House.  We discuss matters which are brought forward by the Leader of the House and we vote on them.  Any suggestion that we are just an appendage is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House, I hope on a positive note, to arrange an early debate on the progress of the county enterprise boards, the Leader programme, the INTERREG programme and the new structure for tourism.  My impression is that, to some extent, these organisations overlap.  We are overloaded with administration.</P>
      <P>The word is that these structures constitute a bottom-up approach.  I believe that we are top heavy with structures, some of which are not very well funded.  I ask the Leader of the House to arrange time for a debate on the various structures, some of them quite new, as soon as possible.  This includes the new set of committees put in place to administer the tourism industry.  It is important that this House has an opportunity to discuss this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that my colleague Senator McGowan has raised this serious matter in the House.  We, as Members of the Seanad whose constituency is comprised of members of local authorities, should place on public record the serious concern that has been expressed about the diminution of powers at local level and the continuing centralisation of these powers to nondemocratic <Col N="846" /> bodies which is aided and abetted by European institutions.  I support Senator McGowan on this matter which is much more serious than it seems on the face of it.  I urge the Leader to respond positively and quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should restrain himself.  The suggestion that local authority members are to have a diminished role in the Leader II Programme should be resisted by Members on all sides of the House.  There is need for a debate on this because public representatives have been removed from too many bodies.  We are creating too many quangos without responsibility.  I suggest that Members on all sides of the House should address this matter.</P>

I give an undertaking to review the situation tomorrow morning.  I ask Senator Norris, in the interest of the House and its running today, not move his motion until tomorrow.  I do not want an argument on this but it is my judgment that it would be better to wait and allow events unfold in the other House from 4 p.m. onwards.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Order of Business but since Senator O'Toole has given a commitment of agreement, I will not be calling a vote.  I will consider my position with regard to a motion under Standing Order 29.  I am not speaking entirely of your role as Cathaoirleach, but on a number of occasions I have placed matters down which I certainly believed were matters of urgent national importance and they were ruled not to be.  It will be interesting to discover what constitutes a matter of national importance.  If this catastrophic crisis in Government does not constitute such a matter, the House is entitled to know the criterion by which a matter of national importance is determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the State to ratify two international conventions &mdash; described as the Rome and New York Conventions &mdash; which will assist claimants in Ireland who wish to recover maintenance from persons living abroad.  The Bill will also assist foreign claimants who wish to enforce their entitlements to maintenance in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A strengthening of the law in relation to the recovery of maintenance payments is one of the principal objectives of the Government's family law reform programme.  The Family Law Bill, 1994, which is currently before the Dáil, extends the range and type of maintenance payments that may be awarded by courts.  It also gives courts new powers to enforce such payments.  While this measure will be of considerable benefit in recovering maintenance from persons who continue to reside in the State, additional provisions are required to deal with the increasingly common situation of maintenance debtors who go to live and work in other countries.</P>
      <P>There have always been unique difficulties associated with the inter-state enforcement of maintenance orders.  In Ireland, under the common law as it applied up to recent times, an order for periodic maintenance payments made in another country could not be recognised or enforced.  Similarly, Irish maintenance orders could not be enforced abroad in the absence of an agreement which was based on reciprocity.  As a result the maintenance creditor was left powerless to pursue the claim, unless of course her financial resources were such as to allow her to institute fresh maintenance proceedings before the appropriate foreign court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Maintenance Orders Act, 1974, was the first major attempt to address this problem.  That Act gave effect to an agreement with the United Kingdom for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders &mdash; an agreement which remains in force to this day.  A unique and far-sighted feature of the agreement was that it <Col N="849" /> covered not alone the legal aspects of recognition and enforcement but also the provision of administrative assistance to maintenance creditors who sought redress through its provisions. There are no fees or lawyers required. The system has worked well and will remain undisturbed by the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to other European Union countries was improved considerably in 1988 when Ireland acceded to a convention signed in Brussels in 1968.  This convention provides a simple and standardised legal basis for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments, including maintenance orders, between the member states of the EU.  The procedure for recognition and enforcement of these judgments in the State is set out in the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Last year, in this House, I initiated the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act, 1993, to give effect to another convention &mdash; the Lugano Convention &mdash; which provides for similar arrangements between member states of the European Union and of the European Free Trade Association. The net effect of the two Acts is that Irish maintenance orders can now be recognised and enforced in all EU and EFTA countries, with the exception of Austria and Iceland, who have yet to ratify the Lugano Convention.</P>
    <P>However, these conventions differ in one important respect from the earlier Ireland/United Kingdom agreement &mdash; no administrative assistance is provided for a maintenance creditor who seeks to avail of the simplified legal procedures. The maintenance creditor still has to travel to or engage a lawyer in the country involved, despite the fact that the international procedural and jurisdictional obstacles which formerly militated against the enforcement of Irish orders have been removed.</P>
    <P>The Rome Convention, which was finalised during the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers in 1990, is <Col N="850" /> intended to address this problem as it affects European Union member states. The main feature of the convention is the establishment of central authorities in each member state which, in co-operation with each other, will assist maintenance creditors in having maintenance orders recognised and enforced.  The central authorities can deal with both incoming and outgoing applications, help with documentation, ascertain the whereabouts of debtors and ensure that moneys due are paid over.  The Rome Convention does not come fully into force until it has been ratified by all 12 member states, but it can apply between individual member states which have ratified it prior to that date.</P>
    <P>The other convention dealt with in the Bill, the New York Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance, is currently in force in over 40 countries worldwide, including many countries with large Irish populations, such as Australia and New Zealand.  This convention is based on a similar network of central authorities, which are referred to in the convention as transmitting and receiving agencies.  There are, however, some important differences between it and the Rome Convention.</P>
    <P>The assistance given under the New York Convention is broader in scope than under the Rome Convention. There is no requirement under the New York Convention that a claimant must first obtain a maintenance order in his or her own state.  The New York Convention obliges central authorities to assist a claimant who wishes to recover maintenance, whether he or she already has a maintenance order.  The central authority in the receiving state is free to initiate proceedings for a fresh order or, alternatively, to apply for the recognition and enforcement of a foreign order, if one exists.  The Rome Convention applies only to the enforcement of maintenance orders already obtained.</P>
    <P>Neither the United States nor Canada are parties to the New York Convention. Nevertheless, the provisions of the Bill are intended to be sufficiently flexible to enable similar type arrangements <Col N="851" /> to be made with individual states or provinces within those jurisdictions without the need to have recourse to further legislation.  Discussions are currently taking place between officials from my Department and their US and Canadian counterparts with a view to achieving this goal.  The same will apply to other countries which may be less relevant in an Irish context.</P>
    <P>I turn to the details of the Bill. Section 2 states that the legislation will come into force on a date or dates to be fixed by order.  This is a standard provision in legislation giving effect to international conventions and is necessary to allow for the different timescales required for ratification and entry into force of the two conventions.  Section 4 provides for the setting up of a central authority to perform the functions required of it under the Act and the Rome and New York Conventions.  Subsection (1) is modelled on similar provisions in the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991.  The central authority proposed in the Bill is very similar to the central authority for child abduction which has been operating most successfully for the past three years.  In 1993, that central authority dealt with 82 cases involving 144 children who had been removed from the State or to the State.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) (b) provides that, pending the appointment of a central authority, its functions will be discharged by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, as is currently the case with the central authority for child abduction.  In the short term it is the intention to maintain this position, given my Department's expertise on the conventions themselves, its international contacts and its experience in the operation of the central authority for child abduction.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill covers the recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders from what are termed &ldquo;reciprocating jurisdictions&rdquo;.  In order to qualify as a reciprocating jurisdiction, a country must be a contracting party to either the <Col N="852" /> Brussels or the Lugano Convention and must operate a central authority system to assist maintenance creditors.  In fact, all the contracting parties to those conventions already have a central authority system in place by virtue of having ratified the New York Convention or the Rome Convention.</P>
    <P>The Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993, already provide a simplified procedure which may be availed of by a maintenance creditor who seeks recognition and enforcement in the State of a maintenance order made in a country which is a party to the Brussels or Lugano Conventions.  However, as I said, the maintenance creditor must travel here or engage an Irish lawyer to avail of this procedure.</P>
    <P>By virtue of section 7, the central authority can step into the shoes of the creditor once it receives an application to enforce a maintenance order.  It will send the application to the Master of the High Court who will consider it privately. The master will make an order for the enforcement of the maintenance order, unless it appears from the accompanying documents or from the master's own knowledge that enforcement is prohibited by the Brussels or Lugano Conventions.</P>
    <P>This procedure corresponds with that of the Maintenance Orders Act, 1974. Once the order has been made enforceable by the Master it will be enforced by the District Court and in accordance with section 7 of the 1988 Act unless, in the case of a lump sum order or arrears, it would be more effective to have the order enforced by the High Court.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 to 12 amend various provisions of the 1988 and 1993 Acts.  The main purpose of these amendments is to allow the District Court to enforce lump sum maintenance orders.  This will add to the District Court's existing powers to enforce periodic payment orders and is consistent with a similar extension being made under the Family Law Bill in respect of domestic maintenance orders.  The District Court is also being given power to enforce maintenance <Col N="853" /> orders where the debtor is employed by an Irish based firm but does not in fact reside here.  In such cases an attachment of earnings order may be effective.  For convenience of reference sections 6 and 7 of the 1988 Act, which are quite lengthy, have been set out in full in their amended form.</P>
    <P>There are several references in these sections to &ldquo;authentic instruments&rdquo; and &ldquo;court settlements&rdquo; which require further explanation given that they are unknown to Irish law.  Authentic instruments are enforceable in the country where they are drawn up in the same manner as a judgment but without the need to have recourse to the courts.  The instrument must be authenticated by a public authority, normally a notary. Court settlements &mdash; known in German and Dutch law &mdash; are approved by a court in the course of proceedings and are enforceable without further formality. They differ from court settlements under Irish law which are not enforceable unless they are embodied in an order of the court.</P>
    <P>Applications for recognition and enforcement of these instruments and settlements are made not to the Master of the High Court but to the High Court itself under the Brussels and Lugano Conventions.  This procedure will continue. However, the District Court is now being empowered to enforce an instrument or settlement which the High Court has declared enforceable in so far as it provides for the payment of maintenance.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with applications for the recovery of maintenance from &ldquo;designated jurisdictions&rdquo;, that is, jurisdictions which are contracting parties to the New York Convention.  Other jurisdictions, such as individual states and provinces in the United States or Canada, may also be declared to be designated jurisdictions by order of the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, as I hope, similar arrangements can be negotiated.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is the key provision of this Part.  That section sets out the procedures to be followed by the central <Col N="854" /> authority when it receives an application for the recovery of maintenance on behalf of a claimant from its counterpart in a designated jurisdiction.  The application may be accompanied by a maintenance order already made on the claimant's behalf by the courts in his or her own country.  Alternatively, it may represent the first attempt by the claimant to have the matter determined by any court.</P>
    <P>European Union and EFTA states &mdash; other than Austria and Iceland &mdash; may be both reciprocating jurisdictions for the purposes of Part II of the Bill and designated jurisdictions for the purposes of Part III.  This will operate as follows. Applications for recognition and enforcement in Ireland of maintenance orders which are made in those countries will be dealt with under Part II because those orders come within the scope of the Brussels and Lugano Conventions. However, where there is no actual order these conventions will not apply and an application from one of those countries to commence maintenance proceedings here will be dealt with under Part III.</P>
    <P>If the application for the recovery of maintenance is accompanied by a maintenance order made in one of those countries, it will be transmitted by the central authority to the Master of the High Court for determination.  If the application is accompanied by a maintenance order made in any other country, the central authority will apply to the District Court for enforcement of the order.</P>
    <P>In section 22 I am taking the opportunity in the Bill to give statutory effect to very recent changes in common law rules concerning recognition and enforcement of foreign maintenance orders.  These changes were as a result of a High Court judgment in a case entitled McC. <i>v.</i> McC. on 22 June 1993 and had a major impact on the approach adopted to this section.  Previously, under common law, Irish courts would not recognise or enforce a foreign maintenance order if, as was usually the case, the order was for payment of periodic <Col N="855" /> amounts by the debtor.  This was because such an order was not regarded as being final and conclusive, because it could be varied, as regards future payments, by the foreign court which granted it.  The 1974 agreement with the United Kingdom and the Brussels and Lugano Conventions made this rule obsolete in respect of orders made in the European Union and EFTA area. The position in relation to orders made in other countries remained unaffected.</P>
    <P>The effect of the High Court decision is that the recognition or enforcement of a foreign maintenance order can no longer be refused just because the court which made the original order has the power to vary or revoke it.  Statutory effect is being given to this principle by section 22.  That section amends the common law rules in one other respect also in order further to facilitate the enforcement of foreign maintenance orders.  It abolishes the rule that prevents a foreign order being denied enforcement simply because the respondent was not resident or present in the foreign country when the proceedings began.  However the claimant must have been resident there at the time.  The other grounds for refusal &mdash; that the judgment was obtained by fraud or was contrary to natural or constitutional justice or public policy &mdash; will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>Thus the District Court will be able to recognise and enforce foreign orders under section 14 (1) (b) even where the respondent has absconded from the foreign country before the order was granted.  If the District Court decides the order is enforceable, it will be enforced under the provisions of the 1988 Act mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>If a request from a designated State is not accompanied by a maintenance order or if a request for the enforcement order is refused by the District Court, section 14 (1) (e) of the Bill authorises the central authority to apply for a maintenance order to the Circuit Court or the District Court under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses <Col N="856" /> and Children) Act, 1976.  Section 14 (4) lists various options open to the court in the event of the respondent disputing the evidence of the claimant.  Special measures are needed to deal with such cases given that the claimant may be living thousands of miles away and through lack of resources may not be in a position to attend the hearing.</P>
    <P>The court is being empowered to ask the respondent to make his case by swearing an affidavit outside court or by way of a sworn deposition in the courtroom there and then.  The affidavit can then be sent to the central authority in Ireland for transmission to the central authority where the claimant lives with a request that the claimant provide an answering affidavit.  Alternatively the court may ask a court in the foreign jurisdiction to take evidence on the matters raised by the respondent in his affidavit.</P>
    <P>If the court is not in a position to give a decision on that basis it has the further option of requiring the claimant to give evidence through a live television link. The necessary facilities can be provided in the equipment already in use in the Four Courts, although similar facilities may not be available in all of the foreign jurisdictions concerned.</P>
    <P>It is probable that in most cases the question of whether to make an order can be decided on the basis of the documentary evidence.  In this context it is relevant to note the foreign central authority is obliged to satisfy itself the application is made in good faith and is authorised by the UN Convention to express to the central authority here an opinion as to the merits of the case. However, provision is being made for cases where the respondent may have a bona fide wish to cross-examine the claimant whether by television link or otherwise.  That is done in section 14 (5).</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the case of an Irish claimant who wishes to recover maintenance from a person residing in a designated jurisdiction.  It provides that such a claimant may give evidence on sworn deposition before the District Court as to the facts of the claim.  The <Col N="857" /> court may then certify that the claim sets out facts from which it may be determined that the respondent owes a duty to maintain the claimant.</P>
    <P>The object of this provision is to ensure that the most convincing evidence is given on behalf of the Irish claimant to the foreign court or tribunal. If a maintenance order has already been made in Ireland in favour of the claimant, the registrar or clerk of the court will give the claimant a copy of the order and a certificate of other particulars relating to it.  A similar provision is not included in Part II of the Bill because it is already covered by section 12 of the 1988 Act.  The type of evidence provided for in this section should be of great assistance to Irish claimants in pursuing their applications before foreign courts.</P>
    <P>Section 18 empowers the High Court to grant provisional, including protective, measures upon the application of the central authority arising from a request for the recovery of maintenance under Part III.  The 1988 Act contains similar provisions which would apply to applications under Part II.  Such measures could include an injunction to restrain a defendant from disposing of goods or from removing them out of the jurisdiction with the object of defeating any future maintenance order that might be made.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill applies to both reciprocating and designated jurisdictions. Section 20 empowers the central authority to obtain information about a defendant's whereabouts or his or her assets.  The Rome Convention imposes this obligation on central authorities. The New York Convention contains no similar provision but such a course is certainly not precluded by it and is in keeping with its spirit.</P>
    <P>Section 20 (1) places a statutory obligation on Government bodies or office holders to provide such information.  In the case of other bodies or persons the central authority must obtain an order of the District Court requiring the disclosure of information.  I should emphasise that the information the central <Col N="858" /> authority is allowed to seek is limited to that which is necessary or expedient for the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters.  Section 22, to which I have already referred, amends the common law rules on the enforceability of foreign maintenance orders.  Section 23 states that payments under a maintenance order shall be made in Irish currency. The rate of exchange used in converting the amount due under a foreign maintenance order is the exchange rate prevailing on the date the order is declared enforceable.  A maintenance order for periodic payments could have a different exchange rate for each periodic payment and that would result in a totally unmanageable situation.</P>
    <P>Those are the main provisions of the Bill.  Although many of its provisions are quite technical, its successful passage through the House will represent far more than a technical change as it now stands.  The Bill is a significant step forward in the protection of the rights of spouses and children who have been deserted by those whose responsibility it is to maintain them.  It is a measure which is particularly appropriate in this the International Year of the Family. Ratification of these international conventions will also serve as a statement to the international community that Ireland is not and does not intend to be a safe haven for those who wish to evade what is perhaps the most fundamental of responsibilities &mdash; the responsibility towards one's family.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, in principle at least, the Bill will receive support from all sides of the House and I look forward to a good and constructive debate in accordance with the best traditions of the House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's commendations of the Bill will be accepted on this side of the House, and we will cooperate with the speedy passage of this important legislation.  From a reading of the debates in the Lower House it is apparent that the legislation had universal <Col N="859" /> support from all parties and there were very few objections to any of the proposals contained therein.</P>
      <P>The Bill ratifies two important international conventions &mdash; the New York Convention, signed in 1956 and the Rome Convention signed in 1990.  The general intent of these conventions is being given legal effect in the House today, and this is to be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has established simplified procedures under the Bill and they will be put in place with the minimum of bureaucracy, red tape and regulations, which is to be welcomed.  The central authority which is to be established by the legislation is of immense importance. Because of the different ways in which the authority will operate, as outlined by the Minister, it will be possible to proceed with claims without recourse, in large measure, to costly legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Presumably some people will seek legal advice.  There are many legal aid centres throughout the country which will be able to assist those who require advice on these&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, and it is to be welcomed.  In many instances these centres will explain people's rights under this legislation.</P>
      <P>Emigration is one of the great haemorrhages from which the country has always suffered.  Indeed, Ireland has suffered more than most other countries in this respect.  Irish people have emigrated to the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other countries, often on a permanent basis.  The vast majority of men who emigrated and left their wives and families in Ireland continue to support them financially. This legislation will help those wives and families in Ireland who have not been, and continue not to be, supported by men who have emigrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> Some of those men who emigrated have formed other relationships in Britain and Europe, I hope there will be sufficient safeguards for them.  This is not to be recommended but it can and does occur and is a fact of life.  There are many kinds of relationships and it is open to question whether some of the families of those in such relationships are aware of them.  We must ensure that, where there are other relationships, the State will not use this legislation to cause hardship to either the individual concerned or to the other families in foreign countries.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in Britain during the Thatcher years a decision was made to actively pursue husbands who had entered into other relationships and family arrangements. Under the legislation wives were compelled to obtain maintenance orders against their husbands.  Many of these court orders were reported in the national newspapers and on television. Wives were refused money unless these orders were sought and obtained.  Many men had nervous breakdowns or committed suicide and the other family relationships were broken up.  I am not advocating support for people who are irresponsible in the support and maintenance of their wives and families but there must be an element of fair play and justice for people who have entered into other relationships.  Such relationships are often formed when people emigrate to cities and to other countries. If a woman has entered into a relationship with a man in England, that family structure should not be broken down and we must provide the necessary safeguards to ensure that.</P>
    <P>This convention is of enormous importance for us in Ireland because in the past many people did not want to get involved in court proceedings as it was too expensive and they felt it would not be worth the trouble.  This procedure goes a long way towards remedying this defect.  The Bill deals with international conventions and we should see if, in some instances, the need to apply for maintenance orders <Col N="861" /> and a wife bringing her husband to court can be avoided.  From my understanding of the procedures, a deserted spouse must bring a claim of maintenance before she is paid the deserted wife's allowance.  In most cases, spouses have been refused payment unless they made such applications.  Under the New York Convention one does not have to bring an application for maintenance in one's own country, but in Ireland one is not paid the deserted wife's allowance unless an application is brought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the New York Convention it is not necessary to obtain a maintenance order in one's own country <Col N="862" /> but in Ireland for a person to obtain the deserted wife's allowance a maintenance application must be brought.  I will give an example.  A woman in a small town has been deserted by her husband and all her neighbours know this.  She is living with somebody else in the town who may be in a poorly paid job.  She knows he has difficulty financially maintaining the new relationship and she must bring a maintenance application against her husband.  I ask the Minister to look at it because it is causing problems.  I do not know if it would be possible to resolve this.</P>
      <P>This Bill has a great deal to commend it and we support it.  We want to make sure that when there are applications, the persons against whom claims are made will have an opportunity to make sure that they too are treated fairly. Family breakdown is, regrettably, a fact of life.  There are about 55,000 cases of family breakdown in Ireland and a number of these people have entered into other relationships.  I hope that if applications are brought all their incomes will be assessed rather than extreme measures being taken against them in relation to payments because this could cause great problems.  This Bill is significant in that, at long last, wives who have been deserted have redress with the minimum of fuss and red tape.  This is welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>In the day that is in it, it is a little ironic to be addressing the issue of maintenance.  I compliment the Minister on more excellent legislation. As Senator Enright said, there is a common sense approach in the Bill which gives effect to two conventions which help to overcome injustice.  The Bill is part of a package of progressive and humane legislation which the Minister has brought forward.  These have been the hallmarks of his Ministry and I hope he will be in the same Ministry in the weeks and months ahead to steer us through a whole series of other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="863" />
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will be here because he has done an excellent job.  I will not go any further into that matter.</P>
      <P>Both conventions address a form of injustice which has been growing over time and has gone unchallenged.  Breakdown in marital relationships is bad enough but when injury is heaped on insult we all, at a human level, would accept that something seriously needs to be done.  Under the present arrangements, a deserted or separated spouse, whose financially more powerful ex-partner has deserted and gone to another jurisdiction, finds herself &mdash; and we are usually talking about women in these cases &mdash; in an appalling situation. The abandoned spouse in these cases is in an invidious position and unless they have tremendous financial capacity or considerable personal stamina they will not be able to pursue the person who has abandoned them, destroyed their trust and left them and their children in a state of financial impoverishment.</P>
      <P>Although this legislation is short and technical, it is important in terms of expanding economic and social justice and it must be commended on all sides. Under the arrangements introduced as a result of this Bill and through the two conventions, a relatively simple central authority procedure is being put in place to allow the abandoned spouse to seek vindication without having to go through the hoops they previously had to go through.  The strengthening of the law in relation to the recovery of maintenance payments is an objective which every person who has a sense of justice must commend.  The Bill achieves that objective in a sensible way.</P>
      <P>One aspect, which the Minister mentioned in his speech, relates to the requirement of additional provisions to deal with the increasingly common situation of maintenance debtors who have gone to live in other jurisdictions. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on this point because I am not sure what he meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> Not only has this legislation much to commend it but, having read through it, one must ask oneself why it was not put in place before.  It is also a good vindication not just of membership of the EU but of membership of other international bodies.  It also seems to indicate that a tremendous transmission of legal ideas across national boundaries is being undertaken at present.  We have seen the importation of a number of legal ideas over the last 14 years, for example, starting with legislation relating to the Ombudsman.  As the Minister said, we are introducing new terms and concepts into Irish law.  Such cross fertilisation is valuable because our legal system has been narrowly focused on the traditions of our nearest and dearest partner.</P>
    <P>The idea that a central authority can step into the shoes of a creditor is given legal effect in section 7 of the Bill and it is a sensible one.  It will provide real support for the abandoned partner which is not in place at present.  One thing which struck me while the Minister was making his speech was that the model for the central authority, which is provided for in section 7, could be applied elsewhere.  For example, one of the problems in Clonmannon estate in my own constituency is that a number of creditors &mdash; unfortunately they are old age pensioners &mdash; are not able to sustain court actions on their own behalf because they do not have the means or the energy to do so.  The introduction of the model for the central authority to deal on their behalf is valid.  It is an extraordinary coincidence that today I made a submission to the commission, which was established by the Minister for Justice, arguing along those lines.</P>
    <P>Another interesting aspect of the Bill is the section 22 provisions where statutory effect is given to the principle established in the High Court judgment of McC. <i>v.</i> McC.  That was a good piece of judicial law and the Legislature is now following that.  The Minister has used this Bill to good effect to bring a good principle, established and enunciated by the courts, into our legislation. <Col N="865" /> It is one example where the Legislature has followed judicial interpretation.  I welcome the provisions in section 14 (1) which are an intelligent addition to the general provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is interesting because it provides a novel use for technology.  For example, the idea that a live television link up could be used to tape evidence is interesting and a good example of how modern technology can be used in an intelligent way to overcome boundaries of space and time.  It is interesting that a number of years ago University College Dublin used live television link-ups to give lectures to people in Saudi Arabia. If it can be used to give lectures, I do not understand why television and technology cannot be used to humanise and reduce the trauma of a woman seeking justice.</P>
    <P>I welcome unreservedly the provisions in section 15 which are at the heart of the Bill.  The provisions in section 18 which empower the High Court to grant protection in the case of tying down assets is a model which could be used in other circumstances. As we all know, there are grave difficulties when people, who do not have any scruples, can strip assets, thereby denying justice to a creditor, as is envisaged in this situation.  The model for the provisions which the Minister is bringing into law could be more widely used.</P>
    <P>The Minister concluded his comments on this Bill by referring to responsibility towards the family.  Unfortunately and regrettably, there has been a growth of irresponsibility towards families, whether they are formed within the traditional marital arrangements or as a result of partnerships.  It struck me while reading the Bill and listening to the Minister's contribution that we also have another form of separated family, which is too common in this country, where a father has deserted the mother of his children and the children and has left them and the State to pick up the pieces.  One of the commendable aspects of this legislation is that in the context of separation it will not only force the <Col N="866" /> abandoning spouse to face his responsibilities but it will take a financial burden for looking after the abandoned parties off the shoulders of the State.  I am talking in the context of relationships which have produced children and where the man has walked away from that relationship.</P>
    <P>We should also look at some form of central agency to force all fathers &mdash; and we are talking about fathers &mdash; to accept their responsibility.  I know that is outside the scope of this Bill and the Minister's responsibility but it is something which this Government, or the next Government, should address.  In addition to the separated families we are looking at in the context of this legislation, there are, unfortunately and regrettably, a growing number of women who have been abandoned by partners to attend children, and the State, the women and their extended families have had to pick up the costs.  It is time we addressed this issue, although it is beyond the scope of this Bill.  This is fine legislation and it is my pleasure to support it.  I congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has taken a long time to come into this House.  The first time I remember this issue being discussed was when Mrs. Nuala Fennell was Minister for Women's Affairs ten or more years ago. I am glad the Minister has brought it before the House.  It is interesting that the protection of children should be discussed on the same day that inadequate protection of children in another sphere is being discussed in another part of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We constantly talk about how we value and cherish children in this country and how the family is protected under the Constitution yet our children have few rights.  This Bill deals not only with maintenance but with the rights of children to some sort of maintenance from those who have this responsibility; those who brought them into the world and who have left them not only without the emotional support of a father &mdash; in most cases it is the father &mdash; but without financial support.  If a woman is <Col N="867" /> deserted and has no children, it is a great deal easier for her to go out into the world and resume her career, or start a new one.  However, she is in an invidious position if she is left with young children.  Because of our lack of child care facilities, it is almost impossible for her to get a job where she can pay for the care of her children while she is working outside the home.  This Bill is only the first in a series of measures aimed at improving the lot of the children in our State.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche raised an important matter.  This Bill addresses the case of spouses living abroad but I hope the Minister will also consider the serious situation of deserted women in this country who are left with little in the way of maintenance and who find it impossible to have those orders maintained. Usually maintenance awards are low and the rate of defaulters is high.  I strongly urge the Minister to come forward with all the legislation and improvements he proposed to increase the number and funding of free legal aid centres.  I realise he has done some work in this regard but this is such a serious issue that I hope it will be kept at the top of his Department's agenda, which has shown great commitment to introduce some improvement in these long neglected areas.</P>
    <P>The notion that even well off women could go abroad to pursue maintenance orders was ridiculous; indeed, this is what was required before now.  I know of one woman who was married to a lawyer and she said that she gave up pursuing her spouse for maintenance in a foreign court after 14 years.  She said that since the children were 20 and 21 years of age at that stage, what was the point.  She had the money to make representations in a foreign court but what hope is there for the majority of Irish women who are left in a similar situation?</P>
    <P>When this legislation comes into force, I hope those who are making maintenance orders will take the trouble to read the documents produced <Col N="868" /> by the Combat Poverty Agency on the cost of rearing a child.  Sometimes when I look at the maintenance orders awarded by the courts I wonder if the judges have any notion of the cost of a pair of runners, never mind the cost of a school uniform, books, food or the increased amount of maintenance needed as a child grows older.  Are any of these situations ever addressed when these low maintenance orders are made?  I urge anyone making maintenance orders to equip themselves with some sort of realistic costs before they make low maintenance orders.</P>
    <P>My last point concerns the central authority.  The Minister's notion of a central authority looks slightly better than the Child Support Agency in England.  I have been following that agency with some interest because it was brought into effect with more thought for the Treasury than the child. I understand what Senator Roche is saying. Some 13,000 deserted wives and 22,000 deserted children here are currently claiming maintenance, which naturally puts a huge cost on the Treasury. However, I do not think it is too grudgingly borne.  Most people are appalled by the situation in which these women find themselves.</P>
    <P>Around Christmas, all of us like to go out and do our various piece of Christmas goodness.  I remember going to a house of a deserted wife during that period a few years ago.  There was nothing in the front room, apart from a huge motorbike under a bedspread. When I went into the kitchen to leave the gifts I had brought for this lady, I accidentally burst a bag of peanuts.  She did not even have proper cups into which we could put them.  The abject poverty in which she was living was unbelievable.  I do not think anyone would begrudge that woman, or any woman like her, proper maintenance award.</P>
    <P>I am rather pleased &mdash; I must confess to some socialist leanings here &mdash; that Britain's target driven Child Support Agency had to be given another £70 million to improve its administration <Col N="869" /> last year.  I do not want to see fathers tortured to death by paying increased amounts of money they cannot afford but I hope the interest of the child will be of paramount importance to this agency and that it will ensure adequate maintenance for these children.  Not all those children are deserted by penniless fathers; many of them are deserted by well off men.  Private responsibility in this issue is as important as public responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Archbishop of Canterbury was obliged to berate the Conservative Party &mdash; I am delighted he is coming here tomorrow and is being given a reception by the Taoiseach.  Even he was brought into the Conservative Party controversy.  At last year's Conservative Party Conference, several of their Ministers seemed to imply that lone mothers were the cause of the current financial downfall of the United Kingdom.  I do not see anything like that being suggested here.  Fortunately, our spirit of generosity towards those in real disadvantage is too high.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will do something about the free legal aid centres, which are vital.  I also hope he can ensure adequate maintenance orders are awarded.  I know that is not within the Minister's remit because he cannot interfere with the Judiciary, but he can certainly make his feelings known.  I hope our central authority will be child centred rather than Exchequer centred.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and warmly welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am always delighted to be present when the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is here.  To be party political, the emphasis the Labour Party has placed on that issue is significant as is evident by the very fine legislation the Minister has brought before this House, each and every part of it badly needed.  I take this opportunity &mdash; in case we do not get another chance &mdash; to thank the Minister for providing law centres in Cavan and Monaghan which <Col N="870" /> were badly serviced before this in terms of free legal aid.</P>
      <P>The benefit this Bill will give to spouses and partners is immeasurable. Whatever the official number of separated couples in this country, the higher unofficial number shows that this legislation is badly needed.  I work as a solicitor and every day I see examples of cases where deserted wives, in the main, come to me asking what they can do.  If the legislation on ordinary maintenance orders in this jurisdiction could be simplified, all the better.  Some spouses and partners may now be willing their partners to go abroad to avail of this legislation; it may be simpler than what they have to face at home.  At present spouses who are left at home to carry the can, to look after their children, their schooling, etc. have to cope with the breakdown of their marriage and then find themselves being hauled through the court system in a none too friendly fashion.</P>
      <P>I live and work on the Border.  The absconding of a spouse or partner to Northern Ireland is an everyday fact of life.  I accept that the convention allows for chasing them under the previous legislation to which the Minister referred, but it does not make it easy for any spouse or partner to chase their spouse whom they may not want to chase but have to in order to achieve the necessary maintenance and to keep the bread on the table.  It is a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been thought out.  It is not often you see a Bill that deals so comprehensively with every possible situation and aspect.  When I read legislation dealing with various matters I often ask &ldquo;But what if?&rdquo;  However, every time I asked &ldquo;What if?&rdquo;  when reading this Bill, the question was covered.  It is a job well done.  While being comprehensive, the Bill also manages to remain within the subject matter. I have a personal dislike of seeing little sneaking sections at the end of a Bill which are unrelated to the title.  I commend this Minister for sticking to the topic in hand and for dealing with it <Col N="871" /> in such a comprehensive fashion.  It is very practical.</P>
    <P>We often see changes in our law that really make little difference on the ground because the people who need to know about it do not, and the people who do know about it cannot afford to do anything.  Such situations are much too complicated and unworkable.  In this case the Bill introduces a simplified system in terms of conventions.  It sounds complicated but the administrative procedures provided for in the Bill appear to be workable.  It is marvellous that the law is being made workable for those who need it.  That is something of which we, as legislators must always take account because we all too easily pass legislation in both Houses, yet fail to see how it will actually translate for those who need it.  This Bill does that.  The administrative provisions are practical and will work well.</P>
    <P>Allowing the District Court to deal with the maintenance aspect of a High Court order is good and practical. Allowing the District Court to recognise and enforce orders made in foreign countries is another practical aspect. Section 15, allowing an Irish claimant to make a sworn deposition before the District Court and to let that go abroad, is also practical.  The Bill facilitates people in awkward situations in the best way the law can.  That is something I welcome.</P>
    <P>It has already been mentioned that the Bill obviously saves the taxpayer money.  However, I would not agree with an earlier contribution suggesting that we should be wary of not burdening the &ldquo;poor&rdquo; father with having to maintain two families.  I am strong on honouring one's responsibilities and any adult in this country must do that.  It is something that we fail to do in many cases and Irish people are not good at that.  We need to be taught our civic and personal responsibilities.  In saying that I may sound like an old granny but it is most important that when you have parented a child the responsibility is yours and you must realise that.  I welcome <Col N="872" /> anything the State can do to enforce that responsibility and have no qualms about it.</P>
    <P>When we talk about this Bill we refer in the main to women spouses; the woman taking the application to court, etc.  Real equality will have been achieved when we stop talking about women claiming maintenance, and when it is not automatic to think it is only women we are talking about.  That day often seems a long way off but legislation like this will ensure that those who are placed in a disadvantaged situation, having no independent income, will at least be facilitated as far as possible to obtain the necessary funding to carry on their responsibilities which a spouse or partner has reneged on.</P>
    <P>This legislation may appear complicated at first sight but it is practical.  I hope the Minister or the Government of the day would take it upon itself to provide a simplified explanation of what the Bill does.  A leaflet or pointer system is required that could be widely publicised and distributed so that people would know what the law provides.  It is all very well for us to talk about that here, but people generally need to know what this law does.  While I have faulted Bills that have come before the House on previous occasions.  I cannot fault this one.  I commend the Minister on his marvellous work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister.  It was one of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women of which I was a member, so I am pleased to see the Minister bringing forward another of the commission's recommendations. The main problem with the maintenance procedure seems to be the difficulties in enforcing maintenance orders.  The results of a recent survey of maintenance applications under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, gives useful information on how ineffectual and limited the maintenance system is in supporting dependent spouses and children. <Col N="873" /> It shows the low level of maintenance awards and the high rate of default.  In the majority of cases the amount of maintenance awarded was less than the lowest social welfare payments.  In fact, many women would be much better on the deserted wives allowance, which is now called the lone parents allowance, than they would be receiving maintenance.</P>
      <P>The recent survey by Peter Ward also showed that maintenance was not paid regularly in 87 per cent of cases; in 28 per cent of cases there was no record of any payment ever having been made and in 49 per cent of cases they were in arrears of six months or more.  The enforcement of maintenance awards was an issue the commission addressed. It looked at the limited remedies available to enforce the payment of court orders for maintenance.  The remedies consist of imprisonment or the attachment of earnings, neither of which is ideal.  Imprisonment may be the answer where there are not sufficient assets to pay but, if there is deliberate default, it is difficult for women to force men to pay maintenance orders.  Generally speaking, if there are no assets and a man is imprisoned, then there are no resources by which he can pay the maintenance order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A form of automatic enforcement was recommended by the commission which looked at the system in existence in the province of Manitoba in Canada.  That programme, which seems to work well, has a computerised system for monitoring maintenance payments.  All amounts enrolled in the programme are automatically monitored by the computer and in the event of the maintenance not being paid, enforcement proceedings are immediately initiated.  It is not necessary for the woman to initiate the enforcement proceedings herself.  That is one of the difficulties here because women do not have the wherewithal to enforce the maintenance proceedings. The usual action taken in Canada is the <Col N="874" /> attachment of the man's earnings.  As last resort, the debtor can be summoned before the Master of the Family Division of the Court of the Queen's Bench where he is required to show cause why he has not paid.  The system is obviously effective because 85 per cent of order registered are collected.  The system operates quickly because any default detected within ten days after the payment is due and enforcement proceedings are commenced immediately. The reason for the success of the Manitoba system depends, in part, on the fact that the maintenance creditor &mdash; usually the woman &mdash; does not have to institute the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if the State could play an active part in ensuring that the money due on maintenance orders is paid promptly.  The State itself would benefit financially because women who do not collect money through maintenance are, in effect looking to the State to support them.  As well as deserted wives, unmarried mothers are also entitled to apply for payment under the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>If the State ensured that the father and a child pays maintenance it could encourage fathers to take an interest in the welfare, upbringing and education of their children which they might otherwise neglect.  If they have to pay child maintenance, they will probably maintain an interest in the child.  It is important to realise that fathers should have rights as well as responsibilities. We should not just look at his financial responsibilities but at his maintenance of emotional links with the children. This is very important.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women looked at the role of the father.  In this country, 75 per cent of potential claimants are in receipt of unmarried mother's allowance, not lone parent's allowance.  The father not cohabiting with the mother and child.  This makes the Irish experience fundamentally different from that <Col N="875" /> other countries.  In Denmark, for instance, where the non-marital birth rate is much higher than here, most children are brought up in households in which both the father and mother are present.  In most cases in this country, the father does not pay any child support and therefore does not have any financial responsibility for the child.  In many cases this may lead to the father not having any contact with his child.</P>
    <P>Available data from Australia tends to reinforce the link between maintenance or support payments by the father and long term contact.  In cases of divorce, men who pay child support are more likely to maintain contact with their children.  This is a very important point.  There is no point in generalising, but two interested and caring parents must be better for any child than only one.</P>
    <P>In this country, it seems likely that many women apply for the lone parent's allowance rather than look for maintenance from the father because if they receive lone parent's allowance they are sure they will be paid every week.  If a mother looks for maintenance and the father defaults, she must then engage in a long procedure, she must try to have the arrears paid and to have the payment re-established.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women recommended that some form of procedure should be instituted by the State and I ask the Minister, while complimenting him and welcoming the Bill before us today, to look into this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this debate. I appreciate the general welcome they gave to this legislation.  Although it contains many provisions of a technical nature, the Bill's essential purpose is straightforward.  The Department of Social Welfare estimates that over 3,000 families in the country are dependent on <Col N="876" /> social welfare because the so-called breadwinner has chosen to emigrate rather than face up to his or her family responsibilities.  While the Bill has been drafted in a gender neutral manner, there is no doubt that the principal beneficiaries of the measure which I have outlined will be women who have been deserted by their husbands.</P>
      <P>A number of points were made by Senators.  The free legal aid system was referred to and I wish to report to the House that enormous improvements in that service have been brought into being since this Government took office: the number of people working for the free legal aid service has doubled since this Government took office, 16 new centres have been opened and now, for the first time, there is a law centre operating in every county.  I am pleased to report that huge increase.  I hope to make improvements in the family mediation service.  Substantially increased funds have been provided for counselling and all these things are on the advance since this Government took over.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the central authority.  I can assure Senator Enright and others that I am most anxious that red tape be avoided to the greatest extent possible.  The central authority which operates already in my Department on the child abduction issue works extremely well without red tape.  It works very efficiently and the whole concept is a very user friendly one.  The information is given to the central authority, the work is done in the central authority of the other country involved; likewise we take action here when information is received.  The emphasis is on simplification and speeding up the procedures and on avoiding the necessity of incurring substantial legal costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the level of maintenance awards being made in the District Court.  I do not want to comment too much on that; it is for the District Judges who are supposed <Col N="877" /> to assess &mdash; and I have no reason to suppose that they do otherwise &mdash; to the best of their ability the information on the financial situation of both spouses in the cases that come before them.  They have to take into account the means of the respondent, usually the husband.  The saying is that you cannot get blood out of a stone.  All factors must be taken into account and there is an appeals procedure if the amount is inadequate.</P>
    <P>A much more difficult aspect of the matter is the actual recovery of the amount that is awarded.  That has been and continues to be a problem, but I would remind Senators that this very issue is being addressed in the Family Law Bill which is at present before the other House.  In that Bill I am proposing to take on board one of the key measures recommended by Peter Ward to improve that situation, that is, to make an attachment of earnings order the norm when the initial order is being made so that it is not necessary to come back to the District Court a second time to have earnings attached in the event of default in the payments on the initial occasion.  That was one of his main recommendations and it is already in draft form in the Family Law Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the Manitoba legislation referred to by Senator Honan, I will consider that but the State is already very involved in the monitoring of maintenance payments in an appreciable category of cases.  I am not quite sure what proportion of maintenance cases it would be, but in a pretty substantial proportion the payments are directed by the court to be made through the District Court Clerk.  That is a common form of order.  Then the District Court Clerks in the family law offices who do such wonderful work in this regard automatically monitor the payments coming in and in the event of default will immediately issue attachment proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> The range of proceedings is there; there is considerable room for improvement and many possible improvements are being addressed in the Family Law Bill and, of course, I will keep those procedures under review at all times. Finally, I thank Senators again for their warm welcome to this measure which will improve matters so far as foreign recovery is concerned.</P>
