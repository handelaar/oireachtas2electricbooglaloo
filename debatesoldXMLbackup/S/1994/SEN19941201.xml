      <P>I have notice from Senator Dardis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to maintain the acute and surgical services provided by Naas Hospital, to reopen beds which have been closed at the hospital and to appoint a full time consultant physician.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Dardis as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will order extra business in anticipation of a report which is due in the Library this morning.  Today's Order of Business is Item 1, which will be taken between now and 1.30 p.m.; Items 2 and 3, all Stages, between 1.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. and Item 4, between 5.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  I suggest that from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we take statements on the Attorney General's report.  I suggest that there be time limits on certain aspects of the Order of <Col N="926" /> Business: 30 minutes for each speaker on Items 2 and 3, 15 minutes thereafter and ten minutes per speaker on the statements.  I understand the Taoiseach will contribute to the statements, either at the start or the conclusion.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Leader has recognised the importance and gravity of the report which I am told is about to be made available by the Attorney General on matters relating to his office and which are central to the present crisis of confidence in the acting Government.  I am glad he is making time available for this today.  I was going to propose that we take Item 26 in our name which deals with the same subject, but we will need time to read the report. I am happy that today's business is being reordered so that the most important question facing the public can be discussed where it should be discussed, that is, in the Houses of Parliament. I also ask the Leader of the House to ensure that copies of this report are made available as quickly as possible so that all Members will have time to study it in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Standing Orders, it is possible for us, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to invite the Attorney General to address the House. The Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, has dealt with the matters expeditiously and thoroughly during the past week.  His integrity and competence are universally accepted in the short time he has been in office.  It would be appropriate and useful if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could meet immediately after the Order of Business to discuss if the Attorney General, the one person whose credibility is not in question, could be invited to the House this evening to report to the Members on his findings.  It would be a big step towards establishing full openness and transparency.  It is within our powers, under reviewed Standing Orders, to invite a person of distinction to address the House and to ask him to take questions. The sooner the matters in the Attorney General's Office are in the <Col N="927" /> open, the better for everyone in this House, in politics and in this country. What better place to do that than in this House?</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to take on board my suggestions and to convene a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that a formal decision may be made to invite the Attorney General to come before the House this evening.  He has nothing to fear or hide and we have a great deal to learn from what he has to tell us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be put on the record of the House that it is regrettable and contemptible that a report, which has once again been selectively leaked to the press, should be unavailable to elected public representatives.  This morning I contacted the Attorney General's Office, the Taoiseach's Office, the Library of the House and various other groups and I was told that this report, which is mentioned in all today's newspapers, will not be available to public representatives until 1 o'clock.  I also contacted the Cathaoirleach's Office earlier this morning with a view to having the business of the House suspended to discuss this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Leader's proposal to meet my demands in this regard because we need to air this issue. I also recognise that by putting forward this proposal I am reacting to media reports.  We have been treated with contempt. This is no way to run a democracy. I want to hear someone trying to defend this attempt to keep us in the dark.  This lack of information does not translate into transparency, and that is unacceptable to the population.  I would like to know what is going on.  I look forward to the Taoiseach's explanation this evening and the sooner that is done the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader's proposals are reasonable in the circumstances because it is essential that we discuss this matter.  I would have preferred a debate but, at least, the Leader has provided time for statements.  Matters of such gravity are increasingly being discussed in the newspapers, on television, on radio and in every forum except in the Parliament.  On several occasions I expressed the view that a marked lack of democracy was creeping into both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is a matter of concern.  When we debated the Taoiseach's resignation, I expressed the hope that it would bring us back to true accountability and democracy, which is at the core of this request to the Leader. The overworked word &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; has been devalued by the way it has been used during the past couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>As to the time arrangements the Leader has proposed, may I point out to him that if the Taoiseach speaks for 30 minutes, there would only be an hour remaining and only six Members could speak.  It is essential that all shades of opinion in this House be reflected in that debate and from that point of view, the proposed arrangement is not satisfactory. If the Progressive Democrats were not able to contribute to that debate by reason of the time arrangements, I would regard it as a serious matter.</P>
      <P>It is also not acceptable that we should be asked to take all Stages of Item 2, the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, today given that there is considerable controversy involved.  In the Dáil two weeks ago, an attempt was made to take all Stages at the one time without debate.  Thankfully, it was not successful. It is wrong that all Stages should be taken here today, especially given that Report Stage was only taken in the Dáil yesterday.  I do not see how we can bring forward any amendments that can be of any value when Report Stage was taken yesterday in the Dáil and we are being asked to debate all Stages today.  I ask the Leader to reconsider his proposal in respect of Item 2.</P>

      <P>We welcome the opportunity to debate the Attorney General's report in this House this evening.  As Senator Manning said, it is appropriate that it is discussed in a House of the Oireachtas.  I also welcome the fact that the report has been produced so speedily and efficiently.  It is in the public interest that we have information as soon as possible as to what exactly did occur over recent months in the Office of the Attorney General.  I also support the call that we should have copies of the report as soon as possible so that we will have an opportunity and the time needed to consider it.</P>
      <P>As to Senator Manning's suggestion about inviting the Attorney General to the House, I do not know if that is covered under the legislation to which he referred but I would certainly be in favour of investigating it.</P>

      <P>The time allotted for the discussion of this report &mdash; an hour and a half &mdash; is not adequate.  I want to contribute to the debate.  I understand this report was discussed by the Cabinet yesterday.  If that is the case, why is the Taoiseach's Office saying that the Cabinet members want to peruse it further? Is it the case, as was previously mentioned here, that, like the beef tribunal, the selective points the Fianna Fáil Party want the public to know and think about will be leaked?</P>

      <P>I am delighted time has been provided to discuss the report from the Office of the Attorney General. For Senator Manning to suggest that people of stature could come into the Seanad is a misrepresentation of what happened at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.

      <P>The current Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, is a man of distinction and enormous integrity and he has established a very fine reputation across this country in a very short time.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning proposed this morning that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would meet after the Order of Business and that the Attorney General would be invited here this evening to take part in the discussion and to answer questions.  I second that proposal because it is very sound and sensible, particularly when &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; is the current buzzword.  If we are to have a real debate or discussion in this House this evening and if we are to have openness and accountability in Government, surely there will not be any difficulty in bringing in the Attorney General.  I believe he would be very readily available if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges take that decision.  I ask you, Sir, to join with Senator Manning in coming to that conclusion at your meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>I want to make a point, however.  I will not come into this House and be lectured by Senator Sherlock of all people on the issue of democracy.  He belongs to a party which only recently left its balaclavas behind.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I also agree with the suggestion that was made here that it will be important for all parties and for people from all parties to contribute to the fullest extent in the debate.  I ask the Leader of the House to consider the point made by Senator Dardis in the event of the debate being somewhat truncated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> I agree with Senator Dardis' point about the regional technical college legislation.  A man who is not in this House or the other House has been subject to the most unprincipled allegations over the last few weeks; he has been tried by allegation.  It will not be possible in the time available to discuss all the issues arising from the Letterkenny regional technical college issue here.  If we cannot discuss it in the context of this Bill, I ask that we would lay time aside at an early date for the full issue to be discussed because matters of justice are concerned here.  We cannot and should not put a time limit on that.</P>

I thank those who agreed with the proposal for statements at 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I want to assure everyone in the House that all parties will have the opportunity to contribute. If Taoiseach speaks for a certain length and that disrupts the agreed times, the House will make arrangements to ensure that all parties contribute. As regards copies of the report, I will pass on the requests but it is not within my remit to ensure there will be copies for everyone at 1 p.m.</P>
      <P>I will explore the suggestion made by Senator Manning to invite the Attorney General.  If the Cathaoirleach wishes to call a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that is his prerogative. As regards Items 2 and 3, there is more than enough time provided for the debate and for all Stages to be taken today.  If time is needed to prepare amendments, that could be arranged this afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt) Tom Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to explain the implications of Norway's decision not to join the European Union and to refer further to an issue which arose during the Committee Stage consideration of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1994.</P>
      <P>On 28 November, the people of Norway by referendum decided not to join the European Union.  Unlike Austria, Finland and Sweden, therefore, Norway will not become a member of the European Union on 1 January 1995.  I, personally, regret the decision because Ireland's experience has been that it is through the European Union the strongest relationships are forged with our neighbours and friends in Europe. Nonetheless, the decision is the democratically expressed wish of the Norwegian people and must be respected.</P>
      <P>We are aware of some of the reasons so many Norwegians rejected membership through the very intensive opinion poll data which has been made available. Fears of a loss of sovereignty in Norway and perception of a democratic deficit in Europe were among the factors.  There was uncertainty in many Norwegian minds about the possibility of maintaining traditional means of livelihood and concern about the future of the extensive social benefit system, especially as it was perceived to impact on women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Norwegian referendum outcome was the exception in this round of accession, and we will still welcome Austria, Sweden and Finland as members of the European Union, there is a lesson to be learned from the Norwegian referendum process and from the referenda campaigns in all the accession countries.  The President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, summed it up well when he said that &ldquo;nothing is possible without the support of the people&rdquo;.  That is certainly the case in Ireland and for all member states. While we in Ireland have had significant majorities in favour of membership of the Community or Union in the three referenda held to date, the experience <Col N="939" /> of these referenda and the Norwegian result this week is a reminder that support for Europe must be won; it can never be taken for granted.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully conscious of the need to increase European awareness among our citizens.  It was for this reason that the Government launched the Communicating Europe initiative earlier this year.  I was given responsibility for this initiative.</P>
    <P>A major aim of this initiative is to tackle what might be termed the comprehension deficit between the public on the one hand and the institutions, policies and performance of the European Union on the other.  It is evident that even in Ireland, where there is strong support for the European Union, as evidenced in the three referenda to date, and where the benefits of European Union membership are tangible, there is still a sense that the Union is an unknown quantity for many.</P>
    <P>As Senators are no doubt aware earlier this year I established a task force to assist and advise me as to the best strategy to follow in communicating Europe to the people.  The task force, which I have chaired, engaged in extensive consultations with a wide range of interest groups and I am pleased to inform the Seanad that its report is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.  I am confident that the strategy mapped out by the task force will have a significant impact in helping to ensure that the policies of the European Union are better known and understood.  My overall objective is to raise public awareness of European issues and in the process to ensure the retention of the traditionally high level of support for Europe in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, it is the case that, unlike Norway which has to a degree been insulated from the vagaries of the world economy, Ireland has to a large extent seen the benefits of being at the table and having an input into the rules that govern much of our economic, social and political activity.  We have seen the range of benefits that the European <Col N="940" /> Union has brought to us through the CAP and the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>While the Norwegian referendum result will have a resonance in each country of the European Union there is no doubt that the increasingly close relations between Norway and the European Union and between Norway and the member states of the Union will continue to develop and flourish.  The European Economic Area Agreement, to which Norway is a party, remains in place.  This has given Norway access to the Single European Market of the Union.  On a bilateral basis Norway and Ireland will remain Atlantic neighbours and will continue to have many interests and concerns in common.</P>
    <P>The most immediate issue that must be addressed by the European Union is the adjustment of the Treaty of Accession for Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria to take account of the fact that Norway will not become a member of the European Union.  None of the provisions of the accession Treaty negotiated with Norway can now apply.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a precedent for non-accession following the signing of an accession treaty.  It will be recalled that Norway was unable to ratify the accession Treaty of 1972 which provided for the accession of Ireland, the United Kingdom and Denmark to the EEC.  On that occasion a Council decision was taken which provided for adjustments of the Treaty or allowed provisions of the Treaty to lapse.</P>
    <P>In Article 2 of the accession Treaty, providing for the accession to the European Union of Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway, the European Union addressed the possibility that not all the accession countries would be in a position to ratify the Treaty by 31 December 1994 as required.  The Treaty provides that in the event of an accession country being unable to ratify, the Council of the European Union, acting unanimously, is permitted to make the necessary technical adjustments to the accession Treaty to take account of this.  It will not be necessary to renegotiate the Treaty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> As Norway will not now proceed with membership of the European Union the necessary adjustments will have to be made to the accession Treaty to take account of this.  For example, Title I of the accession Treaty provides for 15 members of the European Parliament, and three votes in Council for Norway and stipulates that there will be 21 members of the Commission.  These provisions, and others, having institutional implications will have to be adjusted.</P>
    <P>Title II of the accession Treaty provides for transitional measures specifically concerning Norway covering free movement of goods, persons, services and capital as well as fisheries, external relations and customs union and financial and budgetary provisions.  These provisions and any relevant annexes and Protocols will have to be adjusted, or they will be allowed to lapse, to take account of the fact that Norway will not become a member of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Council legal services in Brussels will, within the next few days, provide member states with a report covering all aspects of the implications for the accession Treaty of Norway's decision to stay outside the European Union.  It is envisaged, at this stage, that the Council will take a single unanimous decision which would have the effect of making the appropriate adjustments to the accession Treaty.  It is also envisaged that this decision will take effect on 1 January, 1995.</P>
    <P>The decision by Norway not to join the European Union does not affect Ireland's ratification process.  Ireland's ratification involves, <i>inter alia</i>, an amendment to the European Communities Acts, 1972 to 1993 and passage through the Dáil of a resolution approving the terms of the Accession Treaty. As Senators are aware, the motion approving the accession Treaty was adopted by the Dáil on 26 October and the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1994, passed all Stages in the Dáil on 22 November and has reached Report Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> The European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1994, contains the title of the accession Treaty signed in Corfu on 24 June 1994.  Although the accession Treaty will be adjusted to take account of the fact that Norway will not become a member of the European Union, the title of the accession Treaty, as signed, will not be adjusted.  Thus, the title of the accession Treaty, providing for the accession of four new member states to the European Union will remain the same as the title of the accession Treaty in the European Communities (Amendment) Bill before us. No adjustment to the Bill or to Ireland's national ratification procedures will be required.</P>
    <P>A question arose on Committee Stage as to why the term &ldquo;European Communities&rdquo; is used in the last line of paragraph (r) in section 1 (1) of the Bill.  I wish to explain the use of this term.  The purpose of the Bill is to make the new accession Treaty part of the domestic law of the State in so far as it is necessary to do so in order to enable the State to adhere to its obligations under that Treaty.  Austria, Finland and Sweden, by becoming members of the European Union, are also acceding to the three original communities of that union, which are: the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Community &mdash; formerly the European Economic Community &mdash; and the European Atomic Energy Community.  These three communities are collectively called the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Although the accession countries are joining not just the European Communities but the European Union, the accession Treaty only needs to be made part of the domestic law of this State in so far as it relates to the European Communities.  This is what section 1 (1) (r) of the Bill says.</P>
    <P>This is consistent with the fact that under the Treaty on European Union as it stands, and the three pillar structure that it established, only measures taken under the first pillar &mdash; the Communities pillar &mdash; have been made part of the domestic law of the State.  The other two <Col N="943" /> pillars established under the Treaty on European Union, the Maastricht Treaty, and that make up the Union structure &mdash; justice and home affairs and common foreign and security policy &mdash; were not made part of the domestic law of the State in 1992 by the required amendment to the European Communities Act, 1972, as amended.  The same policy was followed in our legislation to give effect to our obligations under the Single European Act in 1987.</P>
    <P>That clarifies the issue raised on Committee Stage.  &ldquo;European Communities&rdquo; refers to domestic legislation. The other two pillars &mdash; the common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs &mdash; relate to intergovernmental relations between the members of the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has clearly explained that this Bill introduces to domestic law the first pillar of sections of EU legislation which deal with the communities.  There is nothing controversial in the Bill.  However, it is disappointing that, since we last discussed this Bill at the committee, Norway has decided not to become part of the EU.  Any independent sovereign state is entitled to make such a decision and a strong democratic decision was taken in Norway by the vote of the people.  We respect that decision but we must look at the situation as it now stands.  The Minister outlined some of the issues that should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the most serious long term repercussions for the EU as a result of Norway taking a decision not to join will be the security and defence aspect which comes up for discussion in 1996. Norway has a strategic geographical location in EU terms, particularly since one of its closest neighbours is Russia. This is a serious factor which must be closely examined at EU level.  Norway is a member of NATO and there will be repercussions in that area also.  We must examine the implications this may have for long term European security.  I hope the Minister and his Department will <Col N="944" /> examine this important issue in the months ahead as there is not much time before it comes up for discussion.</P>
    <P>We must learn something from Norway and the reasons it took a decision not to join the EU.  Fisheries was one of the central areas of controversy, given the dissatisfaction Norway felt with overall EU fisheries policy and how it would affect its fishing industry and its economy.  As an island nation which has claimed since 1972 that we did not get what we required in the negotiations at that time or subsequently in terms of the fishing industry, there is an onus on us at all times to fight for Ireland's fishing industry by promoting it and trying to secure a better deal.  It is a controversial issue and the Norwegian people took a specific line because of EU fisheries policy.  This should not go unnoticed at EU level.  It gives Ireland a stronger arm in terms of arguing its position, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Spanish position in particular, within the EU on fishing agreements and policies.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing the development of a most serious situation in the former Yugoslavia, particularly in the town of Bihac which the Serbs are attacking. There is huge controversy between NATO, the UN and the US.  This debate is an opportunity for us to express our dissatisfaction with America's stand on this issue.  It voted in favour of a UN Security Council resolution but has subsequently acted differently by passing a resolution that arms should be provided to the Bosnians.  Clearly, if that line continues to be taken, the definite message will go out to the former Yugoslavia that war is deemed the alternative to the peace process.  I hope the Minister will take every opportunity to castigate America's actions in this matter. Certain EU members are expressing firm views as regards what should take place there but it is regrettable that the EU as a whole does not appear able to act.  We should remember that we are talking about fellow Europeans and we have responsibilities to them.  Our commitment to our European neighbours <Col N="945" /> outside the Union is not as strong as it should be.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, given an expanded European Union with great economic and political power, that we cannot collectively do something to protect, assist and bring peace to that war torn part of Europe.  I hope the Minister in the course of meetings in Europe and elsewhere will encourage greater cohesion on issues which affect the broader Europe.  The EU should act responsibly in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not controversial.  We regret Norway's decision but we must examine closely why it was taken.  In examining it we may find that the Norwegians felt they were facing too bureaucratic an institution with no relevance to national government.  Criticisms have been made about the lack of communication and the relevance of national parliaments to the EU structure. These issues should be included in an examination of the reform of institutions in the EU so that it becomes relevant to all member states.</P>
    <P>While recognising that the responsibility and the onus is primarily on national governments, they must look for greater accountability as to their role in Europe.  The Government should report back in detail to the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, does so on a regular basis &mdash; as the public needs to educated.  This is important if there is to be more cohesion in the EU in the future.  There is a danger that, as the EU expands, it could become more unwieldy and disconnected and that would not be in the interests of any of the member states. We must be vigilant in that regard.  We must learn from Norway's decision which could have serious consequences for the long term security and defence of the EU given Norway's strategic position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  There is a definite sense of paternalism creeping into Europe. The members of the EU have come to think that they have all the answers to <Col N="946" /> all the problems associated with economics, defence and social attitudes in Europe.  As with all cases of paternalism we should not be surprised if, at some stage, the child fights against the perceived paternalism.  In this case the Norwegians have decided that they will fight against their parents, so to speak, because they can stand alone.  Somebody had to stand up, disagree with the EU and tell them they can do things better and live as they are.</P>
      <P>There are implications for Europe beyond economic and defence matters. When we consider the number of countries who greatly desire to join the EU, what will they make of the Norwegians voting against membership?  In a sense Norway will have the best of all worlds: since the economic union will be maintained, it has lost nothing in economic terms.  However, it may lose in the future but I cannot perceive that happening. The Norwegians have contacts giving them access to our markets and we have access to theirs.  Norway would have been a net contributor to the EU.</P>
      <P>With regard to fisheries and agriculture. Norway may have some problems in the future although I cannot see what they might be.  The fishing industry in Europe is in chaos and nobody seems to be able to so anything about it.</P>
      <P>On defence and security, mention has been made of former Yugoslavia.  The attitudes taken by the US, NATO, the Western European Union, France and Britain must all be taken into account because each has its own agenda on European defence.  The Western European Union does not know what it wants to do or how it will reach an accommodation with NATO.  It wants to be in NATO and yet be separate.  We are now observers in the Western European Union and the amount of confusion within that organisation is unbelievable. People talk about a cohesive defence policy in Europe but as long as we have NATO and the competing states of France and Britain &mdash; who consider themselves to be world powers, and they are not &mdash; this confusion will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> Between now and 1996 we will have to decide what our attitude will be on security and defence matters.  We are entering a minefield and I do not know how we will get out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should not use military terms like &ldquo;minefield&rdquo; in the context of defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I once nearly stepped on a mine, but nearly never hurt anyone.</P>
      <P>The fact that Norway will not join the EU but will remain a member of NATO will cause problems in the future, and it is not clear how they will be solved.  I am delighted Austria, Finland and Sweden have decided to join because it makes the EU more cohesive.</P>
      <P>I welcome the passage of the Bill through the House and I am glad we will not need future legislation because of the Norwegian decision.  This Bill covers that eventuality.  I believe Norway was wrong but the EU tried to force that country to join by claiming it was a great institution.</P>
      <P>We can claim credit for some growth within Europe.  Nevertheless, unemployment was the main problem Ireland faced before joining and it has not been addressed by the EU; it is still too high. The EU has created more unemployment than any country or any group in the world; we are not good at anything else and unless we tackle this problem not many countries with a reasonable standard of living and low rates of unemployment will want to join the EU.</P>
      <P>Complicated issues will arise when dealing with the next group of countries which have applied to join the EU.  We must now closely examine them because Norway, which would have been a net contributor to the EU, has now opted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister; I am sure he is glad to be in the calm and civilised waters of the Seanad rather than somewhere else.  He obviously had a civilising influence on us because the <Col N="948" /> atmosphere improved dramatically once he came into the House.</P>
      <P>It is important that Parliament continues to conduct its legislative functions during the present period, albeit that we are in a curious constitutional position. It is important that we deal with the Bill before us, although we have strayed from it.  It is curious that the Bill is progressing through the House at the time when Norway decided not to join the EU, and that it is not amended to take this into account.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's remarks regarding the accession treaties, that they stand, there is no difficulty about them and the enactment of the legislation does not materially affect the outcome of the accession of the other member states or our relations with the EU. However, the legislation should take account of Norway's decision, and this should be done before 1 January 1995.</P>
      <P>I welcome Finland's decision to join the EU in the House.  I am disappointed that Norway has decided, by a very slim majority, not to join, but I recognise the democratic right of the Norwegian people to make their decision and to say No.  If Norway were to join the EU, it would be of benefit to Ireland, just as it is beneficial for us that Sweden, Finland and Austria decided to join, because of the nature of the societies in these countries and given that they are unaligned, are on the periphery and have an identity of interests with Ireland.  It would have greatly improved our capacity to argue our case at European level if all those countries were to join the EU. The fact that one of them is not joining dilutes in some way, but not entirely, the view that it would be beneficial to us to have those countries involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it is, these countries will contribute enormously to the quality of the EU in the years ahead.  Apart from their unaligned nature, and the fact that at least three of them are agricultural and fishing communities similar to us, they have a far better awareness of environmental matters than most of the mainland European countries and they can <Col N="949" /> bring this perspective to bear on the EU, which would be of benefit to us.</P>
    <P>There is little theology involved in the accession treaties and whether the Bill should be amended.  I believe this underlines the point the Minister made earlier regarding the comprehension deficit.  We are getting to the point where the jargon has become impenetrable and it is impossible for the ordinary citizen to understand what is happening. In this respect, I can claim some personal responsibility for contributing to this jargon.  According to the Chairman of the Institute of European Affairs, I am credited with having provided the phrase, &ldquo;comprehension deficit&rdquo; to the lexicon of European jargon. At a meeting of the institute there was much debate about the information deficit and the fact that citizens were not getting information from the EU.  I said it was not a question of a lack of information as there was a deluge of information but rather that people could not understand it and that led to the comprehension deficit.  As one who has been very critical of the jargon, I must claim some responsibility for contributing to this unfortunate growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are proposals to bring the EU to the people. I welcome this and wish the Minister well with regard to this exercise. However, on the day after the result of the European elections, I was annoyed when one of the daily newspapers gave us a lecture in its editorial columns about the fact that European issues were not dealt with by the candidates or the parties in the election, and that the only issues dealt with were Malone <i>v.</i> Guerin, Cox <i>v.</i>  O'Malley, or whatever road show was of interest at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the candidates &mdash; and there were many &mdash; who addressed European issues got no coverage from those papers. I do not criticise them for this; newspapers are interested in news. Nevertheless, if they are interested in news, they should not lecture us the day <Col N="950" /> after the polls close that we have not dealt with the issues when we did address them but did not publish our comments.  To be fair to local radio, this medium dealt in a more substantive way and in more detail with the European issues in the course of that election campaign.</P>
    <P>The question of Bosnia is not relevant to the Bill but it has been alluded to. The current situation is unfortunate; there are difficulties between the EU and America and NATO is involved, but we must not under-estimate the complexity of the issue and to what extent it is acceptable for outside forces to intervene militarily in what is a largely domestic situation.  We are into very difficult areas of international law and it would be easy, on a superficial level, to say this or that should be done. However, the situation is extremely complex, it is unfortunate, it is a human tragedy and obviously the EU and Ireland must do what it can to alleviate that tragedy; it would be unfortunate if we were to rush in blindly.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the strategic importance of Norway and its proximity to Russia.  I think this strategic importance is highly questionable given the changed nature of Russia and the changed nature of international relationships.  In this respect, the balance will shift fairly dramatically to the extent that from a strategic and military viewpoint, the importance of the Nordic countries will diminish somewhat in the future.</P>
    <P>The high participation rate of the electorate in the referenda which were held on the decision to join the EU is notable.  At the Irish Council of the European Movement, the Finnish Ambassador expressed serious disappointment that only 73 per cent of the electorate voted in the Finnish referendum &mdash; we would have been pleased with such a turnout &mdash; and the turnout in Norway was much higher.  There is a great tradition of participative democracy in these countries.  People vote, not by virtue of any compulsion by law, but because they are democracies.  This is <Col N="951" /> another area where they may influence the EU.</P>
    <P>I do not have a serious difficulty with the Bill but it is a little curious, given the Norwegian decision and accepting the Minister's remarks on the accession treaties and the fact that they stand and are not altered, to continue to include the references to Norway.  From a practical viewpoint it would have been preferable to amend the legislation to exclude these references.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis in that the Minister's remarks on the accession treaties are not logical. These treaties deal with those countries which have acceded to the EU, but because this Bill has already been passed by the Dáil it would appear that a decision has been taken not to amend it for the Seanad.  It appears to be a <i>fait accompli</i>, but from a practical viewpoint there is no reason the Bill could not be amended to accord with reality.</P>
      <P>Since the Kingdom of Norway has not acceded to the EU it should be written out of the Bill.  I question an attempt to ignore the views of the Seanad on a Bill, and to ignore the realities of the situation. I question the acting Government bringing the Bill forward as it stands.  I hope this is not an example of things being in written form and therefore, being ignored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clear up this issue.  The Senator has raised a valid point.  We signalled that the Bill was cleverly structured to allow for this to happen.  We anticipated that Norway might not join the EU and always knew this was in the balance.  Everyone appreciates that we were up front in the Dáil and in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister is saying but it does not seem logical. I have a logical mind and am used to seeing what is stated as the position. However, this is not the case here.  The Bill says that Norway is part of the <Col N="952" /> European Union, but this is not the case.  I accept how this has come about, but I am point out that that seems illogical to me and I stand by this.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder Norway did not vote to join the European Union.  It now has the best of both worlds &mdash; this was alluded to by a previous speaker.  It has the benefit of trade and economic links with the EU but, it does not have to contribute in financial terms to the Union and it does not get bogged down in what I consider to be Union's excessive regulations and answering the commands of European institutions.  It does not have to sacrifice its independence in any sense or the high level of individual rights its people have.  I am not surprised it did not join.</P>
      <P>This reflects what Senator Dardis said earlier; it is not often I agree with him. Both of us, having been through a European Parliament election campaign, have a great deal in common in what we have concluded, that is, that there is a great deal of ignorance among the general public as to what is happening in Europe.  I do not blame them for this. Certain groups, clubs and private institutions, etc., receive funding from Europe on the basis of disseminating information.  These people advertise by invitation only and charge fees to attend.  I do not agree with this.  Information must be made available to Mr. and Mrs. Soap and not only to certain people who are invited to these meetings to listen to speakers from the EU. There is a great need for more information. I called for this before and was accused of wanting it during an European election campaign.  Having offices in Molesworth Street or elsewhere is not enough unless EU matters are explained to parliamentarians &mdash; there is a lack of understanding by many of us through no fault of our own.  EU jargon must also be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no real link between this country and the European Parliament. It is crucial that we consider setting up a forum in the Seanad or the EU subcommittee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to allow <Col N="953" /> MEPs to address us on current issues. We read about such issues in newspapers after they happen.  When one hears about regulations or directives having been passed last week on the measurement of bananas &mdash; these are the only things about which we hear &mdash; it is no wonder people are disillusioned and do not vote in elections to the European Parliament.  I have many gripes about the Government's efforts to disseminate information.  Perhaps it has put a system in place but I do not think this is getting through.</P>
    <P>I regret the absence of Norway from the EU.  We will miss what it would have contributed in terms of its advanced system of social welfare, taxation and the rights enjoyed by its women.  Some 50 per cent of its parliamentarians are women; no specific system had to be put in place to achieve this.  Norway is much more advanced in these areas, and has been for centuries.  We would have gained a great deal from its experience. We saw a great example of democracy there.  It had an open debate on EU membership which the people decided on in a referendum.  We will miss its membership in that sense.</P>
    <P>I am glad Finland, Austria and Sweden will be members.  They will be in a position to contribute a great deal to the Union.  I am not thinking in the narrow-minded sense of their being net contributors.  We must examine their systems of democracy and learn from them.  We must examine the advanced individual rights people in these countries have.  I hope that in years to come we will be in a position to learn from them and provide in EU legislation for the introduction to this country of what they have had for years.  I welcome and look forward to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The major change since we last discussed this legislation has been the decision of Norway not to join the EU.  Everybody here has admitted this. The Norwegian people have made their decision.  It is my view that there is the possibility that, at a later stage, should Norway decide to change its views on <Col N="954" /> membership, a mechanism can be put in place to facilitate this.  I hope that the Norwegian people make a different decision in the future.  However, their present decision does not require a change in the legislation.  We have ratified the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and I welcome the Minister's statement that no adjustments to the Treaty or to this legislation are necessary.  This is reasonable and understandable.</P>
      <P>The decision to enlarge the EU from twelve to fifteen member states is important and significant at this time because, in the view of many people, Europe now needs stability to enable it to further develop and strengthen its connections and to enlarge further. Even though the Norwegian decision is a temporary setback, there are countries in Europe which are anxious to join the EU, and it is essential that they do so. As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I recently attended a meeting in Bonn which was addressed by Mr. Helmut Kohl who had just been elected Chancellor of Germany, which has a population of 80 million and is probably the most powerful country in Europe.  He outlined in a very long, detailed and well thought out speech how he thought the EU and Europe in general would evolve over the next number of years. He clearly indicated that the view of Germany and of Europe was that Europe would expand, deepen and strengthen and would create a stability which would enable some of the problems mentioned by Senator Taylor-Quinn to be overcome.  There will be many problems of this nature.  The view of Germany would also be the view of a majority of people in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the EU strengthens as a result of this new enlargement and deepens because of closer economic connections between member states, it will make a significant contribution to the overall prosperity and stability of Europe for the foreseeable future.  In the view of everyone who is looking forward, it will make a major economic impact and will <Col N="955" /> improve the standards of living of millions in Europe as far as the Mediterranean and beyond for the next two or three generations.</P>
    <P>This legislation is timely and will chart the future course of Europe for the next number of decades.  I do not think the impact of Norway remaining outside the Union will be as significant as some commentators might like to suggest.  The fact that Norway is part of the European Economic Area Agreement will to a large extent minimise this impact.  Nevertheless, those who were involved in the negotiations on behalf of Ireland did an excellent job, especially in relation to fisheries.</P>
    <P>A major problem facing fisheries is not Spanish, Norwegian or Danish ports but the stock of species of fish in the Community which is under threat from over-fishing and from the lack of a proper management regime.  If anything damages international fisheries in the future it will be the failure of communities, such as the European Union or the enlarged European Economic Area, to deal with the huge problem of over-fishing and the over exploitation of resources which need the opportunity to be replenished.  The damage done to fisheries in the Irish Sea as a result of over-fishing is well documented and highlighted.  The damage being done to some of our unique fisheries in the south-west, such as hake fishing, through over-fishing and poaching by Spanish boats in particular, is something to which all the countries in EFTA must pay more attention in the future.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that in the regime worked out with Norway we will not have the benefit of the Norwegian expertise and the research work done in Norway in relation to fisheries.  Nevertheless, we will be able to deal with this in the future.  I compliment those involved in the negotiations with Norway as regards EU enlargement.  We had a good deal in Ireland and one which would have benefited our industry, particularly in relation to further <Col N="956" /> opportunities for employment in the fishing business.</P>
    <P>There are many opportunities in the aquaculture industry.  I would like the Marine Institute to work more closely with Norwegian researchers to see how they have managed to create employment from a resource which is as scarce in Norway as it is here.</P>
    <P>We have a unique opportunity in Ireland because of our key location, especially in the enlarged Union, to play an ever increasing part in the development of our fishing business.  I hope the Marine Institute and those involved in the Department of the Marine will avail of this opportunity in the enlarged Union to open up new markets and to introduce techniques for developing the business, especially aquaculture, because this will create more jobs in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who expressed a view about transparency &mdash; a word which is abused at present.  My own view is that until such time as we decide to have 15 single seats, smaller constituencies where individual Members of Parliament will represent that constituency and a transferable vote in the system, there will continue to be a gap between what is taking place in Europe and what people are familiar with at home.</P>
    <P>I would remind people that one of our best Members of the European Parliament, Mr. Paddy Lane, lost his seat in the European elections because people were not fully aware of the important work he did.  I want to express my appreciation for the work he did in the Parliament and for his achievements there.  However, it is regrettable that someone like Mr. Paddy Lane, who worked hard in Europe and was able to achieve a lot there, could not get reelected. This highlights the necessity for more communication.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, earlier this year and by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs to provide funding to initiate movement in that direction so that information on Europe would be <Col N="957" /> more readily available.  That was a success and I would like to see it continued.</P>
    <P>Those who look at developments in Europe see that we are now entering a new era which will have a dynamic impact across a range of economic activities, especially employment and job creation.  In that respect, it is important to keep a close eye on our economy because we can deal with these matters ourselves.  We must ensure that we keep our inflation rates low, watch our balance of payments, reduce our unemployment levels and keep our borrowing under control.  We do not want to see &mdash; and it is important to emphasise this today &mdash; Ireland relegated to a second tier in a two speed Europe.  The enlargement of the European Union is now bringing in more prosperous countries and wealthy economies and there is a real danger that we will be relegated to a second grade.  This would be detrimental to Ireland and our economy.  Although we now have great opportunities, we must be fully aware of the responsibilities this places on us. During the next few years we must ensure that our economy is soundly managed and that we have a good Government so that we keep Ireland in top gear, as we have been in since we joined the European Union.  We must continue, as we have done in the past, to play a leading role in the developing European Union.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate because it is important to deal with this issue.  The Senators have facilitated the passage of this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. This process of ratification is not only happening in Ireland and in the 12 member states but in the 15 member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Members' regret that Norway did not choose to join the European Union but that is its democratic decision.  I also agree with those who said the Norwegians would have brought many positive elements to the <Col N="958" /> development of the European Union. However, we have means of continuing our links with Norway, both bilaterally and through the European Economic Area Agreement.  Senator Lanigan correctly pointed out that Norway will not miss out in the short term, but there will be drawbacks in the long term.  I participated in the lengthy discussions during the enlargement negotiations and we dealt with the question of access to markets as regards fishing.  I am conscious that we made gains in many areas, as did Norway in the long term, but it must deal with customs, which those of us in the European Union will not have to do.</P>
    <P>I understand the concerns expressed by Senator Dardis and Senator Gallagher about the technical nature of the Bill.  I said earlier that the Bill was cleverly prepared to allow for this situation and I agree that we should try to make changes to facilitate the reality.  I made the point when bringing this Bill before the House and the Dáil committee that not only Ireland but all other member states of the European Union were conscious this might happen.  Certain procedures were laid out which we could follow if the people of one country decided not to join.</P>
    <P>The most important point is that we ratify it before the end of December and this problem is not peculiar to Ireland.  We have an impasse because we have an acting Government.  I appreciate that the Seanad was able to take this Bill because I was concerned that we would not be able to do so when I heard the debate this morning.  It is important legislation.  Other countries still have to ratify this measure and each member state, as well as the three new states, must do as we are doing today.  If this happens &mdash; and we must wait and see &mdash; then the three states will become members on 1 January 1995.</P>
    <P>In understanding the points made by Senator Dardis and Senator Gallagher on the logic of it all, we are bringing in the same kind of procedures as other member states of the European Union and Finland, Sweden and Austria.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> Members mentioned the question of providing the people with communication about Europe.  My report is ready for publication.  There are many exciting new proposals and, hopefully, we will get a chance to deliver, some aspects relate to points that were raised in this debate.  There is also the question of education.  We must get the message across to our younger people that there is an important debate with regard to Europe that needs to be addressed.  I can assure Members that part of the focus on the communicating about Europe strategy will be on the schools.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the European Parliament.  Members of the European Parliament are entitled to come to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, and they often do.  I agree that we must not keep this debate within our own politicians and experts. I am keen &mdash; and this is part of the communicating about Europe strategy &mdash; to bring this debate to the people; Senator Gallagher and other Members mentioned that.  Senators will be satisfied when they see the final recommendations in this report; it is almost ready for publication.</P>
    <P>I especially thank the House for facilitating the passage of this legislation before the end of the year.</P>

Tá a fhios agaibh an riachtanas atá ag baint leis an mBille, go háirithe i gcúrsaí Choláiste Réigiúnach Leitir Ceannain.

      <P>I am glad the House has agreed to take all Stages of these Bills, especially those aspects which are so necessary in the context of restoring the operation at Letterkenny regional technical college back to where it desperately needs to be.  I am grateful to all Members for the opportunity to debate and conclude all Stages of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, came into effect on 1 January 1993, bringing into existence on that date 12 new statutory based institutions. This legislation has done a number of important things: it has defined the membership and functions of the colleges in the Dublin Institute of Technology, it provides for the roles of governing bodies, it has established the post of director as chief executive in all of the regional technical colleges and the post of president as chief executive in the Dublin Institute of Technology; it has provided for the establishment of an academic council in each of the institutions with clearly defined functions; it has established all staff as employees of the particular institution and has allowed for the drawing up of programmes and budgets on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bills now before this House are aimed at addressing difficulties which have arisen in the appointment of governing bodies to the colleges and the institute, which were not contemplated when the Acts were drafted and passed <Col N="961" /> in 1992.  The Bill also addresses difficulties which have arisen in Letterkenny Regional Technical College and extend the provisions considered necessary to address those particular difficulties to all the institutions as a safeguard for the future.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges have undergone dramatic development from the time of their establishment in the 1970s under the vocational education committees to their foundation on a statutory basis as autonomous higher education institutions from January 1993.  Prior to their establishment and following the publishing of the reports &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Training of Technicians in Ireland&rdquo; in the early 1960s, a steering committee was set up to advise the then Minister for Education on the provision of technical education.  This committee's report in 1969 formed the basis for the establishment in the 1970s of most of the colleges. The report related the colleges to economic growth both nationally and in their own regions.  In their continuing adaptation over a period of almost 25 years, the colleges have continued to stimulate demand for skills which the economy needs.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology can trace the development of technical and technological education in Dublin to much earlier times, from the Artisans Exhibition in Earlsfort Terrace in 1885 through to 1978 when the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee established the Dublin Institute of Technology on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to ensure better co-ordination of the work of its third level colleges.</P>
    <P>The growth in this sector in this period has been marked.  In the period since 1980, whole-time student numbers in the regional technical colleges have risen from 6,500 to 25,000, an increase of almost 300 per cent.  In the same period, the enrolment of whole-time students in the colleges which form the Dublin Institute of Technology has risen from 4,000 to 10,062, an increase of 150 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> The 1992 legislation, since coming into effect, is providing new opportunities for the sector to broaden its range of activities and to branch into new spheres of development.  Activities such as applied industry supported research, technology transfer, services to regional industry, industrial training, product development technology centres and new industry incubation are now an ever increasing feature of the sector.  Looking to the future, national and indeed EU initiatives point to a number of developments in higher education. These include participation and access, partnerships, continuing education and international linkages.  The regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology have a major contribution to make in all of these areas.</P>
    <P>In the case of participation and access, the colleges and the institute have been major instruments in broadening educational opportunity and access.  They provide national and regional access to courses at a wide variety of levels matching closely the abilities and ambitions of the students.  They have developed co-operatively transfer possibilities to higher studies on a large scale and they also provide a programme of professionally oriented part-time education and industrial training. The success of the Tallaght college in the context of access and participation of the local community is the most recent testimony to this.</P>
    <P>In forming the partnership with economic life, the colleges and the institute are working with national and international development agencies.  New industry incubation, co-operation with and assistance to indigenous industry and the attraction to the regions of investment in development are and will continue to be major functions of the sector.  Whether through associated technology parks or through tourism courses and the services sector, the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology will be significant regional and national contributors and will provide support for <Col N="963" /> community and rural development projects. They will also contribute to technology updating in the education sector generally.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing demand for continuing education and, in the future, it is expected that there will be a higher proportion of mature and part-time students.  As a result, greater diversity of access and lifelong education will be required.  The regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology will be expected to offer an education service to those students, given their highly regarded traditions in these fields.  Pilot schemes in open and distance learning are already a feature of the sector and can be expected to grow.</P>
    <P>Where international linkages are concerned, many students of the institutions covered by this legislation participate in a wide range of EU programmes in the education, culture, science, technology, information and other spheres.  The institutions also have a range of development and research programmes with industrial and international partners.  This record of growth and the key and exciting role of the institutions for the future should be kept to the forefront of our minds when we come later to discuss the situation in Letterkenny regional technical college which is unique in the sector and which must be addressed as a matter of urgency in the interests of the sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Bills before the House have a number of aims.  They were initiated in the other House as Bills relating to various aspects of the governance of the colleges.  In particular they were intended to underpin on a statutory basis gender balance on governing bodies, to provide certainty in respect of who among the academic staff were entitled to vote in the elections for governing body position, and to clarify certain technical matters which arose from the High Court judgment relating to elections to governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the Bills the then Minister, having considered the <Col N="964" /> report of Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien into the management of Letterkenny regional technical college, brought forward proposals by way of Committee Stage amendments to protect the interests of that college and its students and to provide safeguards for the future in the other institutions.</P>
    <P>In January of this year, Dr. Hederman-O'Brien was appointed by the then Minister as an inspector to inquire into aspects of Letterkenny regional technical college and she reported to the Minister at the end of July.  Her report outlines the situation which causes all of us serious concern and worry.  In particular the report raises concerns about the financial management of the college, the selection procedure for staff appointments, the provision and authorisation of courses and the provision of services for students and certain strategic issues with implications for all the institutions.</P>
    <P>Concern has been further heightened by developments since Dr. Hederman-O'Brien made her report.  Investigations by my Department suggest that student enrolments in the college are falling at a time when there is unprecedented demand for places elsewhere in the regional technical colleges and the third level sector generally.  The former chairman of the governing body of the college has accused senior management in the college of being responsible for a range of management failures.  Furthermore, subsequent to the finalisation of the inspector's report, it has emerged through the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General that there is a fraud in the accounts of Letterkenny regional technical college.</P>
    <P>My first and overriding concern now is to safeguard the reputation and operation of this college by ensuring that it is brought to the high standards expected of a third level educational institution.  In the circumstances now obtaining in the college I cannot have confidence in the capacity of the present management structures to achieve that. Accordingly, in circumstances where there is strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the management and governance structure <Col N="965" /> has failed, I consider it to be my duty as Minister with ultimate responsibility for this college to take immediate steps to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 2 of the Bills will enable the Minister for Education to appoint a commission to direct and control the college for up to two years.  The commission will, upon appointment, immediately take on the role and functions of the governing body and director.  The appointment of a commission will thus ensure that an effective management structure can be put in place immediately in Letterkenny regional technical college.  This will allow time for a full consideration of the inspector's report, particularly in the context of affording a full and complete opportunity to those named in the report as having responsibility for the situation outlined in it to have their views considered.  The appointment of a commission should not be seen as prejudging that process but as an assurance to others with an interest in the college, such as staff, students and the public, that in the meantime their interests also will be protected.</P>
    <P>In drawing up this provision there was a concern to ensure that the interests of any institution to which a commission would be appointed in the future would be protected from any unfair or arbitrary action by a Minister.  A number of safeguards were built into the provision as drafted and these were strengthened by the Select Committee in the other House.  These safeguards include a requirement that a commission can be appointed only on the making of a report by an inspector appointed under the Principal Act.  Further protection is accorded by giving the governing body, chairman and director a statutory right to be informed of the reasons for the appointment of a commission and an opportunity to show cause why the functions vested in a commission should be revested in them.</P>
    <P>The third protection for the normal management and governance structure in an institution is provided by the fact that the period for which a commission <Col N="966" /> may be appointed is limited to at most two years.  In the Select Committee on Social Affairs the provision was amended to ensure that any future order would require confirmation by the Oireachtas in general in advance of it becoming effective.  To safeguard institutions from undue delay by the Oireachtas an order would become effective automatically 28 days after having been made.  In such a case however, the Houses could annul the order within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>This provision is proposed in the particular context of the situation obtaining in Letterkenny regional technical college. As I outlined earlier I have every confidence that high standards of management and governance apply in the other regional technical colleges.  This proposed provision is, however, drafted in general terms to cover all the institutions. I consider this to be advisable. Letterkenny regional technical college has shown how an institution can move seriously out of line in terms of its management and operation.  The public has a right to ensure that were that to happen again in this or in any other institution, the institution can be rescued, the interests of the many people involved, including staff, students and parents, guaranteed and the significant investment by the State protected.  The granting of power to the Minister for Education, in the carefully balanced way now proposed, is in my view the most effective way of giving the public that assurance.</P>
    <P>I would like to now outline to this House the background to the provisions relating to gender balance.  In enacting the 1992 legislation, the Oireachtas quite rightly recognised that it would be in the interests of the institutions if the method of appointing governing bodies ensured a reasonable gender balance. The regional technical colleges and the institute have a record of achievement behind them and a challenging future ahead of them.  The realisation of the aims and ambitions for this sector of third level education will best be achieved by a co-operative effort by all <Col N="967" /> the interests involved and the harnessing of a wide range of relevant experience and expertise.  This must be firmly rooted in the governing bodies and in the method of their selection.</P>
    <P>In general I believe it is necessary in public life to ensure that men and women are fully represented and given the opportunity to make their contribution. Traditionally women have not been so represented.  In the case of educational institutions gender balance assumes a particular significance in view of the role these institutions have in educating young people in all aspects of life.  Governing bodies are charged with the overall governance of colleges where in many cases women are more than 50 per cent of the student population. The total current number of women students in the sector is 15,000. Given the importance of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology in the development of their regions and in the national educational framework, it is essential that there should be balance in the range of experience and expertise available to them.  Gender balance facilitates this.</P>
    <P>In January 1993 the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> included a commitment to a radical programme of affirmative action in appointing women to State boards with the objective of achieving a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the direct Government nominees within a period of four years.  Subsequent to this the Government in March 1993 set out a gender balance policy to increase the participation of women in public life and to ensure that men and women are fully represented and given an opportunity to make their full contribution in all aspects of public life.</P>
    <P>Regretfully the experience to date has been one of extreme difficulty in securing an appropriate balance of women on the governing bodies.  The structure of the appointments system at present is that the vocational education committees make recommendations to the <Col N="968" /> Minister for Education on the composition of the governing bodies and the Minister formally makes the appointments. Recommendations come from six areas in the case of the colleges and seven in the case of the institute.  These are nominees of the vocational education committees, academic and non-academic staff, students, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and relevant organisations in areas such as agriculture, industry, commerce and the professions.  The institute has an additional nominee from Trinity College.</P>
    <P>When guidelines were issued to the relevant vocational education committees in November 1993, for their nominations for the new governing bodies to be appointed with effect from 1 January 1994, my Department sought nominations in accordance with the Government policy on gender balance.  It was indicated to the committees that the then Minister would have no option but to refuse nominations under the various sections where the required gender balance was not met.  Letters in similar terms were sent to the outgoing governing bodies in the context of staff and student elections and to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in connection with their nominee under the Acts.</P>
    <P>The nominations from vocational education committees generally failed to provide an appropriate gender balance. By March 1994 the situation with regard to the appointment of governing bodies in the institutions had reached an impasse with the vocational education committees in most cases either unable or unwilling to put forward proposals on the basis of minimum representation of 40 per cent for men and women.</P>
    <P>The requirement to ensure gender balance is a duty imposed on the Minister for Education by the Acts.  On the other hand, the vocational education committees pointed to a weakness in that legislation.  While it imposed an obligation on the Minister to ensure gender balance in appointing governing bodies, it imposed no such obligation on the vocational education committees in <Col N="969" /> making recommendations as to the people to be appointed.</P>
    <P>This clearly placed the then Minister in a difficult position.  To meet and discharge the statutory obligation to ensure gender balance, the Oireachtas had to provide the necessary powers.  It would not, however, be in the best interest of the institutions if they were left without governing bodies in the meantime.  Accordingly, governing bodies were appointed as recommended, but only for one year instead of a possible five year term and the provisions now forming part of these Bills were drafted to prevent the kind of stalemate which occurred this year from occurring again.</P>
    <P>At present the selection of governing body members is largely the preserve of the vocational education committees. During the Second Stage debate in the Dáil there were calls from all parties for a greater input by the institutions themselves into the selection process.  I was happy to able to facilitate these calls by moving an amendment at the Select Committee which will give a central role to the academic councils of the institutions in selecting five of the 17 ordinary members of the governing bodies. The academic councils are in the best possible position to know which organisations are most relevant to the courses and overall academic aims of the institutions. That they now can put forward those organisations and request nominations from them for the governing bodies will greatly enhance the working of the governing bodies and through them the effectiveness of the institutions.</P>
    <P>If the provisions now proposed are enacted I am confident that vocational education committees will have little difficulty in practice in assisting the Minister for Education in ensuring a gender balance on governing bodies and that the original Acts can finally, after two failed attempts, be implemented in this respect and in the spirit intended. However, I believe that a stalemate of the kind which developed over this issue <Col N="970" /> of gender balance on governing bodies cannot be allowed to occur again.</P>
    <P>It is extremely damaging for the operation and reputation of the regional technical college-DIT sector and carries series legal and financial risks if colleges are left for any significant period of time without governing bodies.  Accordingly, I am proposing in section 3 of the Bills to provide for a situation where a vocational education committee, in making recommendations to a Minister in respect of the composition of governing bodies, fails in its statutory obligations. The Minister in certain circumstances would be able to by-pass the normal appointments procedure and appoint any person or body of persons to take over the functions of a governing body.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this provision I sought to ensure that it is reasonable and proportionate and that it strikes a balance between the need to put governing bodies in place with as little delay as possible while, at the same time, protecting vocational education committees from arbitrary or unfair action on the part of a Minister.  I also sought to ensure that the power of the Minister is not so wide as to enable him or her to completely set aside the provisions of the Acts as originally enacted. Accordingly, any person or body appointed under this power could hold office for not longer than one year.  This period in most cases would enable a Minister and a vocational education committee to resolve whatever difficulties led to the appointment in the first place and a governing body would then be appointed in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Apart from the issue of gender balance, the appointment of governing bodies was delayed earlier this year because of litigation relating to who should be allowed to participate in the elections for academic staff nominees. This matter was the subject of a High Court judgment which extended participation in the election to certain part-time staff.  In bringing forward provisions setting out in some detail who the electorates for academic and non-academic <Col N="971" /> staff should be, I sought to implement the spirit of that judgement by including part-time staff in the elections.</P>
    <P>At the same time I am conscious of the fact that some part-time staff have only a limited commitment to the colleges and the institution in terms of the number of hours the work there.  In my view it would be inappropriate that such staff would be allowed to participate in elections for governing body positions on the same basis as staff whose contribution is much greater.  In reconciling the rights and interests of part-time staff who make a significant contribution to the colleges and the institute and the rights and interests of staff who work on a full-time basis there, I propose to limit participation in elections to all permanent staff and to those part-time staff who work at least 50 per cent of the hours of whole-time staff.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing in these Bills to amend the method by which student nominees for the governing body are chosen.  At present the legislation provides that two students are to be elected by the student body in accordance with regulations made by the governing bodies. College managements and the Union of Students in Ireland made representations to me to change the method of selecting student members of the governing bodies.  Their concern was that elections for governing bodies separate from the student union elections could lead to a situation where the student members on their governing bodies would have no formal link to the students unions in the colleges.  This would cause fragmentation of student representation which would be damaging to the colleges and the students' interests.</P>
    <P>In recognition of these concerns I propose to amend the method of selection of student members by providing that selection is to be made according to regulations made by the governing bodies. This will enable local managements to work out with students how best their interests can be represented on the governing bodies.  The provision if accepted <Col N="972" /> would put the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology on the same footing in this respect as the University of Limerick and Dublin City University where this method of selection is working well.</P>
    <P>I now propose to outline to the House the provisions of the Bills as presented. My remarks on the individual sections apply to both Bills and I will indicate points of difference as they arise. Section 1 merely provides that the Principal Act referred to in the Bills is the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, or the Dublin Institute of Technology, 1992, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the appointment of a commission to a college or the institute.  Subsection (1) provides that where the Minister is satisfied on the basis of a report of an inspector appointed to inquire into any aspect of an institution's affairs that the institution is not being managed in an effective way, then the Minister may appoint a commission to take over the functions of the governing body, the chairman or the director or all of them.  The commission may be one person or a body of persons and under subsection (2) will have all the powers necessary to carry out their functions.  This subsection also limits the period for which a commission can be appointed to at most two years. At the end of that period, under subsection (7), the powers of the commission must be revested in the then acting governing body, chairman and director.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that the governing body, chairman and director must be informed of the reasons for the appointment of a commission and given an opportunity to show cause why the powers should be revested in them.  This provision ensures that the governing body, chairman and director are given an opportunity to have their case heard and considered.  Subsection (4) ensures that the commission can get necessary information from the former governing body, chairman and director.</P>
    <P>Subsections (5) and (6) give a flexibility to the Minister to vary the membership of a commission while subsection <Col N="973" /> (8) extends that flexibility to the functions of the Commission.  This provision would enable a gradual return of functions to the normal management and governance structures as circumstances allowed.  Subsection (9) provides for the remuneration of a commission while subsection (10) provides for the role of the Oireachtas in the making of orders to which I have already referred. Section 3 would enable the Minister for Education to appoint a person as director of a regional technical college in an acting capacity.</P>
    <P>The director of a college is a key person in its operation and management. He or she is described by the 1992 Act as the chief officer of the college and is charged by that Act with the control and direction of the activities of the college, the direction of staff and the efficient and proper management of the college.  At present the Act provides for the appointment of a director by the governing body of the college with the approval of the Minister for Education but has no provision for an appointment in an acting capacity and no power for the Minister to make such an appointment. In certain circumstances this power would be of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the method of selection of a governing body.  It replaces subsection (4) of the Principal Acts.  This provision would effect no change in the overall composition of the governing bodies.  In the case of the regional technical colleges, there will continue to be 17 ordinary members comprised as follows: six to be nominated by the vocational education committee; two each to be nominated by academic staff and students; one each to be nominated by the non-academic staff and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and five to be nominated by relevant organisations as determined by the vocational education committee.  In the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology, there is one additional member &mdash; a nominee of Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The changes to the present subsection (4) which would be effected by this provision <Col N="974" /> are the imposition of a formal requirement that in the case of the student and academic staff nominees, one from each group must be a woman and the other a man and in the case of relevant organisations, the vocational education committee may seek nominations from any number and then choose five for recommendation to the Minister.  The provision also establishes clearly who among the staff are entitled to participate in the elections.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) imposes a statutory obligation on the vocational education committees to ensure a gender balance and to implement ministerial directives in making recommendations.  Subsection (3) effects the substitution of these provisions for the provisions in the 1992 Acts.  Subsection (4) makes the provisions relating to the electorate for staff members retrospective to safeguard the elections which took place in the wake of the High Court judgment.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that in the event that a vocational education committee fails to abide by its statutory duty in making recommendations and persists in that failure after it is brought to its attention, the Minister may appoint any body of persons to perform the functions of the governing body for a period not greater than one year.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that where a member of the governing body who was elected by the staff of the college or institute ceases to be a member of that staff, he or she will also cease to be a member of the governing body.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is intended to address the difficulties posed by the fact that the governing bodies leaving office last year had, in effect, after the striking down of their regulations governing staff elections by the High Court, left office without making valid regulations.  A full governing body could not be appointed until regulations were made but regulations could not be made until a governing body was appointed.  This &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; situation is addressed by providing for the appointment of a less than complete governing body which would then make the necessary regulations.  It is <Col N="975" /> retrospective to cover the present governing bodies which were appointed under this procedure.  Section 8 provides for the short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Bills seek to provide for the exceptional circumstances which have arisen in Letterkenny regional technical college; bring certainty to the process for electing staff members to governing bodies; ensure that an appropriate gender balance is effectively implemented on all governing bodies; assist nominating bodies to achieve gender balance in their recommendations and to prevent a situation from ever arising again where failure on the part of nominating bodies could jeopardise the good order and management of the colleges and the institute.</P>
    <P>I commend these Bills to the House. I thank my colleagues for facilitating an early passage of this very essential legislation. I regret that it will not be possible for me to remain in the House for the full Second Stage debate.  I hope, however, to be able to return as quickly as possible for the remaining Stages.  I will, in the meantime, have as much access as possible to what is being said so as to address the questions raised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has had to carry a heavy load this last week or so, which he is doing with aplomb.  I hope we will have a good discussion on this Bill before the evening is over.  I recognise the need for the introduction of these Bills. However, I have tabled a number of amendments which I believe are important.  I hope we can discuss them in full and get at least part agreement on some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology have done an enormous job for this country, in the case of the regional technical colleges <Col N="976" /> since the 1970s and in the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology for almost a century.  The need for the regional technical colleges was established, as the Minister pointed out, in the 1960s and they were set up in the 1970s.  They have made an enormous contribution to economic and social development in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology, in particular, has made a wonderful contribution for almost a century.  It is a widely respected institution and has been offering degree courses since 1975 through a link with the University of Dublin.  The success of the institute is due, in no small way, to the unremitting dedication of its various presidents and the members of the teaching staff.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges are a more modern development, most of which were established in the 1970s. When one compares the 1980 enrolments to the current enrolments, one is struck by the enormous strides which they have made.  Today, as the Minister pointed out, there are about 25,000 students attending these colleges and about 10,000 attending the Dublin Institute of Technology.  We need to pay attention to the further growth of these institutions.</P>
    <P>We have to strike a balance between the academic and the practical, technical courses these institutions offer.  For years Irish education was &mdash; and still is to a large degree &mdash; purely academic. The economy would benefit if we could get a proper mix between academic and practical, technical courses.</P>
    <P>Industry has come to realise the value of these institutions and the quality of their graduates.  Having worked in education at post-primary level, I know that industry was slow to employ those graduates in the beginning.  Any change is a slow process but, thankfully, industries are now employing these graduates and are reaping great benefits from the quality of their work.</P>
    <P>The continued development of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology is essential to good economic growth in the years <Col N="977" /> ahead.  These institutions have developed courses which are more oriented to the practicalities of industry and the economy in general.  These colleges sit comfortably side by side with the universities.  They have carved out their own distinctive niche in education and their futures are assured.</P>
    <P>I believe &mdash; and it was discussed in the other House and by the Select Committee &mdash; that both the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology should be given university status eventually.  The Minister should set out a time frame within which this might be achieved.  Certain things would have to be done before they could be given that status and if the Minister set out a time frame the colleges could starting working towards fulfilling all the requirements.  Changes would need to be made to the curriculum and methods of certification.  If the colleges knew the prerequisites they could work towards them.  We need a good balance between the purely academic and the more practical orientation in third level education.  University status would give a further impetus to the development of these colleges and we should actively pursue it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer in passing to the decision, in principle, by the former Government to introduce free third level education some time in the near future.  I am not satisfied with that glib proposal because as it stands, and as it was announced, it lacks fairness and equity.  Further to that, it is proposed at a time when the primary and post-primary sectors are continuing to operate in a milieu of scarce resources.  I wish to give details to the House of some of the cuts which have been brought about in educational funding during the course of this current year.</P>
    <P>The voluntary secondary schools attended a meeting in the Department of Education a couple of days ago.  All six of the voluntary secondary schools in County Monaghan were present as were the public representatives from the county.  We had an interesting discussion in the Department.  However, <Col N="978" /> certain figures were placed before us and the House should know the position.</P>
    <P>The income used by managers of voluntary secondary schools to keep the institutions going comes from capitation grants.  Departmental officials admitted that if these <i>per capita</i> grants had maintained their real value over the last number of years, they would currently stand at £202 per student.  However, this year schools are being paid £158 per student.  One does not have to be a mathematician to realise the huge gulf that exists between the amount of funding required and the amount of funding being provided.</P>
    <P>We also discovered that there was quite a substantial cut in the book grant for necessitous pupils this year &mdash; up to 25 per cent in many cases.  That cut was applied to some schools where the enrolment has increased by 15 or 20 per cent; in those cases the cut is greater.  I fail to understand how a Labour Party Minister in particular could justify the cut under that particular heading &mdash; book grants for necessitous pupils &mdash; but it has been done.</P>
    <P>The schools were not notified about the cut until after September.  In every case the schools assumed they would get at least the level of the grant they had last year and obviously had to take steps to provide grants for students.  As a result, the schools are in a right mess. They had to dig into their empty pockets to find the money.  One school pointed out that its management is currently running the school on an overdraft of £30,000.  This should give Members some indication of the current commitment to post-primary education.</P>
    <P>Subject grants for practical subjects, such as woodwork, drawing and art, in post-primary schools have been reduced to a farcical level.  The amount per student granted by the Department to schools is totally inadequate; it would barely supply the materials necessary for the certificate examinations alone, let alone supplying materials used in the day-to-day teaching of these subjects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> It is coming through strongly to me that the voluntary sector feels under siege and is convinced that there is an ideological battle going on in which it is being sidelined.  We cannot afford that. There is a good mix of public and private voluntary schools at post-primary level.  The actions of any Minister who would try to interfere with their current status should be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector has made an enormous contribution to the development and continuation of post-primary education over the years.  It is clear, given some of things in which she has been involved, that the former Minister has some sort of ideological bias in that direction.  It has to be said that the vocational sector is also doing a marvellous job.  The two systems work side by side without any difficulty.</P>
    <P>In every town there tends to be at least two schools, one public and one private voluntary; both fulfil necessary requirements.  We cannot do without the voluntary sector at this stage.  If the former Minister is not reappointed, the voluntary sector will heave a sigh of relief.  That is the information I am getting. When the new appointment is made that sector will be looking to the Minister and the Government to restore, with some degree of equity, proper funding for the running of their schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal for free third level education, participation rates in third level education are highest in areas which are convenient to the colleges and lowest in remote areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>We will discuss that later. Throughout the provincial counties the participation rates are as I have stated. This is caused by the additional costs involved which families are unable to bear.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to introduce more equity into third level education will have to go further than just saying we will have free education.  The public are not in a position to accept such a statement because everybody now knows that while national education is designated as being free, it is patently not free.  The same applies in the post-primary sector which is also designated as free but is not.  Both second level and national schools are forever trying to get money from parents to keep the show on the road.</P>
      <P>If the Government proposes to pursue its proposal for free third level education we will have to oppose it unless it is introduced in an equitable way.  The Government would have to introduce further proposals to ensure equity in the system.  One method would be to examine and try to improve maintenance grants, particularly for those living in remote areas.  It is also necessary to look at families who are unable to avail of grants.  The Government would have to use tax breaks and other methods to assist those families to avail of necessary third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister was involved in a broad spectrum of issues.  She showed promise when appointed but the promise <Col N="981" /> has largely turned to ashes in recent times.  The meeting she held in Dublin Castle was excellent in itself and seemed to form a basis for agreement on the various proposals she had <i>vis-a-vis</i> regional and local authorities in education. However, subsequent actions by the then Minister have brought those proposals to naught.  At this stage I do not believe anybody supports local or regional education authorities.  It is a shame that this has happened.  If the new Government is to make any progress in those areas, a new hand will have to be put in charge.</P>
    <P>The two Bills before us have been constructed by a Labour Party Minister. Given that party's overt commitment to openness, transparency and accountability, particularly in recent weeks, I examined the Bills with those issues in mind.  I wished to see if the overt motivation of the Labour Party was translated into practice.  However, I was disappointed.</P>
    <P>In section 2 of both Bills the Minister sought the power to appoint a commission to carry out the functions of the governing body, chairman and director. Appointments to State boards and to commissions of this nature are powers which Ministers can use in a self-centred way; they are not answerable to anybody for such appointments.  Although questions can be asked in the Dáil, in general such boards and commissions are populated by faceless people who are unknown to the public.  That is wrong.  The public has a jaundiced view of Ministers who make appointments to boards, commissions and so forth.  If a Minister is involved the public is convinced that the appointments are made totally on the basis of grace and favour, in other words, it is seen as political favouritism.</P>

      <P>No, I am speaking in a general context.  If Fine Gael were in power I would like to see certain changes made as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> The public is turned off by such practices. The public &mdash; or 99.9 per cent of the people &mdash; never receive a phone call to say &ldquo;there is a little job going in the Judiciary&rdquo; or &ldquo;a board is being appointed, would you like to sit on it?&rdquo; That is how such appointments are made.  There is no competition for such positions.  Ordinary members of the community who are looking for a job must compete for it.  They are not happy that appointments to State boards, commissions, the Judiciary and so forth are made in such a <i>laissez faire</i> manner.  I sympathise with them.  We must assure the public that appointments are, in the first place, good appointments.  I am not concerned about the background of a person who accepts a particular position or whether the person is a Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour Party supporter. Such sympathies must be discounted. However, I am concerned that the public is convinced that appointments are genuine and that the appointees are qualified to fulfil their functions.  We are not doing that at present.  The public is sceptical of the systems being operated in that area.</P>
    <P>I have put down an amendment which applies to the two Bills.  It provides that, when a Minister makes an appointment or, in this case, appoints a commission, the appointees should appear before the Select Committee on Social Affairs at a public hearing.  I assume there will be no objection to that amendment.  It introduces the qualities of accountability and openness for which people &mdash; particularly the Labour Party &mdash; are screaming. I assume my amendment will receive the full support of the Labour Party.  If it does not, people will make up their own minds about the intentions of the Labour Party and the practice as against the promise.  There has always been a difficulty in that area.</P>

When the Government was formed <Col N="983" /> after the election in 1992 the Labour Party brought members of their families into Government with them and put them on the public payroll.  That is a matter of fact.  I am not aware of any Fianna Fáil Ministers who did that. Perhaps they did, but I am not aware of it.  We must look at the promise and the practice and we should beware of deceiving the public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficult job today.  I am saddened that a college in my county must be discussed in this House and that special legislation is necessary to put a management structure in place there.  It is difficult for me because the college means so much to Donegal, to the future of the students and to the generation in that county that will require third level education.</P>
      <P>We waited many years for that college. There was no third level education available to our young people.  The building of the regional college in Letterkenny in 1982 was a major development that had been eagerly anticipated. As the late Bishop MacFeely said, although we regretfully had to export some of our young people at least the college equipped them so that they might aspire to higher employment than digging tunnels.  The college was the seventh regional technical college to be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Bishop MacFeely persuaded the late Seán Lemass to provide the college in Letterkenny.  Of the seven regional technical colleges, none was more necessary.  Devastation had been wrought in the area as a result of our isolation and our peripherality and no <Col N="985" /> development was as welcome in Donegal as the regional technical college.</P>
    <P>There were many problems over the years, caused mainly because it was a small college, with 500 students initially, but it grew.  Today, salaries at the college amount to £7 million.  There are 168 teachers and the student population is almost 1,500 in an area which did not have a tradition of third level education. If one provides a regional college in Dublin, Limerick, Galway or elsewhere where there is a third level institution, there is a pattern, procedure and structure. However, in County Donegal, it was a completely new structure which encountered all the problems involved in growing as a college.  Some of the best teachers and committed lecturers were involved.</P>
    <P>However, the college got into serious difficulty when involvement by teachers and lecturers in areas outside the college was accepted as the norm, that is, where part-time lecturers undertook work outside the college.  This situation existed in the college to the extent that it promoted internal jealousy.  Whatever the type of outside involvement, it had a detrimental effect on the college.  It reached such a point at one stage that I approached Deputy Higgins and asked him if there was any such difficulty in UCG.  He told me his experience was not dissimilar to the position in the college. There was much trouble because the pursuit of activities outside the college promoted internal strife.</P>
    <P>At one stage a lecturer, who undertook architectural or design work outside the college, designed a school.  He featured prominently, advertising the fact that he designed schools.  The school in Letterkenny was for disabled people and he featured prominently in the photograph of those involved at the formal opening of the Little Angels School in Letterkenny.  He was a lecturer who was paid full-time by the board of management.  This is an example of the difficulties that would arise.</P>
    <P>At that time, the Department had no structures in place whereby those <Col N="986" /> involved and paid on a full-time basis should and could not be involved in outside activity.  Much of the trouble at the regional college in Letterkenny started as a result of the fact that lecturers could be classified as part-time because they had other activities outside the college. That caused much jealousy.</P>
    <P>I have 30 minutes to make my contribution to this debate but it would take me three days to cover all the details.  It is a pity I do not have three days because I want to do justice to the issue. I have a responsibility in this area because I come from County Donegal and I have an in-depth knowledge of what happened at Letterkenny regional technical college.  I was chairman of the board of management for the five years previous to the setting up of the current administrative structure.</P>
    <P>As I said, the trouble started with those who were involved in activities outside the college.  This difficulty developed to the point where a new principal was appointed.  In 1985, I was a member of the panel who interviewed the teachers and we appointed a principal who came from outside the college. The internal difficulties in the college were so serious that we were glad to get a suitable candidate from outside.  It is with much concern and difficulty that I contribute to this important debate.  The newspapers have printed many statements; every politician who felt like it jumped on the bandwagon about the Letterkenny regional technical college in recent months.  Some of the national newspapers must not have had much to write about if they had to feature Letterkenny regional technical college as their lead story.  One article in a local paper stated that £25 million for the regional technical college was in doubt following union trouble, that a £25 million funding project for the extension and development of the regional college was in serious jeopardy due to the ongoing controversy involving the board of management at the regional technical college.  I will not quote the author of the article but I was disappointed to read it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> We believed we would solve some of the college's problems by the appointment of a principal from outside the area &mdash; he came from Birmingham.  We were wrong.  Everybody makes some mistakes but I was one of the interview board and we made a very serious mistake by appointing a principal from outside the college.  We listened to the principal putting his case.  He said he had spent almost 20 years developing a college and making a major contribution to education in England.  He dearly loved home and said he wished to return and contribute something to his native county.  He went on to say that the activities of a good principal did not stop when the college closed in the evening; they had to continue through after care and outreach education.  He used all the nice phrases.  From his experience on the ground in the college in Birmingham, the principal said he had approximately 98 per cent success in after care, by seeking jobs and keeping in touch with his students.  We fell for it.  On the day I found it almost too good to be true.  The man said that at 5 p.m. in Letterkenny and he was on duty in Birmingham the following morning. I rang the college in Birmingham next morning to see if he was on duty and he was.  After that, I believed in him and played some role in his appointment, which was a disaster for the college.</P>
    <P>Some people have jumped on the political bandwagon and would have us understand that the trouble at the college only emerged recently with the appointment of the board of governors. Special focus has been placed on the chairman of the board of governors. This chairman has been called a political hack and it has been said that he used the college.  There has been a great deal of innuendo but to my knowledge that is not the situation.  I am surprised that the special investigation into the college did not consult those who were involved in the board of management prior to the establishment of the board of governors. As chairman of the college's board of management for the previous five years <Col N="988" /> I had gained an in-depth knowledge and experience over those years.  I did not expect to make a contribution but I thought I would have been consulted.  I formed the impression that Dr. Hederman O'Brien came to do an in-depth examination of the difficulties at the college with the brief that this was a political problem.  The examination was totally ineffective as her findings did not relate to the real problems.</P>
    <P>When the former chairman of the board of governors was appointed I persuaded him to take an interest in the college because of its serious difficulties and he finally agreed.  I gave him files on seven difficult cases, I am pleased that he pursued them and, in two cases, got results.  He spent his own money in investigating the problem of drugs and was successful in detecting the drug pushers in the college.</P>
    <P>In another case one person was hell bent on doing anything but his job as lecturer.  He was employed for four or five terms and the board of management finally said &ldquo;no more&rdquo;.  He went above the board of management to the Department or the Minister or somebody with influence and obtained leave of absence.  I persuaded the former chairman of the board of governors to pursue that case and, again, he was successful. He established that the person involved was involved in activities outside the college, that he bought a first class ticket charged to the college in his expenses and traded it for two tickets &mdash; one for his wife and one for himself.  The former chairman of the board of governors, who has been called a political hack, made a major contribution to solving problems in the college.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the board of management of the college I convened 11 special meetings &mdash; four of them on Saturdays in the Mount Errigal Hotel &mdash; with Deputy Blaney, chairman of the vocational education committee, Sean O'Longon chief executive officer of the vocational education committee and the principal of the college.  The House will understand that it was not normal activity.  To indicate to those who may <Col N="989" /> think that this is a recent problem the dates of some of the meetings were Friday, 15 May 1987, Saturday, 16 May 1987, 5 June 1987, 12 June 1987 and Saturday, 5 December 1987.</P>
    <P>I do not know how Dr. Hederman O'Brien managed an inquiry into the college and made recommendations without consulting those involved.  I would readily have made the files and the information available which would have clearly indicated that we had a problem going back to 1987 and before that.  That problem was compounded the day we appointed the principal &mdash; who is still there &mdash; on 1 April 1985.  It was April fool's day and we on the board of management were the fools.  I have more files than I could carry into the House &mdash; nothing is lost or missing and they are all available to help to put in place a structure that will manage the college properly.</P>
    <P>Those who try to nail the former chairman of the board of governors on political grounds do a disservice to the college and are on the wrong track. Many people know exactly what happened and I compliment the former chairman of the board of governors for his consistent approach and determination to clean up a bad management structure at the college.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the board of management of the college I had occasion to write to the chief executive officer &mdash; also the finance officer &mdash; involved on the board of management.  I wrote to him on 18 February 1988 as follows:</P>
    <P>Please include on Agenda for Special Meeting of the Board of Management of the Regional Technical College on Monday 29th February the following items: (at 11 a.m.)</P>
    <P>1.  The failure of the Regional Technical College to proceed as planned with the 2 Diploma Courses in 1987/88.  [The reason I included that was that the principal was missing for four months and the teacher who was planning to introduce two diploma courses <Col N="990" /> could not get into the office to get the letters.]</P>
    <P>2.  The grounds for the Principal withholding information supplied to him on 13th January 1988 by the TUI until the 12th February. [He had important information about which he did nothing for a month]</P>
    <P>3.  The failure of the Principal of the College to act as instructed at a Meeting of the Board of Management of the College on 27th November 1987, i.e. the Board of Management decided that before the College would undertake any outside work, approval would have to come from the Board of Management &mdash; the Principal was directed to inform the College Staff accordingly. Up to Monday 15th February the principal has not informed the College Staff of the decision of the Board of Management.</P>
    <P>4.  Testing for the Department of Marine.  [This was done under the management of the regional technical college at the marine college in Killybegs.  This scheme has a long history &mdash; the idea was to organise testing of fish quality, but it was impeded from achieving its full potential because it was badly managed and controlled, largely because it was left to the principal of the college].</P>
    <P>5.  The Principal's letter, dated 14 January 1988 to the Vocational Committee/District Auditor.  [In my opinion, what was written in that letter was not true and I want it investigated.]</P>
    <P>6.  Principal's absence from the college on outside activities.</P>
    <P>At the meeting convened on 29 February all those items were discussed.  The minutes stated that the principal must win back the confidence of the board of management.  He admitted at the meeting that he had lost our confidence and was foolish enough to sign his name to the minutes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> The board of management was aware the principal was a problem, which made its job much harder but it was able to handle it.  However, when the 1992 Act came into force knowledgeable people who had given up their Saturdays for the regional technical college and put great effort into its management were swept aside.  The principal now had autonomy and the committee no longer had control over him or his financial management.  That Act prevented involvement by the vocational education committee in those affairs.  Not only that, it removed Deputies Blaney, Harte and me from the board of management. I question that provision because I do not believe everyone who becomes involved in Irish politics is a gangster, a crook or a political hack but that most are doing an honest job.  The people involved in the management of Letterkenny regional technical college had an onerous job and I felt that even those who differed from me politically were sincere.</P>
    <P>It was a mistake to exclude them.  If this provision is challenged under the Constitution, I do not think the court will uphold the exclusion of people simply because they are Members of the Oireachtas.  It may yet be challenged. Membership of the Oireachtas is temporary and it should not be possible to exclude a member of the Oireachtas from the board of management of an regional technical college.  It was wrong to exclude us and introduce a new group of people who have not yet discovered the problems.</P>
    <P>It is with a certain amount of sadness that I speak today.  Many issues could be mentioned but listing them all may not achieve much.  For example, at another meeting we had to consider the unauthorised appointment by the principal of a temporary teacher.</P>
    <P>On 18 February 1988 I wrote to the chief executive officer, asking him to supply me with copies of claims for travel, expenses and subsistence submitted by the principal of the regional technical college.  They show that the principal <Col N="992" /> was away from the college much of the time.  In January 1987, he was in Dublin five times and once in Galway; in February he was six times in Dublin; in March he was three times in Dublin; and for every month that year he was away from Letterkenny on four or five occasions, involved in every outside management structure except what he was appointed to do.  That indicates the failures and the difficulties at the regional technical college. People may ask why we did not sack or suspend the principal.  I asked him for his resignation but he would not give it.  He employed a solicitor who sent a letter to the board of management. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, wrote to the principal on 19 November 1987 and 20 January 1988, both times about fairly important matters but the principal took four months to reply.  Senator Cotter expressed surprise earlier but when I was chairman of the County Donegal vocational education committee the vocational education committee sacked the principal of a college in Ballyshannon and the then Fine Gael Minister reinstated him, despite the wishes of the vocational education committee.  I directed the vocational education committee to take the Minister to the High Court, where we won the case and succeeded in sacking the principal who was doing everything except what he should have been doing in Ballyshannon.  That should be on the record, although I am not anxious to score political points.  I will give details if asked.  The Minister should also know that in 1989 the Department of Education ordered a review of the regional technical college but nothing untoward was reported, despite the Department having been given the information.  That was a mistake. The examination by Dr. Hederman O'Brien was a political one to nail one person in County Donegal.  Because of this I ask that there be another examination, and I will make new information available.  I will also prove beyond doubt that the examination undertaken by Dr. Hederman O'Brien was superficial, did not address the <Col N="993" /> details of the case and did not seek information that was available.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister establishes a commission to run the college, he should clean out the existing system and ensure that any new structure will be soundly based and will not present any difficulties.  In this respect I ask for a further examination of the matter as there is much evidence available, many files to be considered and plentiful problems to be addressed.  The files are available for scrutiny and I am anxious that matters be cleaned out, because our college, for our county, is paramount.</P>
    <P>Nobody in our county will be used as a scapegoat, and this was attempted recently.  In this respect it is important to ensue that this inquiry does not conclude that the problem which arose was the total responsibility of one person. On the contrary, the person concerned made a gallant attempt to clean it up and he has my total support.  He did what I expected of him, and this is not a bad reflection on the former chairman of the Board of Governors at Letterkenny; quite the contrary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, and also the report of the Minister, Deputy Smith, who outlined to the House the acceptance of this important Bill, one which is badly needed.  Both Bills before the House are important, but for those, like myself, who come from County Donegal, the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Bill is also important in that a major problem has come to the fore over the years and it was vital that action be taken to address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 12 regional technical colleges in the country have made a major contribution to education, both in Letterkenny and nation-wide.  Letterkenny regional technical college, the improvements there and the number of students attending it have helped the industrial development of County Donegal.  Major firms have been established in Letterkenny, such as Unifi Textured Yarns, <Col N="994" /> IMED and ITE, which has been recently established, has its training headquarters in the regional college. The regional college has benefited the town, the county and the north west region to a great degree, because it allows for the development of skills which encourages investment by industrial units.</P>
    <P>I compliment the former Minister for Education, Deputy Breathnach on establishing the investigation when requested into the college in Letterkenny. There were major problems at the college, and in this respect I compliment Dr. Hederman O'Brien on the report she produced on them.  I also admire Senator McGowan's defence of the former chairman of the college, which is to be welcomed.  Anybody who defends a friend, as Senator McGowan did, must be complimented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is never the wrong time to say the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not compliment the former chairman as Senator McGowan has done.  The first students, 77 in all, were enrolled in Letterkenny regional technical college in 1971-72.  By 1993-94 the college had 1,500 students with a staff of 168.  That was no mean achievement, and people such as Senator McGowan and Deputy Blaney must be complimented on the role they played in the establishment and development of the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An examination reveals that 60 to 70 per cent of the students attending the college come from outside the town and the county.  These students had to be catered for, including their social life, because they are away from home.  The fact that we in County Donegal did not have a real link with other parts of the country left us in the position that we had to undertake this task, or else the students had to look after themselves. The spending power of the students, both in Letterkenny and in County Donegal is enormous, whether it be on food, drink, rented accommodation and so on.  Figures such as £7 million have <Col N="995" /> been generated for Letterkenny from the regional college alone, which is big &ldquo;bucks&rdquo; in anybody's money.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to consider the nature of the facilities available to the students at the college, and I would question the kind of supports, both from the college and the board of management, which were provided to students who were away from home for a long time.  In this respect, the conduct of the students in Letterkenny was excellent.  People made political capital from criticising and scandalising them, but the students had an excellent record with the local community and the people they stayed with. They were good for the town and the town got on quite well with them.</P>
    <P>The troubles in Letterkenny started a number of years back.  Lest anybody has vague ideas as to how they started, it is necessary to state that they commenced because the students moved their place of entertainment from an establishment in Letterkenny to another establishment, which I will not mention.  Immediately, one of the directors of the former establishment criticised the students. Those, like myself, who live in the town and saw what happened agree that the threats, the pressure and intimidation which took place were a disgrace.  It was not deserving, and should not have happened, but politics being what it is in County Donegal, that is the way it was. It was open season against the students, and some people went to town on them in style.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the identity of the person, whose name I will not disclose, who gave the database of the student's names and addresses to the directors of the Golden Grill.  I also know the girl who was told to hand over the database to these directors.  What is the reason for the delay by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in providing a response?  The agency has had the relevant information for almost a year and in view of this I wonder if those in the agency have been got at, because I am concerned that they have not undertaken any serious investigations into the <Col N="996" /> situation in Letterkenny.  That is a national agency, and when the names and addresses of people are disclosed in such a manner somebody should be held accountable.  The identities of those who distributed the database in Letterkenny are well known, and they should be made to pay for what they did.</P>
    <P>Some people considered that there were alleged irregularities of student's accounts.  A report from the Garda Síochána is still awaited with regard to these accounts, but a reading of the report submitted by Dr. Hederman O'Brien reveals that there is very little in it which deals with the students. There was no major investigation of the students, and at the end of the day, the students have not come out of the affair too badly.  Students are students, no matter what way the situation is considered, and the attacks made on them by those who are part of the right wing agenda in our area, examples of which were on display in the House today and in the other House yesterday, angers me.  Protection is given by these people to the former chairman of the board but nothing is given to the students, who are away from home and have to overcome challenges.  We must help them as much as we can.</P>
    <P>Letterkenny is a good town and the number of students there has grown year by year.  The growth over the last five years has been phenomenal and the indications are that by 1997 student numbers may rise to around 2,600.  It is important for us as politicians to see that this happens.  A rise in student numbers is important for the development of the town.  The college is and has been excellent and we must do all we can to restore its good name so that it continues to grow and enjoy major achievements, as it has in the past.</P>
    <P>Once this matter is cleared up and the Bill comes into force a commission will run the college in place of the people who have done so until now.  The sooner it is cleaned up the better.  Educational standards are important.  Good management practices are also important and we did not have them in Letterkenny in <Col N="997" /> recent years.  It is important for the regional technical college to maintain its local and regional position and to become a centre of excellence in education.</P>
    <P>People have asked why this Bill is needed.  Only has only to look at the record of the college over the years to see the mess that has been created.  The college has been established in Letterkenny for 22 years.  Senator McGowan, Deputy Blaney and Councillor McGlinchey have been chairmen of it, the latter since September 1991. There were no problems until the students decided to change the venue of their disco, which was a great money spinner.  Since then we have heard complaints about embezzlement and fraud. There have been such allegations from within the college itself.  The Garda are investigating a fraud which is supposed to have taken place there.  There have been accusations about politicians, staff and students.  The situation is an absolute mess.</P>
    <P>Drugs were mentioned.  I cannot understand what Senator McGowan was talking about.  If there were drugs in the college when the chairman took up his post, they are still there.  There are drugs in every small town and they have not been cleaned out.  Drugs were not a major problem in Letterkenny regional technical college.  Attacks were made on the students in defence of the chairman.  The drugs problem in the college was the only defence he had.  Why did he resign if he had nothing to answer for?  The report on the college was damning in regard to the director and the chairman.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Fianna Fáil Bill &mdash; much of the work on it was prepared by the Fianna Fáil-Labour coalition Government &mdash; is to rectify the situation in Letterkenny.  It is important that the Bill also applies to other colleges because the same could happen in any of them.  The students have been vilified time and time again.  What supports were they given over the years?  There is a one day strike in Letterkenny regional technical college today.  Students are <Col N="998" /> standing at the gates of both campuses because grants have not been fully paid to them.  The powers that be in the college, at a very insensitive time, decided to deduct from grants moneys which were owed due to absences.  These moneys were not deducted four weeks ago when they should have been.  It was decided to deduct them after eight weeks and some of the students are left without a penny.  This is a disgrace and very insensitive on the part of the management which should have learned over the years how to treat people.  The lack of consideration of the welfare of students has been evident for years, particularly the last two years.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers did not address the excellent report by Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien, for which I commend her, and defended the situation in Letterkenny and the chairman.  I believe they are defending the indefensible.  It is easy to attack the students and staff. Students and lecturers in the college are easy targets for politicians.  Why did the chairman resign?  The best he could do in his report was to attack the drug problem in the college.</P>

      <P>This debate is very important.  I bow to the Members from Letterkenny who have had knowledge of this problem for a long time.  I concur with their statements on the important role which has been played by the college. From my long experience of the business I was in before I became a Member of the House in 1982, I know that the chairman, during his 40 years in public life, has established a reputation of being a person of great integrity.  He was a very distinguished Member of this House and made valuable contributions to it.  The junior Members may not know that he holds the record for the longest and second longest speeches in the Oireachtas.  He is an intellectual and a man of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last few months I have read about and closely followed the problem which exists in Letterkenny.  The chairman <Col N="1000" /> took corrective action and now has to bear the brunt of a report which, in my opinion, should be re-examined.  I concur with the call by Senator McGowan, the father of the House, for an independent commission to further investigate the matter.  He placed before the House certain files which contain extra information about the investigation. These were not sought and could make a valuable contribution to changing the conclusions which were reached. Everyone knows it is difficult to run a business but the chairman of this distinguished body has been an extremely successful businessman and has made a valuable contribution to the life of Letterkenny for 30 years or more.  I have had personal experience of his efficiency and generosity in providing the community with the benefits of the establishment with which he has been closely associated through the years and with a social life which was not in the area when he started there many years ago.  His profession brings him into contact with young people on a daily basis. One cannot cast aside the service he has given to the community.  For many years, too, he has given his time to organising evening activities for young people, thereby keeping them out of danger.  I value his opinion.</P>
    <P>Having read the reports on this issue in the newspapers and listened to the contributions here today, I am convinced that this has come to light as a result of the role played and the contributions made by this gentleman as chairman.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the people of Letterkenny, the public representatives from Donegal here today and everyone associated with the college are disturbed by news of some happenings in the college in respect of which we are not speaking about everyone there, but about a few students and a small minority of the teaching staff.  The teaching staff in Letterkenny Regional Technical College are as good as the teachers anywhere else in the country and the <Col N="1001" /> students in Donegal, who will make their contributions to the affairs of the State as our ambassadors abroad, are as good as other students throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the report came to its conclusions when various alarming things were happening there Various activities, as Senator McGowan said, were organised by people who spent thousands of pounds without getting value for money.  No one can condone that.  It was an enlightening experience to listen to the quotations read by Senator McGowan during his contribution. There is something seriously wrong in Letterkenny Regional Technical College which is damaging it.  I agree with Senator McGowan's conclusions.</P>
    <P>I have vast experience in the entertainment world and in this case I was amazed to find that, for example, cheques were often written for £2,000 on the day after a band's engagement although the band had been paid in cash the night before.  That would not happen in most areas, it is not usual procedure. I also understand that 33 discos took place in 1992-93 and 1993-94, but only 16 of these were accounted for.  If all these allegations are true, I do not know how any Senator can ask us to accept the report's findings.  There are major discrepancies and issues here. These eminent people were not investigated or asked questions, therefore the examiner did not have a fair opportunity to meet them.</P>
    <P>The Members from Donegal may say they know more about the problem than do people in Dublin.  However, as regards drugs, I am not aware of any college where a students' booklet was published which had such a damning effect as that which was issued in Letterkenny Regional Technical College.  I know little about drugs, but the Senator who spoke before me would know about them because of his profession. This booklet, which was in circulation in Letterkenny Regional Technical College <Col N="1002" /> for a number of years and which many college principals must have known about, states:</P>
    <P>To minimise the very real risks of acid:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the first time you take it use only a small amount &mdash; perhaps ? of a tab.</P>
    <P>(2)  Do not take it alone, or with people you don't trust emotionally. And remember, if you drop a tab at 11 o'clock in the evening you will be peaking at around 2-3 in the morning when friends are trying to sleep.</P>

      <P>It is a disgrace.  The Students Union is teaching trash to our young people.  There are two former presidents of that union in the Dáil at present.  It is no wonder these thoughts are planted in their minds.  A former Member of this House, who has a well run establishment in County Donegal, would not allow, tolerate or consider making a living through such activities. I commend him for it here today and for the stance he has taken in bringing to light the actions and activities in this college.</P>
      <P>I could talk for a long time, but Senator McGowan has highlighted this issue and many other things which I did not know were happening in that college. I commend the chairman who is not a political hack.  He could make a living from many other industries, instead of serving the public voluntarily one day a week, as those of us, who are county councillors, do.  We do not get anything for ourselves, but we give our time free of charge for the common good of the people in the areas we represent. How dare the press categorise us.  There is no one from the press in the Gallery this evening, that shows how concerned the media is.  If it is bad news, the media wants it in abundance, but if it is good news, it does not want to know.</P>
      <P>I intend to introduce to this House a code of practice which must be adhered to if it can be legislated for because the media at present seems to be moving into the trash tabloid area.  The English press are dumping their magazines in Ireland and we must follow suit by being alarmist.  The press coverage given to this college has been negative. Senator McGowan quoted from various cuttings in the newspapers here today, it is scandalous reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never had to make such a strong speech in the House in my 12 years as a Member, but I hope that the <Col N="1004" /> person who tried to put this college back on a sound footing, by keeping students away from drugs and leading a life which we led in our youth in the 1960s and 1970s, will not be victimised for telling the truth and exposing the various wrongs in the college.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most extraordinary affair.  In theory, we are discussing two separate pieces of legislation but we are actually discussing the affairs of a regional technical college.  It is astonishing that it should have come to this.  I have little quibble with regard to the legislation itself.  No right minded person could begin to argue a case, if there is one, against the idea of gender balance. It seems that some of the steps the Minister and Minister of State have taken here are prudent and timely. However, the issue of the commission raises other questions.  The three previous speakers have referred to their view of the factors which underlie the establishment of the commission and the truly extraordinary affairs which took place in the regional technical college in Donegal over a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am profoundly disturbed that any educational institution should have become involved in such a maelstrom. Politics are very much to the fore in this matter.  It is interesting that the headline in one of our newspapers this week referred to the ex-chairman, Councillor McGlinchey, as a political hack.  I am not here to defend that man.  I am here to defend all politicians and politically connected people who take public office.  I have no experience of the board of that regional technical college under that or any other chairman.  It was my great pleasure to serve for a time on the board of Carlow regional technical college under the chairmanship of a gentleman from your party, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. When he could have been replaced as chair when my party were in the majority, I refused to stand and contest that position against that councillor because I believed he had done a phenomenal job, as many of our councillors do around the country in all <Col N="1005" /> walks of life, irrespective of politics. They serve this nation as well as they can.  It is profoundly wrong, unjust and unforgivable that simply because they are politically connected they should be labelled, as has happened in a national newspaper and to the discredit of a politician in the other House, as political hacks, a word which is derogatory and intended to hurt.  It also clouds the issues and they are complex in this case.</P>
    <P>There has been an interesting argument in the other House recently about whistleblowers.  This term was invented in American public administration at the end of the Watergate era.  The wrongdoings of the administration at that time were brought to the fore by public servants who were rightly and properly offended by the way the State institutions were being misused by people in political office.  The concept of whistleblower legislation was introduced in the United States to protect patriotic public servants who believed that the only way they could protect the public good was by bringing to the attention of the media or of politicians things which they believed to be wrong within the administration.</P>
    <P>The ex-chairman of the regional technical college in Donegal would very much fall into the category of a person who, motivated by the highest public objectives, tried to correct what he believed was wrong.  From what I have read of this affair and having read the Hederman-O'Brien Report and the attendant publicity, it seems that there was a great deal wrong for a long period of time in the regional technical college in Donegal.  Senator McGowan is an ex-chairman of Letterkenny regional technical college as is Deputy Blaney.  Both are on record as outlining long-standing difficulties in that institution.</P>
    <P>The immediate past chairman of the regional technical college came into office and apparently took it on himself to try, within his capacity, to sort out this extraordinarily complex set of affairs that already existed.  He became, in the classic concept, a whistleblower. He wrote as follows to the Minister for <Col N="1006" /> Education on 17 October, 1993 and spoke about the student representative council:</P>
    <P>Since becoming chairman, I have always insisted that at finance meetings, every line would be thoroughly examined and explained.  Indeed, some of the things I highlighted would disturb your officials.  I adopted this same procedure with the students' accounts.  In the second week of June, Messrs. K and G [I will not mention their names because they are private individuals and cannot be here to defend themselves] asked to see me.  They wanted me to agree that a staff member prepare the accounts [again I will not name the individual] instead of an accountant.  I refused.  It was obvious to me from the discussion that there was something seriously wrong.</P>
    <P>The chairman went on to outline the affairs of the discos operated by the students:</P>
    <P>The student discos were held in the Golden Grill, which is owned by me. The paid ex-cashier on duty for all student functions was ... [he mentions a staff member here, a person he speaks of in the most glowing terms who was of the highest and impeccable integrity and was extremely reliable.]  His job was to collect the admission fee, pay the expenses and put the profit on an invoice giving full details in an envelope and then hand it over to either Mr. K or G.  The accuracy of the invoices kept by the staff member was never queried.  Following my meetings with students, I asked this staff member if she kept a record of the student discos and she told me she did.</P>
    <P>The ex-chairman further outlines the details:</P>
    <P>The list shows that in 1992 and 1993, the union made a profit of £31,000 on discos.  Before going to the accountants, K rang my son and told <Col N="1007" /> him that he had mislaid some of [this lady's] invoices and asked could my son give him duplicates.  My son, unaware of the records, told him that he did not have the figures.  K then said that he could produce these figures from bank lodgements.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the points the Senator is making, but I again ask him to try to avoid referring to people who can be identified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you will accept that I am trying to do that, a Leas-Chathaoirleach. Most of those involved in this issue are of the highest integrity and have tried to serve the State well.</P>
      <P>There was serious misaccounting in the matter of the student discos.  The then chairman of Letterkenny regional technical college tried to bring it to attention and deal with it in the context of the regional technical college itself. When he failed to do that, and this was obviously at the nub of all of these accusations, it was brought to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The letter continues:</P>
      <P>The accounts were presented at our meeting on 6 September.  The accountant stated that &ldquo;The system of control over cash receipts and payments was not however, sufficient to enable us to independently confirm that all cash receipts and payments were properly recorded.  Where appropriate, therefore, we have to accept the assurances from the two officials of the students union that all transactions were included in the records.&rdquo;  [The accounts were signed by a named official.]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accounts suggest that the profit on the discos of £22,000 &mdash; the figure mentioned &mdash; is £9,000 short of the actual profit which was taken at the door and accounted for.  The letter goes on to say that &ldquo;The most serious aspect is that there is an obvious deficiency of approximately £15,000 in the capitation and college subsidy.&rdquo;  When one adds <Col N="1008" /> those two figures together, the discrepancy comes to at least £24,000.</P>
    <P>All of this was brought to the attention of the Department of Education in a letter to the Minister which was acknowledged by her in her usual courteous manner some days later.  The then chairman offered to go to the Department of Education, bring any documentation he had and lay it before the Department.  He was never asked to do so because a few weeks after this letter was written, Miriam Hederman-O'Brien was appointed to undertake her own study.  The intriguing point is that none of the factors dealt with here appears in her report.  They do not appear to have undergone, from my knowledge of the affair, anything like the degree of scrutiny or attention they deserve.  The reality is that the previous chairman of the regional technical college, having tried first to resolve these issues at local level, brought them to the attention of the Department of Education 13 months ago.  This man is now being eviscerated in the public press, abused by politicians in this and the other House and made the scapegoat for all that was wrong there.  However he deserves our gratitude, because in a public, elected position he sought to bring to attention what he believed was wrong.</P>
    <P>This is all significant because one of the suggestions in the Hederman-O'Brien report is that he was over involved in the management affairs of that college.  Reading the report and the other material available it must be clear to anyone with an open mind that there was effectively no management system in that college and that very substantial amounts of money are not properly accounted for.  I am not saying they were taken, I do not know what happened, but very substantial amounts of money which should have been taken into account were not.</P>
    <P>There are other affairs mentioned here which are frightening.  There is a suggestion, for example, that cheques were routinely signed by a member of staff and handed over.  Cheques, totalling <Col N="1009" /> £10,000 were bounced right, left and centre.  There is a frightening suggestion, which I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to investigate, that the chairman drew to the attention of the examiner &mdash; a month after his appointment &mdash; a cheque which, to say the least, was questionable but there is no reference to it in the examiner's report.</P>
    <P>Specific aspects of the examiner's report are important.  For example, there are suggestions that the chairman and another member of the board did not comply with guidelines issued by the Department on conflict of interest.  I regarded those as very serious allegations, but the chairman's response makes it very clear he believes he has complied with the second schedule.  The bank mentioned in the examiner's report also complied with the Act.  Perhaps there is a difference of opinion here, or a difference of the presentation of the facts.  I do not know the explanation for these differences, but it strikes me that the differences between the two viewpoints demand further elaboration and explanation.  We should, after all, inform ourselves in all our debates and deliberations by considerations of justice.  The previous chairman of the regional technical college is entitled to justice, like any person in this State.  The fact that he was a publicly elected official, does not mean he can become a target for individuals who set themselves up in judgment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address other fundamental issues in this report.  For example, the Hederman-O'Brien report demands explanation.</P>
    <P>I was so concerned about these affairs that I wrote in the following terms to the Minister for Education on 8 November 1994.</P>
    <P>There were a number of specific points which have come to my attention and which I believe I would like to see pursued.  I know from the press reports that there is some criticism that the ex-Chairman became &ldquo;too involved&rdquo; in management.  I was very surprised at this comment which <Col N="1010" /> appeared in a number of press statements. I would have imagined that if a chairman of a board believed that something was fundamentally wrong and that the management structures which were in place were not handling the deficiencies, the chairman would have some considerable responsibilities to highlight the deficiencies.</P>
    <P>As I understand it.  Councillor McGlinchey, while chairman of the regional technical college, attempted to do this.  I understand that he wrote to your office a year ago offering to come to Dublin and answer any questions that existed in the Department regarding the operations of the regional technical college.  Apart from an acknowledgement he did not, as I understand it, hear anything further from your Department.  This, given the subsequent revelations regarding the regional technical colleges strikes me as very strange indeed, as I would have imagined that a Government Department, aware that something was happening in a body which operated under the aegis of that Department would be more than anxious to have every possible piece of information regarding the problems.</P>
    <P>Details relating to the financial affairs of the students' union which in my view are at the very heart of the evident decline in the relationship between the same students' union and the chairman of the regional technical college would seem to me to be either overlooked or totally ignored in the examiner's report.  For example, it is my information that the Chairman has sent the examiner a photocopy of the bounced cheque which had issued in March 1994, a month after the examiner had begun her examination. There is no reference to this in the examiner's report.</P>
    <P>Another matter which does not seem to get the attention which it would require in the examiner's report was the role of a specific officer in the college [I will not mention his name, he was a staff member.] <Col N="1011" /> who was responsible for cosigning cheques and overseeing the Students' Union accounts.  He has admitted signing blank cheques.  He has also admitted, I am informed, that his name appeared on cheques which he had not signed.  He has further admitted that most of the cheques he signed were made out to cash.  [What does the Minister think of that?]  It seems that the same officer also accepts that £10,000 in cheques issued by the union were bounced by the bank.  This should surely be a matter of some public concern as considerable amount of funds of the Students' Union come, after all, <i>via</i> the grants from public funds.</P>
    <P>Clearly the Students' Union in question was handling its accounts in a remarkably slipshod, if not a bizarre manner, yet from the public commentary the villain of the piece seems to be the chairman of the regional technical college board who sought, in my mind correctly, to ensure that things were done in a less slipshod manner.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about just the ex-chairman of the regional technical college, we are talking about every public representative who takes over chairmanship of any agency in this State. They are entitled to our protection and respect.  They are entitled to a fair hearing and, by any objective standards, the ex-chairman of the regional technical college in Letterkenny has not had a fair hearing.  I hope that we will have a full discussion on the Hederman-O'Brien report.</P>

      <P>As the two buzz words seem to be &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; and &ldquo;accountability&rdquo;, the outgoing chairman should be honoured for the way he highlighted the gross inaccuracies and carry-on in this college.  We seem to have put his head on the chopper because he brought it to the notice of the general public.  It is hypocritical to argue that everything should be out in <Col N="1012" /> the open, when we want to crucify the man who highlighted the problem.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why there was only one person on the commission set up to inquire into the workings of this college.  Why were none of the public representatives on the board of management asked for their opinions?  Something very wrong seems to be going on and will have to be tackled.  There seems to be a view that anybody who is not a public representative can make no mistake but, very often, they make the biggest mistakes.  We seem to disregard public representatives, yet they are elected by the public and are accountable to them.</P>
      <P>Anyone that has been elected for over 40 years by the public knows that the electorate has changed a great deal during that time.  They must be doing something right to be re-elected so many times.  According to what I have here, at a meeting of the board of management of the college on 27 September 1987, because of the failure of the principal of the college to act as instructed, the board of management decided that before the college would undertake any outside work, approval would have to come from the board of management but this was not adhered to.  Is the previous Chairman to be attacked because he insisted that this would have to be adhered to?  Some £100,000 worth of equipment was bought by the college on a leasing arrangement without a tender, a quotation or an approach to the board.  Would a county council or local authority allow that to happen?  Why was it allowed here and why do we crucify the man who has highlighted this?</P>
      <P>At another meeting the senior officer submitted a request for a Rank Zerox 5053 copier which cost £14,500.  He claimed he needed it immediately.  The Chairman objected, got other quotes and bought a similar machine for £11,000.  Who was to get the £3,500 which this man saved?  Why were quotations not sought in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Chairman has proved himself in business.  As someone who worked with him for the past 20 years <Col N="1013" /> on the health board, I know he questions expenses and costs incurred.  Now because he does so, we condemn him. We must ask ourselves many searching questions.  Do we want Chairmen who are prepared to do the unpopular thing and show up inaccuracies and wrong-doings or do we want Chairmen who will take the line of least resistance and close their eyes to cover-ups?</P>
    <P>I saw the great work he did in the health area.  I have opposed the abuse of alcohol and drugs over the years.  The outgoing Chairman was the first man at a meeting of the North Western Health Board 15 years ago to say that it was not alcohol but the abuse of drugs which we need to stamp out.  He was ahead of his time.  He took positive action.  He had the courage to bring in the gardaí and have six drug pushers barred from the premises.  Is that a crime?</P>

      <P>Two of them were arrested and possibly charged.  Is that why we are crucifying the man?  It is scandalous that a man of his calibre who had the guts to begin to clear out a rotten system should be castigated.  If there were more men like him, there would be fewer drug problems.  I am sure many parents of students attending that college are singing his praises for saving and protecting their families from the curse of drugs and for clearing up matters at the college.</P>
      <P>As Senator McGowan said, some people have been doing outside work when they should have been working in the college.  This should be looked at. Some colleges have set up companies where lecturers provide classes after school hours.  They are charging students for these classes which should be held during school hours and which should be on the curriculum.  We need to clean up our third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outgoing Chairman, a former Senator, will go down in history as the man who turned the first sod to clear out the ruin in our thirds level institutions. <Col N="1014" /> This job must be finished. Donegal is no exception, this probably happens throughout the country.  I do not know why anyone should be given a contract without sealed tenders first being opened at a public meeting as in local authority and health boards.  An organisation should not be able to give thousands of pounds to its friends in the trade.  In this case £3,500 was added to the price of a piece of equipment.  Who was to get this money?  I applaud the actions of the outgoing Chairman.  If there were more people like him, we would have fewer public services bills to pay.</P>

      <P>I commiserate with much of what was said.  As regards drugs, I agree with what was said about advice given and I have seen this in other regional technical colleges and universities. That does not imply that students use drugs, but information given to them is not very helpful.  The students in Letterkenny regional technical college have moved their disco from Leo's to Hotel Clanree.  I do not know whether they take drugs but they certainly drink because Tia Maria, vodka, peach schnapps, scotch, Carling Black Label and Rolling Rock are all £1.  That is certainly an inducement to students. We read reports in the past week about young people and drink and it is appalling that they should be induced to drink in this fashion.</P>
      <P>This debate is about somebody trying to discredit the former Chairman of the regional technical college.  They will not get away with it because everything is on the record and above board.  The Chairman has informed both the Minister and the examiner, Dr. Hederman O'Brien, of everything which took place.  There are some facts which should be placed on the record of the House of which Members may not be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The student representative council in the Letterkenny regional technical college consists of a president and two vice presidents &mdash; there is no executive committee. When a student pays £100 registration, <Col N="1015" /> the governing body hands over £25 to the union to be used for the benefit of the students.  I do not believe there is a legal obligation to do so, although in 1992 the college paid £36,400.  The board of management gave £1,500 in May and £8,500 later.  Most colleges do not bother to do this.  Payment has always been subject to proper audited accounts being presented.  All cheques had to be signed by a lecturer, by the president or vice president, although as we heard, one of those involved signed blank cheques.</P>
    <P>The accounts which should have been ready in April only reached the board in September.  The former Chairman always insisted at finance committee meetings that they be examined line by line.  He quickly discovered that there was something grievously wrong.  A previous speaker suggested that this arose because the students shifted their custom from one disco to another and we should call a spade a spade &mdash; the students left the Golden Grill which is owned by the former chairman. However, I do not believe that is the reason.</P>
    <P>From 1992 to 1993 the students made a profit of £31,000 on their discos, which is a great amount of money.  When the accounts were presented on 6 September, the accountant stated that the system of control over cash receipts and payments was not sufficient to enable him to independently confirm that all cash receipts and payments were properly recorded and that where appropriate he had to accept assurances from the president and vice president that all transactions were included in the records and that the accounts were signed by the president.</P>
    <P>Those accounts suggested that the profit from discos was £22,000.  Where did the figure of £31,000 come from? That was the figure recorded by someone who the former chairman described as a woman of impeccable integrity and extremely reliable who took the money at the discos, namely Senator Maloney's <Col N="1016" /> sister.  There is an obvious deficiency of approximately £15,000.</P>

      <P>I see.  There is a deficiency of approximately £15,000 in the capitation fees.  This would mean that the total discrepancy is probably £24,000.  It has been suggested that the former chairman should not get involved in trying to clear up this matter. However, it is his duty as chairman &mdash; in fact, he is bound to do it.  The college solicitors issued a letter from which I will quote as it is important that we realise what they are doing.  It states:</P>
      <P>Mr. McGlinchey, chairman of the regional technical college, would have been in dereliction of his duty if he failed to bring to the attention of the governing body information in his possession which indicated that there were serious deficiencies in the accounts and figures, which tended to show that all of the funds received by the SRC are not recorded in the books of the council.</P>
      <P>Yet this man is being pilloried in public. It is a common thing these days to try a man when he has no chance of defending himself.  However, he is putting up a good defence and I do not think anything will stick to him.  He had to take matters in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cassidy spoke of the former chairman's record as a legislator in this <Col N="1017" /> House and his integrity.  I have known him for many years and I may be biased in my appraisal of him.  An objective appraisal would say that this man did nothing wrong.  In fact, the examiner will testify &mdash; it is number 5.6.13 in her report &mdash; that he was less than satisfied with the principle of separate accounts. She received a letter from him in April 1994 which alluded to the existence of a separate account in another bank. However, she omitted to mention that he sent her a photocopy of a bounced cheque which was issued in March 1994, a month after she began her examination. She obviously saw nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>In a letter to the Minister he outlined all the problems which existed and he got an acknowledgement from the then Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach.  The letter contains the facts, some of which I outlined, and was sent on 17 October 1993.  An acknowledgement came back from her speedily, as one would expect from an efficient Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no good in going on about some of the things which students might or might not do.  Students fight abortion issues or whatever and they come and go and leave somebody else to clean up the mess.  This may be a similar situation. I am not blaming the students but some person there obviously signed blank cheques.  I do not know the person's name and I would not wish to allude to it even if I did.  However, there is something fishy about this &mdash; there is something rotten in the state of Denmark.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGowan that we need a much more detailed examination than the one which has been done. The newspaper headlines screamed for the head of one man who did his best to make sure that things were straightened up, not the other way about.  I am sure he was sorry to lose the business from the students when they moved.  Senator Maloney suggested that the students were discriminated against.  I do not know whether they were.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> Senator Maloney also suggested that the people in the Data Protection Agency may have been got at, if I quote him correctly.  That is a terrible thing to suggest.  I do not know anything about the people in the Data Protection Agency but I doubt if they were got at. I am sure that all of these matters when examined in the clear light of day will vindicate the integrity of the person who is supposedly on trial.  I would like to see a more thorough &mdash; I will not say more independent &mdash; examination of all the facts before we reach any conclusions on a commission going in to clean up the affair.  That has already been attempted by the former chairman.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions to the debate on these Bills.  In particular, I thank those Senators who have supported these Bills and acknowledge the universal praise for the generally high standards in the regional technical college and Dublin Institute of Technology sectors.</P>
      <P>I also wish to acknowledge the cooperation of the House in recognising the urgency of bringing forward proposals to resolve the difficulties in Letterkenny regional technical college.  I can readily agree with Senator McGowan that the majority of staff in the college are of the highest standard. It is in their interest and that of the students and the community that the proposals in these Bills are brought forward.</P>
      <P>I also concur with what Senator Roche said.  It is unfortunate nowadays that politicians have become scapegoats. The vast majority of politicians are hardworking, conscientious, honest people.  It is sad that they are constantly open to ridicule and become immediate scapegoats.</P>
      <P>A number of questions have been raised which I cannot answer but which I would like to answer at a future date. Perhaps the new Minister for Education could apply herself or himself to getting the answers to the questions raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> During the debate it was claimed that the Minister would not be answerable to anyone in the composition of the commission. The Minister is, of course, always answerable to the Dáil for his or her actions.  In the case of the commission to be appointed to Letterkenny regional technical college, the Minister has already stated that the overriding concern is to bring the college back to the high standard which obtains in other colleges.  The composition of the commission will be decided solely with that aim in mind.  I believe that is what we all want.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter referred to the need for additional higher education facilities. I draw Senators' attention to the fact that the future development of the higher education sector is being considered by the steering committee established under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority.  The steering committee will prepare projections to the year 2015 of the total potential enrolments in higher education and the corresponding needs of the sector to facilitate these enrolments.</P>
    <P>The committee will carry out a comprehensive analysis of higher education requirements.  Its remit includes the overall needs of society and the economy as well as regional, socio-economic and equality considerations, together with the needs of students and the world of work.  It will also focus on the appropriate provisions for mature students as well as the need to provide access to third level education for disadvantaged students.  The work of the committee will have to be informed by, and take account of, budgetary and financial considerations. The steering committee's recommendations will be carefully considered when they become available.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Members.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1021" />
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2 between lines 20 and 21 to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Each person proposed to be appointed by the Minister under subsection (1) of this section shall appear before the Select Committee on Social Affairs in public hearing before such appointment is confirmed by the Minister.  The Committee may submit its opinion in the matter of any particular appointment to the Minister who shall have regard to that opinion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I propose this amendment in the interest of openness and transparency and all those wonderful things about which we are talking currently.  This is one area where Ministers have enormous power.  It could be said that they are answerable to the Dáil but the fact remains that the appointees to these position are, generally speaking, faceless people who are never seen by either the Members of this House or the public.</P>
      <P>The public are very disaffected about appointments to State boards and commissions and other things which Ministers have to do in the course of their daily work.  The public are convinced that there is a certain amount of skulduggery going on.  I do not necessarily hold that view but this amendment has been put down in the interest of the public who are disaffected.  If the Minister accepts this amendment, it will open the door in a gentle way for the public and Members of this House to see exactly what the Minister is doing when he makes these appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no veto involved.  I made sure that the Select Committee on Social Affairs could not have a veto in respect of these appointments.  That would be a step too far.  I framed the amendment in a way that would make it broadly acceptable.  I assume that many Members of the House will sympathise with it and will take its intention for what it is worth.  There is no innuendo <Col N="1022" /> implied in the amendment.  I am trying to introduce openness and transparency &mdash; which everybody is talking about &mdash; into a system that is not satisfactory in the eyes of the public.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I talked about how such appointments are made.  The selection process is conducted by the Minister. There is no competition.  The ordinary citizen never gets the call or the brown or white envelope offering a position without competition.  This amendment should be the beginning of a complete change in the way State boards are appointed and Ministers make such appointments.  It would be a welcome change; the public would welcome it.</P>
    <P>The people selected by the Minister for appointment to the commission would appear before the Select Committee on Social Affairs in a public hearing.  That would give the public an opportunity to see exactly who these faceless people are and to be confident, after a simple and straightforward hearing, that they have the ability to carry out their functions under the terms of their appointments.  I do not think that is too much to ask.  In a democracy it is certainly desirable.  Too many people are disaffected at present for one reason or another and this issue goes to the heart of that disaffection.  People often wrongly believe that Ministers are up to all sorts of skulduggery when in fact they are not.  We should be open and transparent about this.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned who is appointed to a board.  I am not concerned whether they are Fianna Fáil, Labour or Fine Gael supporters.  Who they are or what their background is does not matter to me.  I just want to be satisfied that they can carry out their functions.  That is the main concern about which I and the public want to be satisfied.  That would eliminate the innuendo that people are appointed to boards because of who they are and the number of years' service they have given to a political party. The appointment is seen as a thank you and it is believed that the appointees have nothing to offer.  In very many <Col N="1023" /> cases that is false and unfair.  If the appointment is brought into the open and a public hearing is held before the particular committee &mdash; in this case the Select Committee on Social Affairs &mdash; such innuendo would disappear because there would be no grounds for it.  The amendment would inject transparency into a system that needs it.</P>
    <P>I expect the Labour Party to support this amendment because it has put itself forward as a champion in this area.  On Second Stage, I expressed scepticism about the Labour Party.  In my opinion and from the information I have gathered, the practice and the promise of the Labour Party are different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments relate substantially to amendment No. 2.  I hope the Labour Party's practice in future is nearer to the promise it continues to make.  This Bill was introduced by a Labour Party Minister and I fail to see any commitment in the Bill to openness and transparency.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.  Let us break new ground and show the people that we are serious, that we have nothing to hide, that these appointments are made in a bona fide manner and that the appointees do not have a question mark over them.  That is the substance of what I am trying to achieve.  I hope the Minister will agree.</P>
      <P>Questions in the Dáil make the Minister accountable to a degree but that is not visible to the public.  The public cannot see exactly what is going on.  People hold important positions in such bodies and the public must see that these appointments are bona fide.  That will be the case if my amendment is accepted.  If the wording of the amendment is not suitable we can change it. Consequent changes can be made to the rest of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment in the spirit in which I have proposed it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">

      <P>I totally oppose the amendment.  The insinuation is that nobody is clean or honest besides the proposer and his party.  The ordinary member of the public realises that the Fine Gael Party and one or two other parties are disgruntled and dissatisfied, that they are clinging and hanging on in the hope that somebody might recognise them.  This is another anti-Government suggestion.  Any appointments made under the new legislation will be in an open and honest manner.  It is inferred that such appointments are not democratic.  They are.  They come before the House, the intentions are clearly stated and ultimately the Minister will be responsible for them.  I hope we will soon return to normality.</P>
      <P>However, I have only one reservation. I hope the appointees will have qualifications in management rather than in education because those qualifications will be necessary.  To say that appointees should go before a public hearing is utterly ridiculous.  The amendment does not bear consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions relating to the involvement of the Oireachtas in the appointment of the commission already give the Houses a major role in any appointment. This role, for the most part, will be exercised before an appointment takes effect.  In the unusual circumstances where either House cannot deal with the matter within 28 days, there is a further safeguard provision.  This will enable the House to annual an appointment within 21 sitting days.</P>
      <P>Given this comprehensive involvement of the Oireachtas I do not think it appropriate that the House should exercise a discretion over the composition of the commission.  This is a function proper to the Minister of the day who is ultimately responsible for his or her decision to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the contention that the Minister is taking enormous power onto himself or herself in these given circumstances. Everybody accepts, and it was clear from the contributions on Second <Col N="1025" /> Stage, that it was absolutely essential to take appropriate and quick action in the circumstances.  There is no other authority aside from the appropriate Minister to take such action.  Nobody doubts that action should be taken now and that it should not be delayed.  I assure the House that the person or persons will have the competence, integrity and the independence to do the job.</P>
    <P>Moving away from that aspect, this country has been well served in a range of areas by publicly minded people who sat on committees and went on boards to do jobs in the national interest.  They could have decided to play golf or to take an easier role but they decided to come in on the invitation of the Government of the day &mdash; and this goes for successive Governments &mdash; to do essential work.  In the main, looking back at the history of this country and making a comparison with developments in most other European countries, we have been very well served.  I reject the contention that the public is afraid and unwilling to accept the nominations put forward by successive Governments to carry out essential tasks where necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter is putting forward a view, which admittedly is held by some sectors, that there should be complete and absolute independence and that everyone should be screened before they undertake any job.  While that would happen in an ideal world, it is not practical.  In the main, not many people would be willing to undergo that type of intensive slaughter.  These positions are not worth much financially but these people are willing to give their time and expertise in the national interest.  Their integrity should not be subject to an inquisition of that nature.</P>
    <P>With regard to having a competition for those posts, we only intervene in extraordinary circumstances where something has gone wrong and needs to be rectified immediately.  For example, if there was a competition, somebody in a post must leave it.  They must let their employer know they will not be available. <Col N="1026" /> They must give due notification and it could take two or three months before they were available to do the job. We would not have that amount of time on our hands.  Why are we pressing forward with this legislation?  Why did the House agree to take all Stages today, which is unusual?  The answer is that there are unusual circumstances where intervention of a particular type is needed to deal with a problem.</P>
    <P>I reject the notion of faceless people. Far too often in my public life, which spans 25 years and has had its ups and downs, I have heard people in the public service and other places referred to as faceless bureaucrats.  I have had the proud honour of serving in six different Departments with these so called faceless people.  I have not always agreed with them, or been served as well as I might in every circumstance, but in general I have found they are competent people with tremendous dedication, who work overtime, arrive on time with little regard to what they might be paid for it.  I do not regard them as faceless people.  I stand over them as public servants who do a difficult job and often cannot stand up for themselves.  It is very easy to paint a picture which the public will like without giving an explanation. I have been re-elected on a number of occasions by telling people what I honestly believe about many of those people and I hope I will always be able to do so.</P>
    <P>Openness and transparency are not the prerogative of any one party.  There is a view that everything should be open and transparent.  For example, I make decisions in my capacity as Minister for the Environment &mdash; a role to which I am more accustomed &mdash; concerning halting sites and the public vehemently oppose those decisions.  I provide £3 million to local authorities for halting sites but the public oppose me left, right and centre. However, I will continue to make those decisions as long as I have that responsibility because the overriding consideration is the people affected.  Given their lifestyle, educational opportunities, asthmatic children, lack of health services <Col N="1027" /> and the fact that they are discommoded is so many ways, the overriding point is that in the national interest I should take those decisions, even though the public perception is that they should not be taken.  People say they want this problem solved, but not near them.  We should be truthful.  The public does not always agree with decisions taken on national questions and individual circumstances.  The buck rests somewhere and in these circumstances, unfortunately for Ireland at present, it rests with me.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter's point may be genuine and I have no doubt that it is. However, he will appreciate that in these circumstances, there is not the scope for this type of intervention.  It would exercise too much time in dealing with the problems we face.  However, he should be happy that as a result of the meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs &mdash; although I cannot say this categorically &mdash; I do not know of any other Bill passed in the Houses of Oireachtas which provides for a 28 day delay before a decision taken can be executed, with an opportunity for the House to annul it during that time.  Most decisions are taken and implemented and can only be annulled subsequently by the House.  However, in this instance, decisions taken &mdash; that is, in all other circumstances apart from the Letterkenny case &mdash; could only be implemented 28 days later following confirmation in the House.</P>
    <P>The Senator should be happy that a major breakthrough has been made.  I say this based on my broad experience, but it may be the case in other circumstances of which I am not aware.  It is an indication of the willingness on my part and on the part of my officials to meet the general concerns outlined while, at the same time, leaving scope for immediate intervention in a sensitive operation.  I assure the House that the competence, integrity and independence of the person or persons concerned <Col N="1028" /> will match the requirements necessary in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I must reject the vast majority of the argument put up against accepting the amendment.  The Minister said that appearing before a committee would be something of a slaughter. Many Members serve on committees. Every week, people appear before us and they are examined and questioned on various matters.  I have never yet seen a situation where a person appearing before a committee ended up in circumstances that could be described as slaughter.</P>

      <P>I have no trouble dealing with it.  There is a huge credibility gap between Government action and public perception.  This has existed for a long time and has not just arisen in recent weeks.  The electorate has changed dramatically and is much more mobile. People are loosening up in terms of how they vote.  The electorate is disturbed and has been showing these signs for a long time.  Given that the country is changing we have to change also; keeping our heads in the sand is not good enough.  The Minister said this is an emergency.  Is it the case that this House could deal with legislation in an emergency but the Select Committee on Social Affairs could not?</P>

He said that this amendment is full of insinuations; where are they?  He said it was full of implications, somehow or other taking away the good name of politicians. Where are they?

      <P>The Senator might get used to the idea as we talk about it, and he might find it is a good idea.  I said Ministers have to make these appointments and most of the time there is absolutely nothing wrong.  However, I want the public to see what goes on, and the Minister being subject to Dáil questioning is not good enough.  Another kind of transparency, where it is possible, should be introduced.  That is the basis for my argument: it is nothing to do with tripping up any politician.  Ministers have to make appointments to boards and have to set up commissions from time to time and, as the Minister says, in the vast majority of cases it is good sound work.  The difficulty is that it is not seen as such: the public perception is entirely different to that which the Minister suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> The public is completely disaffected and has been showing signs of that for a long time.  The public does not believe that politicians &mdash; who we all agree work hard and long hours &mdash; are doing anything of importance.  It has probably made up its mind that we are doing the wrong things.  We all agree that we are not looked on as being as respectable as we used to be.</P>
    <P>We have a changing electorate and we have to change also.  This amendment seeks to bring about a change which would give the public a glimpse through the window.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 27, after &ldquo;until&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, following a debate on the order,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is another amendment which refers to this section.  If this amendment was made the section would read:</P>
      <P>Every order made under subsection (1), other than the order to which subsection (10) relates, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and it shall not have effect unless and until, following a debate on the order, a resolution has been passed by each House confirming the order....</P>
      <P>This is similar to an amendment tabled previously and it has probably been examined from all angles on Committee Stage before the select committee and been rejected.  I tabled it again to give the Houses an opportunity to have a discussion on the matter because laying an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas and having a resolution passed without discussion is not the correct practice.  The resolution should be passed in the course of a discussion in the Houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister's decision should come under scrutiny as much as possible and I am sure no Minister would mind such scrutiny being brought to bear on particular decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would have the effect of requiring a debate to be held on an order for the appointment of a commission.  I would consider it inappropriate to seek to constrain either House of the Oireachtas in the ordering of its business.  It is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine whether they wish to debate a resolution. The amendment would also mean that an order would require confirmation <Col N="1032" /> of both Houses before it could take effect.  In general, this would happen.</P>
      <P>However, it is both necessary and prudent to provide for a situation where either House cannot deal with the matter in a reasonable period of time.  This could happen, for instance, during the summer recess.  Excessive delay could be extremely damaging to an institution. The Bill as now drafted strikes a reasonable balance between the rights and the role of the Oireachtas and the needs of an institution in difficulties.  Thus, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>I am not afraid of public or private scrutiny.  I want to make sure that the Minister of the day is afforded the opportunity to take whatever is the appropriate action in given circumstances. We need this legislation to take the appropriate action in Letterkenny. It may well be that if we were dealing with natural law as distinct from the more sophisticated legal and constitutional arrangements to which we have grown accustomed.  The action I am seeking in Letterkenny could, in most circumstances, be taken without a basis of law because it was right to intervene and stop what was going on.  It was right to ensure that the college's operation and integrity were restored.</P>
      <P>This amendment is tied to the previous one in the circumstances where, for the greater part, outside of the Letterkenny case, circumstances which might necessitate the implementation of these provisions would require the Minister to make the decision but, before that decision was implemented, an order would be put to the House and there would be the opportunity for the House to debate that order, and it would not be capable of implementation for a period of up to 28 days except in circumstances where it was annulled by the House or if the House was not sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be argumentative about this because Senator Cotter is genuine in his contribution but I emphasise we are talking about exceptional <Col N="1033" /> circumstances and the right to intervene to change matters without excessive delay when fundamentally necessary. For these reasons it is with regret that I am again on the opposite side to Senator Cotter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's reticence to support my amendment for the reasons given.  Many Government decisions are made without reference to the Dáil and the Seanad.  I was trying to bring this matter back before the Houses to allow discussion on it.  I disagree with the Minister's reasoning.  He said earlier this was an emergency but the Dáil, the Seanad and the committees are able to respond to such events without difficulty.  One hopes the Letterkenny case will never be repeated and one would assume this legislation will rarely be used.  However when it is used it will be an emergency and a matter of national importance.  The Letterkenny case has repercussions for every regional technical college.  It has rocked the foundations of the system and brought it into question.  For that reason there should be an opportunity to discuss this in the Houses once the order has been made.  That is why I put down the amendment and I am sorry the Minister has rejected it.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 40, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;on the recommendation of the governing body&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I checked the Principal Act I discovered the appointment of the director is made by the governing body.  Section 9 (1) of the 1992 Act states that each governing body shall from time to time appoint a person in a whole time capacity to be the director and chief officer of the college.  The Minister's approval is necessary.</P>
      <P>Having regard to that it is hard to see why the Minister should be directly involved in an appointment when the office becomes vacant, even if the appointment will only be temporary. There is no reason the board, if it exists at the time, could not carry out that function, although the Minister would obviously have to give approval.  I ask the Minister why he should make the appointment in that case because I am not convinced it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision would enable the Minister for Education to appoint a person as director of a regional technical college in an acting capacity.  If an office of director became vacant and there was no statutory power enabling the Minister for Education to make any appointment in the absence of a governing body, the college would be left without its chief officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position we are directly dealing with arose earlier this year because of the High Court decision.  The Minister is <Col N="1035" /> seeking the power to appoint an acting director where no governing body is in existence at that time.  A vacuum would exist which would be detrimental to the interests of the college.  Any permanent appointment must be made by the governing body, so Senator Cotter can be satisfied this intervention will only be made where the governing body is either not performing or not in existence and a vacuum has been created.  A final and permanent appointment can only be made by the governing body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement.  Where is anything to that effect stated in either section 3 of this Bill or section 9 of the Principal Act?  If it is there I cannot see it.  There is no reference to the absence of a governing body.</P>
      <P>Section 9 (1) of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, empowers a governing body, with the approval of the Minister, to appoint a person in a whole-time capacity to be the director and chief officer of the college.  Section 9(2) states the selection of the director shall be a function of the governing body in accordance with the procedures which shall include the composition of a selection board to be determined by the Minister from time to time.  Section 9(3) states the provision of the Third Schedule of that Act shall apply to the director.</P>
      <P>This amending legislation states that where an office of director becomes vacant the Minister may appoint someone to be the director temporarily until a permanent appointment to the office is made.  Such temporary appointment may be terminated by the Minister at any time.  Perhaps the Minister can show that I am wrong but this section does not appear to refer to a position where there is no board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>Section 9 of the 1992 Act states that each governing body shall appoint a person in a whole-time capacity as director and chief officer of the college and that the selection of the <Col N="1036" /> director shall be a function of the governing body in accordance with the procedures, which shall include the composition of a selection board determined by the Minister from time to time. Senator Cotter is right in the sense that there is no mention of the issue he is querying in the Principal Act.  We are now taking account of a circumstance which was not envisaged when the Act was brought into force.</P>
      <P>It was not envisaged that there could be a circumstance where a governing body might not be in place.  As we discovered earlier this year arising from the High Court action, such circumstances arose, and they arise in circumstances where a governing body, for one reason or another, is unable to perform its essential duties.  The original legislation did not cater for the circumstances giving rise to the absence of a governing body.  The Bill addresses this unusual situation, and that is the difference in this instance between the Bill and the original Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 is unclear in this respect, and if the intention of the section is to provide for what the Minister outlined it should be tidied up before being enacted.  Section 3 gives the Minister the power to make a temporary appointment and does not outline the circumstances in which this may arise.  Section 3 stands alone in the Bill and is not governed by section 2 or section 1.  If the intention of the section is that outlined by the Minister, it should be spelt out.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of section 3, whenever a director dies or retires, for whatever reason, the Minister can move in, even if there is a board, and automatically make an appointment without reference to it.  This is not acceptable, and furthermore, it is probably not the intention of the Minister.  The matter should, therefore, be tidied up on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 in my name would go some way towards tidying it up, but not completely.  I am conscious that in this instance the Minister <Col N="1037" /> will have to act quickly and consult the governing body.  It is possible that amendments Nos. 5 and 6 will be able to resolve the matter.  Thus amended, section 3 would read:</P>
    <P>(4)  Where an office of Director becomes vacant, the Minister, on the recommendation of the governing body, may appoint a person to be the Director temporarily until a permanent appointment to the office is made and such temporary appointment may be terminated by the Minster, after consultation with the governing body, at any time.</P>
    <P>However, I do not believe that this would resolve the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My French is poor, my German is worse and I have good Irish, but it appears I am not making the point as clearly as I might.  If Senator Cotter's amendment, proposed in genuine circumstances, were to be accepted there would be no scope for the Minister to take action in the absence or the existence of a governing body, which are the main circumstances in which I envisage these provisions to be put in place,</P>
      <P>If, however, Senator Cotter persists, I assure the House that the kind of Bill under consideration, and the specific nature of the requirement which at present pertains with regard to Letterkenny, are those which we are attempting to deal with as best we can. In the normal circumstances which the Senator outlined, where a director dies this matter would not fall to the remit of the Minister and would be dealt with in the usual way by the governing body. It is the exceptional and emergency circumstances with which we are trying to cope, and in this respect the provision must be considered in the context of the totality of the legislation before the House,</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this Bill attempts to deal with an emergency. However, the emergency having been dealt with, section 3 will continue, the Minister can invoke it whenever he or she wishes, and can interfere with the workings of the board in making an appointment to a temporary position which falls vacant.</P>
      <P>If section 3 is intended only for the current situation, then it should be tied to section 2 and should refer back to this section.  At present it stands on its own and gives the Minister powers which he did not want and should not have.  If a board exists then it is clear it should be able to fill a temporary appointment.  If it does not exist it is unable to do so and the Minister must do so.</P>
      <P>In view of this, is there any way this situation can be tidied up, because I am unwilling to accept section 3 as it stands?  I hope Members will understand why, will also not accept the section as it stands and that matters will be speedily tidied up on Report Stage.  I am unsure how it could be tidied up, but perhaps a provision could be inserted as follows: &ldquo;The Minister, acting in her capacity which she has drawn onto herself under section 2 (1) ...&rdquo;, or words to that effect.  If the Minster was not acting under section 2 (1), section 3 would not be applicable, and it would then only apply to the emergency, or situations which we are considering at present, where a board does not exist.</P>
      <P>There are problems with the present provision.  It gives power to the Minister outside the emergency powers and for as long as section 3 exists and in all circumstances if she wishes to exercise it. Indeed, under section 3, and with the amendments which now apply to the Bill as originally drafted, the Minister must act accordingly and make those appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has got the wrong gender for the time being with regard to the Department of Education. For the first four months of this year colleges were without governing bodies because of the difficulties which arose <Col N="1039" /> on the subject of the gender balance and the High Court challenge to regulations regarding elections of academic staff to governing bodies.  If during that period, a vacancy arose, and the director's office was vacant, there was no statutory power under the original provisions to fill that post.</P>
      <P>While I am addressing the general emergency circumstances as they reflect on Letterkenny, the High Court proceedings did not have anything to do with Letterkenny, any more than any other college, yet there was that period during which there were no governing bodies.  As a business man, Senator Cotter represents a constituency where business acumen is probably sharper, maybe because of geographical and Border problems, than it may be in the South.  I may not, therefore, have the same tenacity as the Senator for probing the detail of a business provision.</P>
      <P>However, I know that a college without a director or a chief executive officer is undesirable.  There is no intent in this provision for ministerial intervention, other than in the circumstances where there is not an alternative arrangement in place.  Normally the governing body, with no intervention required from the Minister, acts, but this intervention applies where the governing body, for whatever reason, emergency, High Court or otherwise, is unable to do so.  This is all that is involved.</P>

      <P>I understand exactly what the Minister is saying.  I want the section to apply to the situations the Minister wants looked after.  We could sort this out if we agreed that, where an office of director becomes vacant, the Minister, <Col N="1040" /> in the absence of a governing body, may appoint a person to be the director temporarily until a permanent appointment to the office is made and such a temporary appointment may be terminated by the Minister at any time in the absence of a governing body.

      <P>Sir, you have been patient in relation to this provision and I have no wish to delay the House.  I say to Senator Cotter, in the best spirit of cooperation, that I have been in this and the other House for a series of Bills and have gone back with subsequent amendments because there were circumstances which we did not foresee.  In 1992 we did not foresee that there would be a High Court case and that there would be no governing bodies in existence.  We did not foresee the situation in Letterkenny. We have introduced amending legislation.  The practice generally in this House is not to limit provisions to exact circumstances because we do not know if something else will happen tomorrow or some other day which would make it necessary for us to amend those provisions.  I can only give the assurance that these are the kinds of circumstances envisaged.  I am in no position to say that something else could happen which might involve a governing body not being in place.  I could not suggest what these circumstances could be. There is nothing ulterior about this.  It only involves intervention where it is absolutely essential.</P>

However, there is no definition of &ldquo;student&rdquo;.  There is a definition of what is a member of staff.  Part-time staff are included for the purposes of this legislation. It is possible that there could be a conflict between a student body and a governing body or between a student body or a governing body and the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been so anxious to hear what I have to say, I hope the Senator will agree with me on this occasion.  It would not be appropriate to define a registered student in the terms outlined by the Senator as it is a matter for the governing body to make regulations in the context of its circumstances. If the Senator has worries about co-ordination on this issue, I refer him to the existence of the regional technical college management services, which, with the council of directors, will achieve this.  These are the kinds of matters which, in my view, are best dealt with at local level.  It should not be a matter for primary legislation to dictate <Col N="1042" /> how this should happen.  I am a great believer in freedom at local level for each area to express itself and to handle matters involving students, colleges and registration.  For this reason I do not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 5, before section 6, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6. &mdash; Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after &lsquo;college&rsquo; of &lsquo;for a term of seven years, renewable, on the recommendation of the academic council, for a further seven years&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to bring the Bill in line with common practice. The Minister knows that county managers are employed under contract for a specific number of years.  It is wise to do this for many reasons.  It is unhealthy and unwelcome for a person to be given the position of director of a regional technical college for a lifetime because of the nature of this job and because of the importance of innovation in education in regional technical colleges. I wish the Minister to accept the amendment or insert one of his own.</P>

      <P>The Senator will be aware that existing directors of regional technical colleges have been appointed on a whole-time and permanent basis.  The President of the Dublin Institute of Technology was appointed in 1993 for a period of ten years.  The terms of office of future directors of regional technical colleges is a policy matter which will be addressed when such an issue arises.  It is my view that it would not be appropriate <Col N="1043" /> for the academic council to recommend renewal of the terms of offices of directors.  There is merit in the Senator's general point about contract appointments for a specific period.  We have inherited certain decisions which must now stand.  The term of office of the President of the Dublin Institute of Technology is ten years but the overriding concern is that the academic council alone should not have the final say in such a matter.  It should be a matter for the governing bodies which have overall responsibility for the running of colleges. As far as local authorities are concerned, I am not sure if some county managers would survive for seven years if the local authority equivalent of <Col N="1044" /> academic councils, that is the elected members, had the say.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity, my last opportunity to return to the Seanad and to attend this very important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the appointment of the new Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, S.C., the Minister for Justice on my behalf instructed him to conduct a full and detailed investigation of the extradition case involving Fr. Brendan Smyth.  The Attorney General's investigation has now been completed and his comprehensive report has been placed in the Library.  Senators may not have had an opportunity to study the report fully but I can assure them that it is an exhaustive one and it shows up serious deficiencies in the procedures which were in place in the Attorney General's office at the relevant time for the processing of extradition cases.  The investigation involved a full examination of the Smyth case, all extradition files, files since 1987 and the questioning of persons <Col N="1046" /> concerned.  This comprehensiveness was what I had sought from the outset.</P>
    <P>It would be useful at the outset of this debate to give Senators details of the conclusions to which the Attorney General has come.  These are; that the seven months delay was totally unacceptable notwithstanding the explanations given; that the only person who knew of the Fr. Smyth extradition request and warrants was Official A in whose custody the file remained at all times from the date of the commencement of the extradition process until the time the controversy arose; that there is no evidence that any outside influence was involved in the delay in the processing of the warrants; that neither the former Attorney General nor the Government were made aware of the existence of the Fr. Smyth extradition request until the controversy arose in the Autumn of 1994; that the Smyth case was not the first case in which section 50 (2) (bbb) of the Extradition Act, 1965 as amended was considered; that inaccurate information was given to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Chief Whip; that the procedures in place in the Attorney General's office at the relevant time for the processing of extradition cases were seriously defective; and that had the new procedure of the Attorney General seeing the warrants personally been in place, it is clear that no delay would have occurred.  These conclusions speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>In his introduction to the report, the Attorney General points out that he set out to establish facts &mdash; in so far as that is possible &mdash; in the Fr. Smyth case.  He further states that it is a matter of great concern to him &mdash; as it was to his predecessor, Mr. Whelehan &mdash; that a seven month delay could occur in the office in the handling of a file in any case, more particularly in this type of case.  New procedures have been put in place to ensure there would be no repetition of what happened.  All extradition cases are now receiving the personal attention of the Attorney General as soon as they arrive in the office.  All cases involving <Col N="1047" /> children will equally receive top priority.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's report deals in detail with other relevant extradition cases.  Specifically, it refers to the fact that since 1987, apart from the Smyth and Duggan cases there have been four other extradition requests in child sex abuse cases.  In two of these cases there were delays of eight and ten years respectively between the date of the alleged initial commission of the offences in respect of which the warrants were issued.  In none of these four child sex abuse cases was the section in the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended by the 1987 Extradition Act which deals with the issue of lapse of time, considered. The Attorney General's office dealt with three of these cases most expeditiously.  In the fourth case the UK authorities withdrew the application to extradite seven months after the draft warrants were received.  The UK authorities had failed to answer Irish queries in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's investigation also brought to notice four other cases where the issue of lapse of time arising under the section was in fact considered. These are detailed in the report.  Three involved terrorist type offences and one the offence of rape.  Initially it was thought that the Duggan case was the only one apart from the Smyth case where the section was considered.  The four additional cases recently discovered are further examples of cases in which the section was considered.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention specifically the section in the Attorney General's report which deals with recent Dáil questions relating to the Smyth case.  In the course of her reply the Minister for Justice stated her understanding that the Smyth case was the first in which provisions had arisen for consideration since the enactment of the 1987 Extradition Act. This was a reference to section 50 (2) (bbb) of the 1965 Act as amended.  The Attorney General points out that the information on the basis of which this answer was given was furnished by the <Col N="1048" /> Attorney General's office and was incorrect where the section was concerned. In consequence the Minister inadvertently misled the Dáil when giving the answer.  The Attorney General clearly states that the blame for the giving of the incorrect answers in that case and in statements made by the Chief Whip, Deputy Dempsey, in the Dáil on the following day, lay with the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>I would also like to deal with the section of the report which addresses the suggestion of outside influence which could be responsible for the delay in the processing of the Smyth file.  The Attorney General's investigation concludes that there is no evidence whatever on the file to justify any suggestion of this nature.  As regards the rumours circulating in Leinster House on 16 November, the Attorney General was requested by me to question all professional members of the Attorney General's office on the issue of whether any outside source, a person or an organisation, had made any contact with any of them with a view to discussing or making representations regarding the case. The Attorney General personally interviewed each official and received assurances from each which would negative absolutely any suggestion that such contacts had been made.  The former Attorney General confirms that there is no basis whatever for this suggestion in so far as he is concerned.  As regards the official who was dealing with the file, the Attorney General has received an absolute assurance from him on this issue.  The Attorney General states that the official is known to be a person of high integrity and in the absence of any evidence pointing to a contrary conclusion, his word must be accepted.</P>
    <P>The seven month delay in dealing with the Smyth case is dealt with in the Attorney General's report.  The official dealing with the matter informed the Attorney General that he could have completed his study of the particular legal question within the period of three working days if he could have had time without interruptions.  The official <Col N="1049" /> points out, however, that it is unreal to expect him to have been able to deal with the matter in such a way due to the inordinately heavy demands on his time. The other explanations given by the official for the delay are as follows: the erroneous assumption made by the official that Fr. Smyth was residing at Kilnacrott Abbey and that in consequence he was not a danger to the community at large; the fact that the UK authorities and/or RUC did not press the extradition requests and made no contact with the Office of the Irish Attorney General regarding the matter until 20 September 1993, thereby indicating a lack of urgency in so far as they were concerned, and pressure of other work which was viewed by the official as being entitled to have priority.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's conclusions on the delay are clear and unambiguous. The combined effect of the factors mentioned meant that the file was simply not processed and &mdash; the legal work apart &mdash; lay dormant for seven months. The official concerned has tendered a written apology to me, the Government and the Attorney General which is included in the report.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier the conclusion of the Attorney General is that the seven month delay was totally unacceptable, notwithstanding the explanations given. This is entirely in line with what I said in the Dáil on 15 November when I pointed out that there was an inexcusable delay in the handling of this case and the failure could not be excused. The Attorney General also concludes that the procedures in place in the Attorney General's office at the relevant time for the processing of extradition cases were seriously defective. Had the new procedure been in place, it is clear that no delay would have occurred.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's conclusions in relation to the seriously defective procedures in the Attorney General's office are very much the same conclusions that were reached by the review group on the Attorney General's office which provided an update on its work <Col N="1050" /> to the Government yesterday.  For the background information of Senators, I should say that in view of the seriousness of the issues which arose in connection with the Fr. Smyth case, I decided that there should be a thorough immediate review of the operations of the Office of the Attorney General.  This review is being carried out by a high level group chaired by the Secretary of Public Service Management and Development in the Department of Finance and comprising the Secretary to the Government and the Secretary of the Department of Justice.  The terms of reference of the group are to review and make recommendations on the relevant organisational structure, systems, procedure and staffing arrangements in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat here what I said in the Dáil yesterday.  It is clear from the review group's update that there are serious shortcomings in a number of areas in the administration of the office. The Government is gravely disturbed by these findings and has concluded that as a first step an immediate input of appropriate senior level management expertise to the office is essential.  The group has advised that its final report due within two weeks will include a recommendation for the appointment of a person who would fill that management role.  In the light of this report and pending the appointment of such a person the Government has decided that immediate management expertise must be brought into the Attorney General's office to assist the Attorney in the running of the office.</P>
    <P>To this end it has been decided that a senior official will be seconded to the office to oversee the introduction of modern management systems and procedures and to commence the initial phase of implementation of the other recommendations which will be available to the Government within two weeks.  The official seconded is Mr. Caomhin O hUiginn BL. a senior Assistant Secretary in the Department of Justice, who will report directly to the <Col N="1051" /> Attorney General.  Mr. O hUiginn has already started work in the office.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the Government attempting to excuse the serious failures which have come to light.  The task now must be to ensure that it never happens again.  I believe that the steps which have been taken by the Attorney General and by the Government will ensure this.</P>
    <P>I wish to state categorically that there was never any intention on my part to mislead Members of the Dáil or anybody else in this matter.  The simple fact is that the full implications of issues which arose from the written and considered views of the Attorney General were not known to me until I returned from the Dáil after the debate on Tuesday, 15 November.  I decide there and then that these matters should be brought to the House the following day, which I did.  In fact, it is clear from the Attorney General's report to me now that other salient and relevant facts have only emerged in the last day or so. It is obvious from the Attorney General's report that he himself only became aware of additional facts in the past few days.  It is, therefore, self evident that it was impossible for me to have all the facts on the Tuesday in question, given the situation in the Attorney General's office and specifically the inability to retrieve the full information from their filing system.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  He has always been welcome here.  He was here on a number of important and historic occasions during his time as Taoiseach.  It is perhaps a pity that we in this country do not have the facility which exists in the Italian Parliament where former Prime Ministers become members for life of the Senate.  However, the category of former prime minister is getting somewhat crowded &mdash; we would need a few extra seats here.  In any event, on behalf of my party I wish him every happiness <Col N="1052" /> in his political and personal life from this point on.</P>

      <P>The report from the Attorney General's office leaves more questions unanswered than it answers. That is precisely why this morning I asked that the Attorney General be given the opportunity to address the Seanad this evening and to answer questions for himself, the questions which have been exercising all of us these past few weeks.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is here and he is of course responsible for the Attorney General's office.  However, in the circumstances, I do not think that the presence of the Taoiseach alone is sufficient. After all, the Taoiseach is a major player in the drama which is going on. He is the most public and high profile victim of the entire operation.  He is not, by any standards, an objective or disinterested witness.  He has his own part in the whole drama to justify.  He may even have some scores to settle.  He has points to make, certainly.  In short, on this question the Taoiseach cannot be, however hard he tries, a fully credible objective witness.  That is why we sought this morning to have the Attorney General here but that was ruled against at the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for reasons which I understand.</P>
      <P>The confusion which surrounds the appearance of this report has been added to by the extraordinary media briefing which took place last night.  The circumstances of this briefing are bizarre, its purpose is shrouded in mystery and the motivation for it is difficult to fathom.  Here we have a situation where a briefing takes place, on behalf of an acting interim Government on a highly sensitive document two hours before a Cabinet meeting, 12 hours before the Cabinet Ministers actually got hold of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than that, the briefing was highly selective.  What is even more crucial is that this was not a question of a <Col N="1053" /> sudden rush of blood to the head of the Government press secretary.  He was not going off on a solo run.  He was acting under instructions and the briefing was clearly orchestrated by the acting Taoiseach.  The question is: why?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking a question which is being asked around these Houses today, a question which has provoked endless speculation and rumours which would make even Deputy Rabbitte seem understated.  The question is why this briefing took place last night. It would be helpful if the circumstances around that briefing could be clarified for all of us here this evening.</P>
      <P>The report is a tale of monumental, breathtaking incompetence.  On this report alone the Government deserves to be indicted.  We have an Attorney General's office run along Victorian lines.  We almost wonder if they have high stools and quills over there, if they come back pinching snuff and sipping port after lunch in their gentlemen's clubs.  We have an Attorney General's office which is not computerised, with a clearly inadequate filing system, virtually no retrievable indexes, little delegated authority, antiquated work practices and an Attorney General who is part time and topping up his State salary with rich pickings from the Law Library. When we read this report we have to ask if we are living in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Taoiseach that this is his responsibility &mdash; his and his Government's and his predecessors who condoned this type of situation, who have not given the resources or who have not demanded the type of performance which should be expected of the Attorney General's Office, the highest standards of administration and efficiency.  Even when the warning lights were flickering nobody seemed to be able take action to address what was obviously a situation likely to boil over at any particular moment.  The incompetence of the Attorney General, the <Col N="1054" /> inadequacies in his office, reflect directly on the Government.</P>
    <P>When we look at the report we ask what is the main thrust and the main burden.  At its most simple, the report blames one man &mdash; Official A.  Since the whole world knows who Official A is, there seems to be little point in continuing the fiction of referring to this person as Official A.  It is rather like one of those British political sex scandals of the 1960s where there was endless speculation as to who the headless man was &mdash; the man whose head, but nothing else, had been disguised in the famous photographs.  It is reminiscent of something bizarre.  We see even this evening on television the juxtaposing of certain news items.  Everybody knows who we are talking about and in this age of responsibility and accountability I do not see the point of continuing the fiction about Official A.</P>
    <P>The report makes clear that this man received the warrants.  He kept them in his possession and did not tell Mr. Whelehan about them.  He forgot some of the details.  He forgot about other major cases which might have been relevant. He gave misleading information to the Attorney General and to the Government, who in turn misled the Dáil.  On the basis of this report, the Dáil was probably misled unintentionally.</P>
    <P>However, the report still does not tell us why all these things were done.  We are told that perhaps he took the view that since Father Smyth was believed to be residing in Kilnacrott Abbey he was not a danger.  However, that was not his job.  His job was to act as laid down in law.  His job was not to play God, to decide whether a person who was wanted on an extradition warrant to appear on very serious charges in another jurisdiction might reoffend. That was not his job.  The excuse about there being no pressure from the RUC does not stand up, nor does the whole question of being overworked.  Clearly, at the very least, there is a question of priorities and of judgments and on all of these it falls down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> The report simply does not tell us why all these things happened &mdash; the failure to tell the Attorney General and the incredible forgetfulness regarding major cases.  Why the delay?  The report rules out outside influence but could there have been some sort of subconscious desire not to embarrass the Catholic Church &mdash; which was not sought by the Catholic Church &mdash; on the part of the official concerned?  Was there some other agenda?  Again, we just do not know.  The report says that there was not.  We are asked to accept this denial at its face value but we still do not know.</P>
    <P>On the question of Mr. Whelehan, the report is ambiguous.  He did nothing wrong, nothing dishonourable and those who know him would expect no less. However, the report is scathing of his lack of grasp of what was going on in his office, the fact that he just did not seem to be on top of what was going on and his inability to get to the root of the problem in the way that Mr. Fitzsimons could do in two or three days or less. On his inability, when his job and the future of his Taoiseach and his Government depended on it, to get on top of the facts and come up with a true statement the report is rightly, I am afraid, scathing.  It is also scathing of his incredible misjudgment in placing such faith in his top officials.</P>
    <P>The report is clear, inexpensive and, unlike the Beef Tribunal, it actually comes to conclusions.  It tells a lot and explains very little.  It is, to some extent irrelevant, because it tells us nothing about the questions at the core of the break up of this Government &mdash; the 14 questions enunciated by Vincent Browne in Wednesday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> and the seven questions which Deputy John Bruton put on the record of the Dáil yesterday.  It tells us nothing about the key questions at the core of the breakdown of trust in the just dead Government.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I welcome this report because, at the very least, it has clarified a number of important aspects and I <Col N="1056" /> wholeheartedly accept the Taoiseach's determination that the Attorney General's Office will be reformed, root and branch, as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Manning in his contribution now and earlier, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges met at 2 p.m.  It examined the proposal sympathetically but came to the conclusion that it was not an issue contemplated by the Standing Orders.  The Committee undertook to examine the manner in which such requests could be facilitated in the future.  That was the result of our findings.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning was generous in his opening statement and I certainly welcome that.  He referred to the Taoiseach as a victim.  A man of integrity and honour has been destroyed by these events.  More than the destruction of this man and all that he aimed for, we have a problem in that these events go to the core of the way we govern, and raise very serious questions which have to be answered.  I acknowledge Senator Manning's generosity in recognising the willingness and anxiety of the Taoiseach and the Government to address the issues which have come to the fore.</P>
      <P>Sadly at this stage apologies are of very little use because the damage has been done.  I am pleased nonetheless that this report has been published because it tells us a huge amount about public administration and the way we administer Ireland.  It deals with events which are unparalleled in the life of the nation and with the facts in a way that we have never seen them dealt with before.  It examines how a constitutional office of central importance in the administration of the life and affairs of this nation is organised.</P>

    <P>We can be nothing but amazed that the office should, at this late stage in the 20th century, operate as it has.  There are both administrative and political lessons to be learnt from this report.  This <Col N="1057" /> report does not give any justification for new spins on the events of recent days or for any further attacks on the integrity of leading politicians here.</P>
    <P>One central fact that emerges is that the office of the Attorney General seems to be unsullied by anything approaching administrative efficiency.  There seems to be, for example, no central registry and no record of precedents which are very important in a law office.  There seems to be no evidence of any tracking system to ensure that important matters are not simply deflected or swallowed up in the day to day activities of any law office. The workings of the office seem to depend on that most elusive and frail of all factors, human memory.  Human memory in the age of the computer, the Xerox machine and automated retrieval systems is not the basis on which the Attorney General's office should function.</P>
    <P>The report, at paragraph 30, chronicles the lapses.  It states that Official A was not conscious of the Duggan case and had apparently forgotten or overlooked the facts of the case.  Official B did not recall the Duggan file when the investigation commenced.  At paragraph 34 it says that &ldquo;the former Attorney General states that he had forgotten the cases dealt with by him when the report was being prepared.&rdquo;  He was depending on Official A and Official A's regrettable lapses of memory are already chronicled.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 35 the former Attorney General states that he was not aware of the facts of the State (Ellis) <i>v.</i>  O'Dea case or that these facts were germane to the Symth case, the case on which the Government had asked him to report. In the same paragraph Official A indicates again that he had not thought of this case.  What are the people to think of this?  What are we, as the politicians elected to take command of the administrative structures, to think of all of this?  Surely in an era of modern information technology, a central and sensitive institution of State such as the <Col N="1058" /> Attorney General's office should have been better organised.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning also recognised however that the errors, lapses, omissions and extraordinary administrative facts of the Attorney General's office did not come to the fore during the life of this administration.  They have been there over the last ten, 20, 50, 70 years of the State.  The quill pen may have gone out and the biro may have replaced it but certain modern information technology has not yet breached those walls.</P>
    <P>On the issue of memory lapse perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of the document is the letter reproduced at page 27.  This is an apology from official A.  I accept what Senator Manning said about this fiction.  It is time that the fictions which surround public administration were swept aside.  This letter offers an apology to the Attorney General, the Government and the previous Attorney General for events which led to the resignation of the Taoiseach, the Government and the President of the High Court and which plunged the Government of this State, the Dáil and the nation into an unprecedented crisis. Members may, as I do, find it odd that no apology to the people is appended. They are entitled to an apology.</P>
    <P>Other than illuminating the shambles in the administrative arrangements which have applied for years in the Attorney General's office, the report is valuable in a number of other key areas given the debate that has taken place over the last few weeks.  The most important question is whether the Dáil and the people were deliberately misled by this administration.</P>
    <P>Anybody who is fair-minded, impartial or willing to accept the facts laid before them, must now accept that there was no intention or effort to mislead. There was not any attempt to do anything other than bring all the facts before the people as they became available. It is clear from the report that the Attorney General accepts without equivocation, as should Members of this and the other House, the people outside <Col N="1059" /> and the cynics that make up the great body of our media, that the information supplied by the Attorney General's office at key points was inaccurate.  Due to human frailties inaccurate information was supplied to the Taoiseach, his Government and the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Another important point was dealt with in the Taoiseach's speech, touched on by Senator Manning and dealt with in the Attorney General's report.  The manner in which the Minister for Justice handled her questions in the Dáil is now explained to us as is the way the Chief Whip handled his questions.  If we are fair-minded and objective or if we care a whit about the concept of justice and how we treat each other, we have to accept that, as in the case of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Chief Whip did not intentionally at any time mislead the Dáil or the people.</P>
    <P>If there is any evidence that this is not the case it should be laid before us.  The Attorney General makes it clear at page 16 that any misleading of the Dáil in replies to parliamentary questions to the Minister for Justice was inadvertent and based on information which the Minister in good faith accepted from the Attorney General's office.  On page 17 the Chief Whip is similarly exonerated and on page 17 the Attorney General says: &ldquo;The blame for the giving of incorrect answers lay with this Office.&rdquo;  That should be the end of the affair in so far as the issue of where blame lies is concerned.</P>
    <P>During the Dáil debate there was an electrifying moment which Members will remember.  I know Senator Manning had it in mind when he referred to Deputy Rabbitte.  That Deputy stood up and indicated to the Ceann Comhairle, with all the great theatrics he can bring to one of those magic moments in Dáil Éireann, that there existed a document in the Attorney General's office that would rock the very foundations of this State.  The word went around Leinster House that there existed a letter or communication from a senior figure in <Col N="1060" /> the Catholic Church which contributed to the delay in the Smyth case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte is of course known for making allegations which are later shown to be without any foundation. Mr. Justice Hamilton rejected claim after claim by this public representative as being without foundation in the costly beef tribunal report.  Deputy Rabbitte has not explained himself or apologised for those false claims.  He should now have the honour and the integrity to come before the other House and either explain or produce the evidence to support the allegation he made that day.  It is important as we are talking about integrity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ministerial responsibility and the issue of responsibility in public office is also brought to the fore in this report. Elsewhere, I described the concept of ministerial responsibility as a farce at the very heart of public administration in this country.  I am pleased that the Tánaiste indicated that high on his agenda of administrative reforms will be the issue of establishing where responsibility lies for public administration.  This report clearly indicates that the concept of ministerial responsibility &mdash; which on this occasion lay with the Taoiseach and which, to his eternal credit, he accepted with great dignity &mdash; is shown to be a tragedy and not just a farce in Irish public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to address a series of issues. One is the issue of openness in Government. We have before us a clear and concise report.  It does not provide all <Col N="1061" /> the explanations.  Sometimes things are totally inexplicable.  I cannot understand why an official sat on that file for seven months but must accept that is the reality and that there is no political fault here.</P>

      <P>My comments will deal with the report only.  The new Attorney General has carried out a fine job and I congratulate him.  I also wish him well in undertaking a new job in the eye of a storm.  I have full confidence in him. The Taoiseach will be aware that our union proposed him to take over the job as arbitrator in the public service during the last number of years.</P>
      <P>The report appears to be open, comprehensive and a credit to the man who compiled it.  I agree with all Senator Manning's comments, with one exception. It is unfair &mdash; and I do not think he intended it to be so &mdash; to reflect on an extraordinarily hardworking group of people in the Attorney General's office and I will have specific comments to make about them later.  However, they worked hard under extraordinary circumstances.  References to quills and so forth should not reflect on them.  We are dealing with a specific issue here.</P>
      <P>The situation over the last number of weeks has undermined people's trust and confidence in Government.  It has turned the sceptics into cynics and the cynics into people who have peripheralised themselves out of the political system altogether.  We have lost politically over the last weeks.  It is not possible to go through all the details of the explanation given in the report but some issues are significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> The explanation by the new Attorney General about the use of the term &ldquo;the previous application of the new Extradition Act, 1987&rdquo; is significant.  I believe that the official who used those words was setting out to mislead everybody who read it.  There can be no doubt about it.  The application of that section of the Act has only one result, to stop an extradition or not execute the warrant. It was never applied before but it was considered in all the cases which have come to light.  The information was given in such a way that the impression was given that as it was never applied before it was, therefore, never used before.  It is unacceptable, untrue and was included to mislead deliberately which it did.</P>
    <P>The God-like manner of Official A in determining that because somebody was at the address of a religious order he was prevented from dealing with children around the area or anywhere else is totally unacceptable.  The fact that the cases referred to occurred 20 years ago makes no difference.  There is such a high rate of recidivism in paedophile offenders that it was not for him to make this judgment.  The paltry attempt by Official A to tell us he was busy and, therefore, could not get through the workload in that period of time is also unacceptable.  Busy people set priorities. We have all heard the saying &ldquo;if you want something done, ask a busy man to do it&rdquo;.  If something should not be done there is nobody better than a busy person to stop it happening.  That is the message that comes through to me today.</P>
    <P>I also question the assertion that the Attorney General never saw this file. Sometime &mdash; tonight is not the time &mdash; I would like an official response as to where that puts the role of the Attorney General in the context of the Minister and Secretaries Act and other legislation which require the senior person to take responsibility and does not confer the right to devolve authority on certain issues to lesser mortals within his jurisdiction.  An error was made at that time.  The extradition legislation is very <Col N="1063" /> clear.  It does not allow for the devolution of power.  The Attorney General's signature was not the impact required by the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is misleading to characterise this as a seven month delay.  This delay could have stretched to infinity.  The official had been contacted at least three times by the British Attorney General's office which also contacted the Garda Síochána. Nothing was done and the file was left lying there.  It could not have been forgotten.  At least, he did not try to mislead us by saying that he had forgotten. He was reminded three times and he still refused to deal with it.</P>
    <P>This report &mdash; comprehensive as it is &mdash; is neither a justification nor an adequate explanation for the delay.  It gives us information but it does not inform us about the reason for the delay.  It fails on every count.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the apology in the report.  If ever I have seen a letter &mdash; and I am used to dealing with such letters in my day job &mdash; that smacks of cynicism and contempt, it is that letter.  It is a model of what a trade union official would ask a worker to write to get him off the hook but not to apologise.  We saw something similar here this morning in other circumstances when somebody wanted to distance himself from something without actually apologising for it.  That apology is breathtaking.  It is worth examining; it is a disgrace.  He apologises for the incompleteness and incorrectness of some of the information and for the embarrassment &mdash; misspelt &mdash; he caused certain people.  He offers an 11 line periodic sentence which is impenetrable.  I have consulted my able colleague, Senator Norris&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no mention of resignations, of Governments being brought down, of <Col N="1064" /> careers gone down the drain or of jobs lost.  There is no mention of families in pain.  There is no mention of children at risk.  There is no mention of the people of this country.  It is a thorough disgrace.</P>

      <P>It is similar to apologising to the people of Hiroshima for destroying their water supply.  It simply does not address the issue.  I reject the apology.</P>
      <P>I have a record in this House of defending public officials and people in the public service but this apology is unacceptable.  It is an insult to the people and to our public representatives. I have no doubt that Eoghan Fitzsimons published it with a thorough understanding of what it meant.  I congratulate him for publishing it.  It gives us a clear insight into this man.</P>
      <P>If the report is the total story &mdash; and I am not taking political sides &mdash; it denies that there was political interference. There is no indication of a cardinal or a Taoiseach or a Minister or an Attorney General being involved.  That is not to say that they should not have been involved in a different way. However, this man made a decision to delay this extradition.  He did not do so because the case concerned child abuse &mdash; he had dealt with such cases previously &mdash; but because he had another agenda.  A question has been raised about the influence of organisations such as Opus Dei in high offices of the State.  It is time that we returned to the position of Dr. Garret FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty with people being open and giving their point of view on issues.  I fundamentally disagreed with my former colleague, Des Hanafin, on almost every issue.  However, I thoroughly agreed with the open way in which he put forward his point of view, although I am not talking about that aspect.  I am talking about people with another agenda, which I believe exists. We should take the example of a previous Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, when he raised the question with his <Col N="1065" /> incoming Cabinet at a particular time as to whether they were members of any organisations which might have a hidden agenda in terms of different policies. This matter raises two issues but I do not have time to go into all the areas covered by this report.  However, I worry about the influence of clandestine or secret organisations and we need to examine this point openly, as happened in Italy in recent years when they had to examine this grey area.  It is time we did so.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Attorney General had been tidied up and improved.  I express sympathy for hardworking officials, other than Official A, in that office who do a hard day's work and a good job.  We have tested them time and again in the House on legislation and they are thoroughly professional.  I exclude them from my remarks.  There should be security clearance for everybody involved in such sensitive areas as the Office of the Attorney General. This question has been raised for the past ten years with regard to that office. Adequate resources should be put into the office to do the job required of it in the legislative area and in the operation of Government.  What is there is just not good enough.  Heads have rolled, careers have been lost, people have been put in pain and children have been put at risk.  The report is not adequate, although it is useful.  We will return to this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and the fact that the Taoiseach has come to the House to give his views on the subject.  However, I am not happy that a media briefing was given last night while Members of this House and the other House did not have the content of the report until 1 p.m. today. This should be adequately explained to the House and to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome this debate, it does not substitute for full and adequate explanations or a full and adequate investigation by the Oireachtas.  A series of statements in this House or the other House is not adequate.  Many questions <Col N="1066" /> still have not been answered.  These issues and those raised in the report must be pursued further.  I welcome the statement by the Taoiseach that a review group has been established, which he expects it to report in two weeks, and that a new management system has been introduced in the Office of the Attorney General.  However, it still does not answer many of the fundamental questions.  While the report is concise, clear and goes into great detail regarding the reasons the events occurred, it does not answer the fundamental question as to why there was a seven month delay in the extradition of Fr. Brendan Smyth.  As Senator O'Toole said, we do not know if the delay would have gone on longer if he had not gone of his own accord.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's report is a total vindication of the decision of the Labour Party Ministers to press for a full account of the Smyth affair.  It demonstrates convincingly that the judgment made by the Labour Party leader from the outset of this affair was correct.  I have no doubt that the revelations uncovered in this report would not have come to light but for the actions of the Labour Party in recent weeks.  This report does not change anything in relation to the Taoiseach's responsibility and the reasons the Labour Party Ministers resigned from Government.  They resigned because the Taoiseach was made aware on Monday, 14 November of the Duggan case.  This is confirmed in paragraph 34 of the report before the House.  However, he failed to draw the Dáil's attention to this the following day.  Nothing in this regard is changed or affected by the report.  It is an indictment of the flawed judgment of the former Attorney General and the person referred to in the report as Official A.  It is also a criticism of the decision of the Fianna Fáil Ministers to accept the former Attorney General's report to the Cabinet on 11 November 1994.  This decision brought about the whole situation.  There should have been further investigation before that report was accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> I wish to deal with the original report of the Attorney General in the context of the report before the House.  This was published in the national newspapers after the Cabinet meeting on 11 November 1994.  It is contradicted by the report available today on a number of points and assertions which are shown to be false.  The former Attorney General stated in that report that &ldquo;until the preparatory work has been completed, a case, whether extradition or not, cannot usefully be placed before me&rdquo;.  This is the system condemned by the present report.  Yet it was known and tacitly approved by the former Attorney General, the Taoiseach and the Government on 11 November.  The former Attorney General goes on to say that &ldquo;the procedures just described I am assured have always applied to extradition cases&rdquo;.  Yet in page 14 of the report before the House we are told that in the past extradition requests in respect of subversives were, in accordance with the practice then prevailing, immediately notified to the Attorney General. Item 26 on page 14 states:</P>
    <P>In the past when extradition requests in respect of alleged subversives were frequent, it was a practice that notice of such requests be immediately given to the Attorney General as soon as they arrived in the Office.</P>
    <P>We need to know when in the past this happened and when it was changed. This is a relevant question.  It is not possible to reconcile the two statements, the statement in this report and that in the original report given to the Cabinet by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The critical paragraph in the former Attorney General's report was paragraph seven, which we learned today was based on material supplied by Official A.  Paragraph seven begins by saying that one reason for the delay in the Smyth case was the fact that work had to be interrupted due to the intervention of more urgent matters.  Other Members referred to the fact that this is <Col N="1068" /> not an adequate explanation.  No matter could have been more urgent than this. No further comment is required on the judgment of the Attorney General in this matter or on the assumption that he was in a safe place because he was in a religious establishment.  This just does not stand up to any judgment.</P>
    <P>The former Attorney General stated that there were several legal issues to be considered in the Smyth case but it appears from paragraph 32 of the report before the House and the report of the former Attorney General that it is impossible to reconcile this with the facts.  They were not several legal issues, according to this report.  There was one legal issue, which was one of delay.  The statement was made that there was no necessity to apply section 50 (2) (bbb) of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, until this case.  However, ten cases are referred to in this document: the Duggan case, the Ellis case, the K, M and McD cases.  Five other cases are referred to in paragraph 22 (e) but are not dealt with in detail.  Separate cases of child abuse are referred to on page 4 but as they did not involve delay they are not relevant to the situation.  It is most astonishing that in the ten previous cases, in which this paragraph was considered, one involved a reported written judgment of the Supreme Court.  How a failure to refer to how such a case could have come about is very difficult to explain.</P>
    <P>Official A, whose role in these misstatements to Cabinet and the Dáil was central, has apologised to the new Attorney General.  His apology is included in the report on pages 27 and 28.  It is accompanied by references to short notice, volume of work and the information systems, which have been mentioned.  It seems quite extraordinary that there was not even a proper indexing system in the Office of the Attorney General, much less any type of computer system.  The apology is accompanied by reference to these various aspects.  However, the new Attorney General does not state whether this apology is acceptable to <Col N="1069" /> him.  I think it is wholly unacceptable.  It would be a matter of grave regret if such a serious failure of judgment on a series of matters could be regarded as closed by the publication of this apology.</P>
    <P>There are many fundamental questions that need to be addressed.  I welcome the changes in the Office of the Attorney General; I welcome that a high level investigative team has been established and will be reporting shortly.  It is essential that the public has accountability in all of these matters and that the two Houses of the Oireachtas also have accountability.  We await these explanations.</P>
    <P>This is an opening stage in the debate and there are many serious questions that still need to be answered, and the Labour Party will play its part in ensuring that the people receive the answers to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, in a brief intervention, said that he was happy to have history judge him.  I repeat what I said when we discussed his resignation, that it is my hope and expectation that history will judge him for his contribution to peace rather than for anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Attorney General on his investigation into the Fr. Brendan Smyth case leaves us with many questions &mdash; it has answered a few and left us with many more.  We are little wiser as to the circumstances which led to the Taoiseach's resignation and to the resignation of the former Attorney General in his capacity as President of the High Court.  We are still left wondering what it is that caused a seven month delay in dealing with the Fr. Smyth extradition <Col N="1070" /> case and why it was that other files dealing with similar extradition requests and files subject to queries relating to section 50 (2) (bbb) of the Extradition Act, 1965 could be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>We are told in the report, and the Taoiseach repeated it here, that extradition warrants in respect of other child sex abuse cases were processed in three to six weeks &mdash; a remarkable contrast to the seven month delay in the case of Fr. Smyth.  We are asked to accept that there was a systems failure in the Attorney General's office in respect of this particular file, but, on the other hand, we now know from the report that other files could be dealt with and disposed of expeditiously.  Furthermore, we know that there was an apparent failure to recollect a case, the Ellis case, on the provisions of section 50 (2) (bbb) and that that was subject to the judgment of the highest court in the land.  We are asked to believe that this case was forgotten by the same official who dealt with the Smyth case.  I find that quite extraordinary; it strains credulity to its utmost.</P>
    <P>We have a remarkable situation where it was impossible for an official dealing with both files and advising the Government to remember the Duggan and Ellis files before the Dáil, as the report states, was misled, albeit inadvertently.</P>
    <P>The other great deficiency of the report is that it does not deal in any pertinent way with the events of the period from Sunday 13 November to Tuesday 15 November when the Fianna Fáil Ministers were informed by the Attorney General of the Duggan case but collectively decided to withhold this information from the Dáil on Tuesday, 15 November.  What was it that compelled the new Attorney General to state in his letter of 15 November to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;This is the best I can do.  It does not, in fact, answer the question.&rdquo; After the publication of this report we now know why the Attorney General said further in the letter: &ldquo;It would be absolutely incorrect to inform the Dáil <Col N="1071" /> that this was the first time that the section was considered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are still confronted with the question of why there was a seven month delay.  The Attorney General's report says on page 22: &ldquo;There is no evidence whatever on the file&rdquo;&mdash; note &ldquo;on the file&rdquo;&mdash; to justify a suggestion that the Attorney General or an official in his office had been requested by some outside source or contact to delay the processing of the file.  Does this mean that there was some other interference?  It does not explicitly say that there was not.  What led Official A to make the assumption &ldquo;that Fr. Smyth was at Kilnacrott Abbey&rdquo; and, therefore, that he represented no threat to security?  How, despite several contacts from the UK Attorney General's office, was the file still left unattended?</P>
    <P>I repeat the question several speakers have asked as to why this report was not published yesterday.  The Taoiseach said this afternoon that he was quite disturbed about the way it was leaked to the media.  Is this the beef tribunal revisited?  Is it that the spin doctors are sent out to a receptive media to tell them how the message should be received when it is the Houses of the Oireachtas which should be brought the message before anybody else?</P>

      <P>Can we be assured that the report which came before us today is the same report, word for word, as <Col N="1072" /> that given to Tuesday's Cabinet meeting?</P>
      <P>The Attorney General concludes that the seven month delay in processing the Smyth extradition case was unacceptable; he concludes that the procedures in place in the office were seriously defective.  These serious deficiencies are evident much farther afield than the Attorney General's office.  Do we have collective Cabinet responsibility, or did people get so tired working night and day in an attempt to conceal the truth that their behaviour may also be described as unacceptable? Who wrote &ldquo;If pressed, keep repeating the above&rdquo;?  Who takes responsibility? Is the Taoiseach the only person who has had to pay the ultimate price by taking responsibility or are there not others who also must share their burden of responsibility?</P>
      <P>We look forward to the implementation of the recommendations as we look forward to the promised implementation of the recommendations of the beef tribunal.</P>

      <P>I welcome this report.  It highlights the fact that a senior official at the Office of the Attorney General did not view the request for the extradition of a child sex abuser as worthy of his attention for a continuous period of three days, as stated on page 24 of the Attorney General's report.  The official concerned has the gall to state that he could have completed his study of the aspects of the case within a period of three working days if he could have had the time without interruption.  That speaks volumes about the mindset of the gentleman who has been processing these extradition warrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's comment that we get a further insight into this gentleman's lack of sensitivity when we read his apology.  He apologises to <Col N="1073" /> the Attorney General, the Government and the former Attorney General, but he never once refers to the victims or the families.  That is the kernel of the reason this case was not dealt with.  As Senator Roche said, there have been many allegations and suggestions.  A bombshell was dropped in the other House when it was stated documents would be found which would rock the State.  I am not citing the Taoiseach's contribution but rather the Attorney General's report when saying none of those allegations has been proven, including the suggestion floating around the House that Cardinal Daly had interfered. People's careers were wrecked and inferences were drawn about some who were totally innocent.</P>
    <P>These suggestions were floated by politicians, the same politicians who, according to Senator Dardis, are only supposed to be the conduit of information. One is not supposed to speak directly to the public; they are only supposed to get information via this House or the other House.  I do not accept that, neither in relation to this matter nor in relation to the hepatitis C crisis.  The former Minister, Deputy Howlin told us he immediately briefed the women of Ireland about the vaccine; he bypassed the GPs, who did not like that.  I accepted his bona fides, just as I accept the press briefing was to inform the public, who are gravely concerned about what has happened in this State in the last three weeks and, more importantly, in the seven months in which the case was not considered.  Perhaps this has nothing to do with democracy; it is more concerned with egos.  Some people are peeved at having been bypassed, I do not apologise for that.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has thoroughly examined this case.  He has interviewed not only the people involved with the case but also those not associated with it and asked if there was interference. He has stated categorically that he cannot find evidence of any such interference. If one reads the report one can find the reason for the delay; the official who was dealing with the case did not <Col N="1074" /> consider child sex abuse was urgent and continued with the ordinary day to day business of his job.</P>
    <P>That is what is evident to me from this report.  Anyone else who has other allegations or suggestions to make, or who possesses any correspondence or reports should make them known, as the Taoiseach asked in the other House. The Attorney General did not find such material.  People have lost their jobs and reputations while the victims and their families have not been acknowledged by the person responsible for this.</P>
    <P>When I was in secondary school in the late 1960s I studied basic office procedures. I agree with Senator Manning that the office procedures highlighted in the report are a disgrace &mdash; there is not even an index system.  We politicians all have a way of following up cases which come to our attention.  More importantly, did no one in the office take an initiative so that staff could know what they were dealing with or what was yet to be tackled?</P>
    <P>Did no one request that the office be updated?  If someone did, was that refused at any time since the quill was replaced by the biro?  It is disgraceful that eminent, learned gentlemen did not ask for a card index system while we are supposed to accept they represent us and are doing the best job they can on our behalf.</P>
    <P>During our parliamentary party meeting the Taoiseach's style of leadership was mentioned.  Those who served in his Cabinet said he gave people a job to do, he did not look over one's shoulder and he expected one to do the job.  It is a dreadful shame that that has been his downfall.  Other comments were made about previous leaders of Fianna Fáil who were supposed to have monopolised everything and wanted to do all the work.  This man gave people a job to do and expected it to be done; he was crucified as a result, which is a high price to pay for the leadership he showed.</P>
    <P>The overriding issue, which has been missing from the contributions so far, is the reason for the delay.  So far as I can see from reading the apology from <Col N="1075" /> Official A and the report as a whole, the reason was that child sex abuse was not a priority for that official, who dealt with all of these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator McGennis for sharing her time with me. I welcome the Taoiseach to the House; he is a fellow county man of mine.  It is fitting that we acknowledge his contribution not alone to his county and his constituency but to Ireland and to the search for peace in this country.  The status he has given us internationally is well recognised.  It is unfortunate that he has to apologise to the people of Ireland for the misdeeds of others.</P>
      <P>Someone sat on a file for seven months and the Taoiseach had to resign to save the Government and prevent a general election, and it appears from the apology that this person is not answerable to the public.  Given this evidence, will history not show that we have hung an innocent man, one who had nothing to do with the events which led to his downfall?  That appears to be the case from the report.</P>
      <P>If people had reservations or informations about the former Attorney General, Mr. Whelehan, which would have suggested he was unsuitable for the position of President of the High Court, that information should have been made available to their Government colleagues at an earlier stage.  Trust and responsibility must apply both ways and be shared.  It should also be said the Taoiseach was not in the country and the Tánaiste acted in his place, so responsibility should be shared in those instances also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has tonight produced evidence which was fearlessly extracted by the Attorney General.  Deputy Reynolds has shown that he did not want to hide anything from anyone.  If the information which is now available had been at his disposal earlier he could have brought it to the attention of the House.  However, as he has clearly stated, no conclusive information was brought to him until he arrived back from the Dáil on the evening of Tuesday 15 November, and he made it available <Col N="1076" /> as soon as possible, on Wednesday 16 November.</P>
    <P>The record will show a serious wrong has been done to a man who did not intend that misinformation or incomplete information would be given to the Dáil, this House or the public.  The Taoiseach acted in good faith on behalf of the Irish Government and people. The Attorney General's report has conclusively proven there was no attempt by the Taoiseach or his Ministers to mislead the Dáil or the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this matter.  The report of the new Attorney General on the Father Brendan Smyth affair paints a frightening picture of incompetence and mismanagement in the Office of the Attorney General but it fails to provide any satisfactory or believable explanations for the delay in processing the Smyth warrant.</P>
      <P>The report shows that with regard to extradition matters the person referred to as Official A was effectively operating as Attorney General, making all the crucial decisions and determining which matters were to receive priority. Officials can be blamed but their political masters must accept responsibility. The report suggests a virtual abdication of responsibility on the part of the previous Fianna Fáil Attorney General, Mr. Whelehan.  Official A is indicted for failing to keep the Attorney General informed but no explanation is offered as to why Mr. Whelehan apparently never inquired about these matters.  The report also raises serious questions about the judgment of the two parties in Government who agreed to Mr. Whelehan's appointment in the first place, and why there was no proper supervision of the Attorney General and his office by the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report fails to deal in a precise manner with a number of important questions.  While it concludes categorically that there was no evidence of any outside influence being brought to bear, it does not indicate if this covers possible representations from the Department of Justice and if any such representation would be regarded as being <Col N="1077" /> from outside.  In addition, the report does not absolve the former Fianna Fáil Ministers from their outrageous involvement in withholding crucial information.  This has been referred to on a number of occasions, and in his address to the House the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that the full implications of the issues that arose from the written and considered views of the A.G. were not known to me until I returned from the Dáil after the debate on Tuesday, 15 November. I decided there and then, that these matters should be brought to the House on the following day...</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring told the people that the Taoiseach was thus advised by the Attorney General on Monday, 14 November 1994, and following that he withdrew from Government.  The question, therefore, which must be addressed is the manner in which the report was published. It raises additional questions about the seriousness of the new commitment by Fianna Fáil to openness and accountability.  You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you are not fooling the people this time.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Reynolds to the House on his last visit as Taoiseach.  Because of that and other matters, my colleague, Senator O'Sullivan, put the position on the record <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Labour Party.  I have no intention on this occasion of trying, as Senator Finneran did to cast the net a bit wider.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste know full well what matters sundered the Government and I have no intention of going into this matter any further.</P>
      <P>However, it is ironic that all the heads &mdash; except one &mdash; appear to have rolled in the Attorney General's office.  Everybody appears to have accepted their responsibilities, except one person who appears to be totally protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party had reservations about Mr. Harry Whelehan, which were <Col N="1078" /> vindicated.  Extradition is not something like stealing a car, it has exercised the minds of politicians in the State for many years and it has been the cause of deep divisions within all the parties.  It is an issue which should have exercised the mind of any reasonable Attorney General.  There is, therefore, no excuse for Mr. Whelehan, but it is ludicrous that &ldquo;Mr. A&rdquo; should continue in office. The Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, describes him as a man of the highest integrity.  He may be, however, I am not talking about his integrity but his competence.  If he is a man of the highest integrity, he strikes me also as a man of supreme incompetence.  He attempted to exercise the judgment of Solomon, and all he did was to put children at risk.  It is seldom that I disagree with Senator O'Toole, but in this case he understated the issue.</P>
    <P>The issue of invincibility of those who commit a grave offence, but because they are civil servants are not subject to the same rule as anybody else, is one which any Dáil must at some stage consider. People fall on their swords over issues such as this, and rightly so in some cases.  There are enough swords for everybody and perhaps that gentleman should choose one.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the language used in the House, and the crucifixion of the Taoiseach, the place of the Taoiseach in history is assured, and I said this the night he came back with the peace package.  There are people alive, north and south, who would be dead if it had not been for the action of the Taoiseach.  He at least accepted full responsibility and took the appropriate action.  Nobody forced him to do this and his place in history regarding peace on this island is assured.</P>

This is wrong.  There is an option open to the person concerned, and perhaps he might address it himself.</P>
      <P>Finally, as the Taoiseach takes his leave of us, I thank him for his courtesy to me and to members of my party and assure him of our affection and respect.</P>

There were bad times and I took the blame.  There were good times and the Taoiseach took the credit, but that is politics.</P>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach and his family well and he will always have my friendship. There should be a warning on this report, because it is the most extraordinary which has ever been handed to the Oireachtas and the people.  There should be a warning to people to stand back from the report, because they are certainly in for a shock.  It is unbelievable to find out that this is the way the State runs its business.  We are told of old filing systems, the volume of work, and of an official making a decision on the address where this person was located.  What we have been told about this State is unbelievable, given that it has to hold its place with other states in the world, and must honour agreements regarding extradition and so on.  It is regrettable and sad.</P>

      <P>I reject the interpretation of accountability by the Labour Party Senators.  Accountability in this State has always been the responsibility of the top, and it is only cast down the line when there is a hot potato which nobody wishes to handle.  We have seen two case of this recently, and this is one of them.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that the said individual had a letter presented in the way it was, and it should not have appeared.  If there is to be shared accountability let it be shared the whole time, and let us not drag civil servants out when things are too tough for everybody to handle.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach and I understand the terrible suffering and trauma he and his family went through.  It was an incredible, unbelievable occasion, and the Taoiseach has paid a huge price. However, there is still a terrible fog hanging over 14, 15 and 16 November 1994, especially the 14th and 15th.  For example, the Tánaiste told the nation that on Monday, 14 November 1994, Ministers were informed by the Attorney General, verbally, of the existence of the Duggan case.  A letter came in on 15 November, and the Taoiseach, speaking on the afternoon of 15 November in the Dáil, had the Tánaiste sitting beside him, with the answer to a parliamentary question in his hand. Why did the substance of that answer not appear in the Taoiseach's speech? Surely it is an incredibly strange coincidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current Tánaiste said they were so tired &mdash; they had been up all night for a couple of nights &mdash; that the significance of these matters passed them by.  I do not believe that the significance could have passed them all by.  It passed the Minister for Defence and the Marine. Deputy Andrews, by because he was not there.  However, the other Ministers were given a verbal account on Monday and looked at a letter on Tuesday but the significance of it passed them by.  Yet, it was significant enough to have a reply ready to a possible parliamentary question.  As it happened, no such question was asked.  The Taoiseach <Col N="1081" /> was surrounded by buffoons or there was a cover up.  The evidence we have suggests they are not buffoons but that there was a cover up.  It is sad to say that We cannot find evidence to the contrary. We cannot definitely say there was a cover up but all the evidence points in that direction.  This issue will not be finished tonight, tomorrow or the day after but will last as long as the people who were involved are in office.  There will always be question marks.  These are the hard facts.</P>

      <P>I thank Mr. Fitzsimons for this report, which is written in simple English and not the usual legalistic jargon.  Official A states in his apology that it was the small number of staff and huge pressure of work which caused the delay in the Smyth case.  I wish to compare the Smyth case with the Duggan case.  We all know that the Smyth case was not dealt with for seven months.  The report states that on 4 February, 1992 the British Attorney General wrote to the Attorney General's office here raising certain issues of law.  It is interesting to read in the report that on some date between 4 February and 13 February 1992 the Duggan file was passed by official A to official B, who was able to make a submission to the Attorney General on 13 February.  On the same date the Attorney General accepted and signed the submission and the process for the extradition of Mr. Duggan was put in place.  All the officials must have been burdened with the heavy work load about which official A complained. Official B dealt with the file within days of receiving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it hard to understand that the Attorney General in the UK wrote a letter which was personally addressed to the Irish Attorney General but not given to him.  This is similar to Mr. Major writing to the Taoiseach.  We are told that the Irish Attorney General never saw the letter.  This is unacceptable. <Col N="1083" /> It would be like one of the Taoiseach's officials not allowing him to see a letter sent to him by Mr. Major.  This was a serious dereliction of duty and should never be allowed to happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach. He has been very gracious in this House.  I have had some slight dealings with him.  I recall when I was a Member of a previous Seanad and Deputy Reynolds was Minister for Finance.  I was having lunch when former Senator Tras Honan, of pious and immortal memory, grabbed me with her famous grip and said that Deputy Reynolds, when speaking on the budget, accepted one of my recommendations and gave great credit to the Seanad.  I thought it was typical of the generosity the Taoiseach can show that he gave credit to this House.  Many other times Ministers accept recommendations, proposals and ideas, calmly put them into their own bags and do not give any attribution to them.</P>
      <P>I recently read a certain book which I know the Taoiseach will not read.  Out of this book came a picture of a warm, decent, generous hearted man, who is a shrewd, aggressive businessman.  I did not take any great further negative inference from it and I think this is the picture the people of Ireland will recall as well as, of course, his extraordinary contribution to the peace process, in which he took risks.  He put his finger on it when he said that it is extraordinary that one gets over big hurdles but a small one trips one up.  This is a very wise saying and we will all, I hope, be aware of the small hurdles in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go over the details of the Taoiseach's explanations, except to say that I regret, like other people, that there was apparently some degree of leaking.  What we want to deal with is the report of the Attorney General which raises serious problems.  It is extraordinary that the Attorney General's office seems to be like a down at heels solicitor's office where the filing system is all over the floor.  Such offices are not only in the country but all over <Col N="1084" /> Dublin.  In some statements there was reference to the information retrieval system having broken down.  I thought that at least there would have been an antiquated computer but there were only rusty filing cabinets and no proper indexing.  This absolutely astonishes me and I ask how many other Departments are in the same parlous condition.</P>

The level of consciousness in the Attorney General's office seems to be spectacularly low.  I understood from lawyers, who can be pretty tough when they are dealing with members of the public, that ignorance of the law is no defence.  Yet, they systematically use an ignorance of the law as their own defence.  This is unacceptable.  Senator Roche raised the issue of rumours several times and named the person involved.

When I saw Cardinal Daly, a man for whom I have the highest regard and who has great integrity and principle, making a statement, I had no difficulty whatsoever accepting it immediately.  I find it astonishing that the Roman Catholic authorities used their clear ignorance of human sexuality to justify the way in which they dealt with the issue. Yet, they leave themselves in a situation where they pontificate about the sexuality of other ordinary citizens.  I wonder about the influence of various organisations. I do not know if the allegations made by Senator O'Toole are appropriate or correct or not but I know that a very senior judge wrote in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> an article which suggested very <Col N="1085" /> clearly that he regarded himself as bound more to obey the official teachings of the Roman Catholic Church than the law of this State.  This worried me a great deal but I am not going to name him, at the moment anyway.</P>
      <P>The report contains a list of warrants and there is a suggestion that on occasions draft warrants were sent out, which were really kites being flown.  I am not sure, because of the way in which this information is presented, whether these were just draft warrants or real warrants.</P>

      <P>I want to make two points because this is a serious debate.  The report states on page 3: &ldquo;It was the intention of Official A to have them dealt with if and when the Attorney General indicated his intention to send Fr. Smyth back for trial in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  However, he had previously said that the Attorney General had no knowledge of it, that he was not made aware of it and that he could not have had an idea about it.  Then how could he have a hypothetical intention in this state of ignorance?</P>
      <P>As regards Official A and the apology, why does this person not resign and why is he not named?  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that a Mr. Russell was involved at the very highest level.  It would be unfair if I were to draw the inference that this was Mr. A.  If it is not, is it Mr. B or Mr. C?  Who are these people?  Why are they shrouded when they have catapulted the country into this extraordinary and unwelcome situation?</P>
      <P>On page 4 the report states that &ldquo;Fr. Smyth was ultimately convicted on a plea of guilty to the various charges and was sentenced to four years imprisonment&rdquo;, but he was convicted with no assistance from this jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Míle buíochas to the Senators for their kind words and remarks.  We are all realists in politics and we recognise that the world of politics is full of rumour, no more so than last night.  I want to put it on the record that I did not send out anyone to brief in a particular direction because there would not be any basis for it, logic to it or credit for it.  That was not my position last night, and I know Deputy Manning accepts that.</P>
      <P>The basis for the conspiracy we hear about is a response prepared for an anticipated supplementary question, published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on last Sunday week, with certain handwriting on it.  I want to inform the House &mdash; this is the last opportunity I will have to do so &mdash; that I asked every Fianna Fáil Minister who attended those meetings during the two days in question if they had seen it before or written on it. I have the original which was sent to me from the Attorney General.  My colleague, the Tanáiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, has the copy which he brought with him to the Dáil on the particular day and there was no writing on either of those documents. Let us be honest, open and transparent about it.</P>

      <P>I can tell the facts.  I asked the Attorney General to ask his officials if anyone there was responsible for the two different types of handwriting on it.  The answer was also in the negative; there was no trace of anyone having done so.</P>
      <P>As regards the response, it was not prepared, as was suggested time and time again, by any member of the Government or a Fianna Fáil Member. It was prepared in the ordinary way in the Attorney General's Office.  I hope everyone is clear on that point.  This is the basis of the conspiracy I hear about.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about Monday, although I do not have the detail to go into it, but I want to put what happened on the record.  A question was raised on Monday about two particular aspects of the Attorney General's report which I received.  The Attorney General acknowledged that there was serious legal objections to his point of view within the Office.  I asked him if he had put these two sides of the legal argument to the previous Attorney General and he said no.  I told him that as far as I was concerned I needed a definitive position from him, the legal officer of the Government.  I needed a definitive position, whatever it took to get the matter sorted out.</P>
      <P>After I had gone to the Dáil, a letter was delivered to my office with the definitive response everyone talks about.  There is a paragraph on the second page of that letter which one could not miss because it is a complete contradiction of the previous report which had come to the Government from the Attorney General.  I got that letter when I went back to my office at 9 p.m. I studied it, although I must admit the first page was not very clear. However, the second page was very clear.  I called in the Ministers and I told them the response from the present Attorney General was a complete contradiction to what was given to the Government and on which we made certain decisions and that I was going to the Dáil the following day to make that abundantly clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for coming here this evening.  I realise it has been extremely inconvenient for him and I know he is not the person primarily responsible for this matter.  The person responsible was able to speak on the radio at 5.30 p.m. this evening but he did not regard it as important enough to come into this House of the Oireachtas. At least Deputy Treacy seems to accept the principle that what happens here is more important than what happens in the media and I thank him for that.</P>
      <P>I am asking that the acute medical and surgical services provided by Naas General Hospital be maintained.  I want to let the Minister for Health and the Government know the tremendous concern in County Kildare about the future of Naas General Hospital.  The medical profession, patients and the public are worried that the badly needed services provided by the hospital will not be maintained, that it will be neglected and that, rather than providing the acute medical services which are essential, the hospital will be reduced to a geriatric unit, if it remains open at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the argument in context, I want to point out to the Minister that the population of County Kildare has risen by 70 per cent in the past two decades; the population rose by 11 per cent in the Naas area in 1986-91; the number of people in Celbridge increased by one third, in Maynooth by a quarter and by 3.5 per cent in Newbridge.  We can say with confidence that new motorway development and rail commuter services will almost certainly lead to further significant population increases. This emphasises the argument in favour of adequate local medical services.  Naas Hospital has a long and distinguished history of looking after the health needs <Col N="1090" /> of a wide community, and I can personally testify to that.  I had to bring my son to the casualty department recently and I was impressed by the way the staff looked after him.  The staff make good use of the meagre resources given to them.</P>
    <P>Only one phase of a four phase development for the hospital proposed in 1986 has been completed.  A letter written to me on 24 October of this year by the Minister for Health stated that he had received the report of the joint Department of Health/Eastern Health Board Review Group, established to examine the remaining stages of the development plan for Naas Hospital. The Minister said that the report was &ldquo;under consideration in my Department&rdquo;. I and those concerned with the future of Naas Hospital now want to know what the report says and what has been the result of the consideration given to it by the Department.  Space is at a premium in the hospital, patients have to be moved about frequently, the situation is completely unsatisfactory and, as I said, it is a tribute to the staff that they can cope with the problem.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to learn that beds have been reopened in the hospital and I am also glad that a part-time geriatrician has been appointed to the hospital, but this is against a background of an earlier decision to appoint a full-time consultant physician with an interest in rheumatology, an appointment which was not made.  The concern in the light of all this is that the acute medical and surgical services being provided by Naas Hospital may be transferred elsewhere, for example to Tallaght or to the main Dublin teaching hospitals.  I want the Minister's assurance this evening that these services will be fully maintained at Naas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, his Department and the Eastern Health Board will be aware of the concern being expressed about the future of Naas Hospital which has been communicated to him and the other bodies by the Kildare faculty of the Irish College of General Practitioners and others.  The faculty has expressed the view that any downgrading of the services &ldquo;would marginalise <Col N="1091" /> Kildare and would have serious consequences for the quality of health care delivery in this area.&rdquo;  People in Kildare need to be assured about the future of their hospital.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister to confirm that the services at Naas Hospital, especially the acute medical and surgical services, will be increased commensurate with the increase in population and that no attempt will be made to centralise these services and transfer them to Tallaght or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>It is always a pleasure for me to come to the Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann to answer any question.  I am here this evening on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity on behalf of the Government to speak on the question of Naas General Hospital and the services it provides.  I would like to avail of the occasion to outline recent developments at the hospital in addressing the issues raised.</P>
      <P>The original development control plan for Naas General Hospital was received in the Department of Health in 1986.  It provided for the development of a 209 bed hospital and it was proposed that the development would take place in four separate phases as follows: phase one, psychiatric unit, boiler house and ancillary facilities; phase two, the accident and emergency department, outpatient department and limited surgical service; phase three, full surgical service, including back up facilities and phase four, medical services and coronary care unit.  Phase one of the development was completed and commissioned in December 1991 at a total cost of £3.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining stages of the development plan for the hospital were examined by a joint Department of <Col N="1092" /> Health/Eastern Health Board Review Group which was set up in 1993.  The review group's terms of reference were to examine the remaining stages of the development plan for Naas Hospital, taking account of overall acute hospital requirements of the area and recent developments in the delivery of hospital services, including the decision to proceed with the new Tallaght Hospital. The recommendations of the review group have recently been received and are now under consideration in the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of consultant appointments, interviews were recently held for a second consultant physician post.  I can inform the House that an appointment has been made and the new appointee is due to take up duties on 15 December next.</P>
    <P>Finally, with reference to bed closures, while there were routine summer bed closures this year &mdash; that is common in every hospital in the country because not as many people tend to be admitted to hospital during the summer due to environmental and other considerations and the fact that consultants are on holidays &mdash; there are no bed closures at present in this hospital and I am happy to report that to the House.  For the past eight years, I have served in a number of Departments, including the Department of Health.  I am pleased to be here on behalf of that Department and my ministerial colleagues and to assure the Senator and the House that I will transfer his request for the consideration of both the Minister and the Department.</P>
