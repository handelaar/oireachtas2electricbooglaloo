      <P>I have notice from Senator Cotter that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to take note of the decision by Cement Road-stone Limited to cease operations at the Castleblayney plant as and from 30 November, a decision which will have serious consequences for the local economy; and the need for the Minister to initiate discussions with the company to see if the plant can be saved or at least kept open for an extended period to give the Minister time to replace the job losses in Castleblayney.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to urgently clarify the situation regarding the extension of the DART system to Greystones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on <Col N="354" /> the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business will be Item 1 between now and 1 p.m.  My understanding is that the Tánaiste will address the House at approximately 12 p.m.  I suggest ten minutes per spokesperson and eight minutes thereafter.  Item 2 will be taken between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.  Item 3 will be taken between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., and I suggest 15 minutes per spokesperson and ten minutes thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of time allocations for Item 1, not many spokespersons will require more than ten minutes; nevertheless if the Leader of the Opposition or other spokespersons require a few more minutes flexibility should be allowed as the Minister is not confined to ten minutes.  I therefore ask Members to be reasonable and flexible on this point</P>
      <P>I am disturbed to note Item 2 on the Order of Business.  This was not on the notice from the Whip's Office last week. However, we will co-operate and allow the item to be taken, but to present the House with a Bill to be taken at such short notice, and which has a number of amendments, is not the way to do business. In view of this I request that the business of the House be ordered in such a way that this does not arise in the future.</P>
      <P>I am sure that all in the House wish to send our sympathy to the people of Israel, its Government and the families of those who have been bereaved after the terrible atrocity which took place yesterday, and to hope that the peace process in that country and in that part of the world will not be damaged by what was clearly an attempt to sabotage it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the question of debates on matters of foreign policy which I raised before the summer recess, since the Oireachtas Joint Committee <Col N="355" /> on Foreign Affairs has been established, the House has tended to devote less time to such debates.  We should have a discussion soon on foreign policy developments in areas such as East Timor, the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia.  I asked previously whether this could be done through a report from the committee dealing with foreign policy and perhaps with the involvement of the chairman of that committee.  This matter should be examined because it allows the House to carry out its business by being informed on and dealing with issues.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Manning's reservation about Item 2 and the way it has been introduced.  However, we will also co-operate.  Regarding Item 3, statements on ending long term unemployment, I ask the Leader to clarify that this will not conclude today.</P>

      <P>That is fine.  We should welcome the decision of the Finnish people to join the European Union.  I hope it sets a headline for other countries which will vote on that question in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>A report was presented to the Foreign Affairs Committee two weeks ago on the enlargement of the EU.  I ask the Leader for a debate on this report as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he has any plans for a discussion on the McKinsey report dealing with the ESB. It is important that the House has an opportunity to discuss this report soon. As the Leader is aware, there is a proposal to reduce the number of jobs in the ESB by approximately 3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he has any intention of holding a debate on the Price Waterhouse report on the Department of Defence.  This has caused much uncertainty among Army personnel across the Defence Forces.  There <Col N="356" /> appears to be confusion between the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Defence and nobody seems to know what is happening in relation to the report, which has caused much uncertainty and fear.  I ask the Leader to consider this matter.</P>

      <P>Regarding the milk regulations, I understand from the Minister that the amendments are minor.  I ask the House to accept that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I drive home to Killybegs at the weekend and back again, I pass through the Six Counties. There was always fear when making this journey.  I would ask myself if I should stop at the Killyhevlin Hotel and have a meal or go into Enniskillen to shop or stop at Lisnaskea or Kesh.  There was always the fear that I might be in the right place at the wrong time and that the Provisional IRA would launch a rocket attack or explode a bomb.  It would not bother me if I was killed.  I am not afraid of death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hate to be maimed but, worse again, perhaps my wife would be maimed or hurt.  These <Col N="357" /> fears were not just with me but with the population of Northern Ireland for the last number of decades, particularly for the past 25 years.  However, these fears are gone, thanks be to God and to the combined efforts of Gerry Adams, John Hume, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach, whose constant, simple but powerful refrain &mdash; who is afraid of peace?  &mdash; seemed to strike a chord.</P>
      <P>The fear from the Provisional IRA is gone and I know they will not kill me. However, what about the UVF, the UFF or the UDA?  Can I risk going into a bar for a quiet drink or will somebody push open a door, shout &ldquo;Trick or treat&rdquo; and spray the bar with machine gun fire?  Thank God, they too have decided to lay down their arms.  The loyalist paramilitaries, who gave us the Shankill Butchers, Loughinisland and Greysteel, have stopped the killing, in common with the IRA.  It is worth remembering their brave words: &ldquo;Let us firmly resolve to respect our differing views of freedom, culture and aspiration and never again permit our political circumstances to degenerate into bloody massacre.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They also apologised for the harm they caused over the years, but can the families forget what happened?  Can anybody forget?  I do not think we can forget, nor should we or need to do so. This is what Remembrance Day is all about.  Nobody should forget Enniskillen. However, we must forgive because there is no other way forward. Without true forgiveness, there cannot be a lasting peace.  There is a prime example of this in the House, Senator Gordon Wilson, who will not forget but who publicly forgave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I drive on, I feel a little safer but there are still other armies in the Six Counties, such as the INLA.  It is not a large force but it is very lethal.  I hope it too will choose the path of peace.  As I approach the Border I feel more secure until I am confronted at the checkpoint by a massive fort with a steel tower.  My number plate is checked by computer; I am automatically photographed.  I am asked where I am coming from and to <Col N="358" /> where I am going and what is my business? Often my boot is searched.  This is carried out by one of the last armies to remain in the field, the British Army.  I am suddenly reminded of Bloody Sunday, 12 years old Majella O'Hare, 13 years old Brian Stewart, 16 years old John Boyle, Aidan McAnaspie, the concentration camps at McGilligan and Long Kesh and the torture chambers of Castlereagh.  Sadly, I realise that I am still not completely safe as I drive through part of my own country.</P>
    <P>I wait and I hope.  Perhaps the Northern Ireland working committee of the British Cabinet, which is meeting this morning, will recommend to the British Government to begin talks about talks. Perhaps the British Government will agree to a complete demilitarisation of that part of the province over which it claims jurisdiction.  Perhaps it will withdraw its army, which was sent there to keep peace between the warring factions of Irishmen.  Now that the Irishmen have stopped warring and decided to pursue their separate agendas by democratic and peaceful means, surely this massive army is no longer required? Surely its cause is redundant?</P>
    <P>Are these separate warring factions now friends?  Far from it; they have a long way to go before a real <i>rapprochement</i> occurs.  Irish nationalists who want a united Ireland or loyalists who want to remain with the UK are still poles apart in their aspirations.  We are reminded of the words of the loyalist paramilitaries' declaration, to respect these different aspirations.  It is only through dialogue that they will come to realise how much they have in common. It is only by concentrating on what binds us rather than divides us that we can ever live in peace.  I hope all sides will eventually come to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, not just to talk and present their points of view but also to listen.  It is only by listening to others that we realise they have concerns, worries and fears.  All of us must give a little on this small island if it is to work and prosper.  We must meet one another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> How many people in this part of Ireland have never seen the Giant's Causeway or been to Portstewart or Portavogie?  Now that it is safer they should travel to the North and meet some loyalists who they will find do not have horns and I would ask the loyalists to come to the South, as they did in the past.  We have more in common that binds us than divides us.</P>
    <P>How was it that for years in Donegal where I grew up we could celebrate 12 July and 15 August with the Orangemen and the AOH?  There was no violence, killing or fighting, just an acknowledgement that, although some of us have differing viewpoints, it does not prevent us enjoying ourselves together.  Everyone went to the two parades and &mdash; although nobody believes this &mdash; it is on record that the same bands once played in both parades because one parade was short of numbers.  I would love to see a number of Orange bands march here on St. Patrick's Day; I do not see why they could not be invited.</P>
    <P>I belong to the Fianna Fáil Party, the republican party, whose primary aim is the establishment of a united Ireland through peaceful means.  I make no apologies for that aspiration and I never want to change it but I concede that I will have to modify what I saw as a united Ireland.  I once dreamed of a green, Gaelic, Catholic Ireland.  I know now it will not be Catholic but I hope it will be Christian; I know it will not be Gaelic but at least it will be Irish; I am proud to say that my green flag will be tinged with a fair drop of crimson from the red hand of Ulster if we are to fly it over the whole country in the future.</P>
    <P>We have a beginning &mdash; nothing has really changed except that we can talk without being killed.  That may not sound a lot to people who did not live there but to be constantly under the fear of being killed or maimed was an horrific way to live.  Now that fear is for the most part removed it gives us a wonderful opportunity.  We will not solve our problems in a week, a month or a year but if we talk and listen we will find that <Col N="360" /> we have more that binds us than divides us.  Each side will have to give, yet it is not always easy to give up a dream.  The dream is still realisable; it will just be different.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, to the House; he is always welcome here.  It is a pity that the Tánaiste did not open this debate as it is a help to those taking part to have an indication of the Government's up to date thinking on the matter. We must wait for that later in the debate.  That is not a reflection on the Minister of State who is always welcome here nor on the contribution of Senator Lydon to which I listened with interest.</P>
      <P>This is the first occasion we are not discussing Northern Ireland under the shadow of a terrible atrocity or against the backdrop of some dramatic happening, as was the case when last we met to mark the declaration of the IRA ceasefire.  Today, a week after the event, we celebrate the loyalist ceasefire.  At last the pieces are falling into place.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the IRA ceasefire I said that I did not thank or praise the IRA because it had decided to stop killing and bombing its fellow human beings after 25 years of carnage.  I was glad that at last it had seen fit to give the democratic constitutional process a chance and had accepted that there could be no victory for any side through murder.  I say the same about the loyalist ceasefire.  We can never forget &mdash; nor should we &mdash; that some of the worst atrocities, some of the most heinously barbaric acts were committed by these people.  Greysteel, Loughinisland, the Shankill butchers and the Dublin bombs &mdash; the list could go on and on.  We hope there will be forgiveness, but the nationalist people will never be able to forget what these people have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now time to move on and, in saying that, I would like to applaud the Tánaiste for his part in bringing us to the present position.  He has been somewhat overshadowed of late but it is only fair to say that the Tánaiste was there in 1985 for the beginning of the Anglo-Irish <Col N="361" /> Agreement and has played a consistent, brave and enlightened part in bringing us to the present position.  I would have preferred to say this in his presence but I record it now.  Sometimes in the daily rough and tumble of politics significant achievements can be overlooked and not given the credit to which they are entitled.  I have already recorded my admiration for what the Taoiseach has done in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that we are only at the beginning and we are on a route as yet unmapped and with no real international examples to guide us. We are at the beginning and have yet to face up to the enormous structural and institutional problems which, presumably, those drafting the framework document are now seeking to address. In the euphoria &mdash; understandable as it was and is &mdash; at the prospect of peace it is too easy to dismiss these questions as being already solved or easily solved, or to hope that the difficult problems will simply go away.  These problems are not solved and will not go away.</P>
    <P>On the declaration of their ceasefire the loyalists assured their people that the union was safe.  Sinn Féin tells its people that the Border will go and the British will leave this island.  They cannot both be right, or can they?  That is the size of the problem facing those who are drafting the framework document at present.  It is not just a question of balance &mdash; if it were we could find a ruler or a weighing scales and produce a balanced document which would appear to be fair.  It is more a question of assuring each side that the gains more than outweigh the losses, that the risk is worth taking and to assure them that they can bring their own people with them.</P>
    <P>It is a fragile and vulnerable process. There are people on both sides who do not want it to work, among them elected politicians such as Mr. Ian Paisley who, to his great shame, still appears to be bent on the path of opposition and destructiveness, unwilling to play a constructive role in what the majority of people on both sides want to take place. There are also the lurking godfathers <Col N="362" /> and the hard-liners of the IRA waiting for their chance to tell their people they were wrong and that the old way is the only way.  There are those who are hiding behind the euphoria and do not want this process to work, and it is better that we recognise that these people exist than be swept along in false hope and optimism.</P>
    <P>We must not underestimate these people and for that reason some of the hype of recent times is regrettable.  It was right to bring Mr. Gerry Adams into the peace process but we must not elevate him to a status he does not deserve and which is all too easily being conferred on him at present.  To many people North and South he is not a freedom fighter; he does not speak for nationalist Ireland as he claimed on his recent trip to the US; he is not the leader of what is called &ldquo;pan-nationalism&rdquo;, whatever that may mean.  He should never be a candidate for the Nobel Prize for Peace &mdash; that would be obscene, yet it is seriously spoken about. He is the leader of a party which gets less than 10 per cent of the vote in Northern Ireland and less than 2 per cent of the vote in this part of the island. His importance is based on one fact &mdash; the backing his party receives from the IRA and the influence and control his party can exert on the IRA in keeping it within the peace process.  Let us be careful before we confer sainthood status on Mr. Adams and his supporters. We have yet to see the colour and the durability of Sinn Féin's democratic credentials.  The real tests are down the road.  Similarly, let us not create expectations which cannot be met.  I hope that unionist politicians in the North will say the same about loyalist paramilitaries as they come, for the first time, into the democratic process. Let us look at things realistically but let us not create expectations or create an aura which frightens people away from taking part in this process.</P>
    <P>A point which can easily be forgotten in the present concentration of publicity <Col N="363" /> on the extremes of each side is the importance of the centre to the process. If, in political terms, the centre cannot hold the process will not get off the ground and will not be successful.  The extremes can give us peace but the extremes cannot make the political process work.  That is the job which must be carried out by the solid slogging constitutional parties of the centre. There is an extraordinary obligation at present on the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland to start talking to each other in a way that they have not done thus far.</P>
    <P>The SDLP and the Official Unionist Party have far more in common with each other than either has with the extremists on their respective sides. These are constitutional parties who have stood up against paramilitaries through the years.  They are parties that have ploughed the democratic furrow in extremely difficult circumstances.  They are concerned on a day to day basis with the ordinary problems of ordinary people in Northern Ireland.  They have far more in common in addressing the economic and social problems of the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; the problems that Ken Maginnis, Seamus Mallon and others deal with day in, day out in the House of Commons &mdash; than they have with the extremes and those who have destroyed the infrastructure of large parts of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should encourage them to start talking seriously.  The fact that they are not doing so is regrettable and could prove to be one of the great weaknesses in the ongoing political process. However, there have been hopeful signs.  There has been a softening of tone and an openness we never saw before among people we regard as hard line unionists.  People like John Taylor have not rushed to condemn the peace process.  They have shown an openness of mind that is encouraging and welcome. Recently I saw a mixed group which included Dr. Joe Hendron, Reg Empey and others in Boston working together in the interests of Northern <Col N="364" /> Ireland &mdash; as they have been doing on economic issues for quite a long time. There are hopeful signs that the ordinary politicians are working together. However, every effort must be made to emphasise the commonality of interest and the great issues that bind them rather than those that divide them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a question which I had hoped the Tánaiste would address here this morning.  The question was raised in this House yesterday and it relates to the Alliance Party.  Perhaps the Tánaiste will have news for us this morning that this matter has been resolved.  It came as a great shock to people north and south of the Border that the Alliance Party was being allocated less representation than Sinn Féin at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Apart from the reality of the situation, in symbolic terms it was a major public relations disaster.</P>
    <P>People look to symbols.  The Alliance Party is often despised because it is rational, sane and decent.  It is despised because it is not fanatical and because, of all the parties in the North, it has sought &mdash; long before it was profitable or popular to do so &mdash; to bridge the gap between the two communities.  The Alliance Party is the only party committed to the union in Northern Ireland that is prepared to take part in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and it is being placed lower than a party which has for the last 25 years been part of the subversion of the democratic process in Northern Ireland.  I hope this can be resolved.  It is important that the Alliance Party is told that people here have enormous regard and respect for what it is doing and that we believe it should have at least parity in representation if not more.  I would allocate the party more than any of the nationalist parties bearing in mind its symbolic importance representing unionism.  It would be unworthy and a dreadful waste of time and effort if this problem was allowed to disfigure the opening of the forum.</P>
    <P>I am sceptical about the value of the forum.  I understand why the Government <Col N="365" /> wants to bring Sinn Féin into the democratic process and why it wants to confer respectability on Sinn Féin.  I have no problem whatsoever with that. However, I am concerned that almost everything about the forum appears to be <i>ad hoc</i>&mdash; it is being made up as we go along.  There is no clarity about what it seeks to achieve.  Mr. Denis Coughlan in a perceptive article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today highlights many of the problems facing the forum.  It appears at this stage that the main value of the forum may well be to provide a forum for discussion while the Government sorts out the problems on which it has not yet reached agreement.  If that is what the main value of the forum will be, it is flimsy.  I would like to hear from the Minister what is the up to date thinking on the forum.  To date it appears to be <i>ad hoc</i> and flimsy.</P>
    <P>I had the honour of being a member of the New Ireland Forum during the 1980s.  I have mixed views on the value of that institution.  It took far too long, it was leaky and, at the end of its deliberations, the report of the forum was &mdash; and it gives me no pleasure to say so &mdash; shamelessly hijacked and distorted by the then leader of the Opposition, Mr. Haughey.  The hardest of the three options available was presented as if it was the only option to emerge from the forum.  The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is also vulnerable to being used by parties for their own agendas against the greater good which the forum is there to serve.  That is the nature of politics and the nature of life.</P>
    <P>I have yet to be persuaded that the forum is the best way forward.  A contradiction is looming.  When the framework document is presented it will, presumably, give us the best and the agreed thinking of the two Governments on the institutions and the constitutional changes to be made.  However, these are the very questions which the forum will also discuss.  If the framework document presents what the Government considers to be the best way forward, does the forum have the right to disagree and to seek to change what has been agreed <Col N="366" /> between the two Governments?  I envisage enormous possibilities for friction in that regard.  I can see the work of the framework document being undermined if it is subject to day in, day out scrutiny of the forum.  That could cause great problems between the two Governments. It could lead to charges of bad faith being made against our Government if it is forced to backtrack because of the forum's reaction.  I am not happy about that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister has a clearer idea about its function than has emerged from his speeches so far.  Perhaps he can assure us that the forum has been properly thought through, what it will do, what its relationship will be to the framework principles, what timescale is envisaged for it and what standing the forum will have in the process.  I do not knock the idea of a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation &mdash; it is a good idea.  However, if the unionist parties are absent and unlikely to attend, there is always the danger that it will simply become a rerun of the New Ireland Forum which was essentially a nationalist forum.  There are also the other dangers of it running on too long and of conflict between what the forum wants to achieve and the stated intentions of the framework document.  I ask the Minister to clarify these points.</P>
    <P>I wish to be generous in acknowledging the enormous progress which has been made on what most of us regarded a year ago as an utterly intractable problem &mdash; I and my party have been generous in the past.  The Government should note its position has been greatly strengthened by the bipartisan approach in both Houses.  That spirit did not exist in 1985 but happily it is here today.  As long as the Government continues to respect the principle of consensus and works within the Downing Street Declaration, it will continue to have the full and unwavering support of the Opposition in seeking to attain objectives we all desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, thank you for the opportunity to say some <Col N="367" /> words this morning.  Although the notice was posted to me, for whatever reason I did not hear until yesterday that this discussion was taking place. This is the first time that has happened and I blame no one, but I have not had an opportunity to think about what I might want to say.  I did not even have such an opportunity yesterday because with various commitments I could not find the time to put something on paper.</P>
      <P>This is not an address or a speech but rather a collection of reflections as of 6 a.m. today.  I again remind the House I am not a politician.  I am a retired draper and I have yet to find a speech-writer. When the Taoiseach pays one of his visits to Ireland I must ask him if he can help me in that regard.  I re-emphasise that I do not represent unionism, Protestantism or any other &ldquo;-ism&rdquo;.  I speak for me.</P>
      <P>The news from Northern Ireland is good, if not very good, and it gets better by the day, by the week and by the month.  Peace come dropping slowly and it must be that way.  However, there is evidence of movement; there are changes in Northern Ireland.  People, especially the young, are walking about with a freer and less fearful air.  I mention the young because I see young fresh faces in the Public Gallery and think of the many thousands of young faces in Northern Ireland to whom we hope to present a fearless and peaceful future.</P>
      <P>Some of the changes are in themselves small but are nevertheless significant. For example, I was on the other side of Belfast on Monday evening and had to come home through the city to find the M1.  For the first time in 24 years I took the shortest route, which led down the Falls Road.  I did it without fear but I would not have done it some weeks ago, nor did I do it for 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The army presence is less obtrusive and obvious.  There are many fewer helicopters and army patrols.  Largely because of the IRA ceasefire, an American hotel group has decided within the last three weeks to build a large hotel <Col N="368" /> in the centre of Belfast.  We have more tourists from the Republic than before &mdash; they are obvious in Enniskillen.  An RUC member played golf in Donegal last week, which would not have happened previously.</P>
    <P>Everyday without bombs or bullets convinces ever more people that we are at the start of the road to peace. However, many remain sceptical, and understandably so.  Too many people have been hurt in the last 25 years.  They cannot forget and many find it difficult to forgive.  Attitudes of mind take time to change; softening of hearts does not come easily; respect for and trust of the other side does not happen overnight.</P>
    <P>We need space in Northern Ireland; not pressure but time.  With great respect, I say to the Taoiseach that there have been times in the last four weeks that I and many others in Northern Ireland thought he was proceeding ahead of the field; yet I appreciate he must maintain the momentum for peace.  There have also been times when I felt my Prime Minister, Mr. Major, was getting behind the field; however I believe this weekend he will accept the IRA ceasefire and start the clock ticking. I understand Mr. Major's responsibility, because Britain is the sovereign power in Northern Ireland and if events go badly it is Westminster and Mr. Major who will have to pick up the pieces.</P>
    <P>I remain optimistic.  The two things which had to happen have happened. There was no way forward to peace unless the guns and bombs had been left to one side.  I pay tribute to two men, Mr. John Hume and Reverend Roy Magee.  I never thought I would live to see the day when Mr. David Irvine would say he was happy to talk to Mr. Gerry Adams.  That has to be good news.</P>
    <P>We are at the start of what will be a long and bumpy road to peace.  Let us choose our words and actions wisely and let us pray to God to guide us to the paths of peace.</P>

      <P>Senator, there is no need to hire anyone to write your speeches on the North.  I call Senator O'Toole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by Senator Wilson will appeal to all of us. We should discuss where we go from here.  We should put on record the developments which have taken place in the last two months, which are important for our future and for our history. We now need to know what is the next step, what this forum will do, what is its agenda, and how we will put the views of the forum into action.</P>
      <P>It is critically important to create a sub-political forum, working under the forum.  Politicians as politicians cannot take this process much further.  They have taken it to this extraordinary point. I now believe we need to build bridges between communities.  We need to address where differences are in Northern Ireland.  We can approach reconciliation only by building bridges between people from both sides.  In Northern Ireland there is a huge investment of hope in the future of our island.  There is a huge element of expectancy that this will work out fine.  It is a terrorising thought to visualise the despair of the people of the North if this process is not finally successful.</P>
      <P>To address the future we must look briefly at the past.  We must look at the position in the North in the late 1960s, which gave rise to the civil rights movement and the Troubles.  There is a very grave danger that we could see a rerun of history if we do not look exactly at what is happening there.  It has to be said in a non-sectarian way that in the Catholic ghetto areas of Northern Ireland unemployment is running at twice the average.  In parts of the same areas the number of people receiving disability and invalidity pensions and who are off work due to illness is between 70 and 75 per cent of the average. We need to deal with these issues and see where we should intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where can we make the point of contact and who can do it?  No politician <Col N="370" /> from this House can go to west Belfast and begin the process.  I am the only Member of the Oireachtas with an office in Belfast and having day-to-day dealings with the North.  I keep hearing questions for which I do not have answers.  To where do we go next?  What happens to the views which will be expressed in the forum?  If the forum comes to a consensus that we need more integrated education in the North, who will take the initiative with Cardinal Daly or the heads of other Churches to say we want integrated education in a way which protects the cultural values and ethos of the religions of those Churches?  If somebody says it is a good idea that the security forces be allowed play GAA games, who will take this on the next step?  Members of my union working in the North are involved in the education for mutual understanding scheme.  Who pushes out the boat on this?  It is presented as being an important aspect of the developmental work at children's level and so it is. Whereas children of a local Catholic primary school can meet with the children in the local Protestant primary school and have an enjoyable game of soccer, which is considered to be a globally neutral game, to try to do the same with GAA games, cricket or rugby one would suddenly find where the cultural differences and problems are.  Who will address these issues?</P>
    <P>Students who will conclude their leaving certificates this year are now looking for third-level places for next year. Queen's University and other universities in the North are closer to where I live in north Dublin than the majority of the colleges in the South.  Why should students on this island have to fill two application forms?  It would be a good idea to combine these so that next February leaving certificate students who want to study, say, psychology and can do so at UCD, UCC, Queens, Jordanstown or wherever they can see these choices listed together when they are making their decisions and choices.  It is only through such interactive development that we will make progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> I want to concentrate on practical things and keep away from the high principled ideas which I am worried will become the currency and coinage of the forum.  I do not see people coming forward raising the practical issues which can be addressed.  I will be in Belfast four times this week.  The only two cities in Ireland which I cannot fly between are Dublin and Belfast.  Why is this?  A proposal has been put forward that there should be an eastern economic corridor between these cities.  This makes a great deal of sense.  Who will move towards implementing this?  How do we move forward on these issues?</P>
    <P>Education is the area I know best and I have looked at how it impacts on the peace process.  My members in the North are dealing with the second or third generation of pupils who have known nothing but the Troubles.  They have been born and reared in an atmosphere of tension, worry and terror.  How do we respond to this in terms of counselling and back up support?</P>
    <P>More importantly, how do we teach people on both sides of the Border, young children, older students and adults, how to tolerate difference?  How do we say to people that the ethnicity of this island, with its strong Protestant, Catholic, unionist and nationalist values, its overall republican approach and people with different beliefs and cultural backgrounds, is good and that this island could become the jewel in the European crown for the diversity and beauty of its ethnicity and difference, which can be developed?</P>
    <P>Who will start this process?  It will not happen only in the forum, important as the forum is.  I want to make absolutely clear that I fully support the forum.  It is a necessary step which must be taken. My contribution is related to the next step, to what happens after that point. Somebody may say it would be a good idea to have conferences in the North so that people would at least travel there.  The problem is that there is no interaction.  It is very hard to describe to people in the South what it is like to be <Col N="372" /> born in a Catholic hospital, raised in a Catholic housing estate, go to a Catholic school, go to a Catholic college and, if one is sick, go to a Catholic hospital. From the womb to the tomb there is a cultural context of difference.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a woman from the Shankhill during the week and asked her what her view was on Catholicism.  She was slow to speak about it because her intention was not to create problems and she had the same hopes for peace as people in the Falls or anywhere else. She told me that as kids Catholicism reminded her and others of cannibalism. I do not know what this woman's religion was.  She said that in one of our sacraments we consume our own God and this was difficult for other people to understand.  People do not understand each other.  Why can Protestant kids not be invited to the first communion party in their local area?  Who can set up something like this?  If Jewish kids are celebrating their bar mitzvah, why should we not all be there to be part of it?  The cultural celebrations of different groups should not be confined only to people of those cultural backgrounds.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we get people working together on programmes of common value.  If we were to introduce, for instance, European languages on this island &mdash; I use this as an example because it is outside the cultural experience of people on either side of the divide and the Border &mdash; we could have people, North and South, working on this project and on projects like peace education.</P>
    <P>There are also immediate problems and I know Senator Maloney will agree completely with me.  There is a huge dependency on security for employment on both sides of the Border.  I know areas in the North where the majority of the workforce depends on security for jobs.  In the South there are plenty of towns along the Border &mdash; we all know them &mdash; which would be devastated if we took the Army, the police and customs from them.  There is the immediate problem of putting people in Border areas at their ease.  An initiative <Col N="373" /> should be put into operation to compensate these people for the difficulties and worries they are experiencing at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is a peace process and a peace dividend.  What we are discussing is part of the peace process.  The dividend must be the gain.</P>
    <P>For example &mdash; and I do not say this in a clever way &mdash; one should ask the people of Northern Ireland what practical difference peace has made to them at present, apart from security and a sense of safety.  The practical differences are that many parts of Northern Ireland have recently been introduced to those aspects of developed life which we live with everyday, such as pubs closing on time, parking tickets on cars and speed traps on the main roads, because the security forces have time on their hands to do these things.  This is a joke, but it is true.  We need to find an outlet and a direction for the energy which until now has been directed towards the security area.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as the INTO should tap into the experience of its membership in Northern Ireland and ensure it is taken on board by people on the entire island.  Many all-Ireland organisations, such as the INTO, the IRFU, the GAA, the Churches, the ICTU and the trade union movement, have people on all sides.  An opportunity must now be created for those organisations to put forward practical suggestions which can be shepherded through in order to make progress.</P>
    <P>It is crucial to move on this issue as quickly as possible.  Every time we hear on the radio about extra millions of pounds from Brussels, America, Australia or wherever to the Ireland Fund, the immediate knee jerk reaction is to establish more consultancies which will dream up ways to get their hands on this money.  We must put arrangements in place to ensure that these carpet-baggers do not grab this money, which could be used to benefit our people in all areas of life, from the establishment of pre-school education and employment <Col N="374" /> projects to alternatives to the security industry, etc.</P>
    <P>I could speak at some length on this area, but I wish to use the opportunity to underline practical aspects of the peace process which should lead to a peace dividend.  It is not an easy area and if I had my way everybody seeking a place on this forum should be required to put on a page his or her ideas about issues which might be dealt with in Northern Ireland.  There is too much political jockeying for positions on the forum and there is too little about what ideas these people will put forward on the forum.  I do not want to hear about differences, but about how we can move forward to the next step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from the Border county of Donegal and I have lived through the troubles of the past 25 years.  I remember growing up in Letterkenny and travelling across the Border to Derry to entertain ourselves, play football or to see a decent standard of football.  There was a great relationship between the Donegal people and the people of Derry and Northern Ireland. We seemed to have an affinity towards each other and to understand each other.  One thing which struck me, and I said it before in the Seanad, is the lack of understanding which people from the Dublin-Galway line seem to have of the people in Northern Ireland.  They do not understand their attitudes or their way of life.  One reason for this is that they do not visit them to find out about the situation.</P>
      <P>I have watched the peace process and I welcome the ceasefire announced by the nationalist and loyalist paramilitaries. I have driven through Northern Ireland for 25 years.  I travel 207 miles around Sligo and through the midlands when I am coming to the Seanad, whereas it is only 145 miles from Donegal if one travels through Northern Ireland.  This is a great difference and it adds an hour and a half to the trip to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have visited Northern Ireland throughout the years and I have seen <Col N="375" /> the attitude of the young soldiers on the Border who have been sent from England.  Many of these are between 18 and 20 years of age and some of them go back to England in coffins.  One must ask what we have achieved over 25 years of mayhem and deaths in Northern Ireland?  We have achieved nothing in terms of the nationalist movement or in helping the nationalist people to move forward.  People like myself, who had their ears to the ground over the past two or three years, would have known that something was going to happen as regards a ceasefire because the people in Northern Ireland were saying they had had enough.  Fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters were saying nothing had been achieved for the nationalist people through 22 years of mayhem, torture and hunger strikes.  We are no nearer today to a unified state in this country than we were 25 years ago.  Mistakes were made in the 1950s and 1960s as regards Northern Ireland when one side dominated the other.  Let us hope that from the 1990s onwards we will not make the same mistakes.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned moneys and the fact that people believe a substantial amount will be provided and that it will be a panacea.  I hope that money will be used to benefit the people rather than what it has been used for over the past number of years, to build hotels, swimming pools, etc., which have not benefited the people we are concerned about.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the people involved in the peace process, including the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Mr. John Hume and even Mr. Gerry Adams.  Mr. Adams took a lot on his plate by delivering the IRA, but I believe he will still have problems with some of its factions.  This will create a major problem for him in the future.  We should give them all the support we can to try to ensure these people are kept on side.  People, such as Archbishop Eames and Rev. Roy Magee, should be thanked because they have put their heads on the block, although as someone who lives in Donegal, <Col N="376" /> adjacent to Derry, I believe Mr. John Hume has put his head on the block also.  He put his own life and the life of his family at stake as a result of the attitude he took and the talks he had with Mr. Gerry Adams.  He took a great chance, but he was not praised by many people.  He was attacked by the media and his life was put in danger.  He has been justified as a result of what has happened.</P>
    <P>A number of weeks ago a Labour Party group visited Derry city and met all the political groups.  The first group we met was the Inner City Trust, which was led by Paddy &ldquo;Bogside&rdquo; Doherty. Approximately 30 per cent of inner city Derry was destroyed.  These people got together to try to improve their way of life.  Throughout the 1980s, as a result of talks with the British Government and the Americans and with the support of people such as Mr. John Hume, they completely transformed the inner city of Derry.  There has been little trouble over the past ten years in Derry city, whereas bombs were still par for the course in areas such as Armagh and Belfast.  However, these people built up their city and built a relationship between themselves and their loyalist neighbours.  At present, it is a city to be proud of.</P>
    <P>On the same day we met the Apprentice Boys, named after a group of people who manned the gates many years ago.  Their attitude is that they will continue to man the gates against the nationalists and that they will not be taken over.  We must overcome such attitudes.  We also met the SDLP, which Mr. John Hume has driven to great heights in Northern Ireland.  He must be commended for this.  It is a forward thinking party.  At 12 o'clock we met the Lord Mayor of Derry, who is a unionist, although there is a Catholic majority on Derry City Council.  They must be commended for this.  In the afternoon we met the UUP and Mr. Gregory Campbell from the DUP, and we met Sinn Féin in the evening.</P>
    <P>These people wanted dialogue. However, they strongly made the point <Col N="377" /> that there was too much Catholic involvement in the South in education, health and the Judiciary, in particular. They felt liberal views were beginning to be expressed in Ireland, but they still did not trust the Judiciary here.  Shades of this were expressed during the recent debâcle regarding the appointment of the Attorney General.  We should keep our eye on this because how we are perceived in Northern Ireland is important for the whole peace process.</P>
    <P>I was in Belfast about a week ago. The people one will get the message from in Northern Ireland on how things are going are usually the taximen.  I was talking to a unionist taximan and asked him how he felt about the situation.  His reply was strongly worded.  He said, as a unionist, he would feel that they were &mdash; I will not repeat his exact words &mdash; buggered.  I asked him why and he said &ldquo;Basically, Southern Ireland and Great Britain do not want us, so we are presently in limbo.&rdquo;  We have to do something to ensure that those people are not left in limbo.  This is why I ask people from all our political parties to go to Northern Ireland and talk to the people there.  Dialogue must be maintained. The hand of friendship must be put across to the people there.</P>
    <P>Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of having my car broken into while I was in Dublin, which was something I always feared during the time I was there.  However, one can go to Belfast and leave one's car sitting at the side of the street for a whole weekend and no one will touch it for some reason.  One does not feel as safe doing this in Dublin.  That experience brought home to me the difference between the two areas.</P>
    <P>While the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is to be welcomed, unfortunately the unionists will not be taking part and we have to ask ourselves why. The same situation occurred with the Opsahl report.  We did not get the real unionist point of view.  What was missing from that was that somebody like the Rev. Paisley, who commanded one of the highest number of votes in the <Col N="378" /> European Parliament, did not even make a submission to it.  It left the Opsahl report short in content and I feel the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation may well be the same.</P>
    <P>From talking to people in Northern Ireland, they tell me that they trust certain parties in the South.  The unionist parties will seemingly talk to Fine Gael and the Labour Party, but for some reason they have a problem with Fianna Fáil.  I ask my friends in that party if they would try to do something about this because that message has come across.  If members from Fianna Fáil went up to meet them or spoke to them if they came to Dublin, I have no doubt that it would help the peace and reconciliation for which we are working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity today to express my views on this matter.  This also gives me the opportunity to welcome the announcements by those engaged in violence on this island to stop.  Many people were hoping for this and expecting it to happen during the past year.  Perhaps after 25 years of violence, the reasons for it became dimmer and dimmer as time went on.  A greater number of people in the various communities struck a chord with those responsible for much of the violence.  They let their feelings be known to these individuals in no uncertain fashion as to where violence was taking them.  In the end the violence was stopped by the communities themselves. The security forces seemed to have a lesser role in the equation.  While it may not be said now, the stark reality of outright civil war was facing those not alone in the North of Ireland but on the island as a whole.  Indeed, that was said here by Senator Wilson.  This could have been the reason that made people realise that violence had brought them to that point, making it the best excuse and reason why it should be denounced and finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Maloney's comments regarding Fianna Fáil.  One of the most historic happenings that took place in recent times <Col N="379" /> was the stand now adopted by Fianna Fáil, which I welcome.  Every year at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, the war cry that went up was that Ireland was united.  I do not blame the unionists for not liking Fianna Fáil when that was its stated policy. Now, people have realised that one cannot make statements purely for political or historic reasons.  I can understand why Fianna Fáil stood for that and why it expressed it every year at its Ard Fheis, but the reality of living on good terms with one's neighbour, living on this island and the fact that Ireland is now part of the European Union shows that we have moved in a different direction. Both the world and Europe are changing.  That is historic, because the largest party in this part of the island have now realised that and have gone along with it.</P>
    <P>It has always been Fine Gael's stated policy to live on good terms with our neighbours and to develop better relations with them.  That message has also hit home to the unionists who, for one reason or another, because they were in the minority on this island &mdash; they were in the majority in the North &mdash; also had their own hidden fears, especially when they heard statements from the South saying that one day all of this island would be united.  Perhaps it will, but people must be united on the basis that they want both themselves and their children to live together and that violence is not, and will not, be part of the political agenda in the future.</P>
    <P>Many people must be thanked for their efforts for peace over the past few years.  The SDLP were the nationalist and non-violent party.  It is not today or yesterday that John Hume and his family had to stand up to men of violence when he was terrorised in his house.  He was always used to abuse, be it verbal or violent.  Whenever democracy and the freedom of the individual is discussed, he will go down in history as standing high on that list.  Our Government did their part, but one must bear in mind that other Governments helped as well.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement <Col N="380" /> brought about this situation.  The nationalist community in the North saw that their role had improved, that they were getting more recognition and that a fairer system was being introduced. The Anglo-Irish Agreement played a major part in that.  It isolated the men of violence.</P>
    <P>I wish the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation well.  I know perhaps a slight error was made as regards the number of Alliance Party members on the forum, but I know the Taoiseach and the Government will set that right. The Alliance Party has always stood against violence and seem to be made up of people who are prepared to live in peace on this island, not placing as much emphasis on the past but moving forward instead.  This is why it has joined the forum.  It is a progressive party.  It was unfortunate that it did not get an additional seat on the forum, but maybe that will be settled to its satisfaction.</P>
    <P>There is much more I could say, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, but there are other speakers who wish to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to debate the peace process. Nobody should stand in the way of any kind of progress.  The Government has taken a major step and everybody must be commended &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, John Hume, the British Prime Minister and the Unionist Party in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I was shocked when I heard that unionists and other groups in Northern Ireland were always a bit reluctant to speak to the Fianna Fáil Party because, since the signing of the Treaty, that party has been interested in dialogue.  If, in our hearts, we had the reunification of this country as part of our agenda, I do not see anything wrong with that because we are living on a small island compared to the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I lived abroad for a number of years and have done business with people of various races and creeds.  I never asked them what religion they were or if they went to church on Sundays, received <Col N="381" /> Holy Communion, were confirmed or went to their bar-mitzvahs.  It did not really bother me because I had my life to get on with, and I got on with it.  In a society like ours, if people want to start drawing that type of argument into the equation they are only looking for a way out.</P>
    <P>I have never asked about the religion of my colleagues in this House or the Lower House because it does not bother me what they are.  In my own political party there is a Jew, whom I would support in any way I could because he is a human being and has to be respected as all denominations have to be respected.  When it comes to difficulties in any part of the world, where you have hunger and starvation, this country is always to the forefront in helping other races out of their dilemmas.</P>
    <P>We have had, and have, a very serious situation on our island from many points of view, including economics, tourism and security.  We are trying to overcome all those problems and the Government must be commended for the major step it has taken.  The people in Northern Ireland must be commended also for coming part of the way to try and bring peace to this island. Nothing has been gained from all the problems over the years, particularly the killings and the trauma inflicted on families on all sides.  I would hate to think that a red herring was being brought into the peace process about representation on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  It reminds me of county councillors complaining that they did not get on a particular committee to represent this, that or the other thing.</P>
    <P>The main point is that the peace process is being put in place and I know that fair play will be implemented on all sides.  The major step has been taken but several other steps have yet to be taken to finalise the equation.  It will not be done overnight and it is going to be very difficult.  Political leaders in Northern Ireland have an active part to play and those who stand in the way of progress <Col N="382" /> in the peace initiative will have a lot to answer for, not just to the people of this country but to the people of the world.</P>
    <P>In the recent past we have listened to all the media hype about the Taoiseach flying to Australia and the Tánaiste visiting Tokyo or New York.  However, they have both raised the level of this country beyond expectation.  For a tiny island on a big globe, when you mention Ireland in any part of the world, the Irish are a recognised force.  They are people to be listened to, who have accomplished economic achievements and have now put the peace initiative in place.  Many people must be commended for that.  It is totally unfair to criticise the itineraries of political party leaders, whoever is in Government, when they are abroad for the betterment of this country.  If they were sitting at home in bunkers doing absolutely nothing they would be criticised for not promoting the country and attracting jobs here.  I cannot understand why when they are out doing that, they are criticised.  These are small points that we would not want to get tied up with inside our own little snug political arenas.</P>

      <P>People who live in glasshouses should not throw stones. The political parties would not want to start doing that either because there is plenty of glass in their houses.  That is not the answer.  The answer is dialogue, trust and getting on with the peace process which is the biggest step forward this country has taken since the foundation of the State.  The peace process will affect industry and tourism in this country &mdash; when I mention &ldquo;this country&rdquo; I am talking about this island, north and south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been involved in the tourism business for 25 or 30 years and meet many people who say: This is a lovely island but there is a war going on&rdquo;.  You tell them the war is not going on here, that it might be 200 miles away from <Col N="383" /> Kerry, but 200 miles to these people is nothing, it just a drive up the road. There was a war going on in this country but, thank God, it is finished.  If the peace process had been achieved 40 or 50 years ago it would not have been Nelson on a statue in O'Connell Street; perhaps today we would have Albert Reynolds at one end, Dick Spring at the other and John Hume in the middle.  We should be erecting monuments to these people for what they have achieved to date.</P>

      <P>I resent anyone who tries to stand in the way of dialogue, saying on the one hand that they welcome it but sniping at it on the other. It is unfair because the most important thing is to look at our country, this island, the future for our children and the future economic situation.  We must look forwards, not backwards.  Eventually, resentment between people in the northern part of our island will fade because it was just an excuse.  In English cities people do not even know the religion of the person living next door. They work together but they are not concerned about their religion.  They are concerned about where the next shilling will come from to pay their rent.</P>
      <P>Living in peace, tranquility and harmony is the answer for the future.  I welcome the peace process and the people involved in it.  I would ask those involved in the peace process to be flexible and to ensure the security and sanity of the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended funerals of people killed as a result of Northern violence and wept. I saw parents burying their young in the prime of their lives and I saw young people burying parents that they would never get to know.  The fact that this factor has been taken out of the equation must be commended.  I am asking all those involved to get it together because, while the major step has been taken, there is a long way to go before <Col N="384" /> the circle can be completed.  I welcome the peace process.</P>

      <P>All that needs to be said today is that we have come to this point and thank God for it.  Perhaps everything else is irrelevant.  When we last debated this matter, as we have done consistently over the past couple of years to the credit of the House, I was quite pessimistic.  At the time I said that the only ground for optimism was to stop the killing, to put away the bombs and bullets and to talk peace.  That would be the only road to peace.  Thankfully, that opinion has been vindicated and we can now view the future with optimism and enthusiasm.  The basic condition for peace and progress has been fulfilled.  Therefore, we can be optimistic.  I think that we were always hopeful, which is not the same thing. There was always hope, but now there are grounds for genuine optimism.</P>
      <P>The opinion of this House, which has been expressed with restraint and dignity over succeeding debates, has been very substantially vindicated.  It is a credit to the House that it has taken such a restrained and balanced view over successive debates.</P>
      <P>There are still very difficult questions which are going to take a great deal of time, restraint and generosity to resolve. The first question which arises is: has Sinn Féin signed on for sorting out the problems on this island by peaceful and democratic means only?  They are the only people who can answer that question; I cannot answer it on their behalf.  The task confronting Sinn Féin now is to take up the challenge of a peace process and to see it through to its logical conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  I do not have tremendously great expectations for it, nor is it necessary to have great expectations. However, I believe fundamentally that it is far more important to talk than not to talk.  That is something which we may have learned from South Africa and other parts of the world.  I regret deeply that the Alliance Party was not offered <Col N="385" /> more than two seats.  It took a tremendous act of courage on its part to agree to participate in the forum and it is only by its participation that the forum can be meaningful.  Otherwise, what is likely to occur is that we will have only one tradition talking to itself rather than one tradition listening to another, which is what we have to do and what I hope the forum will achieve.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of how much progress has been made in resolving that difficulty. However, it seems absolutely paramount that the Alliance Party, which, in the face of everything which happened, stood for balance, moderation and reconciliation over such a long period, should be accorded a status which is at least equal to people who stood for nothing other than violence for 25 years.</P>
    <P>It is important for the forum to explicitly state the principle of consent. The terms of reference for the forum states &ldquo;it will be a fundamental guiding principle of the forum and of participation in it that all differences relating to the exercise of the right of self determination of the people of Ireland and to all other matters will be resolved exclusively by peaceful and democratic means&rdquo;.  I do not have any quibble with that; I think that it is very worthy.</P>
    <P>However, I would go further to say that it has to be done in accordance with the Downing Street Declaration.  The terms of reference open by saying that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is being established by the Government in accordance with the intentions as expressed in the joint declaration.  That is not quite the same thing as going the full mile and saying that it will be in accordance with the joint declaration.  I think that has to be the basis on which the forum works.  We must say that it can only be with the consent of the majority of the people in Northern Ireland that there can be any possibility of a change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.  It is not clear to me that Sinn Féin accepts that principle, which I regard as fundamental.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> It is important that we talk and try to understand other people's points of view.  That is the way to progress. However, if we are to do that effectively there has to be the widest possible participation. I appeal to people of the unionist tradition, outside of the Alliance Party, to participate and to show the generosity which is prevalent today.  I can understand the deep suspicions which are there and I fully appreciate why they are there. However, I believe that there is time for generosity &mdash; as we have said before in this House &mdash; and that that generosity extends to all sides.  It is not just a unilateral generosity.  It stems from a mutual respect of the position of other parties. It is quite legitimate and right that we recognise the legitimacy of an aspiration but that we say absolutely that it is illegitimate to attempt to achieve that aspiration by violent means.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole about the small things which we do as individuals and within society.  I have been refereeing rugby football matches for about 25 years.  Part of the responsibilities of doing that has taken me to rugby grounds throughout Northern Ireland. At times it was difficult to go.  I went the morning after the Hillsborough agreement when Belfast was almost blockaded. However, I believe that it is through doing such things that enough people see that there are normal people on both sides of the Border and that we do not all have these agendas and baggage.</P>
    <P>I come from the nationalist and Catholic tradition.  It was important that people who came from different traditions, but could see each other's legitimacy through the sport which we all enjoyed, could have this dialogue in the bar after games.  They are very small things but I think that they are important.  It is important that people come to the theatre in Dublin, as they did last night.  Those things are fundamentally important.  It takes ages and ages to achieve progress through those small things but they are of importance and should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> I think it is curious, and I could never understand it, how those people who spoke most about ending partition were those who frequently acted in the most partitionist way.  It would never occur to them to go and see what life was like in Northern Ireland and how people lived there and to talk to people there.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the British Government seems to be prepared to open talks with Sinn Féin, at whatever level.  However, I believe that there is a problem with explosives in the background. We had a difficulty earlier with permanence, which I think we have overcome.  The actions have demonstrated that there is a permanence about the ceasefire.  That attitude has been reinforced by the very welcome developments on the loyalist paramilitary side.  However, I still have problems about the Semtex and punishment shootings.  I also have problems with policing and what the vacuum might be in the event that the paramilitaries decide to carry out summary justice.</P>
    <P>I thank God that we have people like Senator Wilson in this House so that we have that legitimate and authentic voice. We could express what he has to say ten times over but it would not carry the authenticity which he brings to it.  I will re-emphasise something which he said earlier &mdash; we need space.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the constitutional politicians and the clergy, who were mentioned earlier.  However, there is still one problem.  The fundamental thing which we are going to have to reconcile is the statement that the union is safe with the statement that we are talking about the nuts and bolts of British withdrawal. That is the conundrum which still faces us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated Northern Ireland on a number of occasions in this House and we have had the opportunity to mark a number of very important steps in the progress towards a solution.  The Downing Street Declaration of last December was one of the major steps.  On 1 September of <Col N="388" /> this year there was the ceasefire by the IRA and now, recently, we have had the loyalist ceasefire.</P>
      <P>As Senator Dardis said, on each occasion the debate has been very restrained and constructive and the presence of Senator Wilson has added a huge dimension to our debates.  Every time that we have debated this we have expressed hopes that there would be further progress.  We can say today that there has been a tremendous amount of progress.  We can now look forward to what is generally described as the peace dividend.</P>
      <P>I sincerely welcome the announcement of the loyalist ceasefire.  It was absolutely essential that trust was built up in the cases of both the IRA and loyalist ceasefires.  It was built up painstakingly over a long period of time and with tremendous effort from constitutional politicians, church representatives and people on all sides of the community.</P>
      <P>We have to pay tribute to those people, particularly the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, John Hume and others.  It was interesting to hear Gusty Spence mention Cardinal Ó Fiach.  Gusty Spence, an old loyalist of long standing whose past has been a very violent one but who has embraced peace, talked about his relationship with Cardinal Ó Fiach. These relationships have been extremely important and the careful work done in the background has been essential.</P>
      <P>It is also essential to keep the framework of the Downing Street Declaration and its guarantees permanently on the agenda.  As Senator Dardis said, the principle of consent has to repeated and people have to be sure that they can trust that it will always be part of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we last debated this issue, support for the peace process in other parts of the world has grown.  Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have travelled, and have been criticised for travelling, to various places.  This has, however, been essential.  On 2 September, just after the debate in this House, the <Col N="389" /> Tánaiste met with President Clinton. The Americans have pledged support for the peace process in the context of employment creation and inward investment. This is relevant to the points made by Senator O'Toole about the importance of the support from abroad being felt on the ground among the communities in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was right to raise the importance of the changing lives of ordinary people on the ground.  It is important that whatever money and support comes from abroad is used in a real and practical way to change lives and bring people closer together.  It is important that we work with community groups.  I have a copy of the news magazine of the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council which contains evidence of tremendous work on the ground in Northern Ireland.  It is necessary to build on this.</P>
    <P>The peace process will not be effective unless it works from the bottom up as well as from the top down.  It is important that a framework and safeguards for both communities exist and that each community realises that their aspirations, hopes and security are equal to those of the other side.  That must be guaranteed from the top while not forgetting the approach from the bottom.  The latter approach must also be successful and work in conjunction with communities on both sides.</P>
    <P>The EU also pledged financial support and increased its support from £12 million to £40 million.  That is a sizeable increase in the support of the EU for peace in Ireland which should be used wisely.  Since we last met, John Hume has been nominated by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Many Members have praised John Hume and I have done so myself in the past.  It is only right that this nomination was made and I am sure it will have everybody's support because he fully deserves it.</P>
    <P>There are basic constitutional differences which have to be acknowledged. However, regardless of the decisions made, people on both sides have to <Col N="390" /> realise that their views on constitutional issues will be safeguarded and that the ground rules of the Downing Street Declaration will be the framework for what happens.  As long as that is present, there is room for people to trust and talk to each other and make political progress.</P>
    <P>The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation has been discussed here.  I share the hope that the situation concerning the Alliance Party will be resolved; I understand that it is the subject of ongoing discussion.  I also wish the unionist parties would join the forum.  I know they have doubts and do not see themselves participating but we, as Members of the Seanad, should urge them to take part.  It has been said that participation will be without prejudice to the position on constitutional issues held by any party which should give comfort and understanding to the unionists.  They will not be browbeaten in this process.  We should encourage them to get involved.</P>
    <P>The peace process is on very firm ground &mdash; popular support.  There has been widespread support for both ceasefires in both communities in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Britain and elsewhere.  That is probably the greatest hope for a way forward.  The hard men of violence who are still there on both sides and who do not like the peace process know there is no popular support for their stand and that they will not get support if there is any resurgence of violence on either side. That is the real ground on which we can hope that the peace process will move forward.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is no easy process.  It is very slow.  The chief executive of Co-operation North said:</P>
    <P>Peace is not just absence of violence; it is a positive force and the process of achieving it can be slow and demanding.</P>
    <P>We have to acknowledge and accept that.  Senator O'Toole, Senator Wilson and Senator Maloney, from their experience on the ground in Northern Ireland, <Col N="391" /> have all very clearly demonstrated the difficulties.  Nevertheless I believe the difficulties can be overcome but they must be overcome slowly and always while working with the people on the ground.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that John Major is currently consulting with his senior Ministers in relation to opening dialogue with Sinn Féin.  That is another step forward which we could hope for in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here on 2 September; I was in South Africa and I was there also on the day the ceasefire was announced.  I was impressed by the attention it got and the hope it raised.  I was impressed because I was in South Africa, a country that has changed dramatically in the last four or five months.</P>
      <P>Many of the people to whom I spoke had been pessimistic about their future in South Africa last April when the election took place but were now positive, confident and looking forward with optimism.  They believed things had changed.  In the new South Africa, attitudes had changed and it was this change in attitudes which excited me most about the opportunities we have here.</P>
      <P>Five years ago these people would have thought that a South Africa run by the majority was unthinkable, and certainly not something of which they would want to be a part.  I saw how these people and their attitudes had changed and were continuing to change. I did not ask myself would it not be great if the unionists were to change like that as well.  Instead, I thought this could happen to all of us in Ireland.</P>
      <P>We need to change the way we think and we must learn to think the unthinkable if we are to successfully bridge the gap that exists between the two communities in the North and in Ireland as a whole and bring about peace and genuine reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make points, the first of which is about winning.  It might be useful <Col N="392" /> to ask ourselves what we cherish highly but are prepared to give up.  We can reach a lasting solution in Northern Ireland only when both communities begin to realise that they cannot have everything they want.  Until they agree to a compromise that is equally painful for both of them, there is no way to find a solution on a win-lose basis; it will have to be on a win-win basis.  We will do our cause no good if we entertain foolish hopes that somehow or other the walls of Jericho will collapse in front of our eyes and a united Ireland will emerge painlessly from the rubble. There is a necessity for us to begin to rethink matters.</P>
    <P>We have too few solutions to discuss and models to examine.  It seems there is only one solution on the nationalist side &mdash; a united Ireland, maybe not now, but at worst a little way down the road.  In the past we spoke about halfway houses to unity, joint sovereignty, condominium or something like that. On the unionist side, the preferred solution is a continuation of the <i>status quo</i> with perhaps a few cosmetic changes. The essential issue for them is that there is no constitutional change until a majority in the North endorses it.  I do not believe there is much prospect for a worthwhile settlement if these are the only two models to work from.  What I mean by a worthwhile settlement is one which is genuinely win-win.  It would be easy to see progress if either side caved in and yielded to the other position.  We could then have agreement in five minutes, but that is unlikely to happen.</P>
    <P>We should realise we will not get all we want and what we can get will be painful and, in many ways, undesirable. Having realised this, we should then begin to search for new models on which to build the fabric of the solution we hope to reach.  New models should not be disguised versions of what one side or the other wants; they should be totally new.  I say &ldquo;models&rdquo; in the plural because the process needs to start from a selection of models, from a number of different opportunities and alternatives so that we may tease out the different <Col N="393" /> attitudes to them.  As we search for these models something we should ditch is the notion that at this point we can come up with a solution which we will put in cement.  Whatever is agreed now cannot be the last word, but what it can be &mdash; and I suggest it must be &mdash; is a framework for evolution, trust and confidence to be built between the two communities so that further steps might be taken at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic about the prospect of real progress on this question.  I was impressed by the debate this morning and the points made by Senator Dardis when he spoke about consent.  I was also impressed by the point Senator O'Toole made about small things.  My mother grew up on the banks of Lough Neagh, County Armagh, and my father grew up in the middle of the Mourne Mountains. As a youngster I visited the two farms and met the neighbours who, as Senator Dardis who came from a Catholic, nationalist background said, were Catholic nationalists.  Their land was poor because that is where their families had moved to in the 1600s.  They moved to the banks of Lough Neagh in the reeds rather than the good land from which they had moved and to the Mourne Mountains because the good land was held by another community.  After 300 years this problem will not be easily solved; it will come in small bites and it will require patience.</P>
    <P>What is sad is that the gap has widened in the past 25 years.  It is a jolt to meet somebody and talk about rugby only to discover they would not play it nor would they be interested in soccer and then to meet somebody from the other side who would not dream of going to a Gaelic football match.  We must find a solution, which will come from the things we spoke about today.  I am optimistic about the two developments I spoke about.  We will not have a win-win situation unless we and those involved in the process adopt a flexible approach.  As I said we should have a number of models and solutions if we are to arrive at an eventual settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the significance of these events has impacted on any of us yet, much as we try to understand the change which has occurred since the Downing Street Declaration, the subsequent IRA ceasefire and then the loyalist ceasefire.  As Senator Quinn illustrated, in many ways it has had a greater impact outside Ireland.</P>
      <P>I reflect for a moment on the reason the Tanáiste is not with us, although he may be here shortly.  He is not here because he and the Taoiseach are meeting the Leader of Sinn Féin.  It would have been unthinkable six or 12 months ago that the Tanáiste would have been unavailable to address the House at a particular time because he was meeting the Leader of Sinn Féin.  That is a measure of the dramatic change and progress which has occurred.  We must see what our contribution can be at each stage of that evolution.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly after 25 years of horrific violence, 70 years of dissension, distrust, domination and fear of one form or another, there will be residual scars and wounds.  There will be the need for healing, but there cannot be healing without scars to show where the original wound was.  It would be too much to expect suddenly that that experience could be obliterated from the consciousness of those who came through that terrible trauma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lady &mdash; I will call her Maire McGuinness; that is not her real name &mdash; from Derry was a prominent and active supporter of the SDLP and endeavoured to do all she could over the years to shelter her children from any contact with violence and to bring them into the political process. However, on one occasion the youngest member of the family become involved in what seemed to be regular excitement, bottle and petrol bomb throwing. That night the family had a visit from the RUC and the British Army.  As a consequence, she told me she had five active Provos in her family about which she could do nothing.  The sadness of that impacted on my mind over the <Col N="395" /> years and I used to ask Peter Carrington how we could extricate Maire McGuinness and those like her from the web of violence which was suffocating them when they wanted to work for peace; as she did, and still does.</P>
    <P>I read an encouraging but sad story in a newspaper two days ago about a young social worker from the Creggan, Eugene Mullen, who worked under a pseudonym, an extraordinarily brave thing to do, in one of the loyalist working clubs in Belfast.  The people there grew up in a certain background and tradition of which they were proud. However, they had a certain apprehension and attitude to Taigs and others, which they felt was patriotic.  They felt it right to share this common attitude towards those who deserved their hatred. Who are we to judge them?  This social worker developed a personal relationship with one of these young men who subsequently became, by our judgment, one of the most savage loyalist killers. It is sad to reflect on what might have been if we had all shown a little more understanding of the other person's position.  That loyalist killer was one of the last victims of Northern violence before the ceasefire was proclaimed.</P>
    <P>We have come from a period of violence but we must remember that in every post-war society &mdash; this was a war &mdash; those living in that terrible reality, whether in west or east Belfast watching their sons being maimed, killed or injured, the police who were also subjected to that experience, the British Army, youngsters from Leeds, Birmingham or elsewhere, who I saw looking like frightened strangers wondering what they were doing in Belfast &mdash; have all been scarred.</P>
    <P>We now have moved to a different stage as a consequence of the great political commitment of the Government, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Mr. Hume and, let it be said, those in the Sinn Féin movement whom we may not always have wanted to acknowledge, much less admire, who have made this quantum leap forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> Violence has been put aside.  There are those who would wish us not to believe that.  There are Cassandras, one in particular had the responsibility of Government during my period in Opposition in the other House and was in Opposition when I was in Government. I am talking about Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, who for some strange reason does not want to recognise these signs of progress, who rather wants to point out that there are irreconcilable differences, that it is not possible to reconcile the loyalist position which says the union is safe with the republican position which says that we now have the possibility of working towards a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>We will always find a Cassandra who will say that these things are complex if not impossible, but it is up to each one of us, including commentators in the press, to recognise that the real significance of what is being done is that the irreconcilable is being reconciled.  I did not think I would ever hear Mr. John Taylor, whom I have known for years, saying that he supported the contact and discussions between the British Government and Sinn Féin.  Mr. Taylor was physically violated by Sinn Féin, or the IRA of the time, but I have heard this statement from him, and more besides. We have all heard it.</P>
    <P>Let us not confine ourselves in this House &mdash; I am glad to say I have hardly heard it here &mdash; to pointing out the difficulties and the irreconcilable.  We are not called upon in this Chamber to work out these complex details; what we are being called upon to do is to support through our words &mdash; we will not have much opportunity for action &mdash; the process which is now underway.  I have been in Belfast a number of times within the last six months and, hopefully, I will travel there again next week. There is no doubt that as violence was the characteristic of the last 20 years, peace and reconciliation is the mood of the moment in Belfast as one of my colleagues has already said.  That is the foundation on which whatever is to be done now will be built.  How we build on <Col N="397" /> that foundation will be the test of our achievement from this point on.  It can and will be done.</P>
    <P>Members know about the energy that is released in post war societies. Members should look at the energy that rebuilt Germany and the nation which emerged after all of the suffering and unspeakable brutality that was a feature of that nation at that time.  There is good and bad in all of us.  After all of that we saw the emergence of the European Communities.  Dissention and residual traces of distrust are still in evidence today in the centre of that European Union.  I have met it regularly in the course of normal negotiations on the CAP.  If Members think there is a natural and easy harmony between the Dutch and the Germans, they are mistaken. There is not.  They have to work at it each day in common cause for the economic future for all of us.  The same will happen here.  That is why progress through economic co-operation, respect for our mutual characteristics and respect for our separate identities is important.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That is the basis on which we can build that forum.  The tone and theme of these debates in the Seanad has been consistent and the presence of Senator Wilson in this House has made a remarkable contribution as a reminder to us that our own immediate, narrow, comfortable assumptions never can be enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally reject the notion of the United Ireland that some unionists seem to fear, a notion that would mean we would dominate them or swallow them up.  I would find that as reprehensible as any unionist does.  For that reason I ask them to take every opportunity for involvement with the British and ourselves, such as exists in the British Irish Interparliamentary body.  There are seats there waiting to be filled.  I am <Col N="398" /> on that forum, as they should be.  Who else is to speak for them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach. I was getting very worried listening to Senator O'Kennedy, because I was finding that the spirit of harmony in this House was almost undiluted, until he mentioned Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly legitimate for Senator O'Kennedy to criticise Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien and such criticism is welcome. However, to call him a Cassandra and to insult him as a prophet of doom is not to understand the position which he is taking.  This new atmosphere of peace and goodwill which permeates all the political parties and the whole of this country is a very welcome one, but it is also very necessary that there should be those who say that everything is not perfect, that there are real dangers ahead and that we could be living in a fool's paradise.</P>
      <P>Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien does not wish to make a self-fulfilling prophesy, but he has a record of courage, a record of warning against and of fighting violence unparalleled in this country for 20 years.  If his prophesies are wrong, so be it, but as I understand what he says, he is telling us that if we continue to put pressure on the unionist population, as has been done for many many years in this country, there are dangers ahead of which we should be aware.  One danger which he points out unambiguously is civil war.  That is not a popular message in this country at present, but it is one which I find welcome, because we should have diverse opinions to counter the consensus which exists in all political parties in this House at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien has been right most of the time over the years. He has recently been warning us and reminding us of the uncomfortable truth, that in our midst we have welcomed a political party which has given up violence for the moment.  He reminds us of something else which I know Senator Dardis rightly touched on &mdash; I did not hear all of his speech &mdash; in <Col N="399" /> saying that questions had to be asked. Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien reminds us that these people have arsenals of arms, that they have not declared their ceasefire to be permanent and he reminds us that they have not renounced violence for all time.  That is a very necesary and welcome message.  It may be embarrassing and uncomfortable and contrary to the beliefs and optimism which exists, but it is something which we must face, not get paranoid about and which we must counter.</P>
    <P>Like everybody else in this House I welcome the new atmosphere which has existed here since 31 August.  I congratulate everybody involved in that effort and in the great success which has been achieved.  We have to be careful about some of the things which we say and we have a special obligation in this part of the country to understand the unionist population rather than the nationalist population.  The nationalist population appears at this stage to have reached an understanding of sorts and now it is time, indeed it was time before this, to make moves which breach the divide between us and the unionist population, which is much bigger than ever existed between various strands of nationalism.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Quinn when he drew a parallel, and it is a common parallel, between the unionists and the whites in South Africa.  The Senator spoke of the wonderful achievement in South Africa.  It is a wonderful achievement and, like the Senator, I was lucky enough to visit the country this year. The Senator went on to make the remark: if only the unionists were to change like the whites in South Africa. There is a mind-set at work here which blames the unionists and places them in the same category and pigeon hole as the whites in South Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it down as the Senator spoke and he said if unionists were to change, we must not think like that.  My point is valid, nevertheless, because one hears so often people saying if only there was a de Klerk on the unionist side, which implies guilt and also that de Klerk was perhaps part of a majority.</P>
      <P>The unionists do not see themselves like that.  There must never be a return to the old days of Stormont, of discrimination and gerrymandering, and the unionists acknowledge this.  Indeed, I heard Ken Magennis say at Glencree that the unionists are continually apologising for that period, but nobody wants to hear.</P>
      <P>In addition, the unionists, because they are in a majority, do not see themselves in the same category as the white laager bracket in South Africa.  This does not mean that there should be what is now fashionably known as majoritarianism, as there are special reasons why this should not happen in Northern Ireland, and this must be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>However, it should also be acknowledged that the Protestants or the unionists in Northern Ireland are in a majority, and this is an unpalatable fact which we are going to have to face.  This is where the parallel with South Africa unfortunately ends.  It is therefore unfortunate to draw this parallel as it does not exist, although it is tempting to do so.  Indeed, the language of some of the commentators in calling for a de Klerk, while it is neat, is not apt at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must change, and it is incumbent upon us in this self congratulatory period to change ourselves and our attitudes to the unionists in Northern Ireland.  We must be extraordinarily carefully, especially as politicians, about what we say in this House and outside it over the coming months.  It is a very delicate period and there are extraordinary difficulties ahead.  In this respect <Col N="401" /> the language we use will be very important.</P>
    <P>We must stop talking about demilitarisation, not because the motives of those who use it here are aggressive or wrong, but because such language sounds to people in Northern Ireland like the language of the IRA.  The word &ldquo;demilitarisation&rdquo;, a word used by the Taoiseach frequently, is also a word used by the leaders of Sinn Féin.  In consequence people in Northern Ireland will identify the Taoiseach's language with that of the IRA.  It is important therefore that we do not allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>In the past week, especially after the Official Unionist Party conference, we should welcome the fact that the Reverend Ian Paisely has been isolated to a large extent in the unionist community. Many people speak of his influence withering, but it will take very little from us to hand him those weapons of propaganda which he so desperately needs at present.  In this context talk of demilitarisation will do so, as will talk of any kind of support for Sinn Féin.  Even being photographed in a blaze of glory with Gerry Adams on the steps of Merrion Street is unhelpful and unnecessary in this context.  It is also a pity that the American Ambassador to Ireland, Mrs. Kennedy Smith visited Northern Ireland yesterday and again provoked Mr. Paisely into a reaction which he was glad to have.  The conflict is too delicate for gestures of that kind.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary balance in Northern Ireland, where the loyalist paramilitaries claim that the union is now safe, which is in contradiction with Sinn Féin members, who claim that the union is not safe and it must go, or else they will not be successful, which contains an implicit threat.  We must therefore be careful, and from this part of the island we must be especially careful about what we say so that we do not provoke any kind of bad unionist reaction at this time.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, if the House is to have a statement from the Government on the debate this <Col N="402" /> morning, there are only ten minutes to 1 p.m. and there may be other speakers. Surely, out of courtesy, the House should be advised if there is going to be a speech by the Tánaiste?  There has been a succession of junior Ministers in attendance, which is not good enough. There may be reason for this but at least out of courtesy the House should be advised if there is a problem and arrangements should be made to extend the debate or have it rescheduled if it is impossible for the Tánaiste to speak at this time.</P>

      <P>I am a novice to these statements on Northern Ireland, principally because, to date, I believed that those who lived closer to the problem were perhaps best equipped to speak on the peace process.  However, it is now time for those of us who live and work deep down in the south of Ireland to make our views known and make suggestions as to how peace can be maintained in the whole island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I welcome the peace process and in doing so I thank the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and all of the officials and officers who have undertaken so much work behind the scenes to bring together this process.  Little did we believe a year ago that there would be such a long period of peace already and so many weeks without any person being violently killed in Northern Ireland as a result of their political or religious views.  The question to be asked is: how can this continue and how do we ensure that it continues, not simply for six weeks, six months, six years but for six generations? This is what must be achieved and now is the time for much reflection on how best we may order our society so that we can live together in harmony on this island.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made the point that we should use a number of models to examine how we can live together on this island.  This is an important point and cannot be overemphasised.  Senator O'Toole said it is through ordinary, run of the mill interchanges between the varying communities on this island that peace and co-operation will succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much in favour of the idea of formal linkages between local authorities, north and south.  It is by bringing people together &mdash; people who have more in common together than apart &mdash; that we begin to see we can have a common destiny.  Unless we talk to one <Col N="404" /> another we will not know what each other thinks.  In many ways, people in the South often have romantic ideas of what they would like Ireland to be. After a few drinks at night one often hears &ldquo;A Nation Once Again&rdquo; belted out, without any real thought as to exactly what type of nation we want.  We must overcome generations of suspicion.</P>
    <P>Suspicion is not exclusive to the northern unionist community as regards what is being done in the South.  Some in the northern nationalist community are also suspicious about what we are trying to do.  They feel we have let them down over the years by not attempting a peace process earlier.  They feel we have left them to their own devices.  We are often partitionist in our thinking. We have decided mentally that there is a partition between the two parts of the island.  One remembers the reception Deputy Austin Currie received when he stood as a presidential candidate in the South.  Remarks such as &ldquo;Why does he not go back to his own country&rdquo; were made, which automatically meant that many people who would otherwise consider themselves nationalist mentally thought of the Six Counties as a different place.  Northern nationalists fear that we have sold them out and that we are not as much on their side as we pretend to be.  We need to have a great deal of common sense.  We must open dialogue with groups from all sides and bring out what we have in common rather than what is different.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a <Col N="405" /> Chathaoirligh, for your welcome.  As always, I am glad to have the opportunity to address the Seanad.  I regret that I was not here to open the debate, as was the original intention.  However, people understand in the context of meetings which took place yesterday and today in relation to the setting up of the forum &mdash; I will respond to some remarks that were made in that regard &mdash; that it was unavoidable.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to address the Seanad on Northern Ireland.  The Seanad is to be congratulated for arranging an exchange of views in relation to developments there.  It offers a valuable opportunity to review the momentous developments which have transformed the situation on our island and to consider the path ahead. On behalf of the Government, I am happy to be able to contribute to this series of statements.</P>
      <P>I last spoke to the Seanad in July on Northern Ireland.  It was in the aftermath of the Loughinisland massacre, an event which profoundly shocked the people of the entire island.  There have been so many occasions like that over the past 25 years when, in the face of appalling paramilitary violence, it was difficult to sustain the hope of a better future.  Yet today we have reached a stage where the outlines of that better future have become dramatically clearer. The ending of violence by both the IRA and loyalist paramilitary organisations has utterly transformed the future prospects of the people of this island.  It has brought palpably nearer the day on which we may finally achieve a lasting political accommodation of our differences.  It has opened up a space for exclusively political action and negotiation and the resolution of conflict by peaceful persuasion rather than coercion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity we now have to build a new political order is truly unprecedented.  We have been given a precious opening to forge a political consensus among the Irish people, North and South, in an atmosphere entirely free of the torment of violence. <Col N="406" /> This moment must be seized by all concerned. This historic challenge is one which none of us, North or South, unionist or nationalist, can afford to shirk.  Now is the time to draw a line forever under the savagery which has been suffered by both communities over the past 25 years and to start afresh in the search for a real and lasting political settlement.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of Irish people of both traditions are, and always have been, resolutely and absolutely opposed to the use of violence for political ends. I always believed that the sheer illogicality, let alone absolute immorality, of seeking to persuade through terror would eventually be recognised, even by its practitioners.  Moreover, all responsible political leaders on the island have known and argued that there was an alternative to the spiral of violence: dialogue and discussion in an atmosphere of mutual respect.</P>
    <P>When this Government took office in 1993 we committed ourselves to searching for an end to the conflict.  We undertook to work towards an accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland, pledging that we would seek, through political dialogue and in an open and innovative spirit, to address comprehensively all of the issues involved.  We immediately began to discuss with the British Government how the conditions for dialogue might best be established.  It was clear that the prospects for a political settlement would be immeasurably greater in an atmosphere of peace brought about by a total cessation of all paramilitary violence.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration agreed last December has a profound and lasting significance.  It defines clearly and unambiguously a set of principles which underpin and safeguard the fundamental rights and aspirations of both traditions. It is of permanent validity and it continues to be central to the approach of the two Governments.  In addition, however, it specifically threw down a challenge to republican and loyalist paramilitaries.  In the light of the <Col N="407" /> balanced and comprehensive statement of fundamental principles in the declaration, how could they claim the remotest shred of justification for their continued use of and support for paramilitary violence?  To republicans and to the rest of the nationalist community, it made clear that the British Government accepted that the future of Ireland was for the people living in Ireland freely to determine without external impediment.</P>
    <P>Equally, it made clear to loyalists and the rest of the unionist community that the Irish Government accepted that the democratic right of self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with, and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  It made clear to all in Northern Ireland that there would be a place in democratic politics and in fully comprehensive dialogue for all democratically mandated parties which established a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and showed that they abided by the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The twin cries of &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; on the one hand and &ldquo;sell out&rdquo; on the other became totally implausible as pretexts for continued campaigns of murder.  We badly need a climate of mutual forgiveness now.  It is right on all sides to seek to draw a line under the horrors of the past.  This is not, however, to diminish or forget the sufferings of the countless innocent victims of this conflict.  The most fitting memorial we can now construct for them is to ensure that peace is consolidated and made irreversible so that no one need ever again suffer what they have suffered.</P>
    <P>We believe that the peace which has now come is here for good.  The announcements by the IRA and the loyalist paramilitary leadership of their respective cessations of violence were couched in comprehensive and definitive terms.  With each passing day the solidity and durability of what has been achieved becomes steadily more apparent, <Col N="408" /> as has been acknowledged by a number of leaders of unionist opinion. Indeed, the fact of the loyalist cessation itself was clear confirmation of this interpretation of the IRA's intentions.</P>
    <P>I believe that a definitive consensus on this issue will soon be achieved and that it will be possible for the process of preliminary discussion between the British Government and Sinn Féin to commence.  This will mark an important step on the way to a fully inclusive dialogue involving the two Governments and all democratically mandated parties. Equally, with goodwill and creativity I am sure that ways can be devised to ensure that the important and distinctive voice of loyalism can make a positive contribution to this process.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, mindful of the continuing and wholly unjustifiable punishment beatings and shootings which continue to scar both communities in the North and I strongly urge that these cease immediately.  More generally, I would assure Senators that the Government, while confident that the use of violence for political purposes is indeed at an end, will continue to be vigilant and prudent in its approach.</P>
    <P>In the new situation in which we now find ourselves, it is essential that we and the British Government move quickly to make tangible and real the benefits of peace.  Our legislation and our security practices have both had to respond dramatically to the threat and the reality of violence.  We have had to introduce and maintain measures which would never otherwise have been necessary and which in normal times would not be needed.  Within the constraints of commonsense and prudence it is now imperative that with all reasonable speed redundant emergency laws be revised and where necessary reformed. Likewise, security force activity must be scaled down and transformed in character where this is feasible, as it certainly will be in many cases.</P>
    <P>Within Northern Ireland certain areas and communities have been particularly affected both by paramilitary violence and by the response to it.  They must see <Col N="409" /> that peace allows them to lead normal lives again and, in the case of the young, for the first time.  Some important changes have already taken place: a number of cross-Border roads have been re-opened and there have been some alterations in the forms and pattern of British Army and RUC operations.  Nevertheless, the momentum must be maintained and I will, through the Anglo-Irish Conference, be working to ensure that this is indeed the case.</P>
    <P>As is often said, however, peace means much more than the absence of war or of the signs of war.  The violence which disfigured our island and caused such death and destruction did not arise from nothing.  It could never be tackled simply or primarily as a security problem. As successive Irish Governments have recognised the violence which has been endemic in our history and in the history of the relations of the two islands has deep roots.  The fundamental issues are, and always have been, political and constitutional in the broadest sense.  Violence has been symptomatic of a deeper unresolved conflict which in this century has come to be concentrated and expressed on the narrow ground of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Not for one second do I suggest that the violence of the recent past is other than a perverted and evil response to the existence of that conflict.  In seeking to construct a future for our children and their children in which political violence will never be experienced we must fully acknowledge the reality of that conflict.  That in turn means finding an honourable and fair accommodation between the two traditions in which neither is victor nor vanquished, now or in the future, and in which the identities and aspirations of both are given equal weight and expression.</P>
    <P>The way to that accommodation is through patient dialogue and negotiation. This will be a slow and laborious process, but as the northern poet, John Montague, once asked:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> Who today asks for more</P>
    <P>&mdash;Smoke of battle blown aside&mdash;</P>
    <P>Than the struggle with casual</P>
    <P>Graceless unheroic things?</P>
    <P>As an important first step, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will shortly be commencing its deliberations. The Government sees it as a significant consultative body in which the participants can explore ways to advance peace and reconciliation and to overcome the barriers which divide us as a people.  We hope and expect that the forum's discussions and the recommendations it may make will make a distinct and positive contribution to the climate in which wider political negotiations will take place in the future.</P>
    <P>I regret that the unionist parties have not, for now, accepted our invitation to attend.  Participation in the forum will be entirely without prejudice to the position on constitutional matters held by any party.  Nevertheless, we will make every effort to ensure that the forum will benefit from the broadest possible range of experience and opinion, including from the unionist community.  Some members have raised the question of the participation in the forum and I hope that the problems which have emerged in relation to the Alliance Party will be resolved.  I see no great difficulty in having them resolved. It is regrettable that they have arisen in open debate.  The Government set out what it thought was a reasonable representation for all the parties involved and weighed heavily in favour of the parties participating from Northern Ireland.  I hope we will have the matter resolved in the course of our meetings with the party leaders and in the meeting with the Alliance Party tomorrow.  It can be resolved and, hopefully, will be.</P>
    <P>The Government, the Taoiseach and I, and our respective Departments, have put a lot of time and effort into the preparations for the forum and I hope that in a short period of time we will have agreement from all the parties.  We have never set out to dictate to the parties in relation to representation, the <Col N="411" /> terms of reference or the way the forum will do its business.  We have set out to consult and by a process of consensus to arrive at the best working arrangements for the forum.  I am confident that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will play a major role, just as the New Ireland Forum was an important part in developing relations on this island, with regard to finding a solution to the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish essayist, Hubert Butler, once commented that while opposites often attract, the attraction quickly wanes unless the full extent of the opposition is acknowledged.  We have frankly to name and to express our fears, hopes and beliefs and to accept the reality of the fears, hopes and beliefs of others if dialogue is to be firmly grounded.  The forum will play a key role in advancing this process.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we are continuing to work intensively with the British Government on a framework document which we would put to the Northern parties for discussion as the two Governments' shared assessment of how a comprehensive and lasting political settlement might be achieved.  It is my hope and intention that this work will be finished very soon.  As we have made clear, the Joint Declaration will not be a blueprint to be imposed on the parties on a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; basis. Nevertheless, we expect that as the joint view of the two sovereign Governments it will carry substantial weight with them, as it obviously must with the Governments themselves.</P>
    <P>Upon its completion we and the British Government will intensify our efforts to bring about the early initiation of talks involving all the parties.  As was agreed in 1991, talks must be comprehensive, addressing all the key relationships, with no matter being excluded from consideration.  The Governments are determined that the talks should be brought to a successful conclusion.  The British Government has in the Joint Declaration described its role as that of encouraging, facilitating and enabling <Col N="412" /> the achievement of agreement among the people of Ireland.  For our part, we in the Irish Government have a particular responsibility to convince all the people of our island, unionist and nationalist, that such agreement is possible.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has promised that in the event of an overall settlement it will, as part of a balanced constitutional accommodation, put forward and support proposals for change in our Constitution which would fully reflect the principle of consent in Northern Ireland.  In advance of that, let me repeat once again that for us the principle of majority consent to a change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland is inviolable.  Moreover, that is clearly the will of a majority of the Irish people.  We will never try to obscure or fudge that principle.  Anybody who doubts our sincerity or resolve in this matter is quite simply wrong.</P>
    <P>Likewise, we guarantee to the members of the unionist tradition that in all circumstances their rights, aspirations and identities would be fully respected and allowed full expression.  I confirm that we seek no more for nationalists within Northern Ireland than we would wish unionists to enjoy if the situation were reversed.</P>
    <P>It is essential, however, that all of us approach talks seriously and ambitiously in a spirit of openness and generosity.  The tempest of violence may have abated.  It would, nevertheless, be profoundly wrong to believe that a policy of drift is now a serious option or that it would be in the long term interests of anyone in Northern Ireland. The <i>status quo</i> has been demonstrated to be deeply unstable.  Tinkering at the edges will not eliminate that instability, which derives from a friction of identities and aspirations which must honestly be accepted and not denied or wished away.  Only a comprehensive settlement which adequately acknowledges and accommodates the duality which lies at the heart of Northern Ireland, and of Ireland as a whole, can work.  This means, in effect, that the nationalist <Col N="413" /> community in Northern Ireland must actively agree to whatever arrangements are to be put in place.  Within Northern Ireland nationalists must enjoy equality of treatment and opportunity. The institutions of the State, including the police, must reflect and express the reality of diversity.  There must be parity of esteem for the nationalist identity and their aspiration to a united Ireland must be respected and catered for.  There must also be North-South institutions which serve to reflect the nationalist identity while at the same time allowing all the people of Ireland to work together in all areas of common interest for the common good. It is indeed agreed on all sides that, irrespective of all political considerations, there are substantial practical benefits to be had from such co-operation in terms of growth of the economy of the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>In short, as Seamus Mallon recently put it, acceptance that there must be consent to a change in the status of Northern Ireland does not mean that nationalists consent to the <i>status quo.</i> An impressive element of the statement announcing the loyalist ceasefire was its firm resolution &ldquo;to respect our differing views of freedom, culture and aspiration&rdquo;. It is important that the wider unionist community also acknowledges the implications of that difference.</P>
    <P>Not to grasp this opportunity to build a lasting political settlement, which would be the most cast-iron possible guarantee of a permanent peace, would be unforgivable.  There could be no better memorial to all who have died nor any better basis on which to build a new Ireland for the living.</P>
    <P>While the costs of the last 25 years have been above all human, they have also been vast in financial and economic terms.  Energies and resources which could have been much better used in advancing the prosperity of all our people have been diverted and wasted. We now stand at the beginning of a new era.  I am convinced that the economic benefits of peace will be immense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> It is true that there will be some short term dislocation within Northern Ireland as a full peace-time economy emerges.  Nevertheless, consideration of the experiences of the two parts of the island since 1969 suggests that there is now immense scope for the North to make rapid progress, particularly in developing its tourism industry and attracting inward investment.  Furthermore, the psychological liberation represented by an end to the troubles should also have a major impact.  Confidence is a key ingredient in successful economic development.  History suggests that the indigenous private sector within Northern Ireland should have the potential to resume a much larger and more dynamic role.</P>
    <P>In the process of economic reconstruction and development, both of the North and of our own Border areas, our friends abroad, especially in the United States and the European Union, have a major part to play.  Their help and support have been invaluable throughout the entire peace process.  I am in close contact with the US Congress and Administration and with the institutions of the EU as they work on proposals for further assistance to underpin the achievement of peace and reconciliation and the Government is making a detailed input into that process.</P>
    <P>A fundamental objective must be the reduction of unemployment through the creation of useful and productive new jobs.  Unemployment in both parts of our island is our greatest single social and economic problem.  Both North and South are particularly affected by long term unemployment.  Within Northern Ireland, while both communities suffer from unemployment, the situation is particularly acute for Catholics, above all Catholic males, whose unemployment rate remains more than twice as high as that of their Protestant counterparts. Deprivation and inequality have been intimately linked to the political instability of Northern Ireland and they must be tackled as a matter of the highest priority.  While fair employment legislation has contributed to an <Col N="415" /> improvement in certain aspects of the situation of Catholics in Northern Ireland, it is vital that the British Government explore all possible ways to bring about fair participation in employment and be active and innovative in seeking to reduce the unemployment gap.</P>
    <P>Our shared experience of unemployment is one of the many similarities between the two economies on the island.  These point to the need for a concerted effort, underpinned by new cross border and North-South structures, to develop co-ordinated and integrated policies and programmes which would enable us fully to maximise our limited resources and to take full advantage of the possibilities opened up by the continuing evolution of the European Union.  There is considerable scope for joint action both in relation to overseas opportunities and to the development of trade and economic co-operation between North and South.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to refer briefly to the experience I had last night in the Abbey Theatre where I attended the Frank McGuinness play.  Frank McGuinness described the unrealised potential which has beset generations of Irish people from both communities on this island.  Kenneth Piper, one of the characters in <i>Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme</i> reflects on his efforts as a young man to escape the cycle of violence and hatred:</P>
    <P>I could not create for when I saw my hands working they were not mine but the hands of my ancestors interfering and I could not be rid of that interference.  I could not create.</P>
    <P>Last night in the Abbey there was real optimism that we have begun to leave behind the legacy of bitterness that has disabled us for so long.</P>
    <P>The coming of peace opens up new vistas for the people of Ireland.  It opens up the prospect that at last we might realise our potential, both social and economic.  We must now work together to forge a political agreement which will <Col N="416" /> represent an honourable compromise to which all can assent.  In this spirit of partnership we can move to heal our divisions and, at last, create harmony and prosperity on this island.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the House for being 17 minutes behind time in dealing with this Bill.  However, the House agreed to this procedure.</P>
      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82 it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  Members may speak only once on the question.  I call the Minister.</P>

      <P>This Bill was introduced in the Seanad in 1988.  It was left in abeyance until the staff of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards worked out an agreement under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. Earlier this year an agreement was reached which satisfied all concerned. <Col N="417" /> The Bill has since been passed by the Dáil and it is before the Seanad with some minor and purely technical amendments.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the dissolution of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards, for the sales of their ancillary business and for the establishment of a new National Milk Agency.  It was necessary to make a number of minor and technical amendments to the text of the Bill as passed by Seanad Éireann on 5 July last.  The amendments to the text of the Bill were as follows.</P>
      <P>In section 1 (1) the definition of &ldquo;heat-treated milk&rdquo; was amended by the deletion of the word &ldquo;substances&rdquo; in line 35 and the substitution of the words &ldquo;food ingredients&rdquo;; and in line 36 by the deletion of the word &ldquo;substances&rdquo; and the substitution of the word &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo;. These amendments were necessary because the words &ldquo;other substances&rdquo; and &ldquo;substances&rdquo;, respectively, render the definition too wide and therefore inappropriate in the definition of a product intended for human consumption.</P>
      <P>In section 1 (1) the definition of producer was amended by deleting the words &ldquo;an establishment&rdquo; and substituting the words &ldquo;a holding&rdquo;.  The amendment was necessary because &ldquo;an establishment&rdquo; is more appropriate to a processing establishment or other industrial premises whereas it is intended to refer to a dairy farm.</P>
      <P>In section 2 (2) the words &ldquo;or elected&rdquo; were inserted after the word &ldquo;appointed&rdquo;.  This is a simple technical amendment.  The Bill provides that all members of the agency will at the start be appointed by the Minister but within the first year an election will be organised so registered producers can elect representatives from among themselves. Thus the agency will soon have both elected and appointed members and section 2 must reflect this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At section 5 (1) the words &ldquo;or supplied&rdquo; were inserted after the word &ldquo;sold&rdquo; and at section 5 (4) the word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; was inserted after the word &ldquo;sells&rdquo;.  These amendments were necessary <Col N="418" /> to ensure milk delivered from one part to another on a sale or return basis comes within the provisions of this section.  Furthermore, in the event of legal proceedings being brought under this section, it will not be necessary to prove a sale was completed; it will be sufficient to demonstrate a change in possession of the milk involved.</P>
    <P>In section 5 (5) the words &ldquo;in respect of each day of such contravention&rdquo; were inserted after &ldquo;£200&rdquo;.  This is a technical amendment to make it absolutely clear that a person guilty of contravening the provisions of this section will be liable to a fine of £200 for each day the contravention continues.</P>
    <P>In section 5 (6) the words &ldquo;two months&rdquo; were deleted and replaced by &ldquo;on a date laid down by order of the Minister&rdquo;.  The amendment was necessary because two months may not allow for adequate time for the work which will have to be undertaken by the agency before the provisions of this section can be brought into full effect. The amended wording allows for the section to be brought into effect whenever the agency signifies it is ready to commence operations, be that a longer or shorter period than two months after its establishment.</P>
    <P>In section 8 (2) (a) the following was inserted:</P>
    <P>(ii) the total quantity of milk acquired for the production of milk for liquid consumption, and [.]</P>
    <P>This amendment increases the amount of information which processors will be required to furnish to the agency.  The agency will therefore have to be made aware of the quantity of milk obtained by a processor under an exemption licence granted by the Minister.  This will greatly facilitate the agency in determining whether processors' acquisitions of raw milk balance with their sales of heat-treated milk and whether they are paying the correct amount of levy.</P>
    <P>In section 8 (7) the following was inserted after &ldquo;register&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> of producers or processors as the case may be and the registration of any and all contracts to which that person is a party [.]</P>
    <P>The amendment ensures there is no ambiguity in that once a registered person loses his registration with the agency, any registered contracts to which he is a party become null and void in the eyes of the agency.</P>
    <P>In section 10 (3) the following subparagraph was inserted:</P>
    <P>(d) prevents the inspector from taking copies of records or documents or extracts therefrom in accordance with subsection (2) (b), or [.]</P>
    <P>The amendment protects the inspector's authority by making any person who impeded an inspector in the exercise of his powers under subsection (2)(b) guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>In section 12 (2) the phrase &ldquo;at registered premises&rdquo; was deleted and replaced with &ldquo;by a registered person&rdquo;. The amendment was necessary to improve the clarity of the text since the Bill provides for the registration of persons, whether natural or legal, rather than on premises.</P>
    <P>In section 13 (3) (f) the word &ldquo;Directive&rdquo; was deleted and the words &ldquo;Directive, or&rdquo; were substituted; and the following subparagraph was inserted:</P>
    <P>(g) in the case of a registered producer, that producer fails to supply the quantities of milk specified in a registered contract as being due for supply during the winter months.</P>
    <P>These amendments enable the agency to take effective action against a producer who may attempt to exploit the situation created by the operations of the agency by supplying only in the summer months when production costs are low while ceasing to supply in the winter, so undermining the objective of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In section 13 (4) (a) the word &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; was inserted after &ldquo;liquidator&rdquo;. This was a simple technical <Col N="420" /> amendment which corrects an omission. In setting down the possible parties which might be in charge of a business and on which the agency would be obliged to serve notice of its intention to alter or cancel registration, reference to a receiver was accidentally omitted.</P>
    <P>After section 13 (8) the following subsection was inserted:</P>
    <P>(9) A producer whose registration is cancelled in pursuance of subsection (3) (g) shall not be eligible for re-registration by the agency for a period of at least two years from the date of such cancellation.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides for a penalty of two years prohibition on renewing the registration of any producer whose registration is cancelled by the agency for failing to supply the contractual quantity of milk during the winter months.</P>
    <P>A new section was inserted before section 21 entitled &ldquo;Prosecution of Offences&rdquo;, which reads:</P>
    <P>21.&mdash;Offences under sections 5, 8, 9, 10 and 15 shall be brought and prosecuted by the Agency.</P>
    <P>The amendment facilitates the more effective implementation of the legislation by bestowing on the agency itself the power to prosecute offences.  In the absence of this provision, the duty of taking proceedings for offences would fall on the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The following amendments were made to the Schedule to the Bill.  First, at paragraph 1 (4) the word &ldquo;absence&rdquo; was inserted after the word &ldquo;through&rdquo;. This amendment widens the circumstances in which the Minister may appoint an acting chairman in order to facilitate the conduct of agency business. Second, after the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;and references to the Chairman in the subsequent provisions of this Schedule shall include the person so acting&rdquo; was inserted.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure the acting chairman will be empowered to carry out the duties otherwise carried out by <Col N="421" /> the chairman if the chairman was not absent.</P>
    <P>I trust I have given a clear report of the amendments to the Bill passed by Dáil Éireann and I commend them to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, but I endorse the sentiments of the Leader of the Opposition who this morning deplored the manner in which this Bill came before the House.  We were not aware it was to be presented until yesterday.  That is too short a notice, but we on this side of the House do not object to the Bill being taken and will not hold up approval of the amendments made in the Dáil.  Conscious of what you have said, a Chathaoirligh, I will confine my comments to those amendments.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking he noted the Bill first came before the House in 1988.  I can verify that it was here in 1989 and it is time it was brought to fruition because there is a need for it.</P>
      <P>There was probably a good reason for setting up the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards, but they have outlived their usefulness and it is time to amend the regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly pointed out most of the amendments were technical, such as changing the word &ldquo;substances&rdquo; to &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo;, changing &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; to &ldquo;holding&rdquo;, or adding &ldquo;supplied&rdquo; to &ldquo;sold&rdquo;.  Those amendments make sense and strengthen the Bill. Many of them strengthen the hand of the agency.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned about two points.  First, in section 5 (6) it is proposed to delete &ldquo;two months&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;on a date laid down by order of the Minister&rdquo;.  There is probably a good reason for doing that. However, although this legislation is regarded as important, there is nothing to ensure the Minister will make an order in a reasonable period.  The matter could be let lie for a year because the time is not specified.  It does not say when the regulations will come into being; it is left to the Minister to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> If we believe that this legislation is important, we should be given a date.  I understand why two months may be too short, but I ask the Minister to consider amending this to include &ldquo;not later than six months&rdquo;.  It is important that these amendments be made and that the Minister should not be left with an option, which is the situation at present.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about amendment No. 14 which proposes to insert a new subsection (g) in section 13.  This proposed new subsection is as follows:</P>
    <P>(g) in the case of a registered producer, that producer fails to supply the quantities of milk specified in a registered contract as being due for supply during the winter months.</P>
    <P>There could be a situation where a producer would not be able to meet the contract requirements due, maybe, to his herd having TB or some other act outside his control.  It would be a tragedy and not in the spirit of the Bill if such a producer were penalised because he failed to supply in those circumstances. The proposed new subsection is dangerous unless there is an addendum to protect producers who, through no fault of their own, may not be able to honour their contracts, say, because of a disease outbreak and there may also be other reasons.  I know a farmer who, in the not too distant past, had to sell his dairy herd because of pressure from financial institutions.  It would be a great pity if somebody was to loose his contract because of this type of situation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider both sections to which I referred.  I accept that the rest of the amendments are technical and strengthen the legislation, either by making it more meaningful or ensuring more clarity in its sections. However, I am concerned about the two amendments about which I spoke and the implications of the latter on producers. There is no time limit for the making of orders, this is left open to the Minister.  I believe there should be a time limit for the introduction of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I apologise to the Minister for the fact we started this debate later than ordered but I am sure he understands the reasons and is prepared to accept them.  We may say with a fair degree of accuracy that the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas has been leisurely &mdash; and this is being charitable &mdash; but I understand the reasons.  The fears of the staff have been dealt with and allayed.</P>
      <P>Curiously, my reservations are in accord with Senator Naughten's and I can assure the House I had no consultation with him prior to the Bill coming back to us.  I am trying to recall the Bill as originally drafted.  In respect of section 5 (6) and the two month period, when the original Bill was presented to us, did it refer to two months or was this period the result of an amendment to the Bill as it passed through the Houses?  I agree that there should be a defined time limit.  I am in favour of taking discretion away from the Minister, particularly in a case like this.  We could find ourselves in a situation where the Minister might adopt an even more leisurely approach to the date of the order than to the passage of the Bill through the Houses.  This is conceivable because he is entitled to do this under the legislation. This is highly undesirable.  It is totally within the bounds of reason that there should be a defined timescale.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Senator Naughten about giving discretion to people who, through no fault of their own, might not be able to supply winter milk.  I await the Minister's reply on this.  I am more concerned about section 5 (6).  I do not understand why such discretion is given or, if there was a difficulty about the timescale, it could not have been extended, but there should have been a timescale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken a long time to get this Bill through both Houses.  It was introduced here because of the difficulties of the Dublin Milk Board.  It was very necessary because the supply of milk for liquid consumption had to <Col N="424" /> be regularised.  The Minister said that amendment No. 9&mdash;</P>
      <P>....increases the amount of information which processors will be required to furnish to the agency.  The agency will, therefore, have to be made aware of the quantity of milk obtained by a processor other than under a registered contract; e.g. milk lawfully imported into the State....</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I mentioned that there would be a danger of this if milk producers, especially of liquid milk, were not adequately paid for supplying winter milk.  It is hard work supplying milk in the winter; I know this from experience. There must be good compensation for producers who supply milk in the winter in addition to that supplied in the summer.  Those who supply milk in the winter and fulfil their obligatory requirements need the support of the Department.  With the increase in urban populations there is more demand for liquid milk.  In rural areas people buy pasteurised liquid milk, and this also adds to the demand.  Producers should be adequately compensated.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Naughten's view on amendment No. 16.  The Minister stated that:</P>
      <P>The amendment provides for a penalty of two years prohibition on renewing the registration of any producer whose registration is cancelled by the agency for failing to supply the contractual quantity of milk during the winter months.</P>
      <P>The Minister must take account of disease; I am sure he is well aware of them. Senator Naughten mentioned difficulties with banks.  There will have to be leniency and goodwill on the part of the agency to ensure that the people who are genuinely prepared to supply the contractual quantity of milk during the winter months but are unable to do so through no fault of their own, are not to be barred for two years.  If they can supply the following year their contracts should be renewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed.  This measure has been before the Seanad for a considerable time.  It was introduced here and went to the Dáil.  Satisfactory arrangements were made on which there was agreement between the existing staff and management.  This agreement was drawn up under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been returned to the Seanad because of a few technical amendments.  I refer to those alluded to by Senator Naughten and Senator Dardis.  The period mentioned in section 5 could be less than two months. I wish it could be less than two months because it has been progressing at a pedestrian pace until now and I would like to see it rationalised and the new agency put into effect as soon as possible. I will make every effort to have the work done as soon as possible.  If there was a six month period, perhaps the agency could feel it had more time than was necessary.  I believe it could be less than the two months suggested.  The period of time relates only to the time given to the agency for setting up the arrangements under section 5 and it does not relate to the setting up of the agency.  Once we are finished with this measure in this House, we can move immediately to establish the agency. Some considerable preparatory work has been done already in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the case of a registered producer failing to supply the quantity of milk specified in the registered contract as being due for supply during the winter months, this is to take account of a supplier who enters into a contract to supply a dairy or a milk processor for the production of milk all year round, as Senator R. Kiely said.  Committing oneself to producing winter milk and milk all year round is quite an undertaking because one is talking about 365 days of the year and about producing quite expensive milk in the wintertime <Col N="426" /> when one must feed concentrates.  It is easier to opt for manufacturing milk from grass because one could take a break in the wintertime under those arrangements.  However, one must keep one's nose to the grindstone as regards winter milk arrangements because one must milk the cows twice a day.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited a dairy show and from what I saw the situation is not too bad in the dairy industry.  In fact, I had to take cover from the champagne which was flowing there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was excellent champagne; it was a pity so much was wasted.</P>
      <P>Where an individual supplier cannot meet his or her obligations through circumstances outside his or her control, there is provision for an appeal under section 13 (4).  If, in the circumstances mentioned by the Senators, or as a result of disease breakdown or family distress over a short period of time, the producer cannot meet their commitments for one reason or another, drastic action should not be taken against them.  On the other hand, a supplier could decide to avail of summer milk production, when they should be supplying it all year round.  However, the purpose of the Bill is to ensure there will be an adequate supply of milk to urban areas all year round.  The wintertime is a more acute time and, as Senator R. Kiely said, there is more demand now for heat treated and pasteurised milk in the interests of disease control.  It is essential and in everyone's interest to adhere to the all year round contract.  In the circumstances mentioned by the Senators, and I understand their concerns, I expect that such appeal under section 13 (4) would be upheld and registration would not be cancelled in those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their co-operation and I assure them that once <Col N="427" /> the Bill passes this House, the implementation and establishment of the agency and the consequential developments will take place as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this report.  I am particularly looking forward to hearing the views expressed by the Senators on the contents of the report and the subject itself &mdash; long term unemployment.  I am especially pleased to see two members of the forum, Senator Henry and Senator O'Sullivan, here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, a word about the forum itself, on which I am the Government's representative. The National Economic and Social Forum is different because, for the first time, representatives of the unemployed were invited to sit around the same table as the so-called &ldquo;social partners&rdquo;, employers, trade unions and farmers who have traditionally been part of the concept of the social partnership. It is also different in that what is known as the &ldquo;third strand&rdquo; has actively set out to represent the views of those normally excluded &mdash; the disabled, travellers and women, and they are members of the forum.  It is different because Members of the Oireachtas join with the traditional social partners and <Col N="428" /> the third strand.  This report represents a consensus of their views.</P>
    <P>The forum's highest priority is to examine the problem of unemployment in Ireland and in that context, the delivery of its fourth report, &ldquo;Ending Long-Term Unemployment&rdquo;, was particularly welcomed by the Government.  At the time of its publication, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, said the report would not be left on the shelf, and it has not been.  A high level group made up of senior civil servants and people involved in local community development have already been meeting to examine ways in which the report's recommendations can be best implemented.  As the report says, it deals with the nuts and bolts and puts flesh on the bones of the forum's recommendations.  In particular, the report's recommendation to establish a locally based employment service is being explored.</P>
    <P>This high level group has been charged with producing a report by the end of November and that is witness to the Government's commitment to ensuring that the views of the members of the forum are taken on board and that the forum itself is taken seriously.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment is a major problem in Ireland &mdash; I do not need to tell Members that; the figures speak for themselves.  Out of 135,000 people who have been out of work for more than a year, 65,000 of these have not worked in the past three years.  That represents 10 per cent of our labour force.</P>
    <P>Ireland has the highest rate of long term unemployment in the OECD.  To put it in stark perspective, our long term unemployment rate is greater that the total unemployment rate in most OECD countries.  On the other hand, short term unemployment in Ireland is almost the same as other OECD countries, suggesting that we have normal turnover and job replacement rates. Some 30,000 jobs change hands in Ireland every month, but studies have shown, and we also know from experience, that the long term unemployed are not considered for vacancies that arise.  If one is out of work for more <Col N="429" /> than a year, one has a much greater chance of remaining out of work.  The figures show that those who have been out of work for more than a year have an 80 per cent chance of being unemployed at the end of the following year.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment affects men more than women but the rate is increasing faster among women, reflecting the increasing number of women re-entering &mdash; or not leaving &mdash; the labour market in recent years.  Of course, the figures for women do not give the full picture as many are not registered as unemployed.  Indeed, a majority of the 44,000 lone parents, 70,000 dependent adults and many of the 28,000 on disabled persons maintenance allowance are women and as the forum's report notes, many of these women are effectively unemployed.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment has hit hardest in local authority areas.  Indeed, 80 per cent of tenants in local authority housing in the greater Dublin area &mdash; the picture is similar around the country &mdash; are families where there is no income from employment.  Almost two-thirds of long term unemployed are heads of their households.  There is also a close relationship between employment rates for husbands and wives where one partner is unemployed.  If one partner is out of a job, the chances are that the other partner will also be unemployed.  These are harsh facts and stark statistics, but behind each one is a story of an individual, a family or a community effectively excluded from playing their full part in life.</P>
    <P>There is the individual cost of long term unemployment but there is also the price we all pay.  Unemployment is the single most important cause of poverty in Ireland today.  The cost of unemployment to the State in 1993 was £2.16 billion, or 7 per cent of our total GDP. These figures do not even begin to take account of the indirect costs which include higher usage of health services, greater psychological distress and higher crime levels among the unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> We as a Government and we here as Members of the Oireachtas have a responsibility to those left outside by unemployment, poverty and disadvantage. We have a responsibility to communities in urban and rural Ireland which have been blighted by unemployment and poverty.  In particular at a time when the economy is doing well, we have an increased responsibility to ensure that those left outside, now get a chance to share in economic prosperity. We can only achieve this by active intervention. It is now widely accepted that the rising tide &mdash; and indeed the tide is rising at the moment &mdash; does not lift all boats, that economic prosperity does not reach those who need it most.</P>
    <P>It must also be accepted that we have not been doing enough to tackle long term unemployment, or at least that our strategies have not been the best ones. There is no shame in re-examining our approaches, in looking for new solutions, better ways of tackling what often seems an intractable problem.</P>
    <P>The forum has come up with more ideas and the high-level group I talked of earlier is looking at them, in particular the notion of an employment service. The forum has suggested, and I agree with them, that the most important policy objective must be to provide employment opportunities for every citizen who wants to work.</P>
    <P>The ending of long term unemployment is the ambitious target suggested by the forum to counter the current air of defeatism.  They point out that in the early 1980s the public finances appeared to be in a hopeless state.  Since then we have taken firm policy decisions based on social consensus which have led to a dramatic turnaround.  If, similarly, we put the issue of long term unemployment at the top, we can begin to use our human and financial resources to tackle this problem, which is one that can be solved.</P>
    <P>In arriving at its optimistic target the report identifies the key to the problem. This key involves preventing more people becoming long term unemployed while helping those currently long term <Col N="431" /> unemployed to escape the trap.  In doing this they believe that long term unemployment could be reduced to 20,000 by the end of the century.</P>
    <P>The forum specified a number of approaches.  Firstly, we know that today's early school leavers tend to be tomorrow's long term unemployed. Obviously, that is one important intervention. Secondly, we need macroeconomic and structural policies that provide more jobs in the economy.  That is happening. This year we have seen a reduction in the live register of over 14,000.  The economic forecasts to the end of the century are very good.  Our task is to ensure that the long term unemployed get a fair share of those jobs that are becoming available and of the jobs &mdash; some 30,000 a month &mdash; that become available through normal job turnover.  The third issue highlighted by the forum's report is the prevention of long term unemployment, and the fourth is reintegration of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The forum's main recommendations are early intervention strategy in the education sector, and that is already happening.  Resources, freed up by the falling birth rate, are being retargeted at schools in disadvantaged areas whose pupils are most likely to lose out unless we intervene.  The report recommends an employment service targeted at what needs to be done to build up the skills and confidence of people who are unemployed as well as what we need to do in talking to employers to get them to take on the long term unemployed.  It recommends separate purchase and delivery of training, education and employment options and the linkage of training to jobs.  It also recommends provision of temporary job placements in certain circumstances as well as revamping community employment and increasing the demand for labour of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The forum proposed that &ldquo;a national, comprehensive, locally based employment service should be put in place&rdquo;. Available to all employed, unemployed <Col N="432" /> and lone parents, it would tackle both prevention and reintegration issues.  It would act as a gateway to all employment and training programmes and establish links with local employers as well as mediating on behalf of clients.  It would be based on a ratio of one mediator to every 125 unemployed persons. Registration, as envisaged by the forum's report, would be voluntary.</P>
    <P>In our experience of the area-based partnerships we have seen how crucial the support and commitment of local employers is to the success of locally based employment services.  They must be involved and committed at both local and national level in the design and administration of the service.  The involvement of trade unions is also indispensable.</P>
    <P>The service has to be delivered at local level so that we can start with the needs of unemployed people themselves and match those to what jobs are available. We need to look not at what skills the unemployed lack but also at the skills that they have.  We need to look at traditional job descriptions and see what the components are that make up those job descriptions and build on the potential that our long term unemployed have.  That has to be done on an individual basis.  One of the things that is highlighted in the forum's report is how our conventional approaches are missing a majority of the long term unemployed. If we are serious about tackling the problem we must bring them into the picture.</P>
    <P>In the area partnership areas the forum anticipated that the service would be provided by the area-based partnership company or a unit thereof.  In other areas similar structures might be put in place.  For example, we have already seen in the Northside partnership the great success there has been in placing long term unemployed people through a partnership with local employers.  In building up the skills, confidence levels and giving the job experience, both sides see the pluses that are involved. Last year over 400 people who were long term unemployed were placed by, <Col N="433" /> for example, the Northside area partnership in Coolock.  There are other examples of that kind of locally based employment services working around the country.  The task of the high-level task force is to build on those experiences that are working well and to try to apply those lessons on a nationwide basis.</P>
    <P>The forum recommended that a group such as that which has been set up should look at the resources currently available in areas like FÁS and the job placement services of Social Welfare to build on what is there and what is working. The forum also recommended that the employment service should have the autonomy and resources to carry out its functions.</P>
    <P>The proposed employment service would give priority to those unemployed for six months or more.  The mediator and the client would meet and discuss an action plan to get the unemployed person back into employment. The thrust of the service, as envisaged by the forum, is moving the emphasis away from a service which is focused on the providers to one that is focused on the needs of the customer, the unemployed person themselves.</P>
    <P>For people unemployed for between six and 12 months this service would be obliged to offer an option which prevents that person becoming long term unemployed.  This is based on the belief that those who are unemployed for more than a year end up becoming long term unemployed and find it difficult to escape from the unemployment trap.  So if we stop the flow into long term unemployment, we can substantially solve this problem of long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>While the focus of the employment service would be to find jobs for the unemployed, other options, such as education, training and temporary employment experience, will also be required. Therefore it is essential, in the forum's view, that this service is in a position to offer an acceptable option to an unemployed person and that they must not be confined by the supply of places available <Col N="434" /> through FÁS and other agencies. The mediator, in consultation with the client, must be able to choose the best and most relevant option.  Such an option would require a reallocation of resources to the employment service. The central message of the forum's report is to put the unemployed person centre stage rather than the service deliverers.  The forum points to the success of the counselling route in various international studies and to its endorsements by the EU Commission White Paper and the OECD's job study.</P>
    <P>An employment service will be the key to the integrated operation of all aspects of active labour market policy, including an overall strategy to prevent long term unemployment.  This service shifts the focus of policy to a demand driven approach based on the needs of the unemployed rather than an approach driven by the supply of places on programmes.  The long term aim of this service would be to help to ensure progression across the various options. By working closely with employers it can break down resistance to employing the long term unemployed and it is cost effective.</P>
    <P>However, this is not the only strategy proposed by the forum.  The forum has already made recommendations last year about macroeconomic and structural policies to help create more sustainable employment and thereby reduce overall unemployment.  Many of these were implemented in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>As I have already said, the forum has drawn attention to the importance of applying the demographic dividend of falling schoolchild numbers to target those most at risk of early school leaving. Those children are more likely to enter the ranks of the long term unemployed than any other group in Irish society.</P>
    <P>Targeting such early interventions is essential.  There is no great gain for those most at risk if we merely reduce the pupil teacher ratio by one or two across the board.  It is far better to concentrate resources on children in disadvantaged <Col N="435" /> areas who have traditionally left school as soon as possible due to the lack of support in their environment, peer pressure and limited options and facilities.</P>
    <P>Overall, the forum's report contains an integrated package which addresses the main causes of this country's long term unemployment problem.  The proposals deal with both supply and demand side dimensions.  On the supply side, recommendations deal with the prevention of long term unemployment and the improvement of the skills and general employability of the long term unemployed.  It is also felt that direct advocacy with employers will improve access to the labour market for the long term unemployed.  As I said, we already have experience of that happening on the ground.  The forum's recommendation on the employment service is a key to this underlying approach for bringing the long term unemployed back into the labour market.  On the demand side, the forum's recommendations seek to directly provide jobs for the long term unemployed and indirectly increase private sector demand through ongoing reforms in taxation and PRSI systems.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the tremendous degree of hard work put into this report by Professor John O'Hagan, the members of the forum's employment and economic policy committee and the forum secretariat.  I also thank the Senators who are members of the forum.</P>
    <P>This report is, and will continue to provide the Government with, a very useful analysis of the problem of long term unemployment.  However, more than that, the report provides options, a set of possible solutions and a number of new ideas which are deserving of immediate and serious examination. That is being undertaken with the greatest of seriousness by our high level task force.  The outcome of the task force's preliminary report before the end of next month will be considered in the context of this Government's overall <Col N="436" /> strategy for integrated development and for putting long term unemployment at the top of the political agenda.  This strategy recognises the creation of sustainable jobs as our number one objective.</P>
    <P>Second, we need to develop the capacity, confidence and skills of local communities to ensure that the people who live in them can compete on a level playing pitch for available jobs.  We also recognise the need to facilitate and provide resources for the involvement of local communities in the development of their areas.  I made that a cornerstone of the national plan.</P>
    <P>Third, we must continue to ensure that those who for so long have been outside the consultative process now have an opportunity to have a real input into policy formulation.  We are listening to the voices of local communities and responding to them.  The forum itself is a concrete example of this policy in action.</P>
    <P>We have brought the unemployed, representatives of the disadvantaged, the traditional social partners and Members of the Oireachtas of all shades of political opinion to the table.  This report on long term unemployment represents that powerful consensus across Irish society on practical measures which we can take to tackle long term unemployment.  I look forward to seeing these recommendations put into practical effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, who is a member of the forum, to the House to discuss the forum's report.  I am pleased that the Seanad is discussing this very important report and that the Minister has spoken so positively in relation to a number of aspects where the Government has already taken and intends to take more positive action on the report's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said, this forum was established for a variety of reasons. In particular, the social and economic policy committee of the forum, of which I am member, when addressing which <Col N="437" /> issues to examine, decided that the issue of long term unemployment was one of the most serious problems in this country and one of the most important tasks to be faced by this or any future Government and that unless very direct and clear policy changes were made, this problem would not be resolved.</P>
    <P>The forum has made recommendations in its report, some of which may be considered quite ambitious and revolutionary, given the existing structures. However, it must be pointed out that unless very definite and decisive policy changes are made, this problem will not be resolved.  In examining this we recognised that in the early 1980s there was a very serious economic crisis in this country.  If it was not for very positive economic policies under the leadership of the then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, our economy would not at this stage be on a sound footing.  We felt that unless the public, the Government and all those who deal with the unemployed recognise that a drastic change has to occur in relation to policy, the issue cannot be tackled seriously.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is extremely concerned about this issue, has done a great deal of work in this area, has been closely examining this in her Department and is very committed to it.  I am pleased therefore that she is here to listen to the discussion.</P>
    <P>The central recommendation, as the Minister said, is the recommendation in relation to an employment service.  That is the one recommendation which the committee felt would cost more money than the others.  We were very aware in making our recommendations that the cost factor would be open to public analysis from all quarters.  We estimated that it would cost in the region of £30 million to put this service into place. However, as the report rightly states, we must recognise the huge cost of unemployment. We know that the direct cost of unemployment is about 7 per cent of our GDP.  But there are additional costs which we did not have the opportunity to examine, such as the cost to the health bill, education and other areas. <Col N="438" /> There are indirect costs which we were not in a position to examine but which we hope to examine in the future.  We recognised the enormity of the task of tackling that, so it was not done.  Given the indirect cost, in the overall budgetary context £30 million is not huge money.</P>
    <P>This report is very firmly founded on the examination of the situation at European and international level.  It has been clearly found that where an employment service has been put in place, there have been huge advantages for the long term unemployed. Preventing people from falling into the category of long term unemployed is the major ethos behind this proposal.  It is important that we recognise that and that prevention is better than cure in all areas.</P>
    <P>It has been shown that somebody who has been unemployed for over two years has a 74 per cent chance of being unemployed the following year.  Needless to say, one must recognise the terribly deflating effect which unemployment has on a person's temperament, ego and self confidence.  That has to be addressed, because we cannot afford not to avail of people's abilities, talents and resources.</P>
    <P>This report is very much geared towards individuals and their needs, abilities, talents and skills.  It is important that it is based on the person rather than the bureaucratic structure. That is a fundamental change.  In making this proposal we recognised the success of the counselling route.  This was supported by work done under the ERGO programme, which is referred to in detail in section 3 of the report.  It was also recommended by the EU Commission in its White Paper, which also recommended a substantial increase in public employment services.</P>
    <P>I know that there may be difficulties with this and I appreciate that when the Minister speaks with other Ministers, particularly the Minister for Finance, the cost comes down to pounds, shillings and pence.  However, there is much material in this report to support the <Col N="439" /> argument that this scheme should be put into place.  There was much discussion in the committee about how this would be put in place.  The first issue was registration for the scheme and I am delighted that the Minister of State raised this point.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether registration should be voluntary or compulsory generated debate and I believe the right approach has been taken.  Initially, it will be on a voluntary basis but if the number of people registering voluntarily is very low, the matter will be examined further.  That makes sense and I am delighted that the Minister recognised this.</P>
    <P>The scheme is based at local community level.  Each counsellor is to be attached to 125 unemployed people. That may be a rather high number but it is necessary to ascertain how successful the scheme will be and the level of co-operation it will receive.  Co-operation between the public and private sectors will be an important factor.  The public sector comprises the Government and local authorities and the private sector comprises employers who are in a position to employ people in a private capacity.</P>
    <P>The major problem which must be overcome is the inherent reluctance of employers to employ somebody who has been long term unemployed.  The counsellor will be able to make a great difference to the situation between the potential client and the employer.  This mediator should be able to address any prejudices which the employer has about employing a long term unemployed person.  This is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, put a pilot project in place in Tallaght recently.  I will not say that he ran ahead of the forum; maybe he ran along with it but people were not very pleased about the manner in which it was done.  However, we will not go into the details now.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stated that the setting up of this scheme is being <Col N="440" /> explored.  I hope she will be more definite and say that it is being explored with a very definite view to establishing schemes across the country and that it will be on a national rather than pilot basis.  There is much international evidence to suggest that establishing the scheme on a national basis would be wise, prudent and beneficial to everybody in the long run.  I hope the Minister will proceed down that route.</P>
    <P>We were fortunate on the sub-committee of the forum to work with people such as Professor John O'Hagan who did an excellent job chairing the sub-committee. He is very committed and skilfully manoeuvred and compiled this report.  There are many people representing a variety of areas and it is not an easy task to find a common denominator and compile a report such as this. There were many interest groups who want their issues addressed but the chairman managed to steer an extremely skilfull course.  I compliment him for the work he has done.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to name individual members but we were fortunate to work with Brendan Butler from Coolock who had expertise, knowledge and on the ground experience of the success in the employment centre in Coolock.  We were also fortunate to work with Fr. Seán Healy who always has a tremendous input to make.  I do not want to name others but everybody had an input to make with serious concern.  We were particularly fortunate to have the benefit of Brendan Butler's direct experience. Recognition must also be given to the work of the chairperson of the forum, Maureen Gaffney and the secretariat.</P>
    <P>The report first details the nature and consequences of long term unemployment. It goes on to set out the causes which I do not intend to detail here.  We then summarised the international thinking on policy responses to long term unemployment.  The Government has a responsibility to respond to the recommendations and we look forward to that response.  These recommendations were thought about seriously and <Col N="441" /> did not just come off the top of somebody's head.  They involved much discussion where many points of view were put forward and eventually compromises were made by some groups in order to facilitate our arrival at a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Some of the recommendations may be viewed as ambitious but if one reads behind the lines one will recognise that they are based on sound fact.  I am delighted about the Minister of State's announcement that a high level group has been set up.  The report recommended that an interdepartmental group be established to examine the recommendations.  This high level group will include senior civil servants and people involved in local community development, and the Minister wants their report before the end of November. When concluding, she might indicate the Departments and local communities from which the members are drawn.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned that the possibility of a local based employment centre is being explored.  I hope that after the debate she will be in a position to say that it is being explored with a view to positive action and that it will be established on a national basis and not in isolated instances.</P>
    <P>This is an important report which will demand courage in Government and from employers.  It will also demand courage from the unemployed who are sometimes sceptical or scared about changes.  If people are encouraged to register, they will immediately ask what is happening and will fear that their unemployment assistance will be taken from them.  It is important that the publicity surrounding the establishment of the scheme will allay those fears and clearly outline what is proposed.  We will then have a high rather than low level of registration.  The only reason for a low level of registration would be the fear people may have about placing their names on the register.</P>

      <P>There are many recommendations particularly dealing with the need to make it more attractive for employers to take on employees by changing PRSI and taxation policies.  That is a big and awkward step but if employers are to take on long term unemployed people, specific attractions must be offered to them.  This is fundamental to the success of the overall recommendation.</P>
      <P>I have every confidence that the Minister of State will do her utmost but I will be depending on her to impress on the Government the need to act positively on the recommendations.</P>

      <P>I welcome this report which stands out from others we have received because of its focused analysis. It is very clear and easy to understand. It does not shy away from controversial areas and they are not covered in woolly language.  It is a fine report and everybody associated with it is to be congratulated. The fact that it is such a fine report makes even greater the challenge to Government to implement it.</P>
      <P>In a culture such as ours where a person's sense of identity is defined by what that person does as opposed to any other individual quality, unemployment is a particularly traumatic experience and long term unemployment more so. Not only does long term unemployment deny the individual access to the tangible rewards of work but it undermines the person's sense of self worth.  The long term unemployed are entitled to more than our sympathy.  They are entitled to all the ingenuity the State can muster to overcome what has become a plague on our nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> Long-term unemployment not only stigmatises the individual but also deprives the individual and his or her dependants of the capacity to participate fully in all that modern society has to offer.  It is a corrosive undermining of the dignity of the person.  Material deprivation for the individual and their dependants is not the only down side. For society as a whole, long term unemployment means that a valuable resource, the ingenuity and creativity locked within every individual, is effectively underutilised and is doomed to become a cost rather than a contributor.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment is corrosive to society, it creates an underclass. The Minister touched on that point in her contribution.  It is important for us to understand how complex the web of interrelationships is.  This report is a key to understanding that; it helps to emphasise the importance of the task we face in this regard.  The Minister said we should not despair, and I take the analogy she raised in relation to the crisis which existed in the nation's finances less than a decade ago.  Who would have believed this nation by combined effort could have turned that around?  I hope that type of effort and focus can turn this particular problem around.</P>
    <P>The geographical focus of long term unemployment or underemployment creates ghettos, pockets where unemployment is the norm.  In parts of my constituency, for example, a third generation of families have never known employment.  There is something horrific about that in a modern developed society.  As the development of facilities and infrastructure goes hand in hand with economic activity, the lack of economic activity in an area contributes to physical decline.  A vicious spiral is soon set up and we can see this in the cities. As has happened in many parts of Ireland, particularly in large urban areas, when spending power declines, shops, banks and even basic public facilities are withdrawn.  This adds to the sense of physical deprivation and entire <Col N="444" /> communities rather than individual families are affected.  In these areas the cost of even rudimentary services which remain in place escalates because on a unit basis it becomes harder to deliver them.  Unemployment, as much as bad planning and anything else, creates the &ldquo;Barrytowns&rdquo; in our society which we should seek to rid ourselves of.</P>
    <P>The forum report No. 4 spells out in the most measured terms the cost and consequences of long term unemployment. It forces us to face certain realities. The first reality is truly frightening in that the rate of long term unemployment in this country is greater than the total unemployment rate in most, if not all, OECD member states.  That is an extraordinary statistic.  It was only when I read it that I realised how big the problem and the scourge is and how big is the indictment on all of us.  Even if we were to ignore the impact of this reality on the individuals concerned, which in a civilised society I suggest we cannot do, this gives us some measure of the vast opportunity cost to the nation which is involved in long term unemployment. Besides the innate talent and capacity of those concerned, there has been a huge investment by society in their education, training and development, yet all of this talent and investment is underutilised.</P>
    <P>The second striking feature highlighted by the forum deals with the reality facing the unemployed person, which Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to.  The longer a person is unemployed, the harder it is to break into the world of employment and the greater the barriers of prejudice.  It is a frightening statistic that three out of every four who have been unemployed for two years face at least another year of unemployment. It gets progressively worse and that really is a challenge.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment is shown to be ruthlessly focused on persons who are in their prime years and who have already been the subject of social deprivation in that they are often poorly educated and have not had the opportunity to develop their skills and talents.  In a society which prides itself as one where <Col N="445" /> education is valued, this is surely an indictment and it raises fundamental questions about the way we approach education, particularly education for life.</P>
    <P>This country has not been blessed with natural resources.  We have not been given great mineral or hydrocarbon wealth and we suffer from the problem of geographical peripherality. However, we do have a wealth in our people and this report makes it clear that we have been profligate in the way we have approached that wealth.  Unemployment has become another major economic cost which we must bear.  In economic terms, the report finds that the cost of unemployment amounts to a staggering 7 per cent of GDP.  It is a frightening statistic.  As the previous speaker said, that is not the full cost; it is only part of the cost because one must add to that the cost of support services, health services and poverty, which can never really be measured, the cost of underachievement, deprivation and all the ancillary State machinery which must deal with that pool or spiral of deprivation.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this is that Ireland can be equated to a marathon runner forced to run a gruelling and competitive race carrying a heavy weight, while the other runners can approach the course unencumbered.  We are in a race and we must compete with our neighbour nations for employment.  However, if we have this burden, we fetter ourselves.</P>
    <P>A particularly valuable aspect of the forum report is the analysis of the factors which contribute to long term unemployment.  Like many Members of both Houses, I admit I have never given the idea of long term unemployment, as opposed to unemployment, separate consideration.  The analysis is clear in this profoundly valuable document because it shows there are two stages and points to the particular and unique policies which we must adopt in dealing with the long term unemployed.  I compliment all involved in the forum on <Col N="446" /> that analysis, because it thoughtful, provocative and clear-cut.</P>
    <P>Five main causes of long term unemployment are identified in the report. The impact of employment protection legislation, the benefits system and the changing nature of work, an area we have discussed from time to time, are highlighted.  The low level of skills, education attainment and the barriers facing the long term unemployed entering the jobs market and the barrier of prejudice are touched on.  The loss of skills, the lack of influence and, I presume, the loss of individual motivation must be the lot of a person condemned to unemployment. These factors conspire and come together and the synergy of the five factors is far greater than the impact of any one individual factor.</P>
    <P>The impact of the employment protection legislation and the benefits system is something which should be of particular concern to both House of the Oireachtas.  The legislation and the benefits schemes in question are public policies enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important that the down side of these schemes is fully understood.  It is equally important that the fact that there is a down side should not be used by anybody to look to unpick the benefits of those schemes.  It is almost a cliché among employers to argue that it is positively unwise to expand the workforce.  If we are honest we must accept there are major disincentives which arise from public policy and which discourage the creation of jobs.  That is a frightening dilemma which faces policy makers.</P>
    <P>Employment protection legislation was put on the Statue Book for the best of reasons and I would not like to see the clock turned back.  For equally positive reasons a redundancy payment scheme was put in place and compensation for those without jobs has improved.  That is how it should continue. However, it must be accepted that beneficial as these polices may have been individually, the combination has had a negative impact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> We do not have to depend on anecdotal evidence for this.  Recent statistics on the level of overtime worked have been disturbing.  Most notably in some public sector employment, overtime has become almost endemic.  Two factors are responsible for this.  First, on the supply side there is the problem of workers faced with a high tax burden who wish to defend their living standards and who must seek overtime in order to retain those living standards. Second, employers face a problem in taking on additional staff.  Besides the tax burden, employers face the reality that in a rapidly changing business world it is impossible to forecast two or three years ahead.  That is why the forum's suggestions and it's discussion about contract employment as a way of breaking a particular chain are valuable.</P>
    <P>Employers are fearful of taking on additional people because of the inflexibilities which we, as legislators, have introduced into the equation.  It might not be politically correct to voice opinions such as this, but if we were to be truthful to the people who are long term unemployed, we have to face the realities of all of the causes of long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the impact of redundancy law on long term unemployment reviewed.  While cushioning the impact of redundancy for the individual worker, redundancy law has facilitated healthy firms who wish to ruthlessly downsize their operations in terms of workers.  The same redundancy packages still the trade unions, who might have some views to express on it, were it not for the fact that some of their members, particularly members who have served for long periods, find it financially very rewarding to avail of redundancy packages.</P>
    <P>Some Irish companies have grown to full multinational status.  These have a responsibility to the people of this nation which goes beyond keeping their corporate eyes on the bottom line.  I accept that major operators have to stay competitive, however, I cannot escape <Col N="448" /> the feeling that some of our major Irish companies have adopted rather overzealous employment practices which have grown up in other cultures.  They have applied these practices and policies in a manner which is inimical to the public interest.</P>
    <P>In some cases redundancies have been created in a manner which is highly questionable.  I am thinking in particular of one major Irish firm &mdash; I will not mention it here as it would be unfair to do so &mdash; which has used its pension funds in conjunction with the social welfare system to retire workers and to shed jobs.  While individual hardship may have been avoided in such cases, society is definitely impoverished because jobs which would have been there are not there for the next generation of workers.  The State has helped unwittingly by putting mechanisms in place to support this type of activity.</P>
    <P>The fact that this activity and the whole issue of protection legislation is honestly mentioned here as a factor in long term unemployment gives us the responsibility of analysing our own actions.  The changing nature of work and the barriers facing the long term unemployed are also mentioned.  I do not have time to discuss each of them, but the report's analysis, particularly on the barriers in a society that regards itself as civilised, is poignant, to say the least.  It is bad enough to be unemployed, but it is terrible to be unemployed over a long period.  It is simply unacceptable that those people have to face real barriers and prejudices that are put in place by people who regard themselves as informed and civilised.</P>
    <P>I wish to record my personal support for the central recommendation here, the concept of an employment service. That is absolutely vital.  I heartily concur with the comments made by Senator Taylor-Quinn on the advisability of the one-to-one relationship, the fact that case workers would be dealing with a targeted group of individuals and would at the end of the day have a personal commitment to helping those people to find a way through the difficulties of <Col N="449" /> getting back into the workforce.  This is a very fine report.  It is a provocative report.  There is a great deal in it.  It is a pity, perhaps, that we are not going to have a livelier debate, but I welcome what the Minister has said here.  She has indicated clearly that her mind is open to all that this report recommends.  She has also indicated clearly that the Government's collective mind is open, and that is very welcome indeed.  I wish to see early progress on this report and I hope that in the not too distant future individual elements of legislation or individual schemes to implement the report will be coming before this and the other House.</P>

      <P>I am glad to welcome the Minister to the House and I am also glad to see that the chairperson of the forum, Ms. Maureen Gaffney, is here with us this afternoon.  This is an extremely important report.  One of the criteria when the forum was set up &mdash; and I had the honour of being on the forum &mdash; was that we should look at equality and social justice in Ireland.</P>
      <P>This report begins to address one area where there is appalling inequality in this country.  What degree of inequality are we prepared to accept between various groups in Ireland?  We are talking about equality and that idea seems pretty remote to me.  We might consider looking at it from the point of view of equity, which I hope we want for all our citizens.  We must realise that equity comes with a cost.  The Minister was quite right when she said that economic prosperity does not necessarily reach everyone.  I am delighted she said that, because the theory that a rising tide will lift all boats is simply not correct.  Many boats will still be left in the mud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn said last night that he would not speak against the property tax because he felt that there had to be a broader spread of taxation within the population.  Many people are paying very high tax and I do not think that Senator Quinn, having had the pleasure of visiting his lovely home, is one of <Col N="450" /> those who are not paying property tax; but we have to realise that if we are to spread taxation more equitably, some of us are not going to get a reduction. Senator Roche was quite right when he focused on this in the area of employment. A huge area of inequality must be addressed there.  I hope the Government does it with much more urgency in the next budget.</P>
    <P>As well as the fact that we have long term unemployed, we have an appalling situation where high numbers of the long term unemployed are concentrated in certain areas within the country.  This has a terrible effect on those areas because it affects not just the person who is unemployed but, as the other speakers have said, it also affects the entire family and the community.  There is a tremendous lack of opportunity at the moment to get out of this situation, both for the long term unemployed person and that person's family.  Being long term unemployed carries with it a huge social cost.  When people become unemployed it has been described to me as being like a bereavement.  It has been as bad as that.  There is a tremendous sense of loss, tremendous bitterness in the beginning, then there is an increased feeling of lack of self worth.  As other speakers have said, there is increased likelihood of illness, and of course we have not looked at the costs of this at all.</P>
    <P>I was at a meeting in Bonn last week with various people from the European Union and outside and we were discussing the social effects of unemployment on ill health among other topics. Life expectancies are a pretty good indicator of the health of a country and some of the points that came up there were extraordinarily interesting.  The difference in the mortality rates between social class one and social class five, especially for men, is now seven years.  In other words, a person in social class one is likely to live for seven years longer than a person in social class five, where the unemployed and the very poor are.  What is really fascinating about this statistic is that it has got much <Col N="451" /> worse between 1931 and 1981, so they are making no progress at all.  I am not quite so sure of the figures here because they are not as clearly divided.  No progress in equity in this area has been made in Britain.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic increase in the longevity of those in the higher social classes but there has been no change at all after the age of five for those in the poorer sections of our society which is quite incredible.  Mortality inequities in the United States and the United Kingdom have increased dramatically since the late 1960s.  We all know that the policy pursued there has been the one of the rising tide lifting all boats, but it has not been successful. There has been an improvement in mortality rates over all social classes in other countries &mdash; for example in the Scandinavian countries and in Japan &mdash; and we would not describe any of those as being less successful than the United States or the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The fact of being unemployed seems to make it so much more likely that a person will have all the usual diseases like arthritis, respiratory diseases, tuberculosis, obesity and everything associated with smoking.  I sometimes find myself wondering what on earth I am saying when I tell patients that they should not smoke, because I am sure these women see a middle class, middle aged woman who does not know that smoking is the only thing they do for themselves.  So, apart from when they are pregnant, I try not to make too much of a lecture of it.</P>
    <P>A colleague asked a man in his fifties, who requested sleeping tablets from him, at what time he went to bed.  The man replied that he went to bed at approximately 4 a.m.  He then asked the man if he would not go to bed earlier, to which he replied why should he as there was nothing to get up for.  There is no structure to the day of such people. The man went on to advise that his main occupation was to watch four videos per day.  Apparently, the video shops are <Col N="452" /> good about providing videos at a very cheap rate during the day to those who are unemployed, and I presume they should be commended for that.</P>
    <P>In addition to the serious situation regarding health, the area of education must be addressed.  I am aware that a start is being made to address it now, but enough is not yet being done.  The Minister for Education is targeting areas of deprivation with pre school opportunities, which is important, but it must be fed on up through the entire system.</P>
    <P>Those in deprived areas have parents with little social structure to their lives. For example, if somebody is up until 4 o'clock in the morning, it is difficult to get up again at 8 o'clock to ensure that the children get out to school.  Such children have a tremendous disadvantage in that their parents see no reason why they should get up and go to school. Enormous efforts must therefore be put into liaisons between the home and the school and other such areas, because it is the prevention of people becoming unemployed which is important.</P>
    <P>Much is spoken about graduate unemployment.  However, speaking of my constituents, such unemployment is much less than for those who have left school at 15 years of age.  Most graduates do not have the feeling of coming from totally deprived areas and having little self worth before they start looking for jobs.  I find that many of them make extremely determined efforts in this respect.  We must therefore begin by preventing long term unemployment from starting by concentrating on the various areas where there is educational and social deprivation.</P>
    <P>All studies produced, be they European or Irish, emphasise the fact that those who have the most problems with obtaining jobs are those with an inadequate education to begin with.  Maintaining people in education is an integrated operation, because there must be liaison between the home and the school.  For example, more may well have to be undertaken regarding meals at school, because I have discovered that poverty of nutrition is extremely <Col N="453" /> important.  In this respect, while the report of the forum is good on education and so on, the matter must be considered in a broadly based way.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if the forum had addressed the issue of child care facilities a little more in the report.  The Minister is correct in saying that the long term unemployed are mainly men, but the number of women is increasing. In this respect it is interesting to consider the age structure of the long term unemployed, where the usual age groups are 15 to 25 years or from the fifties onwards.  Child care facilities are therefore extremely important, especially for the younger age group. We cannot hope for women, especially lone parents, in whom I have a special interest, to avail of the opportunities which are now being presented by FÁS schemes and so on, including general education which is very important also, unless we establish such care facilities.</P>
    <P>Pious hopes expressed by the working group on child care facilities for working parents to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform are all very well, but they are not enough; they must be acted upon, and there is not a sufficient sense of urgency in this respect.  If the sense of urgency is going to be the same as getting a creche for the Oireachtas, it will probably not happen in my time. However, recommendations 12 and 13 of the report are extremely important in this respect.  They make clear that the operational programme for human resources should make explicit provision for the national training bodies, FÁS, CERT and Teagasc, to assign funds in fulfilment of child care obligations as objective three of the revised Structural Funds, 1994 to 1999.  In addition, it is recommended that training agencies and employment officers should inform prospective trainees of arrangements for support for their child care needs.  The take up of such support should form part of the evaluation of the new community support framework. The report makes similar recommendations regarding preference being given <Col N="454" /> to the creation of child care facilities in community centres.</P>
    <P>In addition, the provision of child care facilities in employment centres, or unemployment centres as they are too often termed, may have to be considered. The counselling service is excellent. To have people specifically in charge of a person is the correct way to proceed, and it was obvious that this approach had to be adopted.  There have been constant complaints in the health service regarding people seeing different doctors on each occasion, so why would there not also be complaints about the fact that every time people attended the centres to talk about their unemployment situation they were seeing different people?  The provision of child care facilities may therefore have to be established in employment centres, especially the large centres, because it would be impossible for those undertaking the counselling to deal with the prospective employee otherwise.</P>
    <P>The other area which has not been addressed enough in the forum, but which presumably will be addressed later, is the situation regarding credit facilities for people who have been long term unemployed.  Is it possible for the counsellors to become involved in this in any way?  Quite often, if they could obtain credit facilities, especially women from the older age group, they may have a greater opportunity to establish quite small projects between themselves or another few people.</P>
    <P>This issue is constantly described to me as a problem, but I am aware that some people have succeeded very well in this area.  Senator Roche spoke of redundancy money.  When redundancy money has been put to good use, such as starting off some small business, I have seen quite a number of people do well.  All such businesses have been services established by women, such as a pressing agency, curtain making and dress making.  In this respect I am pleased to note that repairs are coming back into fashion again.  It is an area which also needs to be addressed by the counsellors.  I am not sure whether they <Col N="455" /> could become middlemen with the banks, guarantors or some such, but it is an area which should be considered.</P>
    <P>While I commend the report, it is only a beginning.  Without funding, its recommendations will be impossible to implement.  The Minister is in the correct Department to ensure this, so hopefully the Government will press forward with the report.  The work put into it by the Members of the Oireachatas and representatives of the social partners has been important, but of even greater importance has been the work put into the report by the voluntary agencies, which the Minister so wisely included in the make up of the forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate in the House today.  I also welcome the Minister to the House, and the chairperson of the forum, Maureen Gaffney. The debate is taking place in the context of unemployment being at the top of the agenda for everybody in the country, especially the Government.  A number of measure are being taken, especially in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, such as structural changes, including the division of the former IDA into Forfás and IDA Ireland under the umbrella of Forbairt, the establishment of the enterprise boards, the National Development Plan, which was recently launched, the community employment scheme expansion, changes regarding the services sector, tourism, and so on.</P>
      <P>All of these measures are designed to tackle the unemployment problem in a broad way.  What is different with this report is that it focuses on the endemic and difficult problem of long term unemployment.  Much talk is made of the rising tide.  There is such a tide, and the economic forecast is bright, but it does not lift up all the boats.  The other Government measures are designed to keep the tide rising.  This report focuses directly on the problem of long term unemployment.  In a way it is revolutionary, and this is not too strong a word to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> As many people pointed out and as the figures show, even if there is an improvement in the employment situation &mdash; and there has been a slow and steady improvement over the last year &mdash; it does not impinge much on the problems of the long term unemployed. As the Minister said, we have the highest rate of long term unemployment in the OECD.  Other speakers pointed out, and quoted figures, that the longer one is unemployed, the less one is likely to get employment.  I have some figures from the Youth Council which show that a young person who was unemployed for over a year in October 1991 had a 74 per cent risk of still being unemployed a year later.  This focuses on the problem of youth employment, but it holds across the board.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the forum and although I was not on this committee, but rather the social policy committee, I agree with all that has been said about the importance of the forum in bringing together Members of the Oireachtas, the social partners and what is described as the third strand.  This represents various other interests which have not always had a voice at the table in the past.  The forum enabled a distillation of views from around the country and from all shades of opinion.  I compliment the members of the economic committee who have been able to distil all the ideas into this report.  It has since been discussed by the committee of which I am a member and adopted by the forum in full.  It brings fresh and original thinking to the area of long term unemployment and real hope for change.  I described it as revolutionary and I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>Many Members referred to the cost of unemployment in terms of how it affects people's health and their well-being, families in poverty and society at large. In focusing on the individual rather than structures and agencies, it is, for the first time in this country, looking at and trying to deal with the human side of the problems of unemployment.  When one tries to analyse why someone in long term unemployment has more difficulty <Col N="457" /> getting a job than a person who recently went onto the live register, one must look at one's individual experiences.</P>
    <P>In common with many other public representatives, I occasionally accompany people who are appealing to the Department of Social Welfare after they have been cut off the live register.  One must be available for and actively seeking work to be on the register.  People produce letters from factories stating that they cannot give them a job.  People must produce these letters to show that they have been seeking work.  Without exception, people who are long term unemployed do not have any feeling of hope that they will get jobs when they apply for them.  They feel they must go through the motions but that they do not have much hope of getting the job. This illustrates how long term unemployed people feel about their chances of getting back into the jobs market.</P>
    <P>Community employment schemes have made quite a contribution. However, the problem with such schemes is that they do not lead to anything. One is on a scheme for a year and it can be extended in some circumstances, but people do not see them as a road to permanent employment.  This is why this scheme is so different.  It suggests 800 mediators in a ratio of 1:125, which means they would deal directly with 100,000 people throughout the country.  Its budget, as Senator Taylor-Quinn said, would be approximately £30 million and the scheme would involve using services that exist, such as FÁS and the vocational training opportunities scheme, and liaising directly with employers.  The mediators would put unemployed people in touch with the system as it exists, whether this is through education, training or direct opportunities for employment.  This has been tried on a pilot basis in other places, such as France, and I understand it has been quite successful.</P>
    <P>It also involves an intensification as time moves on.  If a person has not been successfully placed after a period of months, their contact with the mediator and others who would be in a position <Col N="458" /> to bring them into employment, training and education, becomes more frequent. The emphasis on education is most important.  Statistics show that if one has a poor level of education, one's chances of being in employment are much lower than if one has full second or third level education.  It will be interesting to see how it affects the education system. There has already been a major expansion of the vocational training opportunities scheme.  There may be a much greater demand on it in the future if this scheme is put into operation.</P>
    <P>It will put pressure on the systems and structures that exist at present.  I said I would return to the point about it being revolutionary.  In that sense it might be very revolutionary.  As people will have direct liaison with systems, holes will show up and the need for change will emerge.  If the systems do not meet the needs of the people dealing directly with the mediators, there will be pressure to change them.  This would be a good thing if it turns out that there is a need to change the systems. It might require the setting up of new approaches to enterprise, such as more co-operatives, for example.  There is much good feeling towards the concept of community co-operatives, but in practice there are not many in existence. If there is a facility for long term unemployed people to come together and to be put in touch with the systems, one may find that their needs will involve many changes in and expansions of programmes that already exist.  It may be a challenge to many organisations and I hope it will be a challenge to many employers.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the economic facts of life encourage a tendency for people to adopt labour saving methods and principles rather than taking on new people. Some changes in the budget last year encouraged employers to take on new people and this is good.  However, the nature of economic competitiveness means that employers still tend to bring in new technology at the expense of a new person.  This shows the need to adapt to the way people are trained.  It <Col N="459" /> also poses a challenge to employers not to take the easy option of shedding employees by bringing in new technology. A mediator system will put the unemployed more in touch with employers and it will have an effect in that area also.</P>
    <P>A number of Members mentioned European policy.  I have two White Papers before me &mdash; the Social Policy White Paper, which was published in July, and the Growth, Competitiveness and Employment White Paper, which was published previously.  Both papers refer to the need to change our structures. The first deals with the need to break the cyclical system, of which the cycle of long term unemployment is part.  The European Social Policy White Paper also talks about the need for more guidance and a direct placement approach in terms of how we deal with long term unemployment.  Although Ireland has the most serious difficulties, the problem of long term unemployment has been identified throughout Europe.  We can feel confident that we will have the support of our EU partners for whatever measures we take.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, had a strong input into the drawing up of the National Plan, particularly in relation to its community and local development aspect.  I am sure there will be strong support for the type of suggestions which have been made in that area.  It is important that the community aspect of this is stressed.  Others referred to the fact that high levels of long term unemployment are particularly evident in certain urban areas. There is a need for a community based approach in those places and this will probably link into the system proposed by the forum.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the point made by Senator Henry regarding child care. It is an example of the point I made that if this system comes into operation it will point up needs in society, one of which is the need for more child care facilities.  There have been some developments in that regard but there is a <Col N="460" /> need for more emphasis on child care. If more parents come within the scope of the mediator system the need for child care will become apparent.  In that sense this system will have broad effects.</P>
    <P>The particular and most important effect it can have is to give people who are long term unemployed a real opportunity to get onto the jobs market.  They have had the opportunity on paper but many individuals have felt they do not really have the same opportunity as those who have better education or a more recent employment record.  This is a revolutionary proposal and as a member of the forum I am pleased to speak on the report.  I hope it will be carried through and that the money will be found to put it into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I am glad to see the chairperson of the forum, Ms Maureen Gaffney, in the Visitors Gallery.  At the launch of the report on ending long term unemployment the chairperson emphasised that, unless existing policies are changed, long term unemployment, which is already a major economic and social problem, will continue and the number of people unemployed will be no lower at the end of the decade.  I was pleased to hear the Minister go through the report and indicate that the Government told us it would be implementing its recommendations because if we did not do so, the future would be bleak for the large numbers who are unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous policies have led us to a jobless total of 300,000.  Growth in employment in the 30 years &mdash; from 1961 to 1991 &mdash; is only at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent.  For every nine people in employment 30 years ago, all our efforts at industrial policy have created only one more job.  This is a frightening statistic.  At present there is a definite upswing in the world economy, and it is during such times that levels of consumer expenditure are increasing and firms are given the opportunity to expand into new areas, to increase their <Col N="461" /> resources in terms of technology and to build up a skilled labour force.  If industries do not develop in improved economic climates there is little hope for their long term prospects.</P>
    <P>Many firms in Ireland have, unfortunately, shown anything but the developments expected during a recovery period.  If firms do not survive and prosper there will not be jobs for the long term unemployed.  When we see other countries feeling confident because of an improved economic climate, recurring reports of failing firms and calls for compulsory redundancies in firms in this country indicate that there must be something radically wrong here.  We have the second highest annual average unemployment rate, only exceeded by that in Spain.  Successively the annual average has been almost twice that in the UK and in three of the last six years it has been more than double that in the UK.</P>
    <P>We must look at Government policies and their effect on unemployment.  We must look at the cost of employment, for example.  While interest and inflation rates are at their lowest levels in 30 years, the costs to the employer of employing people are crippling employment opportunities.  Instead of promoting employment the existing exorbitant employer PRSI rates force firms to switch to more capital intensive production methods.  Numerous capital allowances are available for expenditure on machinery and plant but if an employer is considering recruiting another worker the typical rate of PRSI an employer faces is 12.2 per cent on the employee's earnings.</P>
    <P>While it is acknowledged that capital allowances are necessary and reduce the costs of the firm and allow it to become more competitive, when faced with a choice between a new machine and a new worker the present system of allowances and charges is anti-worker.  I accept that the Government has tried to address this and has introduced a reduced rate of PRSI for people earning under £173 per week.  However, more changes are necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> The exorbitant income tax rates force up the costs facing employers.  The tax wedge created by these high rates creates a disincentive for the unemployed to take up employment which may be offered to them at rates which they find unacceptable but which the employers may find extremely difficult to increase.  That is not to say sympathy should be given to employers who may wish to offer the lowest wage rate they can get away with, particularly in times of high unemployment.  The gross figure which the employer has to pay the employee combined with the PRSI he or she has to pay is vastly different to the pay the worker gets into their hand at the end of the week.  This problem must be addressed if employment levels are to be raised.</P>
    <P>Our party has always believed that pro-jobs tax reform is necessary.  Politicians give out publicly about unemployment but support our present tax system by doing nothing but weeping crocodile tears.  There is a vicious penal tax rate on work and on investment in job creation, and until we have radical tax reform there will be no solution to the joblessness and no hope for the huge numbers unemployed.  I accept that pro-jobs tax reform is not the only solution but the Culliton report made it clear that without job related tax reform no progress would be made.</P>
    <P>In 1973 fewer than 2 per cent of employees paid tax above the standard rate and there were 60,000 unemployed; in 1989 43 per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate and we now have 300,000 people unemployed.  There is a simple message here &mdash; if we tax work and employment at penal rates then we are taxing away jobs.  If there is to be any change in unemployment it will only come about with radical tax reform.</P>
    <P>Recent ESRI reports estimate that overall employment growth is to average 1 per cent but they also predict that employment would grow in high-tech sectors by between 2 and 4 per cent over the next three years and that there would be a growth rate of 2 per cent per year in the service sector until the end <Col N="463" /> of this decade.  We must make a greater effort to encourage industries in these areas into the country to provide jobs.</P>
    <P>We must support and develop opportunities for those who wish to establish their own employment.  We must promote an environment of enterprise, particularly in areas for which forecasts of high growth rates have been established. There is a need to give those who wish to create jobs for themselves through self-employment the opportunity to do so by giving them experience and training them in the practical skills necessary; providing them with information on grants and how to successfully apply for them, how to undertake a feasibility study before setting up an enterprise and how to market their products.  This will help aspiring entrepreneurs and those who have already set up to seek assistance to stand on their own two feet.  This would, hopefully, reduce the number of people who are on the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>Such training and enterprise should not be limited to the unemployed. Those who are already active in the labour market can establish new firms and industries and they will be creating employment in the future.  In view of the huge numbers on the dole and those who are long term unemployed we have to provide training for young unemployed people and some form of voluntary third sector employment for the long term unemployed.  The public and the private sectors cannot absorb the present number of unemployed.  The State must devise a third sector in which the resources of the jobless is matched to the needs of society.  It is not beyond the wit of all of us to devise and implement such a scheme.  Our present policies that exclude the jobless from making any real contribution to society are totally immoral and unjust.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats came forward with a proposal for tackling the unemployment crisis, particularly as the sheer scale of the crisis in Irish society means that whatever the level of economic growth we would still have hundreds <Col N="464" /> of thousands with no jobs or gainful activity to pursue.  A radical approach is essential.  The Minister said that some of the proposals in this report are radical and I accept that.  However, in the short term, despite the aspirations of the report for full employment &mdash; and all of us would hope for that &mdash; that will not happen.  In the meantime we cannot tell the long term unemployed that they must remain that way.  They must be given some means of participating in the economic life of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the details of the report and I agree with what she said.  I accept that she is committed to implementing this report; she is committed to tackling the problems of the unemployed.  We, as a party, support the recommendations of this report and we hope the Government will implement them in full so that everybody who wishes to can participate in the economic life of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report and compliment Maureen Gaffney and the members of the forum on their work in its preparation.  It is a comprehensive document which highlights a number of important policy issues that must be tackled.  I am glad to note that the Tánaiste and the Government have indicated that this report will not be left on the shelf.  Unfortunately, over the years many reports on unemployment, labour force opportunities and the like have been left on the shelf and action has not been taken to deal with the problems they highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many important initiatives are highlighted in this report.  I will not unduly delay the House in discussing them but this report will be compulsory reading for many of the people who are involved in this area.  Although the report has been in circulation since June it has received, to my knowledge, very little publicity aside from that surrounding its launch.  The Minister has an opportunity now to involve the social partners and others in discussion of this document and to make the critical <Col N="465" /> decisions necessary to enable the objectives in the report to be implemented.</P>
    <P>There has been talk today of courage in the context of dealing with other situations. However, the difficulty I anticipate is an absence of political courage to tackle some of the issues dealt with in this report.  I encountered this during the short period I was Minister in the Department of Social Welfare.  When important decisions were made which would have an impact in dealing with these issues there was such a hue and cry, especially from Opposition politicians purely for short term political purposes, that it was almost impossible to take any meaningful action.  In the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; which I compliment for its efficiency in modernising its service and the effective way it has regionalised its service and streamlined its decision making process &mdash; there was a possibility, which I understand is being undertaken at present, of matching unemployment figures with taxation figures.  It would have had a big impact in many of these areas. However, there was huge resistance to this proposal.</P>
    <P>I hope that in coming to grips with the issues that have been highlighted in this report the political courage will be available to deal with them.  There might be short term political disadvantages in doing so but in the long term it will be to the benefit of the economy, the people seeking employment and in the overall national interest.  This is more important now than ever before in view of the dramatic changes taking place in Ireland.  There will undoubtedly be more communication and dialogue between us and the people of Northern Ireland and many changes will be necessary arising from these developments.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment, as is borne out by surveys which were carried out heretofore, is the main cause of low incomes and poverty in Ireland.  Unless we undertake initiatives to tackle this, the prospect of dealing with the many people who are suffering in the poverty trap will not be possible.  While I compliment Maureen Gaffney and her team <Col N="466" /> on their valuable research, it is important that the Government not ignore their work and that the specific action that is necessary be taken speedily to deal with the issues highlighted by this report.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the area of guidance, counselling and information which is mentioned in this report.  To put it mildly, the present situation is chaotic. It must be examined and cries out for urgent remedial action.  Not only is this a disadvantage to the unemployed, who are at the bottom of the scale if you like, but it is also a serious disadvantage to many people in the counselling and guidance sector in particular who have good qualifications but who find that they are forced to seek employment opportunities outside this country with a resultant huge loss to our economy. There is no proper guidance counselling service in place to deal with these problems. How soon is that likely to be dealt with?  Can the Minister give us an indication if there is a willingness on the part of the Government to deal with the issue of counselling and career guidance, especially for young school leavers?</P>
    <P>The report indicates that there is a lesser rate of long term unemployment in the over 55 bracket.  However, everybody knows that this is because people are on pre-retirement allowances.  There is also an urgent necessity to look at the unemployed figures.  On a previous occasion I pointed out to the House that while a huge construction project was under way which employed 1,100 people in my constituency, the unemployment figure at the exchange at Kilrush never changed by a single figure; in fact, I think it increased.  Many of the people who were signing on as long term unemployed were doing so for income supplement rather than out of a desire to seek employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that many people sign on in local exchanges to secure an income supplement to their unemployment assistance or benefit and do not have a genuine desire to find long term <Col N="467" /> work.  Many of them are employed on a temporary basis and they are looking for supplementary income.  The unemployment figures could be substantially reduced &mdash; I would say by about half &mdash; if there was a thorough investigation.  It could be carried out in co-operation with those who are signing on if it could be shown that they would not suffer any loss of income because of recategorisation or whatever.</P>
    <P>This report highlights &mdash; and it is important that we continue to highlight &mdash; the fact that women in employment are still doing very badly.  The fact that males constitute 72 per cent of the long term unemployed might tend to create the impression that women are not seriously affected by long term unemployment. Many women do not register as unemployed because they know there is no employment available anyway. Many of them could be employed and this is borne out in European Union reports and in studies by Commissioner Flynn and others.  We must look carefully at a range of issues, such as child minding and the provision of care for families who require it.  They are not being dealt with by the present system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the forum report.  The report will only be valuable if the Government makes the policy changes identified as being necessary; introduces the package of initiatives recommended; sets up the guidance, counselling and placement services; and undertakes the special measures for young school leavers and women that are necessary if we are to tackle this in a meaningful way. The report is valuable but while we can speak about it I would prefer to see action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a valuable opportunity to concentrate on the conditions and difficulties of the long term unemployed. The Minister and most of the contributors have shown a clear understanding of their difficulties and also of the difficulty in doing anything for them.  The latter is the key; sympathising with them and understanding them is <Col N="468" /> not enough, we must try to get them back to work.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that research and the EU Commission's attitude indicates that officialdom has written off the long term unemployed.  From an examination of the Community support framework published in the recent past and from discussions with European officials it is clear that what the Government wanted to spend on programmes for the long term unemployed and what eventually appeared in the published document were quite different.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed with the Commission and reduced the amount to be provided in the human resource section by a substantial amount.  The emphasis was moved from the long term unemployed towards retraining people at work and giving them more skills so they can better adapt to changing conditions. The Minister was supportive in her contribution but the Government agreed to that strategy.  It may not be widely known but the emphasis has moved from the long term unemployed. The change is because the Commission's research has shown that once a person becomes long term unemployed he or she tends to remain in that status.  The long term unemployed do not get work and any new jobs created go to new entrants with more modern skills, or to women who have not appeared on the live register.  That is a grave worry.</P>
      <P>If the best we can do is to employ part of the new entrants who appear every year, what kind of growth rates do we need to give meaningful support to the long term unemployed?  It is mind boggling to think about that, when we cannot provide enough jobs to accommodate new entrants to the labour force. How can we do anything meaningful for the unemployed within the strategies applied up to now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another worry is that the Government is spending 10 per cent more this year than last year.  This seems an erratic approach.  We can pay lip service to certain ideals, but actions speak louder.  If the Government increases <Col N="469" /> spending by 10 per cent at a time when inflation is about 2 per cent, that means it is not serious about creating new jobs in the economy.</P>
    <P>A large employer in the Border corridor carried out research recently showing that the average cost of employing a person in that company was about £22,000 per year; the corresponding cost in the North of Ireland was about £15,000.  The company owner was concerned about his ability to compete with companies in the North and his analysis suggested there was a huge imbalance.</P>
    <P>The Government must be serious about such factors.  Many people are aware this is the case and it is especially hurtful to those of us in Border areas who have to fight competition from companies in the North.  We are all in favour of healthy competition which is good for the economy but when we conduct an analysis we find it is not fair. Conditions must be made right for companies here which want to employ people.  Only then will we make an impact.</P>
    <P>I welcome this discussion.  We have only been given a short time to analyse this problem but I am sure we will be given another opportunity at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's contribution on the report of the National Economic and Social Forum on Ending Long Term Unemployment. The points she made were worthwhile and should be noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I praise the work of the enterprise boards because they pick up local strands.  The Minister mentioned locally based unemployment services and it is important to have a mediator to deal with many unemployed people.  The mediator could find out from the local development organisations and local bodies who is available for work, what <Col N="470" /> kind of work is being sought and find employers who are looking for one or two new employees.  Unemployment can be reduced by filling small numbers of jobs locally through the enterprise boards.  They are crucial in the effort to get people off the dole.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight the plight of new age travellers, which is connected with unemployment.  Many people from foreign countries are coming to my area, west Cork.  They are registering as unemployed and also with the health board for supplementary welfare allowance. It is only right to raise this in the House and bring it to the attention of the Government.  Will the problem be tackled?  Our country has always suffered from emigration and we are not geared for the mass immigration which is currently taking place in many of our rural communities.  It puts a heavy strain on our services and constitutes an employment problem.  Our young people have gone abroad looking for work; we have never had people coming here looking for work before because there is no work here.  This problem will have to be firmly tackled in the not too distant future.  With the new laws about to come into force in England, a flood of new age travellers will come into Ireland.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has always been a tragedy and the biggest danger is for older people who lose their jobs.  They feel they have no hope of gaining employment again.  Unemployment leads to poverty, disadvantage, the growth of moneylending and a general depression.  The Minister mentioned figures for unemployment among lone parents, adult dependants and those receiving the disabled persons maintenance allowance.  We should take these people into account.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have a big part to play in relieving unemployment. There should be a good deal of contact between locally based employment services and the local authorities because people want to work.  Last night when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, was in the House, I said that <Col N="471" /> people employed on SES and CES schemes take great pride in their references from that work.  It gives them dignity and honour and indicates they want to work.</P>
    <P>The unions will have to play a big part.  Many people work long hours and are badly paid and this will have to be looked at carefully.  Schools in rural communities are idle at night and during the summer and other holidays and they could easily be used for training the unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir and, particularly, Senator Calnan, for giving me the opportunity to speak.  I welcome the Minister and the report and the opportunity to speak on it.  It is a marvellous sharp analysis of the problem and its recommendations are practical and sensible.  My principal point is that the report does not bury the problem of the long term unemployed in the overall problem.  We cannot do this because the broader problem of unemployment is so big.  It is partly because we have done this in the past that the problem exists at this stage.  The report points this out and suggests solutions.  If we do not take the long term unemployed out of the overall problem, the rising tide we hope will lift all boats will lift this boat last and the problem will be the last to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted with and wholeheartedly support the link between education and the long term unemployed. Our education system has failed the unemployed, it is not that they have failed to get through it.  We must do something about this.  From that point of view I am delighted with a number of the steps that have already been initiated.  I have an involvement with the new leaving certificate applied programme which is aimed at catering for those in secondary school whose talents have not been satisfied by the present leaving certificate.  I hope this programme will make achievers of them, give them the opportunity to blossom <Col N="472" /> and succeed and a much better opportunity of working in the future.</P>
    <P>The problem is so big that we are in danger of being paralysed by it and saying it is hardly worth tackling because it would appear we cannot solve it.  This is clearly not the situation.  The forum recognised the problem and made a range of proposals for its solution.  I am delighted that these proposals have been recommended.  At their heart is the idea of an employment service which would take an individual handson approach.  This is an exciting aspect. The problem of each unemployed person is separate and the concept is that it would be handled through the medium of what the forum refers to as mediators.  This is an excellent approach.</P>
    <P>The report leaves open whether this new employment service should be operated through the existing FÁS or whether a new organisation should be set up for this task.  I very strongly believe we should not waste time and resources setting up yet another organisation. We have a strong organisation in FÁS, which is competent, capable and sufficiently able to do this task.  We should agree to provide and resource this service and give the existing set-up the task of getting on with the job.  We established enough new bodies in the past few years to last us a lifetime and I know the problems they create.</P>
    <P>The proposed one on one approach is precisely the sort of special treatment the long term unemployed need.  The report uses the word &ldquo;mediator&rdquo; to describe the people who will provide this individual service.  What is envisaged is a mentor.  We used the term &ldquo;mother hen&rdquo; in the old days but I am not sure if it is now regarded as acceptable. The word &ldquo;mentor&rdquo; is precisely what the forum means.  It is somebody who will be able to hold the hands of an individual unemployed person and act as a listener, a sympathetic body and a support.  Each of the unemployed will have a single person to whom they can relate.  This person will know the situation of the unemployed person, will be <Col N="473" /> committed to finding a solution, able to provide the support and encouragement which are such vital psychological parts of the whole need of an unemployed person and be a prop to that person. This is important, new and exciting and I congratulate the forum for coming up with this.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Ms Maureen Gaffney is in the visitors' gallery.  She and the forum must take a large portion of the credit for all the work it has done. This concept directly addresses one of the central problems, which is the demoralising effect of unemployment and the way it destroys motivation, incentive and the belief and confidence of people to be able to help themselves. It creates almost a fatalistic and dependent outlook on life in general, not just on work.  This is not a completely untried idea.  It works successfully in some of the local area partnerships.  We must dramatically extend and expand it very quickly because it is necessary to make a real impact on the problem.  I believe it can do this.  There are previous examples of this working and succeeding. The forum has touched on and grabbed hold of an idea which can work and it must make sure it does work.</P>
    <P>The publication of this report provides the focus to create a national consensus on the importance of tackling this problem.  I was delighted at the speeches made here today.  Senators O'Sullivan and Henry focused on the areas of how this can be achieved.  This report recognises the importance of the problem and makes recommendations with which we can do something about it.  With this consensus and the recognition of the importance of tackling the problem, the report also gives us specific ways to solve it.  The main need now is for action not just talk.  The report has given us not just food for thought but fuel for action.  This is an exciting prospect which we should grab hold of at this stage.  We should not be frightened of the scale of the problem.  If this problem is as big as it seems, there is a danger that we will say it is so big that we are not able to tackle it.  There is the <Col N="474" /> tradition of how to eat an elephant.  This is quite a challenge but the way to do it is to take very small bites at a time.  This problem is elephant sized and if we are to tackle and solve it we must take it bit by bit.  The forum's report has given us not just the rational analysis of the problem but also solutions.  We should move on these solutions immediately.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Closure of Castleblayney (Monaghan) Plant.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Treacy, to the House.  I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the difficulties in Castleblayney, County Monaghan, as a result of the decision made by the management of Cement Roadstone Holdings to close the plant there.  The announcement was made over two weeks ago.  One can only imagine the shock to the workforce and the people of Castleblayney.  The management said rock is depleted at the current location and that, therefore, it must cease operations from 30 November 1994.</P>
      <P>Castleblayney has had a rough time over the past quarter of a century because a few factories have closed there in recent times.  A Eurolivre factory, which was in the town in the early 1970s, closed, as did a furniture factory, which employed approximately 120 people, and two shoe factories.  One could only imagine what people felt when they heard the announcement about the Cement Roadstone Holdings plant.  It is on the national primary road and visible to everyone.  It was seen as a flagship for the town because of the great activity associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> Although only a small number of people work in the plant, the official figure is approximately 25, my investigations show that approximately 60 people will be affected by this decision. These include those who officially work in the plant, contract workers inside and outside the plant and a substantial number of people who provide transport.  It is sad for some of these latter people because many factories have offloaded transport on drivers who bought lorries, but have not yet paid for them.  They will probably suffer enormously from this decision.  Many services are required to support this plant and these are drawn from the locality.  Many people will suffer as a result of this closure. One could say that every business in Castleblayney will suffer a loss if this decision is implemented.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to have discussions with the management about this issue.  I know it is a private company, but, as public representatives, we have an interest in finding out the difficulties and in ensuring we know why the plant is closing.  If it cannot be redeemed, we must take other action.  I hope the plant will be kept open, at least for an extended period of time.  That would give the company a chance to look for alternative rock supplies in the area and give the Government an opportunity to bring its full force to bear on the situation in Castleblayney and to create new jobs there.</P>
    <P>Castleblayney is a small rural town with a population of approximately 3,000.  More than 900 people sign on the dole each week there.  When one considers the number of people on the social employment scheme, the number of people out of work is probably between 1,100 and 1,200.  That is a colossal figure for a small town.  Castleblayney is located only a few miles from the Border.  Therefore, its resources would have been depleted rather than increased over the past 15 years.  Castleblayney now needs help.  It cannot do much for itself as it does not have the <Col N="476" /> kind of stored up capital supplies as other parts of the country because of its geographical location.</P>
    <P>The closure of Digital was a huge loss to County Galway and created a huge disturbance in the area at the time. However, the Government made a decision, moved in and replaced the jobs within 12 months.  It also committed huge amounts of financial resources to TEAM Aer Lingus and Irish Steel.  It also successfully moved into Dundalk &mdash; it recognised the town as an unemployment blackspot &mdash; and successfully dealt with its problems.  Maybe these problems have not all been solved, but there are new industries in Dundalk, which is wonderful.  Will the Minister advise the Government on this and see that it does the same for Castleblayney?  The people there need help and I hope to be the agent to get this message across.</P>
    <P>The quarry industry in the Border corridor in the South has had a rough time, not just recently, but over a ten year period.  It arose because the powers that be in the North at the time grant-aided plant and machinery for the quarry industry there.  Those grants are now gone, but these people were given an opportunity to set up strong and well financed companies, which is what happened. That industry in the North created approximately 500 jobs in the last ten years.  In the South, both near the Border and in the Border corridor, I would say that 500 jobs have been lost. At a meeting in Cavan last Saturday morning, I was given a list of companies dealing in the quarry business along the Border that closed in the past ten years. The list is substantial.  There is no doubt that the number of jobs created in the North was borrowed from us.  Cement Roadstone might, in fact, be able to continue operating in its present location at Castleblayney for another three or four years.  It has taken the decision because it cannot handle the competition; it is a waste of time operating there.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be aware &mdash; he may have already done his own research on the matter &mdash; that a tonne of tarmacadam, <Col N="477" /> for example, supplied to a local authority in the Border counties is cheap compared to the price local authorities pay in the South, which is incredible. Authorities in the North were offered a tonne of tarmacadam at about £20 per tonne at one stage this year, where in the South, it was talking in terms of around £40 pounds a tonne. Why?  It happened because of the fierce competition from the North.  I honestly believe there is a certain element of dumping.  The companies in the North are strong because of the support they got at a certain time.  They are dumping products into the Border counties and closing companies there, which is creating a serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to do research to find out if I am telling the truth, all he has to do is to get somebody to find out how many lorries from the South go to the North on any week with quarrying by-products.  He will find that there are few, probably none.  If the Minister looks around the Border counties, he will find that on every road he travels, he will meet these Northern lorries delivering that product in the South. There is a great difficulty there.  I am informed that one of the reasons for that is the cost of employment in the North <i>vis-a-vis</i> the cost of employment here.  A person who carried out the research told me a certain company found that a job cost them £22,000 while the cost of a job to a competitor in the North was £15,000, a huge difference. Of course, if that is the case, it is a huge imbalance.</P>
    <P>This also has implications for the way in which the Government will spend money in the Border counties.  Providing grant aid there in many cases, given the normal criteria, is not much use because people cannot come up with their own resources to match the grant. Their businesses are not solidly based at that stage because of the difficulties they face with competition.  We are at the coal face, so to speak.  The European Single Market is blowing a cold wind through some industrial sectors in the Border counties and the Government <Col N="478" /> should certainly take heed of that. The structure of grant aid available is not as efficient as it might be in other parts of the country in that people are not able to take it up.</P>
    <P>There is also the additionality factor where funds earmarked for the Border counties are in fact used as substitutes for Structural Funds.  More Structural Funding is spent elsewhere than in the Border corridor because other funding is available, the International Fund for Ireland, for example, and the INTERREG Programme.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal Project was put forward for support under the Structural Funds.  INTERREG 1 came on stream and immediately about £51 million was made available in the South. Some £18 million of that was immediately earmarked for the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  While it is a worthy project, more than one third of the INTERREG funding was put into it.  If the balance was right, some INTERREG funds should be used, but a predominance of the funding should have come from the Structural Funds. However, it did not.  That tends to happen because the other moneys are available but this should not be the case.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House this evening.  I did not have an opportunity to talk to him about this before the debate, but knowing the Minister, I know we will have a talk afterwards.  We will compare notes and see what can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who unfortunately cannot be here today, to make the following statement on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, the Minister wishes to assure the House that he shares the Senator's concern at the loss of jobs and the consequences for the local economy arising from the proposed closure at the end of November of the Cement Roadstone <Col N="479" /> quarry at Castleblayney, County Monaghan.  The CRH Group comprises the Roadstone Group and Irish Cement Ltd. and employs 2,500 people in Ireland.  The Castleblayney quarry is part of Roadstone Provinces Ltd., a division of the Roadstone Group employing over 600 people.  The quarry is involved in the extraction of hard stone, which is used for wearing courses, that is one of the top layers of roads, and as aggregate for use in roads and motorways.</P>
    <P>From inquiries made by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Minister understands that the reason for the closure is that the quarry has been exhausted of the quality material needed for its operation.  The company sought to find alternative sources but was unable to do so.  The closure will, unfortunately, result in the loss of 15 jobs directly and a number of other jobs indirectly.  The company hopes to maintain business in the area which will help to save some of the indirect jobs.  The House will, of course, appreciate that the decision is essentially a matter for the company involved.</P>
    <P>The quarrying and cement activities of the CRH Group are not eligible for grant assistance and the quarry at Castleblayney has not received any grants from Forbairt.  Adequate production capacity exists to supply the domestic market in this sector and the industry is not, in general, subject to international competition.  Grant assistance is only available for the manufacture of products which are exported in substantial quantities to markets outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands that the proposed closure will be fully discussed with union representatives at a meeting arranged for Tuesday, 8 November.  In addition, the company has agreed to meet Castleblayney Chamber of Commerce and the urban district council to <Col N="480" /> explore what can be done to minimise the effects of the closure.  Every effort will be made to minimise the impact of the closure on the workforce and the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>Forbairt has assured the Minister that Castleblayney will continue to be actively promoted by it for industrial development.  In this connection the Minister understands that in mid-September Forbairt-IDA Ireland attended a meeting with the Castleblayney Urban District Council to discuss job creation in Castleblayney, at which it was suggested that community groups should consider the provision of an advance factory in the town.  This would enhance its marketability and funds might be available from EU or International Fund for Ireland sources.</P>
    <P>I empathise with what Senator Cotter said.  I have just come back from a visit to Northern Ireland close to the area about which he spoke.  I saw yesterday at first hand the mobility of lorries across the frontier area with aggregate and other supplies.  Obviously, this can have an effect on competition, particularly local competition.  I will bring what he said to the attention of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and will ask him to renew, with Forbairt and the IDA, every effort to ensure that Castleblayney &mdash; and, indeed, the industrial area of County Monaghan &mdash; gets every support for industrial investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This Adjournment matter is possibly the oldest chestnut in the Seanad.  I have been raising it here since <Col N="481" /> 1991 and Senator Roche has also raised it in the past.  To be honest, I am a little bit fed up with getting, from various Ministers, the same reply which puts off the day we hope to benefit and provides no answer.  As the Minister will no doubt know, Greystones is still one of the fastest expanding areas of population south of Dublin.  It is a neglected town in north Wicklow, a fact partly due to its geography but more to the neglect of the town by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>The principal problem of neglect in this area is transport.  It was originally intended, in the 1970s, that the DART would run from Howth to Greystones but, for reasons now obscured by the passage of time, it only went as far as Bray.  That recognition was obviously an acknowledgement that there was a need for a commuter train, or transport of some sort, from Greystones to Dublin on a regular and frequent basis.  Unfortunately, despite the DART having been in operation for many years, that final objective has not been achieved.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that there are two schools of thought in Greystones about the DART.  There are those who want the DART <i>per se</i> and nothing less. There are also those who do not want the DART, but would like either a restoration of the shuttle between Bray and Greystones or a great improvement in the roads from Greystones to Dublin. Many people in Greystones worry that the DART would bring with it the criminal elements from Dublin which, to some extent, it has brought to Bray. Because of this it is thought that it might be better to facilitate people in Greystones with another form of transport, possibly a shuttle.</P>

    <P>However, there is absolutely no division about the fact that the transport service between Greystones and Dublin is inadequate.  I do not mind if, as an interim measure, the Minister wishes to say that the roads will be improved or the shuttle provided as and from tomorrow. <Col N="482" /> That would be an adequate, if only an interim, response.  However, in the present situation, in which there is so much doubt and in which we are waiting to see the final shape of the National Development Plan, the protests from the people of Greystones should at long last be responded to.  It is two years since the people of Greystones marched on Leinster House.  Senator Roche and I were present but, unfortunately, it failed to provoke a response from the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>We acknowledge that the DART is heavily subsidised, to the extent of £15 million <i>per annum</i> but if the Government insists on continuing to subsidise public transport, and if that is its policy, I do not see &mdash; within the parameters of that policy &mdash; why the people of Greystones should be victimised.  They have an undeniable case, in a non-commercial public transport environment, for being given this form of transport.  I have seen figures which indicate this is not a negative factor but would pay for itself.  I ask the Minister to reply with some good, positive and final news for a change.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Senator Ross, for so generously sharing his time with me.  I also welcome the Minister although it is a pity that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is not present.  Like Senator Ross, I am beginning to suffer from battle fatigue in this issue.  I first took up the cudgels for better public transport for Greystones as far back as 1978.  The extraordinary thing is that public transport into that town is now worse than it was then.  We are actually served with a shuttle using rolling stock which is older than most Members of this House and undoubtedly dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The road system into the town of Greystones is woefully inadequate and will cost endless millions to upgrade.  An adequate and proper public transport system into the town would be the best <Col N="483" /> long term solution, environmentally and economically.  The other reality, which Senator Ross touched on, is that for some reason which has never really been explained CIE, between the time of originating and implementing the plans for a DART service, decided to cut Greystones off.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk about quality bus routes, interchanges, and light rail systems in Dublin city but unless you can service the periphery you will still have traffic congestion all the way into the city.  The public transport case is well made and accepted by everybody. However, the situation in Greystones worries me greatly because, as I understand it, of the £220 million earmarked in the national plan for public transport improvements, about £20 million has been earmarked for peripheral improvements other than those on the light rail and quality bus services.  Many causes are looking for that £20 million.  I was very disturbed when the final report of the DTI came out to see that an interchange in Dublin city and an integrated ticketing system were now being given a higher priority than the DART to Greystones.  Either of those projects would soak up the bulk of the money and would leave Greystones without any improvement in public transport.</P>
    <P>I led a deputation to meet the Minister recently and I pointed out that the people in Greystones are not hung up on the DART <i>per se</i> but, as Senator Ross pointed out, want an adequate public transport system.</P>
    <P>The train service in Greystones is now operating at one tenth of what it was in 1971 when I moved to the town.  It is also extraordinary that when the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company was extended to Greystones it was faster, in those days, for commuters to travel to Dublin.  One hundred years later we have moved backwards instead of forwards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> There was great mirth in the nation yesterday at the inconvenience of a high-tech Iarnród Éireann train which ran out of steam, or puff, on the Cork-Dublin line, yet that is a daily event in Greystones.  We have actually had a three hour delay on a 40 minute service. The days of &ldquo;Are you right there. Michael, are you right?&rdquo; could be transferred from west Clare to Greystones.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross and other public representatives have asked for an end to this farce and injustice in terms of public transport for the people of Greystones. There is no indigenous industry, inadequate second level education and no third level education facilities there. People from Greystones must travel to Dublin to work or for education.  It would make sense and be a very prudent investment if the extension of the DART to Greystones was agreed or if, alternatively, Greystones was to get the kind of services which have been put into Maynooth.</P>
    <P>Of all the public transport projects put forward by the DTI, only one will have a positive return on investment which, unbelievably, is the DART extension to Greystones.  After 11 years of debate and lobbying, the only one which is back in question is that extension of the DART.  We will fund the inefficiency of our transport operator by installing a new integrated ticketing system and creating a new monolith in the Temple Bar area with a bus and train interchange.  I suggest to the Minister that it is time we had a final and positive decision on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am positive by nature and I always like to be as positive as possible.  However, there are parameters within which we must all operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the work of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, the National Development Plan included a strong <Col N="485" /> commitment to an improved public transport system for the greater Dublin area with a view to giving existing public transport users a new deal and making public transport attractive to motorists.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that the purpose of the DTI was to develop a long term transportation strategy which would gain the support of the various agencies involved in delivering transport services and the general public and which would be environmentally sensitive, user friendly and financially realistic.  The final DTI report, which has been referred to already, is the product of more than four years' detailed work and contains proposals for an integrated strategy involving a programme of investment in roads, public transport and traffic management complemented by improved enforcement.</P>
    <P>In the case of public transport, the DTI recommended a number of major investment projects, including the development of a light rail system for the city; the introduction of a quality bus network; improved interchange facilities for buses and other public transport and off street bus parking facilities in the city centre; the extension of the DART to Greystones and possibly to Malahide; provision of secure park and ride facilities on the public transport network and an integrated ticketing system for all public transport services.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan includes provision for an EU assisted investment programme of £220 million to enable substantial progress to be made on the implementation of the public transport elements of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  This funding includes provision for expenditure of up to £200 million in respect of the first phase of the light rail network for Dublin. The remaining £20 million has been included in the national plan for the other important public transport projects to which I referred earlier, including <Col N="486" /> the possible extension of the DART to Greystones.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the overall cost of these projects would exceed the level of funding available.  Accordingly, it is essential that the available expenditure is carefully allocated to the most effective projects in overall public transport terms.  In this context, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, asked CIE to undertake a detailed cost-benefit analysis of a number of future public transport options for the north Wicklow area, including a DART extension to Greystones. Pending the outcome of this work and further detailed analysis in relation to the other projects recommended by the DTI it is not possible to be more specific about the prospects for the implementation of an extension of the DART to Greystones.</P>
    <P>I reassure Senators, however, that we are fully aware of the concerns of the residents in Greystones regarding the extension of the DART to their town.  I listened with great interest to what they said.  I note that I have been here on a number of occasions at the request of both to answer this matter.  I will carry the information and the representations which they have made once again in this House on behalf of their people to my colleague and my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reassurance but I do not find it particularly reassuring.  Apart from that, the Minister might as well have come in here and said nothing or just have said no.  Perhaps he could answer a specific question and tell us when this cost-benefit analysis from CIE is liable to report and why it was not done before.</P>

      <P>I would be disappointed if my visit here to respond to these questions was of no benefit to the House.  I was impressed with both Senator's contributions.  If one positive element of the proposals which they put forward can be fully appraised in the report, that there would be a positive response from people justifying the <Col N="488" /> investment involved in the extension of the DART, then I hope that our collective contribution this evening will assist in producing a positive conclusion to this matter.</P>
