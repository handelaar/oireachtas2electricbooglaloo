      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to take urgent action to set up a population register which is a vital prerequisite to any breast screening programme.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>As all Senators are aware, Senator Hillery is leaving us for bigger and better things.  Next week he takes up his position in London as Director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development &mdash; I understand I will be receiving his letter of resignation from Seanad Éireann before then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly, today is his last Seanad sitting day.  I take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Hillery on his appointment and wish him well.  This is indeed an historic occasion as it is the first time there will be an Irish director on the <Col N="450" /> board of the EBRD.  As Senators know, the objective of the EBRD is to foster the ongoing transition to democracy and open market economies in central and eastern Europe, including the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Senator Hillery will, therefore, have the opportunity to continue his contribution to Irish industrial development in a real and practical manner.</P>
    <P>As a personal friend and colleague of Senator Hillery, I pay tribute to his outstanding contribution to politics during his years of service with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He was first elected to this House on the Labour Panel in 1977 and as the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Labour matters we have all been fortunate in having the benefit of his expertise in debates on employment and industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery left us for the period of the 26th Dáil, when in June 1989 he was elected to represent the Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown constituency.  He served as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment in 1992 and was a member of other Joint Committees, including the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  He has always been a committed Member of this House and to the democratic process.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery also has considerable banking and business experience and is currently Professor and head of the Department of Industrial Relations and Human Resource Management at the Graduate School of Business, UCD.  He studied at UCD, the University of Georgia and Oxford University.  He has also held positions with the ACC Bank and Citibank.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator's experience, both political and business, will be of great benefit to him and I wish him well in his new position.  The new post will be a demanding one but I have no doubt that Senator Hillery, with his usual calm competence will do Ireland proud.  I congratulate him and wish him well in his new role.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Seanad and the Fianna Fáil Party group I wish to <Col N="451" /> be associated with the congratulations to Senator Hillery on his appointment.  It is with some pleasure, if tinged with sadness, that he will be leaving the Seanad. He has been an outstanding and competent Senator and was involved in many of the debates in the House.  On each occasion he has given his views with great distinction on the issue of the day.  I am pleased for Senator Hillery and his family.  It is a great honour as he is the first Irish Director of this bank.  While his appointment is Ireland's loss, hopefully this most important position will be a gain for the country.  I am sorry we are losing Senator Hillery temporarily and hope he will maintain contact with us.  I wish him and his family every success for the future.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the kind of news that bears repetition.  I wish to be associated with the tributes which have been paid to Senator Hillery this morning.  I have known him as a friend and a colleague over a long period.  A great honour has been bestowed upon him and it provides him with a great opportunity to do good in many areas.</P>
      <P>I know Senator Hillery will bring to his new position those qualities, as the Cathaoirleach remarked, of calmness, competence, great courtesy and integrity, which have characterised all his activities, both here and in UCD over a long period.  It is with sincere feelings that I wish Senator Hillery well in his new position.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, and on my own behalf, I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to Senator Hillery.  I congratulate him and wish him well in his new appointment.  It is a most apt appointment for this, our first Director of the bank.  We are all aware of Senator Hillery's great knowledge and competence <Col N="452" /> and I have no doubt he will do us proud.  I wish him well and hope that this will not be his last day in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I also wish to be associated with the congratulations to Senator Hillery on his appointment as the first Irish Director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  I wish him well.  We are all aware of his great ability in the House and of his valued contributions on many topics over the years.  As one who jousted with him from time to time in the Dún Laoghaire/ Rathdown constituency, I know of his gentleness, sincerity and ability and of his commitment to the constituency.  As the Leader of the House remarked, there will be regret at Senator Hillery's departure from the House.  However, his appointment is a great honour for him and I wish him, Miriam and family every success.  If there is one silver cloud on the horizon it is that perhaps matters in Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown will be slightly easier with Senator Hillery out of the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish Senator Hillery, Miriam and the family well.  I am in a unique position to do so because many years ago I was a student of Senator Hillery's as an undergraduate and post graduate when undertaking my B. Comm. and, later, my MPA.  We then served in the area of <i>realpolitik</i> in the Commerce faculty in UCD.</P>
      <P>Senator Hillery is a man of grace with an extraordinary talent with people and I can attest to his great kindness to young people.  Senator Manning would agree with me when I say that he is legendary for lifting up the lame ducks and helping the young people with difficulties.  His door was always open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> While his departure is a great loss to this House we can take pride in the fact that Senator Hillery has achieved this important appointment at such an early age.  When I first met Senator Hillery I had a full crop of black hair which has now turned grey.  I wondered how Senator Hillery managed to keep not only his hair but to retain the colour of it.</P>

      <P>I join with the Cathaoirleach and other Members in congratulating a fellow Clare person, Senator Hillery, on his appointment.</P>
      <P>The name Hillery is distinguished in County Clare and has always carried honour and pride with it.  The people of County Clare are especially pleased and proud that Senator Hillery has been appointed to this prestigious position.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that he is a man of competence and keen intellect and we have no doubt that he will bring both to bear on his appointment.  I am sure that in years to come he will return to the Oireachtas.  I wish him, Miriam, who has always acted as an excellent ambassador when she travels with him and the family every success on this appointment.</P>

      <P>I join with the Cathaoirleach and others in congratulating Senator Hillery on his appointment.  Like Senator Roche I am in the unique position of having been elected to Seanad Éireann on the same day in 1977 as Senator Hillery.  We pursued our careers in the Seanad until Senator Hillery was elected to the Dáil.  I wish him every success.  A wonderful colleague he was most co-operative and it was a pleasure to work with him both in Seanad Éireann and in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  I know Senator Hillery will fill the new post with dignity.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to respond.  I wish to thank you and other <Col N="454" /> Members for the more than generous comments made and for the very good wishes extended to me in my new post.</P>
      <P>I especially appreciate the tributes which the Members on the Opposition benches paid me.  It is characteristic of the House.  I am glad to say that I formed friendships both on the Opposition benches and on this side of the House also.</P>
      <P>I thank my colleague from the Labour Party, the Leader of the House and the other speakers on this side of the House for their tributes.  I also thank in a special way you, a Chathaoirligh, and my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party for the support given during all the ups and downs in politics in the years I have been a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I was first elected in 1977 and I leave the House today with a feeling of sadness. I will miss all Members.  Nonetheless, I look forward to my new post, which provides me with the opportunity to do something worthwhile for Ireland and its people, and for the creation of jobs in Ireland, which is very dear to my heart. I am glad that several Irish firms and individuals have made investment arrangements in the 22 countries of central and eastern Europe within the bank's remit.  We have so much to offer in the advisory and consultancy areas in terms of skills and expertise.  As a director of the bank, I will have to wear a corporate hat for all the work that will come before the board.  It is entirely within my brief to bat for Ireland and promote Irish investment and consultancy opportunities within the commercial criteria of the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have greatly valued my membership of the House, for which I have a great affection, and the many friendships I made here.  Every Member has had a great deal to contribute.  There have been some outstanding contributions but every Member draws on talent and a great range of practical experience, which has enhanced the work of the House, including the legislation and motions discussed by it.  There is a constructive input by the House into the legislation and other work in which we are engaged.  Several Bills <Col N="455" /> have been initiated here and I hope this practice will continue.  The talent here offers further potential for contribution to the political process and I hope mechanisms will be devised to allow greater involvement by Members in legislative work.  As I bow out, I thank all those who spoke for the generous tributes they paid to me and the good wishes they conveyed to Miriam, my family and I.  I wish every Member, and those associated with the House, every happiness and success in the future.  I plan to keep in touch.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Items 1 and 2.  All remaining Stages of Item 1 will be taken.  There will be a sos between 1 p.m and 2 p.m.  During the day the Whips can meet to discuss the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business.  Anyone who saw the news on television last evening will never forget the anguish of Mrs. Margaret Browne on hearing the news of the murder of her husband.  It was heartrending, uncomprehending, baffled anguish from a woman whose husband had been cold bloodily murdered for no other reason than that he was a Protestant. Yesterday we condemned the murder of people because they were Catholics. Since then two innocent, good people have been murdered because they were Protestants.  Our condemnation and heart felt sympathy must go to their families and to the families of the nine victims of the past nine days.  It is incomprehensible to us that 100 miles from here these barbaric, meaningless killings, which are without rhyme or reason, are taking place daily.  None of us knows what can be done to bring the killing to an end.  All we can do is send our sympathy to the families of the victims, little as it is worth, and hope the spirit, generosity and hope behind the Downing Street Joint Declaration will, even at this late stage, begin to make some impact on <Col N="456" /> the hearts and minds of those behind this long litany of senseless killing.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the prediction made by Senator O'Kennedy yesterday has been proved right in that in the 24 hours since we met, and he spoke, more people have been killed.  The House condemns out of hand what is happening in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1994: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 25 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25(3) outlines the titles of chairmen of local authorities. From now on the chairman and vice-chairman of an authority shall be known as the cathaoirleach and the leas-chathaoirleach respectively.  I am pleased the Minister has included this because Irish is our first language.  I have always believed we should use Irish forms as often as possible.  This is a modest step. Members of local authorities are now legally obliged to refer to their chairman and vice-chairman as cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides that the cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach of Dublin City Council and Cork City Council shall be known as the Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor respectively of their cities. The cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach of any other city council or borough shall be known as the mayor or deputy mayor of that city or borough.  All of this may sound colonial but I am a great believer in tradition, as is the Minister.  I am glad this has been included because it retains a sense of our history, whether it was a pleasant or unpleasant part of it. The media does not seem to be aware of the correct references to mayors and lord mayors.  We constantly hear references to lord mayors of boroughs, even though <Col N="457" /> these authorities have mayors.  There are only two lords mayor in this State, the Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Lord Mayor of Cork; Belfast also has a Lord Mayor.</P>
    <P>I understand from some of the Minister's officials that the Lord Mayor is entitled to be referred to as the Right Honourable Lord Mayor, which is a distinction not given to the Lord Mayor of Cork.  The chairmen of borough and county councils used to be known by a variety of titles.  In Senator Honan's county town the mayor was known as the <i>burgermeister</i>.  It was the only town which used this title which is embedded in history and, perhaps, comes from the Huguenots and the Palatinates, who settled there.  In County Kildare the title of sovereign was used.  It is a pity some titles have passed into history but, fortunately, some have been retained.  People may feel such titles are part of our colonial past and that reference should not be made to them.  They are important as they are an intrinsic part of what we are. I am pleased the Minister has insisted that chairmen and vice-chairmen, other than mayors and lord mayors, be referred to as cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach and that he has provided legal recognition of the titles of lord mayor and mayor in our towns and boroughs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>At its last meeting, Laois County Council was given a report by its Irish language officer, which suggested ways and means by which the council could increase the awareness and use of Irish throughout the county.  It suggested that in future we refer to the chairman and vice-chairman as cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the benefit of using the title of cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach to refer to the chairman and vice-chairman of a local authority, not least because it means we do not have to use politically correct language. Senator Mooney made the point that some of the titles in the ancient charters are quite extraordinary and reflect our <Col N="458" /> history, not our colonial past.  It is a pity that they are being left behind.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach and the mayor and deputy mayor in the case of the cities should have a real role.  I made the point in the Minister's absence yesterday that far too much power has been transferred to county managers.  The positions of cathaoirleach, leas-chathaoirleach, mayor and deputy mayor should be developed to the position of full-time elected officials to counter balance the entirely dead hand effect of the managerial system of local government.  This balance is achieved in continental Europe.  I know the Minister is anxious to achieve this very fine balance between efficiency, which comes from full-time appointed officials, and democracy which can only come from representatives with the imprimatur of the electorate.  I know that you, a Chathaoirligh, have also views on that.</P>
      <P>What we are doing here is very welcome but in addition to changing titles we should also be doing something to counter balance what I regard as a very pernicious influence in local government.</P>

In my county of Galway, where we conduct a great deal of our business through the medium of Irish, glaotar cathaoirleach agus leas-chathaoirleach i gcónaí ar an duine a bhíonn san chathaoir.  Nuair a bhíonn muid ag votáil, deireann muid ar a shon agus in aghaidh.  Tá a lán Gaeilge in úsáid agus cuireann mé fáilte mhór roimh an giota seo den Bille.

Every assistance we can give, as public representatives, to the promotion and development of the Irish language is welcome and fitting.  I commend the Minister on this.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí uile a labhair i bhfábhar na hathruithe atá curtha síos san Bille seo i dtaobh ainmneacha sna húdaráis uile.  I am <Col N="459" /> delighted that this change has been welcomed. However, I wish to say to those who are anxious to retain some of the old names that there are a number which they, perhaps, might not like to retain, including that of bailiff.  I understand the thinking behind accommodating tradition and history; understanding and using it; not being totally tied to it and allowing it to become part of the new Ireland.</P>
      <P>The commission which will be established and work for the next year in consultation with local authorities, may reserve its position as to what other changes should be made with local input to give different areas appropriate names.  I will be quite flexible about that.  We are all on reasonably safe ground in what we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The General Council of County Council's submission on this Bill has often been referred to over the past few days and great credence has been placed in it.  That body, which painstakingly examined every aspect of this Bill, is opposed to this section.</P>
      <P>The Minister is showing a great lack of confidence in the foot soldiers of local democracy, the county councillors of Ireland, the poor relation in the Irish political system, the men and women who take the flak at grassroots level.  They are on call seven days a week.  Ministers, TDs and Senators can escape when they spend two to four days in Dublin on parliamentary business but councillors are always on call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> There has been much talk about the devolution of power, better conditions for councillors, giving them more power and letting them become masters of their own destiny but are we serious about them?  Is the Minister serious?  This Bill does not indicate a serious intent.  On the contrary, it is a further erosion of councillors' rights.  The Minister is attempting to impose his will on county council meetings, fix the agenda and set the rules.  There is a touch of the headmaster about this approach; the lads and lassies can do it their way but, at the end of the day, the Minister has the final say.</P>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils is concerned about Part V which is extremely undemocratic and exposes local authorities to severe over prescription by the Minister in every respect relating to meetings and procedures.  It must be removed if local democracy is to survive.  One need only glance at the amount of detail in it to come to this conclusion.</P>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils acknowledges and has consistently argued in favour of a consolidation of local government Acts, including the law on local authority meetings and procedures. Although presented as part of this consolidation process, Part V is more concerned with giving the Minister additional draconian powers over local authorities under which he can regulate their affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be in a position to decide what matters may be discussed or considered by local authorities if this Part is passed.  We must remember that local authorities are comprised of democratically elected representatives of the people and they should be free to act in the general interest of their communities without the severe restrictions provided for in Part V.</P>
    <P>My party is opposed to this provision. Many councillors are very dissatisfied with the Minister's recent decision on meetings and the implementation of this provision would further aggravate the situation. I appeal to the Minister to look at it again in the interests of harmony and to avoid disquiet in the rank and file.  It <Col N="461" /> is an unwanted intrusion into the affairs of local authorities and further gags and limits the work of county councillors.</P>
    <P>Councillors should set their own agenda and procedures.  They are people of great integrity who carry the can for the Members of the Oireachtas.  We should give them the recognition they deserve.  The Minister should reconsider this provision and have it deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a total misunderstanding by the General Council of County Councils and a number of Senators about this provision.  As a former Senator, I can understand why Members of this House from time to time would like to endorse the wishes of that body.  However, in this case it would be extremely unwise.  The General Council of County Councils in its circular to Senators is going totally against what it asked me to do.  The 1992 review group of the municipal authorities, the General Council of County Councils and the managers described the law on local authority meetings as antiquated, unclear and scattered over many enactments and should be updated in consolidated form.</P>
      <P>Some of the local government legislation dates back 150 years.  It is scattered over many enactments and is very inconsistent, complex and difficult to understand. As far back as 1971 the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation referred to the unsatisfactory state of the law and recommended that regulations should be introduced to change it.  The Barrington Committee said it was fragmented and confusing and should be updated.  All the specialist groups, including the General Council of County Councils, have asked Ministers for 20 years to do something about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 30 proposes to produce one set of regulations of the law on local authority meetings in a convenient and accessible format for the benefit of councillors, officials and the public.  In the process I would hope for the first time to establish in law a right of the public to have access to meetings, to remove anomalies, to clarify procedures, to increase public awareness and promote greater <Col N="462" /> public interest as well as giving a commitment to this House to have consultation with local authorities on how to devise these regulations.</P>
    <P>Our laws do not provide for the public to attend local authority meetings and I am being accused of doing something draconian because I propose to change that law.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the General Council of County Councils seeking their views following the publication of the 1992 report. They referred only to the inadequacies of funding for local authorities but did not make suggestions with regard to this aspect of the law.  I look forward to having consultations with the local authorities on this matter.  There are a number of aspects of local government law in great need of reform.  Under the present antiquated law some authorities are required to hold what are known as quarterly meetings.  I do not know what relevance quarterly meetings had 150 years ago but, as most Members know, local authorities meet every month so the requirement in law to have quarterly meetings should be removed.  On the question of summons and agenda, some of the old law requires a notice to be fixed on the town hall door.  Is it being suggested that I should not change that? I am asked to leave that unchanged.</P>
    <P>On the question of the public having the right to attend public meetings, this is a democracy and I know of no other country where the public do not have the right of access to local authority meetings unless the council agrees to receive a deputation.  That is antiquated and Senators should not misunderstand it.  It is not a question of the Minister getting involved in what is to be discussed at local authority meetings.  Senators are surely not serious in thinking that I, or any other Minister wants to be involved in the items placed on an agenda.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that the regulations will provide for local authorities giving sufficient notice of a meeting and for the agenda stating what is to be considered. There will be no draconian provisions in the regulations as has been alleged.  The regulations will be of benefit to the <Col N="463" /> public, to officials and, most of all, to members of local authorities.  They will not be heavy handed and will allow full discretion to local authorities as to the place, date, time and agenda of their meetings.</P>
    <P>At present some local authorities are prohibited from holding meetings outside their functional areas while others are not.  There may be ceremonial occasions when they would wish to do that and I am making the provision flexible so that can happen.  It is illegal at present for local authorities to hold meetings on a licensed premises.  Members are aware that they have been held in such premises but that broke the law.  Is the Minister for the Environment not supposed to change that.</P>

      <P>The Minister's argument on consolidation would be valid, if this were a consolidation Bill repealing every aspect of local authority legislation.  It is not.  The Bill does not do what the General Council of County <Col N="464" /> Councils requested, consolidate the variety of legislation which currently governs local authority affairs.  That argument does not stand either.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the right of the public to attend meetings.  I have been a member of a local authority for 15 years and never once during that time have the public been prevented from attending a meeting of that authority.  Section 30 (2) (q) is the only provision that refers to the &ldquo;attendance of persons other than members of the relevant local authority&rdquo;. What about subsection (2) (a) which refers to &ldquo;annual meetings, estimates meetings, ordinary meetings, special or other specified meetings&rdquo; and empowers the Minister to make regulations on those meetings?  The subsequent subsections empower the Minister to make regulations on the &ldquo;business of meetings; place date and time of meetings; notice of meetings; summons and agenda; quorum; and failure to hold a meeting&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is dictatorial legislation and this section is a vote of no confidence by the Minister in local authorities, their members and the standing of those members within their communities. Members of local authorities are competent and capable of drafting their own standing orders, of abiding by them, calling their meetings and managing their own affairs.  For the Minister to introduce legislation that will empower him to manage the day-to-day affairs of the local authority is completely unacceptable.  I was astounded to read this section and could not believe that any Minister for the Environment, particularly one who for many years was a member of a local authority, could include such a provision in a local government Bill.  It is totally unacceptable.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw all the subsections of section 30.</P>
      <P>On the attendance of persons other than members of relevant local authorities, I would like to know what local authorities are referred to, and when and how they prevented members of the public from attending.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> What Senator Taylor-Quinn said did not make sense.  The law is deficient regarding the attendance of the public at local authority meetings.  No councillor, town commissioner or urban councillor would defend that or would wish that it be so.  However, it is one of the many deficiencies in the law.</P>
    <P>Many years ago Judge Gavin Duffy delivered a judgment in which he referred to the law on local authorities as a tangled web, a jungle and a confusion. That is exactly the case.  Senator Taylor-Quinn said that this is not a consolidation Bill.  That is true: it is enabling legislation. However, from page 49 to page 56 of the Bill there is a list of Acts which are affected by this legislation.</P>
    <P>I can offer the House another example. Recently I, and a number of councillors in Wicklow &mdash; from other parties and from none &mdash; were seeking information. In frustration we &mdash; all councillors &mdash; tabled a section 2 motion under the 1955 Act in order that we, on behalf of the people we represent, could discover the information.  Our manager took legal advice and decided that the motion could go to the bottom of the agenda.  All Senators realise that if a Senator's quota of motions on the agenda is filled it might take months, even a year, before an important motion is discussed.  Under the law the elected representatives of the people of Wicklow did not have the right to direct under an Act passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful in this regard. Obviously, nobody in their right mind would want to prescribe the way local authorities do their business.  However, we should ensure that the law reflects the good practices that exist in councils. Senator Taylor-Quinn is correct in saying that no council would ban the public from its meetings.  Under the law, however, the public does not have the right to attend such meetings.  If we look for information, as in the situation I outlined, we do not have the right to direct that certain things be done because even section 2 of the 1955 Act which is intended to give members specific rights can be circumvented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> I have had experience of the requirement to tag a notice to a door.  I was involved in the establishment of Greystones Town Commission in 1984. When we looked at the Lighting of Towns Act, 1828, which governs that practice we discovered that we had to seek a door to which we could tag the notice.  We had to ask the priest for permission to tag a notice on his door.  Is there anything as ludicrous as that?  The law on these matters goes back to the 12th century.  Most of the legislation dates from the early years of the 19th century or the latter part of the 18th century.  There is a need for legal change in this area.</P>
    <P>As Senators we are anxious to look after the interests of our constituents who are the councillors who elect us. However, we must have a balanced approach and not suggest that the Minister's legislation is draconian or over the top.  It is evidently sensible.  He is trying to make legislative sense of what is a tangled web, a jungle and a confusion. He wants to put the legal powers of the council in a handbook.  It would be misleading and a bad representation of local government to go over the top on this issue.  Part V of the Bill, particularly if it is applied in the spirit anticipated by the Minister, is not a threat to local government. It brings clarity where there is confusion. We should not lose sight of the intent and effect of the section.</P>
    <P>I could continue to debate this subject. For a number of years I have studied the idiosyncrasies of the law relating to the powers of councillors.  Believe me, the powers of the councillor &mdash; I am a champion of councillor's powers because I passionately believe in local government &mdash; are constrained not least&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is welcome that these requirements are to be removed.  There were a number of loopholes.  In other areas, however, the Minister is taking power from local authority members. Our council, for example, has standing orders which regulate the business of the council.  They are the chairman's reference book regarding the holding of meetings and other matters.  If a deputation wishes to address the council notice must be given one month in advance.  The deputation can then address the meeting on whatever issue concerns it.  Can that arrangement continue under this section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. However, the Minister, in his efforts to be seen to give easier access to the public to address and attend meetings, has also, to a certain extent, taken away the power of the council to carry out its business in what it believes to be an orderly fashion. <Col N="469" /> I await the Minister's comments on that aspect.</P>

      <P>I will clarify the view of the General Council of County Councils. That body acknowledges and has consistently argued in favour of a consolidation of the law on local government. This Bill, although presented as part of the consolidation process, is more concerned with giving the Minister additional powers and can only be described as draconian.  He will be able to regulate all aspects of local authority affairs and to prescribe what matters may and may not be discussed or considered by local authorities.  This section is opposed to local democracy.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are comprised of democratically elected representatives of the people and must be free to act in the general interests of their communities without the severe restrictions provided for in this section.  Senator Roche has strongly defended this measure but it is difficult to see how any councillor from either side of the House could support it.  This section will gag councillors and interfere with their democratic right to set their own agenda.  I cannot see how Members on the Government side can subscribe to the section and I appeal to the Minister to delete it; he has been reasonable with councillors in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified the intent of this section because local authority members feared this was an attempt to run the business of councils from the Custom House.  Within my party I have always argued for greater autonomy for local authorities.  I was not aware during my previous membership of Dublin County Council and my current membership of Fingal County Council that my fellow councillors and I were breaking the laws, although we have carried <Col N="470" /> on our business in a correct fashion. We have always adhered to the principles as set out in this section; we have orderly meetings, standing orders and access for the public.</P>
      <P>However, I found it difficult as a local authority member to gain access to the housing department with a constituent. The management of that section fought me at every step and I had to get the consent of the members to achieve access.  If this is an attempt to make local government more democratic and open to the public I welcome it.</P>
      <P>The regulations on estimates meetings may not be covered in this section but perhaps the Minister can answer a query. Whatever complaints the General Council of County Councils and individual councillors may have about the conduct of meetings, there is absolute agreement that the method and the format by which estimates are presented to members is not helpful.  The estimates are presented in the manner in which they have to be presented under the law.  If it is possible under this section, I ask the Minister to change the existing provision to simplify the way the estimates are presented. Control and power is only available to local authority members if they are aware of the authority's financial position.</P>
      <P>I have been a local authority member since 1985 which is not as long as other Members present.  Every year we were told the council would be abolished because of its dire financial straits.  Last year Dublin County Council was abolished, not because an estimate was not agreed but because it split into three councils.</P>
      <P>Unless members have control of the financial running of the council they have no control.  All our aspirations for local government mean nothing if the manager can submit a one line report saying work cannot be done because there is not enough money.  If members do not know what money is available they cannot argue the case.  Whatever regulation the Minister brings forward, I ask him to change the way the book of estimates is presented to the members.</P>

      <P>Everyone in the House agrees with the Minister that consolidation of local authority legislation is badly needed.  We also accept the public should not be prevented from attending local authority meetings.  Where we differ is that we believe the powers given to the Minister under this section could be used in a heavy handed way.</P>
      <P>The Minister is speaking for himself but he may not always occupy his current position.  He may move on to greater things.  The Minister for the Environment will have too many powers and he will be taking them from local authority members, who are most concerned about this.  Senator Roche spoke about the lack of information he received as a councillor in Wicklow and the lack of any legal basis for obtaining that information.  All of us would agree with him but we are not arguing about that.  Our difficulty with this section is that it gives the Minister too much power.  Some Senators on the Government side made this point yesterday.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by Senator McGennis is dealt with in the estimates sections of the Bill, sections 44 to 46.  That provision seems to indicate the Minister will decide or could decide what estimates will be adopted.  We will deal with that when the time comes.  I support what has been said by Fine Gael Members.  Senators on the other side appeared to have doubts about this also.</P>

      <P>The Bill empowers the Minister, not the people. The unfortunate position under this section is that the Minister will be empowered to manage and control the day to day affairs of local authorities, even the operation of their meetings.  It is not entirely honest to suggest otherwise and we can read the Bill before us.  The only subparagraph of any relevance is section 30 (2) (q); every other provision in the section is completely unacceptable. It is extraordinary that the Minister has presented this to us.</P>
      <P>What was the thinking behind this measure?  As many speakers have said, we as local authority members are quite capable of introducing standing orders and operating our business.  We do not need legislation from the Oireachtas to enable the Minister to dictate from the Department of the Environment when we should hold our meetings, what we should have on the agenda, the time they should be held, and the details of those meetings.  As a former member of a local authority, the Minister must recognise that this section is unacceptable.  Many speakers on the other side of the House disagree with this section.  As members of local authorities, I sympathise with them in attempting to defend the Bill.</P>

    <P>Disorderly conduct is a problem in councils, as Senator McGennis said, and the powers of councils to handle it are constrained and limited because the law is confused.  I illustrated this by reference to pinning notices on doors, to Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy's judgment on it and to the difficulties getting information, which councillors throughout the country complain about.  The confusion in the law is exploited by management, which has a vested interest in keeping councillors in <Col N="474" /> the dark.  I accept the sincerity of Senator Taylor-Quinn's submission.

These deal with law in relation to meetings.  &ldquo;Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847 [repealing] Sections 132, 133, 135, 142, 143, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207 and 208.&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854&rdquo;, repealing approximately 20 sections; the &ldquo;Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878&rdquo;, repealing approximately another 20 sections; the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898&rdquo;, repealing the sections referred to; the &ldquo;Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1902&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The legislation we are now debating will provide for the best regulations to help councils to do a better job for the people.  We do not want to use legal opinion and advisers to adjudicate on simple problems and ask the public to pay for it.

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 26, after line 41, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  (a) Where two local authorities are empowered to provide amenities, facilities, etc. under this section or section 6 of the Act of 1991 the principle of subsidiarity shall apply in relation to which local authority shall provide the amenity, facility, etc.</P>
      <P>(b)  In the case of any dispute arising under this section between any two local authorities, the said dispute shall be resolved by independent Commissioners appointed by Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the devolution of power to the lowest possible level at which a service can most effectively and efficiently be administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seems to be based on the premise that there will be disputes between local authorities where powers are vested concurrently in different local authorities.  I would prefer to rely on good common sense.  All local authorities in a county have the same manager.  The provisions in section 7 of the Local Government Act, 1991, require local authorities in performing their functions to have regard to the need for cooperation with and the co-ordination of its activities with those of other local authorities and the need for consultation with other local authorities.  The powers of general competence conferred by section 6 of the 1991 Act apply to all local authorities, but this matter has not given rise to difficulty.  I am confident that county and town local authorities are well capable of making any necessary arrangements for the performance and allocations of functions between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more general note, the question of the relationship between the different classes of town and local authority at county level is one of the specific matters <Col N="478" /> which the reorganisation committee is required to consider and make recommendations on.  At this stage I am not disposed to impose any requirements in this area.  The question of the appropriate role and functions for town authorities and the relationship with county level is one for the reorganisation committee.</P>
    <P>As regards boundary changes, they may not all be perfect.  These changes had to be made within a tight time frame. I was surprised that of the 62 local authorities whose boundaries were extended, there was local agreement in 57 cases.  It highlights the good sense at local level in deciding these matters.  Although all these changes are not perfect, they demonstrate terrific commitment on the part of elected members on both sides to try to reach agreement.  Other matters relating to that will be resolved by the boundary commission.  The reorganisation committee will do a different job and will need to use the consultative process to solve some of these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not want &mdash; this also relates to the last section where there was misunderstanding &mdash; to bring the Minister or ministerial consent one inch further than what is essential in these matters.  That is why I want these matters decided at local level.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the outstanding initiative taken by the Minister in providing an extra £2 million to the public library service.  He will be aware through his dealings with me that I act as a liaison between the Library Association of Ireland and the Minister.  The House may be aware that I am here as a nominee of the Library Association of Ireland.  The association and its component parts <Col N="479" /> enthusiastically welcome the initiatives which have been taken by the Minister for the Environment in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are a number of problem areas which the Minister is aware of.  However, it would be remiss of me not to mention them on Committee Stage.  Section 33 (1) states that &ldquo;a library authority may take such measures&rdquo;.  The association is of the opinion that this should be more statutorily based and that the library authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; take such measures.  The reason is that in a many cases &mdash; I confess that in my experience this is dwindling &mdash; local councils due primarily to financial constraints tend to push library services down the list.  The Minister introduced this financial initiative because book funds were low.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us why he did not provide in this section a statutory obligation on library authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section.  While I do not want to be contentious, I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.  Library services in our respective local authorities are important. There are many libraries in the four Dublin council areas and the boundary areas of Wicklow, Meath and Kildare which may link up and transfer books.  I noted what Senator Mooney said about the provision for book funds and the development of libraries.  Libraries in County Dublin provide people with access to facilities and items, including books, research materials and videos which they would not otherwise be able to avail of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that provision should be made for the library service.  When my local authority discusses its estimates, often the book fund is slashed.  While we accept cuts must be made, libraries are a local authority service which many people benefit from. I ask the Minister to ensure that libraries are developed and given facilities.  Communication between libraries in different local authority areas is important.  There should be a good <i>esprit de corps</i> between libraries, particularly when one library <Col N="480" /> has facilities to research a certain topic. As the Minister has said, there is not a bottomless pit of funds.  We appreciate that, but I ask him for a commitment that his Department, through the local authorities, will recognise the work of managers and librarians.  Many people, young and old, will benefit if basic library facilities are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment librarians throughout the country, particularly those in County Cork where I am a member of the library committee.  I ask the Minister to see if the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education could liaise more closely in relation to library facilities which would overlap into primary and post primary schools.  The two schemes are operating separately and it would be in the interest of the library service and pupils in our schools if the they could be made more cohesive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>Books are to the mind what exercise is to the body.  The mind is the only place where something fragile cannot be broken or where the most explosive idea cannot explode in one's face.  I am delighted with the support for the provisions of the Bill updating the law relating to libraries.  I refer to a problem which I saw as greater than all others in relation to the library service &mdash; the way in which book stocks had been run down. The sum of £2 million is being provided for stocking.  This allocation has been welcomed by Comhairle Leabharlann, librarians and public representatives. There have been a number of good developments in the library service, a multi-faceted service now in the way in which it serves the community.  I am very grateful to the librarians and local authorities throughout the country who have worked hard to deliver a good service.  I admire the architecture of the new libraries and also the way in which libraries have extended their services and brought the mobile services to remote areas.  I welcome the link with ENFO on environmental matters.  The question of supporting the educational system is <Col N="481" /> something we have to continue to work on, we need to improve that link all the time.  We all welcome the fact that so many librarians are involved in local historical, architectural and cultural activities and in developing the library as a local asset and as an asset for tourism.</P>
      <P>Regarding the words &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; in legislation, activists always want to see the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, which means that no matter what the circumstances, it must be done.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives some discretion if there is an extraordinary situation.  I give a commitment to the House, which I have demonstrated in this Bill, that I want to see this area revamped and supported both in regard to capital and revenue.</P>
      <P>In regard to Dublin there have been a number of major developments.  There are a number of other proposals which I accept are waiting for sanction and I will try and deliver on those as soon as resources permit.</P>

I do not in any way wish to tie the Minister's hands on this.  I appreciate that he has a very wide net to cast in relation to An Comhairle Leabharlanna and also to any other appointments within his brief but because of the specialised knowledge of librarians, which has been acknowledged by the Minister and other contributors, I ask him to give serious consideration to appointing a representative of the practising librarians to An Comhairle Leabharlanna.</P>

Over the years the General Council of County Councils has made three appointments, which are renewed every three years, to the Comhairle Leabharlanna.

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 29, subsection (1), line 34, to delete&rdquo;, subject to subsection 8,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the powers the Minister is giving to local authorities to make by-laws in relation to matters of public interest and for the common good.  I was delighted to be involved as a representative of the General Council of County Councils with a group set up by the Minister which made very specific proposals on by-laws and the functions of county councils in 1992.  That group worked very well and I commend my fellow members of the group, some of whom are present.</P>
      <P>However, all the good done by the Minister is undone in sections 8 and 9 of the Bill in clawing back some of the aforementioned powers.  This is totally unnecessary and the amendments we have put forward in this regard, to delete sections 8 and 9, is very sensible.  It would put the Minister in a very good light and he would receive the gratitude of the councils and councillors of Ireland if these two sections were removed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 29, subsection (2) (a), lines 39 and 40, to delete &ldquo;and subsection (8)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is a sensible proposal.  I hope the Minister will relent and accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A central feature of the by-law provisions of the Bill is the departure from the present position where all by-laws require ministerial confirmation. This will no longer be the case. What is proposed is quite novel in Irish law and there are some, no doubt, who would argue against it.  The local authority will decide if by-laws are necessary. It will draw them up.  The local authority will have an opportunity to invite submissions. These will be considered and then the elected members may make the by-law subject to any modifications felt necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> Senator McDonagh's amendment proposed the deletion of subsections (8) and (9) of section 37 which are part of the new framework for by-laws being introduced by the Bill.  Section 37(9) sets out a procedure to allow for steps to be taken to deal with a case where a by-law has given rise to serious difficulties.  First, it must be considered objectionable by the relevant Minister.  He must notify the local authority in writing and it is only where there is a failure to act by the local authority that the Minister can make an order in respect of the by-law.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) allows the relevant Minister to declare certain matters not to come within the scope of the local by-laws. For example, should by-laws be seen to be unreasonable in the national interest as regards some aspect of the agricultural sector, these provisions of the Bill would allow appropriate steps to be taken.  They are simply fallback procedures for use in exceptional circumstances. They must be viewed against the present position where each and every by-law requires ministerial confirmation.</P>
    <P>I fear there is some misunderstanding on this because I regard very highly the submission made by the review committee and as Senators know I endorsed all those recommendations.  I am not involved in the by-laws.  The local authorities will decide whether they are necessary and draw them up.</P>
    <P>I want to give Members some advice. In quite a number of the 37 areas in which since I became Minister for the Environment I have taken away the requirement for ministerial consent and given total autonomy to local authorities, I have been surprised by the number of deputations asking me to change what was decided at local level.  For one reason or another problems can arise.  Senators know what happens in this House and in the other House.  The Minister is asked to intervene and solve the problem.  This is a fallback provision, only to be used sparingly.</P>

      <P>In page 31, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  The power of a local authority to make a by-law under this section shall include the power to make by-laws in respect of users of rivers and lakes in its functional area.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> I do not understand which authority has the power to regulate our rivers and lakes and users of them &mdash; fishermen, swimmers, people using boats or water-skiing. There has been some controversy recently, particularly in the midlands, in relation to the use of speedboats and water-skiing on some lakes.  Is this a matter in which the local authority will have the power to make a by-law under this section?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 35, subsection (2), line 46, after &ldquo;requirement,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and where an independent commission or tribunal has determined that the local authority has acted unreasonably and had the means to act reasonably&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the power to remove democratically elected members of local authorities for adopting insufficient rates.  A number of factors should be borne in mind.  Local authority members are chosen by the people and they have a legitimate mandate to act on behalf of the people.</P>
      <P>Local authority members have not operated in an ideal financial arrangement &mdash; we are all clear on that.  Members have not got themselves into the financial difficulties that have arisen from time to time.  These financial problems have been created by successive Governments and Ministers over the years in not adequately funding local authorities. Matters have never been worse than at present, and the moneys are simply not coming from the Exchequer to the local authorities.  The current environment is characterised by a lack of resources to carry out necessary functions and to provide services.</P>
      <P>It is unfitting and unfair that a Minister can arbitrarily remove elected members from office without independent arbitration. There are two sides to the story. It is not usually the fault of members that these difficulties arise as they are forced to act in a certain manner and it would not arise if adequate funds were made available.  We should tackle the problem, not the system.  Hence my amendment, which is fair and which I hope the Minister will accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this provision was made over 50 years ago, there have been approximately 6,000 estimates meetings held around the country by the 89 local authorities.  On only four occasions was the power exercised.  In percentage terms <Col N="488" /> the vast majority of local authorities have been able to do their business within whatever constraints prevailed.</P>
      <P>During the debate here on Second Stage, Members expressed strong views about the funding of local authorities.  It is important to realise that there has never been a time in the history of local authorities where their range of options and activities was so wide.  They are involved in the housing sector, in shared housing, new construction, acquisition, bathroom schemes, remedial schemes, window schemes.  There is no parallel in our history for that range of activities in housing.</P>
      <P>On major road development, the bypasses for example, the skills of the local authority have been demonstrated around the country.  There has been no parallel for that.  In relation to county roads, an issue that has been raised here time and again, this year the expenditure of local authorities will exceed that at any other time in their history.  It will be £160 million.  I admit that we have some deplorable county roads which are unacceptable to me, the Members and to the local authorities.  We have had 39 inches of rain since 1 December, 1993; normally, we get 50 inches of rain in a year. Local authorities tell me that they got about 14 fine days this year.  People engaged in farming and working on the bogs know how inclement the weather has been and how difficult it has been for the local authorities to do their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resources are there and in the next two weeks I will be announcing the funding of £33 million, which is co-financed by Europe, to help the local authorities to face up to those problems.  I have also said on a number of occasions that I do not want to see repeated filling of potholes in wet weather.  It is extraordinary that I am often attacked by Opposition parties who, in the Dáil, voted against the provisions which gave me the extra £26 million to give to local authorities this year for the county roads. They have gone to local meetings suggesting that they would spend more, having voted in the other House against the provisions which gave me the extra <Col N="489" /> £26 million.  I know there is a problem that cannot be solved overnight.  As Minister for the Environment, I am committed to provide up to £1 billion, between European, local and national funds, in the next six years.  If I could be satisfied that the money was being spent on a more efficient basis and that we were getting a longer and more permanent structural answer to this problem, as distinct from patchwork activities, I would go further and commit additional taxation resources for that purpose.  It is a matter of regret to me that in the last five years, some £120 million has been spent on filling potholes because everybody knows they have had to be filled again and again.  Therefore, a greater effort must be made to solve this problem by dealing with the foundations and drainage with more modern systems.  Money is one of the answers.  I am already delivering on that and will allocate more. Indeed, I have successfully fought a battle in Europe to give local authorities more powers.  However, it is unfair for both Houses to criticise me for providing an extra £26 million this year having voted against provisions that would have given me additional funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I welcome the Minister's statements. I know the Minister was not trying to score political points, but it is beyond comprehension that members of local authorities would have voted against an extra allocation of money purely for narrow party political reasons.  When money was allocated from the Minister's Department, road draft plans were voted down or opposed in some cases by local authorities resulting in people being denied the opportunity to repair these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's successful fight in Europe for additional funding has not been publicly acknowledged.  Some have argued that we, as a sovereign independent nation, have the right to decide where this EU funding should go.  We do not have that right.  The Minister had to fight for that money and has at least managed to get a portion of it.  A county <Col N="490" /> engineer, who shall remain anonymous &mdash; not from my county &mdash; suggested to me that because of the basic structural difficulties facing our county and regional road networks, the Minister might, in his ongoing discussions with the EU &mdash; it may not fit in with the National Development Plan &mdash; defer major works on bypasses until the county and regional road network was put back on the sound footing it held a few years ago.  It may not sound practical, but since it came from a county engineer, it seems an attractive idea.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for only three years, but have found it difficult to adequately answer and address the estimates when they are presented.  Can the Minister do anything &mdash; this may seem ironic in the context of calls for devolution of powers &mdash; to help support councillors at local level who do not have the expertise available to the Executive?  When estimates are debated and accepted inevitably there is over-expenditure later on &mdash; the Minister, who was a member of a local authority, would be familiar with this.  County managers have often said they do not mind being forced to overspend but ask from where the money will come.  We lack the accounting expertise to point out to him where he can get this money.  Sometimes, and this has been said in a wide variety of contexts in the House, county managers have been economical &mdash; I will not say unscrupulous &mdash; with the facts when finance, the core value of any local authority, is discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statements on funding for local authority roads.  This has been the biggest bane of councillors, especially in rural areas over the last three years.  I was interested to hear the Minister say he did not agree with wasting money by refilling potholes. Indeed, we are all of that opinion.  It would be beneficial if a plan which would bring the county roads structure up to a satisfactory level could be drawn up. When I put this idea to the county engineer in my local authority, he said that the previous Minister for the Environment, <Col N="491" /> Deputy Flynn, had told them to refill the potholes and not become involved in any grandiose schemes.  I welcome the Minister saying that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he would be willing to raise extra finance if adequate schemes and plans were presented to him.  That would be welcomed by all councillors, county councils and engineers.  If the county engineers presented plans that would bring our roads up to the level before the rate support grant was reduced, would the Minister be willing to fund it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to cooperate with the House and the local authorities because I know how overstretched and pressed local representatives are on this question.  There is now an opportunity to find the best way to solve this problem.  In overall terms, this year's allocation is the most we have ever had for this purpose although even that may not be adequate. Therefore, we may have to look at ways to increase it further, but there is no point in doing this if it is spent wastefully.  Some £600 million has been spent in the last five years, which represents about £12,000 per mile of our 54,000 county and regional miles.  If one looks at the statistics, one will see that there were 160,000 cars in Ireland 30 years ago; there are now 900,000 cars.  There were 40,000 four, eight and ten tonne trucks 30 years ago; there are now 150,000 40 tonne trucks and bulk carriers.  The foundations and the management of drainage and hedgerows, either by the farming community or the county council, is not good enough in many cases.  All these factors must be combined to ensure that decent roads are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also been frightened by the variation in priorities by county councils.  In some cases, the amount of expenditure per county mile of road is as low as £200; the highest is £1,800.  There was a protest in County Meath about the state of their <Col N="492" /> roads and I will give £3 million to that county this year; it received £1 million from the State four years ago for county and regional roads.  In the last five years, it has reduced its allocation from its own resources by £1 million, 15 years after the abolition of rates.  The condition of roads is my priority and should also be that of this House.  They must also be seen to be a priority in expenditure at local level. Other things may have to be scaled down to ensure that this is done correctly, for example, there has been a lot of discussion on pilot schemes.  I am concerned that this £1 billion, consisting of new resources at local level and State and EU resources, and more if we can get them, will not solve the problem.  I share the concerns raised in this House in trying to deal with that matter in a comprehensive, fundamental and changed way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statements and congratulate him for recognising the huge problems that exist in this area.  I also welcome the Minister's allocation of £33 million for these roads within the next few weeks.  This money should be spent properly and the programmes to be introduced should not just consist of throwing a shovel of tar here and some gravel there, which would be a total waste of money and similar to the £120 million spent over the last five years. If we are to devise a plan &mdash; and if £1 billion is to be spent over the next six years &mdash; the onus is on all of us, as local authority members, to ensure the county managers and engineers spend that money correctly, even if they only repair a mile or two of road properly per year. The Minister mentioned that proper foundations should be put in place so that the council will not have to repair these roads again and throw good money after bad.  I share that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If a programme was introduced on that basis I would welcome it as it would involve proper local discussion on priorities and how the money is to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is public goodwill for spending the money in the way I suggest.  Equally <Col N="493" /> there is goodwill from the engineers, county engineers and the executives at local authority level.  Between pressure at local level and political pressures stop gap work is undertaken.  Do not let this happen to £1 billion over six years; communicate with the public and tell them the truth &mdash; that all the work cannot be undertaken this year.</P>
    <P>I have attended meetings where there was political pretence that work could be done on all the roads this year.  The ravages of last winter alone ensure that this issue cannot be solved in one year. However, we will go as far as possible. The improved weather conditions will give local authorities an opportunity to do the work.  We will give the commitment on finance but it must be matched to ensure that at the turn of the century, having spent all those resources &mdash; and we may never again get the support we received from the EU &mdash; we do not end up with the problem I must now address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a local authority is disbanded by the Minister, an independent commission should evaluate the reason for taking this action.  Members of local authorities do not deal with this issue lightly and would be the last people to vote themselves out of office.  In view of this another structure, such as an independent commission, should be in place to deal with this issue when is arises.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks on the county roads system.  Perhaps because of the bad weather, it appears he has come alive to the problem.  In County Longford our allocation from the Department is down on last year, yet the Minister advises the House today that he has increased funding across the country. Where has he increased this funding?</P>
      <P>In the Minister's absence yesterday I raised the issue of car tax collection in each county.  The Minister knows which are the bad counties because people have been advising him of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;outside the gates of this House and in other parts of the country when he visited on official business. I propose that the Government allows counties to hold car tax funding and spend it over the next five or six years on the county road system.  The argument in the past against this proposal has been that the allocation from central funds would have to drop accordingly. However, this need not be the case because vehicle owners are also paying tax on petrol and diesel.  If the Minister is serious about providing proper funding and a proper planning programme to the local authorities, he should ensure that car tax funding is left in the counties, which are in dire straits.</P>
      <P>Because of the state of the roads people are depressed when they have to travel.  It is all very well for the Minister to suggest that the potholes should not be filled but if he had to travel through them every day, he would take action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality, as anybody with any common sense will be aware, is that the rate support grant has declined and local authorities have been starved <Col N="496" /> of funding from the Government, which has let down the local authority system. The main victim in this has been the county road system.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Government and the Minster are at least admitting to the problem. In this the Minister will have our support.  However, I ask him to consider my proposal on car tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a strange way of making a case by declaring that it is not political.  In 1987 the then Government gave Longford County Council £200,000; I will be giving the council approximately £2 million this year.  The scale of investment by the State over the last five years, in terms of its percentage support for county and regional roads, has increased from 30 per cent to 70 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is a problem and I am not only waking up to it today.  Last year I fought for an additional £12 million in the Estimates, which I obtained.  Because of the very bad weather in December 1993 I fought for a further £15 million and the Minister for Finance and the Government backed me but Senator Belton's party voted against the provisions which gave me that extra £15 million for county and regional roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to take this beyond Government and beyond politics.  There are people travelling roads today which are an embarrassment to me.  I did not cause this problem, but I have the responsibility to remedy it.  That is why I fought for those funds.  That is why I went to Brussels to obtain EU funding, and was scoffed at for doing so by members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party who told me I was wasting my time and the country's time because the EU Commission had indicated that they would not listen to proposals to give money to Ireland for its county roads.  Some Fine Gael Party politicians believed the EU Commission, but I did not.  I believed this problem was serious enough for me to fight longer and harder to get extra money for this purpose, and I won.  This winter we have had 39 inches of rain; our normal rainfall is 50 inches a year.  There has not been enough dry weather to do a <Col N="497" /> decent job on many of those roads.  Local authorities are concentrating on doing this job to satisfy communities who have difficulties.  I give a commitment to the House that, although the largest amount of money ever spent on roads will be spent this year and £1 billion will be spent over the next six years, I am prepared to fight for more money from wherever I can get it, provided the work on the ground is of a lasting nature.  It is not fair to say I do not want potholes filled.  A sum of £12,000 a mile has been spent on 54,000 miles of road over the past five years, yet we still have the biggest problem ever on our county roads.  Should we shrink from reality, play local politics in a cosy arrangement with the public and pretend everything is right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or should we tell the truth?  The Commission said that not one penny of the £226 million it is co-financing can be spent filling potholes but must be spent on structural work. Potholes will be filled but in a way and with the skills which make sure the filling will last.  It will be done in dry conditions and the filling will be sealed so that it cannot be knocked out after the first shower of rain.  I am talking about using resources to finance a fundamental change in activities and I need community support.  People who live in areas with bad roads do not want pretence politics or to be used as fodder in an European election campaign by people pretending they can spend more money because when the election is over they will be forgotten about.  I intend to be there long after the election to continue to solve this problem, regardless of how people are playing around with it at present.

      <P>From the day he took office, the Minister has shown that the quick fix, short sighted solution is not possible.  We are all looking for this solution. I am constantly asking engineers in Galway to fill potholes.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, was the first person to say we have spent so much money filling potholes to no avail.  It is now critically important that he gets the support he needs to get communities to recognise there is only one way to solve this problem and that is to provide significant <Col N="499" /> amounts of money for major structural works over the next six years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken initiatives in some areas where local communities can become involved in aspects of road maintenance, such as the alleviation of water tables and the cutting of hedges.  No matter how much money is thrown at this problem, unless we develop an ethos where local communities become responsible for the basic maintenance of small county roads, we will never solve the problem.  I compliment the Minister for taking this initiative in relation to local authority housing where people are being made responsible for their own repairs. A similar initiative would go a long way towards solving the roads problem.</P>

Because of political pressure we favour stop gap measures and the problems such measures are designed to tackle turn up again six months later.  We should be honest with the public.  County councils should inform the public of their plans and of the programme the Minister wants.  They should point out that money is being provided by Brussels over a six year period to repair roads and that similar amounts of money are unlikely to be provided again.  People would accept this if they were confident that our roads would be improved to an acceptable level.  The quick fix of throwing a few shovels of gravel into a pothole is a waste of money.  This message should be propagated by the Minister, all Members who are members of local authorities and by local authorities themselves.  This is the only way we will solve this problem.</P>

I do not know how they can be repaired.  Another local improvement scheme may have to be introduced, but there are many roads on the waiting list.  The Minister should discuss these roads with local authority managers.</P>

      <P>As a local authority member, I was embarrassed a few weeks ago to see a headline in <i>The Tuam Herald</i> which read, &ldquo;Super council runs out of cash five weeks on&rdquo;.  The article pointed out that after its inaugural meeting the west's super council, the much vaunted Western Regional Authority, had to go cap in hand to the Minister for Finance to bail it out of an embarrassing cash flow problem.  The funding provided to it was almost £80,000 less than it needed.  This is totally unacceptable and an embarrassment for local authority members and the council.  This situation should not have been allowed happen.  Regional authorities should not have been introduced without being adequately and properly funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sufficient funds are not being provided to councils.  The removal of a council by the Minister, on the findings of a commission and without consultation, is unfair because it is not the council's fault if it lacks funds.  I agree with everything which was said.  I am not going to discuss the county roads again.  However, every year since 1985 &mdash; when I was elected to <Col N="501" /> the county council &mdash; the county engineer, a fine man, is like John the Baptist crying out in the wilderness telling us he has about one-tenth of his requirement. So far, nobody seems to have been listening. Perhaps at this stage the Minister will prove to be the real Messiah for us all.  John the Baptist had locusts and honey but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are talking here about something which is much more fundamental. I want to take Senator McDonagh to task about what the county engineer might say.  I have seen timber gates, rotten for 30 years, and tied with binding twine replaced with two pillars and an iron gate; I have seen stone walls replacing hedges; I have seen more money spent off the road than on the road and I am prepared to call that into question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the surface of the roads done. We do not need massive new realignments for 400 yards with the rest of the road incapable of being touched. Decisions must be taken at local level about these realities.  We do not need to purchase land and leave it there providing free access for the travelling people to park wherever they like on land <Col N="502" /> which it was never really necessary to purchase in the first place.  I am talking about fundamental engineering and using resources in the best way possible.  We should stick to dealing with the foundations and drainage problems.</P>
    <P>The farming community has many problems associated with drainage which need to be dealt with.  There are people with new houses who have not prepared soak pits to take the water off the chutes and it is flowing down the road.  We are talking here about a fundamental reappraisal of how we do things.  The alternative is to pretend to the taxpayer that there is money for everything &mdash; all we have to do is put another couple of pence on their income tax and we will charge down the country with new ideas which will not win us any votes.  Nobody will be anxious to vote for me because of what I am saying but some day somebody will say the same if it is not done.</P>

      <P>My amendment was disallowed because it would involve a charge on the Exchequer.  Section 46 deals with the financing of local authorities.  Section 9 of the Local Government (Amendment) Act, 1983, removed the statutory obligation on any Government to provide funds to local authorities.  This has led to local authorities not being adequately funded and the whole system has deteriorated. We have discussed that for the last <Col N="503" /> half an hour and the major effect which this has had on county roads.  Local authorities have not been able to carry out their powers and functions due to the restriction in available funding.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister said on previous sections and I hope the increased funding he promised for roads over the next six years will offset the effects of this lack of funding since 1983. In Laois, £20 million has been lost in funding since 1983.  This measure was not introduced by the present Minister but by Deputy Spring.  The purpose of my amendment was to change the situation which came about in 1983 and has resulted in a severe lack of funding for local authorities over the period.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, a Chathaoirligh. I had no idea that somebody could make political progress and be absolutely pure in the process.</P>
      <P>There are certain elements of local authority funding I want to address. There is a general belief that local authorities are starved.  I emphasised earlier that there has never been a time when so much work has been done on roads, housing, arterial roadworks, amenities and urban renewal.  There is no question of local authorities being starved of cash. On the capital side, things have never been so good for them.  However, they do need more for roads and so on.  Public expectations have changed and we must respond to them as far as we can within the resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some ideas as to how the revenue can be improved and I will try to address them as quickly as I can.  There <Col N="504" /> is a great deal of misunderstanding. There are about 250,000 more people in the income tax net now than there were in 1988; there are three times the number of companies in the tax net and twice the number registered for VAT; there are three times the number of students in third level education, with their parents struggling to keep them there in many instances; there is a huge increase in the numbers in second level education because when the rates were abolished second level education was only beginning to develop in many towns.  In other words, the situation has changed radically since the abolition of rates.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, local loans, arterial drainage, vocational education committee grants and Teagasc grants which were provided by local authorities under the original rates support scheme are now being paid at central Exchequer level. Comparisons are being made without taking into account all the changes which have taken place.  Having said that, there are problems on the Revenue side and I have some ideas how they can be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in local authorities. Much of the social housing legislation I brought in &mdash; this Local Government Bill &mdash; and many of the changes I am making in terms of the Road Traffic Bill are to make sure that that transition can be made in a way which gives local authorities the autonomy, the power and, as far as we can, the resources.  However, let us not try to blind the devil in the dark.  There is not an unlimited amount of resources for anybody.  If we want to do a lot more we must charge someone for it; the money must be taken from somewhere.  Before I give additional money I must get it from the taxpayer.  I do not hear too many Senators telling me to do that.  However, there are imbalances which need to be corrected, and County Laois is one which needs extra help.</P>

      <P>The amendment refers to the commission being appointed by the Minister.  The Minister said that this commission should be independent but I cannot see how it could be independent if he is to make all the appointments.  I would suggest that he follow previous procedures where the Government would agree to nominate certain organisations which would have a right to nominate people whom the Minister would then appoint, rather than the Minister himself choosing all the members of the commission.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>

      <P>It is very important not to have too much confidence in the Minister for the Environment on these matters.  I would not claim to have any greater wisdom than anybody else.  There are two practices.  There is the one Senator Honan suggested where organisations nominate.  Unfortunately, I am having some unusual experiences with that system where people are canvassing associations and getting their names proposed. I am concerned that there would be technical, representative and managerial capacities involved in the composition of this commission.  It will have nothing to do with political appointments but will be based solely on the competence of people to do the job.  I have had four or five different experiences as Minister where I pitted my own judgment against a more elaborate and seemingly more independent way of doing things.  I am not saying other people are having different experiences but, in my case, it has not been as good as I would have wished.  Nonetheless, I want to make sure that this commission is representative of elected members, of top managerial ability and the technical and financial capacities required.  I hope that, when I come to do it, everyone will be satisfied that my <Col N="507" /> bona fides and the way I set about doing it was in the interests of getting the best results.  I doubt that allowing organisations to make nominations is as safe a procedure as it is claimed to be.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Does he not think that whatever one says or does and whatever the Minister's good intentions, if an appointment is made by a Minister it is always seen to be political?  We talk a lot about transparency nowadays.  Does the Minister not think it would be better if he accepted nominations by various representative bodies whom I am sure would include all the types of people he is anxious to have on the commission?  These might include a county manager and a local authority member with knowledge of staffing matters as well as others with business experience. At least the procedure would then be seen to be transparent.  That is what I am anxious about because the political tag would be removed from it.</P>

      <P>A few years ago I might have expressed opinions where I was more afraid of political appointments. However, I have to say that I have changed my mind because of my experience in terms of other types of nomination and circumstances.  Let us bring it down to this House.  As a former Senator, I know the extent to which Senators depend on support from county councillors as well as the influence of the General Council of County Councils.  Their circular was read out by a number of Members here.  I do not object to that but they asked me to defer the local elections to 1999 and to run them in tandem with the European Elections.  That is a disgrace and it should, be called such. If you are nominating somebody who is representing a group they are inclined to do that.  I do not want anyone on this commission representing a group.  I want them there to do a job independently.  I think Senators see my point.  Very often the person nominated by an organisation feels a commitment to that organisation <Col N="508" /> and feels he has to put forward its views. That is not what I want.</P>
      <P>I have been let down by so-called independent systems.  I say without conceit that I am prepared to pit my judgment on a selection process, with the help of the communities throughout the country, against what I call so-called independent organisations where somebody has canvassed for that nomination.  They might have received good support but the question of whether he or she is qualified to do that job is another matter.</P>

Everybody would be happy with that now that it has been teased out and explained.  When we were holding our discussions we did not realise what the Minister had in mind.  The general council would be pleased that we have our own niche in the local government system and that our elections will be held alone and not in tandem with any other elections.

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 43, before section 61, but in Part XI, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;61. &mdash;The Government shall ratify the European Charter on Local Self Government within 12 months from the date of the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The European Charter on Local Self Government established rights for local authorities.  It is a treaty from the Council of Europe and was signed by many members on 15 October 1985.  Ireland has not yet ratified this treaty.  I would like to ask the Minister's opinion on this matter.  Does he think we should ratify it, as I believe we should, and when does he think that this might happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments would oblige the Government to ratify the European Charter for Local Self Government within 12 months.  <i>The Programme for Government, 1993-1997,</i> contains a specific commitment that Ireland will sign and ratify the European Charter on Local Self Government.  All the implications of ratification of the Charter are being examined with a view to signature and ratification as soon as possible.  It is not possible, however, at this stage to indicate definitely what legislation or other changes may be required in local government law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I want to assure Senators of our absolute commitment to the principles of the Charter.  The Charter is the first multilateral agreement to define principles to underpin local self government throughout the area of the Council of Europe.  The first part of the Charter contains the substantive provision setting out the principles of local self government. It specifies a need for constitutional and legal foundation for local self government and establishes principles governing the nature and scope of <Col N="511" /> local authorities' powers.  Further articles concern the autonomy of local government administrative structures, the limitation of administrative supervision of local authorities and the financing of local government on terms which do not impair their basic autonomy.  Other parts of the Charter contain miscellaneous provisions and provisions customarily used in conventions drawn up under the auspices of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not have a fundamental objection to the amendment.  I object to the way in which it ties the Government to a specific time before we have concluded our examination of the legal changes that may be necessary in order to ratify the treaty. The Government has expressed its commitment to ratification and I announced that at the annual general meeting of the General Council of County Councils during my first year in office.</P>

      <P>The Minister has, during the last two days, continuously referred to the General Council of County Councils and its submissions on this Bill.  He and his Department obviously have great faith in the General Council of County Councils.  As a member of the general council since 1987 and a member of its executive since 1989, I believe that this recognition is appropriate.</P>
      <P>The General Council of County Councils is an efficient, concerned and hard working body which is highly sensitive to the policies and problems of councils and councillors.  Despite having scant resources, the general council does marvellous work.  It is a pity more resources are not available to enable this prestigious body to acquire one or two extra staff; the investment would pay one hundred fold.  I expect the Minister to look again at the huge contribution of the general council with a view to increasing its overworked secretariat.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's recognition of the role of the General's Council of County Councils in this legislation.  It is much appreciated.  The general council and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland are funded by contributions from local authorities.  This income should not be liable for taxation as the income of local authorities is not, at present, liable for taxation.  These bodies are non-profit organisations.  They provide a service to the member councils and their electorates.  Funding is scarce at present and it is becoming harder to survive in this difficult economic environment. The general council is considering the purchase of office premises through the prudent accumulation of funds.  However, if it tries to save money like other bodies it could be exposed to taxation.  Bodies such as the General Council of County Councils should not now or in the future be liable for taxation.</P>

The Local Government Bill is a large Bill and, obviously, there is room for differences of opinion. However, I hope we have passed legislation which will enhance local government law and bring it into the modern <Col N="515" /> age.  For the first time this century boundaries of town councils have been extended, populations of over 3,000 can decide to have a new local authority and a Minister will no longer have the power to defer local elections.  A number of sections in this legislation will be welcomed by councillors, administrators and technical officers throughout the country. I hope it will work well.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senators for their support and their contributions. Although we differed on some matters, that is a welcome part of the political process.

      <P>Since I was a medical student the incidence of breast cancer has increased two-fold.  This is a real increase, not simply an increase due to better diagnosis or because women are living longer.  However statistics are being bandied about at present which are alarming rather than alterting women. The increase in the incidence of breast cancer is extremely serious and is naturally a great worry to all women, the medical profession and women doctors like myself, who take a particular interest in women's health care.</P>
      <P>We need to introduce a logical order into how we look at the problem.  It is being said that one woman in 11 gets breast cancer.  This leads women to think that one women of every 11 women of 50 years of age has breast cancer, but this is not so.  The incidence increases with age and such factors are not explained to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> Various women's organisations, including the Council for the Status of Women and the Irish Countrywomen's Association, have campaigned recently for breast screening.  They have contacted all women Members of the Oireachtas and those involved in health about establishing breast screening in Ireland.  There was a useful debate on the subject in the Dáil on Wednesday.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister for Health had millions of pounds available to him to set up a breast screening programme he would be unable to do so.  Breast screening is not a matter of choosing women aged 50 or over at random and asking to screen them.  The programme must be set up with a tight Protocol and must be properly ordered, otherwise the exercise will be pointless.</P>
    <P>There is a debate in medical circles at present about the value of mammography in breast screening.  Having read the literature carefully I feel it is of value in women over 50 if combined with a good clinical examination &mdash; the latter is important.  Breast tissue is too dense in women under 50 for mammography to be of value.  While it is valuable in the diagnosis of already palpable breast lumps in women under 50, the same has not been found true of screening.</P>
    <P>Breast screening must be done in a validated centre and a clinical examination is important.  I say this despite the fact that the late Dr. Maureen Roberts, a friend of mine, and Professor Patrick Forrest set up breast screening in Great Britain.  She died at 56 years of age from breast cancer and she left an emotional article, which was published posthumously in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, which she queried the value of breast screening.  Having read the literature I believe breast screening is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to set up breast screening for women over 50 years of age by a certain date and to establish a population register.  No screening can be set up until this is in place.  I was an observer at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Affairs some months ago and one of our most distinguished epidemiologists also <Col N="518" /> said this.  Recently the professor in charge of the breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital agreed with her.  I refer to the <i>European Journal of Cancer Prevention</i> which states:</P>
    <P>An essential prerequisite for a population based programme is a register which enumerates each member of the target population, since accurate denominator information is essential for any conclusions to be drawn.  A particular problem in setting up a population based project in Ireland was the absence of any population register.  The register constructed for this programme, [the Eccles Street breast screening programme, which is one of 12 pilot studies being done throughout the EU], while successful in identifying 84 per cent of the target population, is not perfect.  For example, it has not been possible, from within programme resources, to update the register continuously, correcting for movement of people in and out of the target population.  Furthermore, restrictions placed on the use of personal data may preclude future access to demographic information from sources available to this programme.  These are serious considerations in any decision to extend the programme nationally.</P>
    <P>Great Britain and the Netherlands are the only countries in Europe carrying out breast screening at present and both have population registers.  We have problems establishing one here, but that does not mean we should not address this matter. The names, addresses and ages of approximately 70 per cent of the population are available from the General Medical Service registers which are held by the different health boards.  However, they are not all computerised and those which are do not have systems which marry satisfactorily or which marry with the computer in the Department of Health.  However, this involves computer policy and it is not my business.</P>
    <P>Those outside the GMS or in private health insurance schemes, such as the Voluntary Health Insurance, also experienced <Col N="519" /> problems.  The VHI had to write to all the women on its books in the birth cohort, which was to be screened, to ask permission to give their names to the Eccles Street breast screening programme. This was a large task for the two areas involved, North Dublin and Cavan-Monaghan, but it had to be done to avoid prosecution under the data protection legislation.  Other private insurance schemes would also need to be contacted.</P>
    <P>One must decide on the cohort when setting up a breast screening programme. For example, it could be women who are 50 years of age.  As soon as a woman reaches 50, a card could be sent inviting her to attend for screening, This must be set up before breast screening can take place.  One could then decide how often she needs to come back, perhaps every two or three years.  Women over the age of 65 are reluctant to go for screening. Perhaps this is due to a false sense of security.</P>
    <P>The Eccles Street breast screening programme has an 84 per cent take-up and it has been applauded by the experts from the European Commission on Cancer who visited this country.  They praised the Irish survey and said it was one of the best of the 12 being undertaken.  It had strong clinical leadership, good epidemiology, a high level of technical expertise and so on.  However, we must be careful not to set up too many facilities for mammography.  At present, there are 17 facilities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I recently visited the women's research unit of the National Institute of Health in Washington DC and I spoke to the woman in charge of research in the breast screening area.  She said that breast screening facilities must be legally validated to show they have reached a certain standard.  I am not suggesting that facilities here are not up to standard, but we must consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>It is no good asking people to attend for screening in centres which may only do three or four sessions a week.  One must have a substantial throughput so that radiographers and radiologists will <Col N="520" /> be able to increase their expertise and abilities to read the sensitive X-rays. There are four or five doctors in the House and I am sure if someone came in with an X-ray of a broken leg and asked us to look at it, we would be able to confirm that the leg was broken.  The same would be true of a chest X-ray. However, if someone asked us to look at a mammogram we would tell them to take it away because it is a specialised area.  One must have a certain throughput in order to increase one's clinical skills. Some experts say 2,000 mammograms a year going through a unit are needed to do this.</P>
    <P>While focusing on breast screening, I must be careful that women do not lose sight of what may be the most important aspect of the treatment of breast disease, early diagnosis.  As soon as they find a lump on their breast they should go to the doctor, who is well trained to refer them to a specialist.  I talked to a young graduate in John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and I was told they rely on early diagnosis.  We must be careful because women, including myself, deserve good health.  We cannot ask for mammography and breast screening if they might be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>When I get an opportunity to talk to the Minister for Health about this matter, I will tell him that I do not want breast screening only when he sets up the screening project.  I want women to have a full health examination if necessary.  If women will not go to their GPs, this is the best way to approach this issue.  Some women think that the family's health is more important than their own.  This is a serious problem and it is being addressed in a haphazard way.  I ask the Minister to give us some guidance and direction by establishing a population register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for allowing me to share her time.  I support this motion because it is important.  This issue was discussed in the other House during the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICA and the Council for the Status of Women have lobbied us to encourage the Minister to set up a screening programme <Col N="521" /> throughout the country.  Many women believe that if a mammography service was established in every county all women with breast cancer would be diagnosed at an early stage.  When women Members of the Oireachtas met Professor Given of the breast cancer unit in the University Hospital Galway, I was shocked when he informed us that mammography for pre-menopausal women under 50 was a waste of time and that breast examination was most important. Women need to be educated on the importance of this examination.</P>
    <P>In addition to setting up a breast screening programme throughout the country, I suggest that the Minister also set up a programme whereby women could go to their GPs for a breast examination free of charge twice a year.  As Senator Henry said, early detection is important.  In the new health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, the Minister mentioned prevention and this is important. In the last three years 2,000 women have died from breast cancer.  A breast screening programme would be of great benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Henry's request to establish a population register because we cannot proceed with the nationwide screening programme until this is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">

      <P>I am standing in for the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry and Senator Honan for raising this important matter. We all know of circumstances where women have died because of the late detection of breast cancer.  It is important that the best possible measures are in place to avoid that.  Senator Honan said 2,000 women have died over the past three years, approximately 650 each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The causes of breast cancer remain to be clearly established and emphasis is therefore placed on early detection at the pre-invasive stage through mammography and consequent early treatment. At present, mammography is used largely as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women on referral by <Col N="522" /> their general practitioner, consultant or through the local breast clinic.  There are now diagnostic mammography units at 17 hospital throughout the country and expertise has been growing in all aspects of the early detection of breast cancer and its treatment.</P>
    <P>Mammography screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis to detect breast cancer in non-symptomatic women.  Mammography screening programmes tend to be directed at women aged between 50 and 64 years.  There is a general agreement that mammography screening programmes are not effective in reducing mortality in younger women.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to briefly outline some of the general principles considered necessary to underpin a successful mass screening programme.  One of these is that the natural history of the disease should be well understood.  Another is that there should be a suitable screening test and one which is acceptable to the population to be screened.  Another essential factor in the success of such a screening programme is a high and consistent participation rate among the population to be screened.  The absence of a national population register on a named basis makes the implementation of a national screening programme all the more difficult.  The establishment of such a register would not, however, be the primary responsibility of the Minister for Health but the difficulties to which its absence gives rise in the context of any health screening programme is something which he will be discussing with the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are the only two countries in the European Union which have organised national mammography screening programmes for women aged between 50 and 64 years.  However, there is considerable debate and discussion internationally regarding the effectiveness of mammography screening programmes in reducing mortality from breast cancer. Before proceeding with a national screening programme for women aged 50 to 64 years, it is imperative that the <Col N="523" /> benefits of mammography screening, in terms of achieving a reduction in mortality, are carefully and fully assessed.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, the Department of Health is supporting a major mammography breast screening programme currently under way at the Mater Foundation. This programme, the Eccles Street breast screening programme, is one of a network of pilot schemes which are at present under way in seven countries within the European Union.  The other countries are Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy.  The Irish pilot programme covers a defined catchment area, North Dublin and Cavan-Monaghan, representing both urban and rural populations.  All women in the catchment area between 50 and 64 years are eligible to attend.  Screening is provided free of charge to women taking part in the programme.  The objectives of the Eccles Street breast cancer screening Programme are as follows: to evaluate the impact of mammographic screening on mortality from breast cancer among Irish women; to document compliance with a breast screening programme in Irish women and to compare the specificity, sensitivity and predictive value of the mammography programme with that reported internationally.</P>
    <P>The second round of screening is expected to be concluded by the end of 1994.  The Eccles Street breast screening programme is the first study of its kind <Col N="524" /> undertaken in this country.  As indicated in the new health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, national policy to be followed in this area will be guided and influenced by the experience gained through the pilot programme.</P>
    <P>I undertake to pass on a number of the details raised today.  They will help the Minister for Health and the Government in furthering this matter by establishing the register requested as soon as possible if it is feasible.  It will also help alleviate some of the apprehensions women have in going for screening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that clear statement.  It is important that we stress that mammography for the diagnosis of a breast lump is not the same as screening asymptomatic women.  I thank Senator Honan for her suggestion that women should be advised to go even once a year to their GP for breast examination.</P>
      <P>Given that one always asks a Minister for money, I ask that the Eccles Street breast screening programme be given more money.  I gather that at the end of this year it will have run out of its EU money.  In view of the praise the programme received from the European Commission on Cancer, it would be sad if the work of this unit did not continue and, if necessary, expand.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 1.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 May 1994.</P>
