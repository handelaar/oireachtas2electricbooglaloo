      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Trade to grant aid a feasibility study for the establishment of a major multi-purpose world centre as an extension to the Centre for International Co-operation at Shannon.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1; it is hoped to conclude Second Stage today.  Item 40 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I suggest 30 minutes for spokespersons and 20 minutes thereafter on Item 1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Our efficient spokesperson would like the Leader to consider 40 minutes for spokespersons.  I understand some discussion took place with the Whips in this regard and some people believe there should be no time limit on such an important debate as the Finance <Col N="894" /> Bill.  We will accommodate it on this occasion if there is 40 minutes for spokespersons.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to give permission early next week to discuss Item 33.  It has been on the Order Paper for some time and relates to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the anniversary of which was yesterday.  The atrocities in Dublin and Monaghan occurred 20 years ago yesterday and left 33 people dead and many injured.  Those who were injured and the families of those who died are entitled to know the full truth from the Government about the situation and why nobody has been brought to justice.</P>
      <P>I want the debate because the Minister for Justice ordered a report after the Yorkshire Television programme; I understand that report has been on the Minister's desk since last December.  I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on Item 33.  Perhaps as a forerunner to that, the Minister for Justice could use the opportunity this evening on the Progressive Democrat motion on crime to make a preliminary statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader of the House when Item 4, the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill 1993, will be taken. Two weeks ago we asked this question in the House and understood from the reply that it would be taken this week; we advised some of our people of this. Maybe the Leader would update us on that situation.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Leader to impress upon the Taoiseach the need for immediate support for the candidature of Mr. Peter Sutherland for the EU Commission Presidency.  It is a unique opportunity for this country to obtain the leadership of the Commission and utilise that to our advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering what we heard from Fine Gael last weekend, 30 minutes should do adequately to extend the message this afternoon.  We feel 30 minutes would be adequate.  Foreign <Col N="895" /> affairs issues come up regularly in this House and during the past few weeks we have heard a number of harrowing stories from different parts of the world, such as Bosnia and Rwanda.  When these things happen other places take second fiddle in terms of a high profile.  We had a long and comprehensive discussion on East Timor recently and, in the meantime, I have circulated Members of both Houses with a petition on the matter for the Minister.  I would like to remind people who support the position we articulated in this House regarding East Timor to conclude that petitioning.  We should consider sending &mdash; not at the taxpayers' expense but at our own expense &mdash; a delegation of parliamentarians to look at what is happening there.  This needs to be addressed urgently because there is a serious problem there.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader of the House about a debate on the input that elected public representatives should, can and do make to the development of education policy.  I again raise with him the need to have such a debate as quickly as possible.  There are all sorts of conflicting views on this.  I hold a middle line; I think it is very important that democracy should be reflected in the curriculum. We need to assert ourselves as public representatives, as I would as an educationalist.  I would ask that matter to be taken very soon.</P>

      <P>There is so much I could say in support of this Bill that I could use three hours.  However, in the interests of discipline and communication I think that 30 minutes are adequate.  I will go along with whatever agreement is reached between the Whips.</P>
      <P>Three or four weeks ago, with a terrible degree of anticipation and apprehension, I raised the fact that the spate of sectarian assassinations in the North would unfortunately continue and that by the time we met again other innocent people would have lost their lives.  I very much regret to say that the spate of sectarian assassinations has increased since then.  The victims include young teenagers and old women who have nothing to be blamed for except that they may belong to one religion or another.  This is totally unacceptable in what is the most heavily policed city in Europe, if not in the world.  While I welcome the actions of the police, in Belfast particularly, in trying to apprehend and question those who claim to be leaders of sectarian&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator O'Kennedy, may I ask you to put a query to the Leader? I am sure you are coming to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I will do that.  While I welcome the efforts of the police authorities in trying to apprehend people after the event, I would suggest that it would be appropriate if we could have a discussion on the basis that it should be possible, through an effective policing and intelligence to prevent this awful series of sectarian attacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bosnia has been mentioned.  We are, quite correctly, proud of our people who go abroad to create the basis for peace throughout the world.  However, while that takes place, in our own island innocent youngsters and old people are being mown down in their homes because they happen to have a certain religion.  This <Col N="897" /> issue must be discussed.  I know the disposition of the Leader of the House on this matter and I hope we can have a responsible discussion on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Health to explain to the Seanad the effect of the dispute between the IMO and his Department concerning the acting director of community care in the health boards? What effect will this dispute have on the delivery of services relating to AIDS, HIV and screening and treatment for hepatitis C?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate Senator O'Kennedy's comments.  Again, I ask the Leader of the House to afford us an opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland further.  We should have an opportunity to discuss and do something about the continuing deaths at the hands of terrorists there.  Two men were killed yesterday and seven children were orphaned.  We should have an opportunity to refute the statement made yesterday by a unionist councillor that the republican rhetoric of Dublin has encouraged the IRA to continue its terrorist campaign.  We all know that the opposite is the case.  We also need the opportunity to say again to Sinn Féin and the IRA that actions speak louder than words. They know what they must do.  They must not continue to ask questions but lay down their arms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House raise with the Minister for Justice my fears and the fears of a number of people who have contacted me regarding what is perceived as a change in our justice system?  It appears that we are adopting a system of plea bargaining.  I am referring to two cases currently before the courts.  When an accused person pleads guilty it appears that subsequently additional charges are dropped.  I do not wish to prejudice the outcome of either of the cases but the Minister should know that there will be public outcry if justice is not seen to be done in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Leader of the House say that the debate on Item 1 will be concluded today?  If so, at what time will it be concluded?  Extending the time for spokespersons lessens the time available to other Members.  It is frustrating to be restricted to four or five minutes to make one's contribution.  I am elected by a wide electorate and time restrictions are being imposed too frequently.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader also tell the Seanad what the Government proposes to do about the fact that, for the second time in a month, women have to come here from Cork to protest that they are not receiving their rights under the equal treatment provisions of the social welfare code?  It is appalling that women must continue take to the streets to protest that.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support the condemnation of the atrocities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I question the time restriction on contributions on the Finance Bill; it is unfair.  It would be preferable if we had an open debate particularly between the spokespersons on the Bill.  Tomorrow on Committee Stage we will discuss 155 sections.  If we do not have an opportunity to speak on the Bill and if we are restricted to 20 minutes, Committee Stage will be held up.</P>
      <P>It would be better if Members could make comprehensive contributions on this Stage.  Otherwise many amendments will be put down on Committee Stage and questions will have to be dealt with on that Stage.  This is the first time there has been a time limit on the Finance Bill, which is extremely important legislation and has always been debated fairly in this House in comparison to the other House. We should have the opportunity to make the points which concern us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be putting down recommendations. Everyone should be allowed to speak on the Bill without a time limit, especially the main spokespersons; perhaps other speakers could be limited to 30 minutes.  If the time limit is not removed I <Col N="899" /> will be one of those delaying Committee Stage tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my condolences to Senator Cassidy on the loss of his father who had been sick for a few weeks.  I understand the Senator had a very close relationship with him.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to convey this House's concern about the lightning strike at B &amp; I which was the result of disagreements which arose last February.  This is a serious problem and the Minister for the Marine last night condemned the action.  I am not aware of the background to the strike but I am concerned at the implications for our tourist industry, coming as it does at the beginning of the 1994 summer season; I am sure the House shares my concern.</P>
      <P>This country relies heavily on access to encourage tourism.  I hope common sense will prevail.  Given that the ferry service is so vital, unions and management should come together as quickly as possible to resolve the dispute.  We should not have to face a summer of uncertainty, which would have an adverse affect on our tourist industry.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to consider having a debate on the film industry.  I compliment the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who brought a major film production to this country.  This will benefit the immediate area to the tune of £35 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a significant project which has been won in the teeth of tremendous opposition.  One could draw a parallel with a film on the Easter Rising, <Col N="900" /> due to be filmed in Dublin, being switched to another country at the last minute.  That gives some idea of the implications for the country losing the project and the benefits to the country acquiring it.  Because of the burgeoning film industry in Ireland and the success of the section 35 film provisions, I ask the Leader for a debate in the House on the film industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments seeking a debate on the film industry. I do not wish to be parochial but it is extraordinary that when that industry is expanding, the Bray UDC has rezoned a studio backlot for the building of houses, as if we did not have enough concrete already.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the House to discuss on an ongoing basis the arrangements being afforded or offered to women who have contracted hepatitis C from infected blood samples, especially those women who will require hospital treatment arising from this infection.  I understand the VHI is refusing to accept that women who have contracted hepatitis C and may require hospitalisation are entitled to full cover.  This is a scandal.  I normally support this State body because if fulfils its public service obligations but this House should allow time to debate this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I ask the Leader for a debate on the enlargement of the EU, which I have sought on a number of occasions.  Such a debate would be timely because this issue has profound effects for the nation.  Second, I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on education. It gives us an opportunity to support Archbishop Eames in his call for minimum interference in denominational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested 30 minutes per spokesperson in order to facilitate the smooth running of the debate on this Bill.  However, Opposition spokespersons may speak for 40 minutes if they wish.  I suggest 15 minutes thereafter for Senators.  With the present state of the <Col N="901" /> economy, we on this side of the House have no objection to a lengthy debate on the Finance Bill, 1994.  Everyone will have an opportunity to speak on this Bill tonight.  After the votes at 8 o'clock the Whips will review the situation to see if we can finish Second Stage before midnight.</P>
      <P>The Whips will discuss Items 33 and 34 in the hope that we can deal with them within the next two weeks.  Item 4 could not be taken because the Finance Bill, 1994, was being taken this week.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and others mentioned a debate on education.  We have already communicated to the Minister our desire to have a debate on this issue. As regards Northern Ireland, we have stated that we would like a further opportunity to discuss the tragic situation as soon as possible.  Other issues were raised, but they are part of Private Members' Time and we can discuss them at a later date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus in this year's Finance Bill is firmly on taxation policies which will promote and assist the creation of sustainable employment.  The Bill's provisions pursue this goal on two fronts. First, it takes tax reform, particularly in the area of personal income tax, a further and significant step forward.  This Bill must be seen in the context of the Government's broadly based strategy for economic progress in the interests of job creation.  The key elements of this are the continued observance of budgetary discipline, the responsible pay arrangements in the new <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> and the commitment to reforming the taxation system to make it more employment friendly.  The Bill implements a range of targeted measures aimed at enhancing <Col N="902" /> business competitiveness, promoting productive use of resources and stimulating and rewarding genuine enterprise.</P>
      <P>In bringing forward these latter measures, I have taken account of the views of many interested parties, notably the Task Force on Small Business and the Task Force on Jobs in Services. Accordingly, this year's package places particular emphasis on improving the climate for smaller and start-up enterprises. It also reflects the Government's conviction that the services sector can continue to make a major contribution to fulfilling our employment needs.  I would emphasise that the measures in this year's Bill should not be viewed in isolation but rather as complementing and enhancing the initiatives for enterprise and employment enshrined in the Finance Act, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the significant items in the Bill in this connection are the introduction of a special capital gains tax rate for individuals in respect of shares in most unquoted trading companies so as to help in attracting investment funds to this area and to reward those who put their funds at risk in developing job creating businesses; an extension to the wider services sector of the roll-over relief under capital gains tax for equity investment by entrepreneurs in unquoted trading companies, introduced last year for reinvestment in businesses in certain sectors; a new business assets relief in capital acquisitions tax so as to facilitate the transfer of family businesses and to improve incentives for those trying to build-up businesses; an easing of the income qualification test for access to the seed capital scheme which assists new business start-ups by employees and the unemployed; an increase in the company value limit for the purpose of BES investment by the &ldquo;original entrepreneur&rdquo;; a raising of the VAT thresholds for both goods and services thus relieving the very small business from the obligations associated with VAT registration; the cash basis of accounting for VAT is being made available to businesses in all sectors with an annual turnover of up to £250,000; a new <Col N="903" /> and better focused scheme of incentives for urban renewal, with new incentives for industrial buildings in the interests of more balanced development in inner city areas; improved annual capital allowances for hotel development and farm buildings; an increased allowance for business cars, and the granting of capital allowances to the purchase of computer software or the rights to use such software; the introduction of a new provision into the relief for investment in films aimed at assisting low budget Irish films; simplification of the payment arrangements, subject to EU approval, for VAT on long term leases of property; a range of relieving stamp duty measures, including a new appeals procedure and a special relief for young trained farmers; modernisation of the tax treatment of businesses' foreign exchange gains and losses; unilateral credit relief for foreign withholding taxes incurred by computer software companies; a range of measures to underpin the further development of the International Financial Services Centre and amendment of the tax provisions relating to bearer bonds so as to assist the development of Irish financial markets.</P>
    <P>This Bill marks a major step forward in the Government's tax reform programme. This programme is aimed at reducing the tax on low income earners and families and removing as many taxpayers as practicable from liability to the higher rate of tax.  This year I have been in a position to provide for a substantial package of income tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>It is worth while repeating the main improvements contained in this Bill which are as follows: the tax free allowance for a single person is being increased from £2,175 to £2,350; the tax free allowance for a married couple is being increased from £4,350 to £4,700; the tax allowances for widowed persons and widowed and single persons are being increased accordingly; the standard rate band is being increased by £525 for a single person and £1,050 for a married couple; the child additions to the exemption limits are being increased by £100 <Col N="904" /> per child; the marginal relief rate of income tax is being reduced from 48 per cent to 40 per cent; the PAYE and PRSI allowances are being retained and the PAYE allowance is being extended to the children of the self-employed and proprietary directors who are genuinely employed by their parents.</P>
    <P>In addition, while not provided for in the Bill, the 1 per cent income levy is being abolished and a threshold of £9,000 is being introduced for the health contribution and the employment and training levy.  These changes will be felt in the paypacket of the average taxpayer.  For example, a single person on £9,000 a year will be almost £5 a week better off, while a single person on £13,000, near the average industrial wage, will be more than £6 a week better off.  A married couple with one spouse earning an income of £10,000 a year will be almost £7 a week better off and the same couple where the spouse is earning £24,000 a year will be over £10 a week better off.</P>
    <P>More important than the actual gains to individual taxpayers is perhaps the fact that these improvements are tangible evidence that the Government's tax reform policy is working.  I assure this House that I intend to ensure that this policy continues to work and that the trend we have established of removing taxation from work will be continued.</P>
    <P>Tax reform cannot be progressed if the whole matrix of existing reliefs was to be regarded as an untouchable edifice. These reliefs grew up in different times reflecting the particular needs and concerns of society at that time which, in the context of a tax structure, are quite different to that which pertains today. This Government is, of course, committed to maintaining the main discretionary reliefs, such as mortgage interest relief and health insurance relief. These reliefs have a significant part to play in the provision of housing and health care.  However, this Bill seeks to address some of the less desirable effects of how these reliefs operate at present. In particular, it will ensure that these reliefs are of equal value to the more well off taxpayer.  This is being achieved by <Col N="905" /> the standard rating of these reliefs on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>During my budget speech I indicated that I intended to raise the limit below which unreimbursed medical expenses would be allowable for income tax to £150 for an individual and £300 for a family; indeed, were the individual limit to have kept ace with inflation it would be £500 today.  During the passage of the Bill through the other House, however, I reconsidered the matter and decided that the new limits should be fixed at £100 for an individual and £200 for a family. These new limits can be in no way considered onerous on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to maintaining the core element of this relief which is designed as a means by which the taxpayer can be assisted with unpredictable and emergency expenditure.  I note that from amendments brought in last week this change went unnoticed.  I am sure that from today's debate it will be picked up that we have made a significant amendment to that provision which is of great benefit for individuals who have no medical cards, normally no VHI but who have high medical bills.  They can claim these reliefs through the tax system and I am glad we have been able to improve this position.  The above provisions are contained in the first eight sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other income tax measures in the Bill.  These relate to the rates used for determining the benefit-in-kind charge on preferential loans, the payment of the 1 per cent income levy by the self employed, the income qualification requirements and the certification agencies for the seed capital scheme, the small company exemption to the own ownership exclusion under the BES, the access requirements for and benefit in kind in respect of works of art displayed in heritage buildings and the taxation of unemployment benefit.  A number of other amendments of a technical nature are contained in the Bill. These changes are outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and do not warrant repetition at length today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> Since the introduction of the Bill, however, there have been two noteworthy changes in this area.  First, the proposals in relation to access to heritage buildings have been revised.  Initially I had proposed to increase the length that a heritage building would be required to be open to the public from 30 days to 90 days, 60 of which would have to be in the period May to September.</P>
    <P>On reflection however I have decided to increase the period to 60 days rather than 90, and to require that 40 rather than 60 of these days be in the period May to September.  The new limits will, I believe, ensure that this relief will provide real benefits in terms of public access to heritage buildings.</P>
    <P>Second, a new section 13 has been included in the Bill which provides for the drawing up of guidelines in relation to works which can benefit from the artists' exemption.  This section is necessary to ensure that the original focus and intention of the 1969 provision which is to assist artistic, creative and original works is maintained.  The guidelines will ensure that only creative and original works of art are able to avail of the relief and the Revenue Commissioners and the Appeal Commissioner will be obliged to have regard to the guidelines when determining whether a work is entitled to be exempted or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit has been made reckonable for tax purposes from 6 April 1994.  It has been decided however that, in recognition of their special circumstances, workers who on 5 April 1994 were engaged in systematic short-time working arrangements, recognised by the Department of Social Welfare, will be temporarily exempted from the new tax arrangements.  This exemption will apply for the tax year 1994-95 or to the end of the individual's current unemployment claim or current period of short-time working, whichever is the shorter.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the taxation elements of the recommendations in relation to expenses of members of the Judiciary contained in Report No. 35 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> The Bill improves the provisions for capital allowances in a number of important areas.  In the case of cars used for business purposes, the capital value threshold for determining the capital allowances and the deduction for running expenses is being increased from £10,000 to £13,000 with effect from 27 January 1994.  The higher threshold will apply to capital allowances for new cars only, but will apply to allowable running expenses for all cars.</P>
    <P>In the case of capital expenditure on hotels and holiday camps, the Bill provides for the shortening of the writing down period from ten to seven years for expenditure incurred on or after 27 January 1994.  This reduced writing down period will also apply to the capital allowances regime for farm buildings and structures.</P>
    <P>An important change is also being introduced in relation to capital allowance for computer software.  The Bill provides that where computer software is acquired as an asset of a business, either by outright purchase or under licence, the company will be able to treat the asset as plant and machinery for capital allowance purposes.</P>
    <P>The Bill closes off a number of loopholes and unintended uses of certain provisions of the tax code.  In the case of the tax exemption for patent royalty income the Bill refocuses the relief on genuine inventions researched and developed in the State.  The exemption has been retained where the royalty is paid in respect of manufacturing activity and in the case of non-manufacturing activity where the royalty arises from third party payments. Dividends paid out of such exempt royalties will continue to be exempt from tax subject to existing requirements.  Royalties derived from non manufacturing activity where the payments are made between connected persons will no longer be exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>The Bill also closes off, from the date of publication of the Bill, certain unintended and unacceptable uses of the legislation dealing with capital allowances and loss relief in the case of general <Col N="908" /> partnership schemes by confining them to the partnership income in such situations.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with two issues arising from the removal in the Finance Act, 1992, of the formal liability of non-residents to income in respect of Irish dividends. First, it deals with a problem that has arisen with a number of our double taxation treaty partners who have taken the view that dividends, if legally exempt from Irish tax, cannot be said to be subject to double taxation if fully taxed in the treaty partner country.  This ignores that Irish corporation tax is paid on the profits of an Irish company paying dividends to non-residents &mdash; in other words, the non-resident shareholder effectively bears Irish tax.</P>
    <P>Second, it closes a loophole inadvertently created whereby Irish dividend income received outside of the State for the ultimate benefit of an Irish resident falls outside the scope of certain anti-avoidance provisions of the Finance Act, 1974.  Both of these problems are being solved by amending the 1992 legislation. While dividends paid to shareholders who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident will be liable to Irish tax, any tax due will be fully eliminated by means of relief which will produce a net nil liability to Irish tax.</P>
    <P>The Bill also introduces restrictions in the tax rules for capital allowances for lessors of plant and machinery in order to deal with an unintended use of these provisions through a new type of lease arrangement with serious implications for the corporate tax revenue yield. Under these new arrangements known as &ldquo;balloon leases&rdquo;, the bulk of the lease payments are not received by the lessor until the end of the primary leasing period which can be up to ten or 15 years after the commencement of the lease. The effect of this is that the lessor can use virtually all the capital allowances on the leased assets for offset against his other taxable income over the early years of the lease.</P>
    <P>With certain exceptions, therefore, the Bill ringfences the capital allowances in the case of such leases to the lessor's receipts from that particular lease.  The <Col N="909" /> new rules will not apply to leasing companies in the Financial Services Centre or Shannon or to leases of buildings and the rules are relaxed to allow for seasonal factors in the case of leases of agricultural machinery.  Special arrangements are provided in the case of leased machinery or plant which is provided for the purposes of certain new grant-aided projects.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that, in order to comply with a direction from the European Commission, the Government has had to take steps to remove mushroom cultivation from the scope of the 10 per cent manufacturing rate of corporation tax.  Section 48 of the Bill makes the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a company entitled to a section 84 loan by virtue of it being included on an IDA list of allowable loans can only get one such loan of the full allowable amount.  The Bill also imposes a seven year limit on the duration of section 84 loans taken out on or after the publication date of the Bill and provides that all loans taken out before that date should be terminated before 11 April 2001, that is, seven years after the publication date of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends to 31 December 1996 the relief from corporation tax for gifts to the Enterprise Trust.  The Bill also provides for an exemption from corporation tax for certain payments by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to National Co-operative Farm Relief Services Limited and to grants made by that body to its member cooperatives for the purpose of engaging contractors to provide farm relief services.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with a double taxation problem arising from foreign withholding taxes affecting certain computer software companies.  It provides for the introduction of unilateral credit relief for foreign withholding taxes on payments in respect of software transactions.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses a number of the most pressing problems in the area of foreign exchange gains and losses facing Irish business engaged in international trade.  In dealing with these issues, I have <Col N="910" /> decided to take a minimalist approach targeted on the main current problems and based on accounting practice.  I am encouraged by the welcome that these changes have received from the business community.  The changes ensure that commercial strategies for reduction or elimination of currency risk are effective after the taxation liability on the transactions have been determined.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the Bill provides that foreign exchange gains and losses on long term borrowings will now be deductible or chargeable, as appropriate, in the computation of taxable income.  It also provides that the foreign exchange gain, or loss, on associated hedging instruments will be included in the computation of taxable income and excluded from the computation of capital gains.  Moreover, companies with a non-Irish pound &ldquo;functional&rdquo; currency will now be allowed to compute their capital allowances in that functional currency.  Finally, any trading loss in that functional currency will be valued at the exchange rate of the year the loss is offset against income.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an exemption from tax for certain income of non-commercial State bodies.  The exemption will not apply to deposit interest or to fee income, excepting statutory fees and incidental income of this kind.  I would add that in settling the annual Exchequer allocation for such bodies, account is fully taken of own resources arising to them so that the interests of the Exchequer will be safeguarded even in the absence of a tax charge.  The Bill extends the definition of &ldquo;qualifying shipping activities&rdquo; in section 39 of the 1980 Finance Act to include deep-sea tugs.</P>

      <P>The IFSC has been a great success and I am anxious to ensure that it develops to its full potential.  I am proposing certain changes, most of which are of a technical nature, to assist this. The changes will help the development of the collective funds and life assurance sectors specifically.  Both of these areas are important from an employment generation <Col N="911" /> point of view and in the context of the long term future of the centre.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill amends the tax relief for investment in Irish film making companies. In future, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will certify all films in respect of which relief is claimed in accordance with guidelines laid down with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  The certification will allow the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to specify what conditions, for instance employment or value added to the economy, must be met before a project will be entitled to the relief.  The Minister may also certify certain low budget films to avail of a pilot concession whereby corporate investors do not have to reinvest after one year in order to qualify for a capital gains tax relief on the disposal of their shares.  In addition, in accordance with my announcement of 14 January 1994, investment in film by way of loans will no longer qualify for relief. Furthermore, new procedures for claiming relief have been introduced.  These changes have been made in order to ensure that the relief provides the maximum return to the economy and promotes the Government's objective to place the film industry in Ireland on a sustained development path.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Bill, provision is made for the termination of the existing urban renewal scheme on 31 July 1994, subject to some transitional arrangements.  A new three year scheme will commence on 1 August 1994.  The new scheme contains incentives targeted at promoting residential and industrial development over office development, and refurbishment over new building projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the progression of the Bill through the Dáil, I introduced two additional measures to further promote balanced urban renewal.  First, I introduced a provision where the residential tax incentives under the new urban renewal scheme will be conditional on the houses and apartments meeting certain standards to be set out in guidelines which will be issued by the Minister for the Environment with the consent of the <Col N="912" /> Minister for Finance.  This arises from concerns which have been raised about the standards, size and mix of the many new apartments being built in inner city areas.  It is envisaged that the guidelines will provide for improved standards in the design and construction or refurbishment of dwellings, the total floor areas and dimensions of rooms within developments, the provision of ancillary facilities and amenities and the balance to be achieved between dwellings of different types and sizes.</P>
    <P>Second, in the light of concerns expressed by the hotel industry, I have made provision for non-owner occupier hotels in designated areas to avail of a choice between the capital allowances for the lessor in respect of the expenditure on construction or refurbishment of the hotel and the double rent allowances for ten years for the tenant operator of the hotel.  In order for the double rent allowance to apply to the operator, the person entitled to the capital allowances must make an irrevocable election to disclaim the capital allowances.</P>
    <P>This avoids excessive Exchequer costs while still providing a substantial incentive for hotel development on a lessor/ tenant basis in designated areas.  The existing urban renewal scheme has been successful and I am confident that the new scheme, which will operate on a more targeted basis, will be equally successful in promoting urban renewal in the cities and towns involved.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill confirms the budget changes regarding the increases in excise duty on cigarettes and other tobacco products, alcoholic drinks, road fuels and heavy fuel oil as well as the reduction in the rates of vehicle registration tax on cars and motorcycles and the other reliefs for waste oil and mobile cranes and the like.  It also increases the threshold above which the higher rate of VRT applies from 2012 ccs to 2500 ccs.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the legislative framework to introduce a tax stamp regime for cigarettes.  The provisions, which are mainly technical, deal with the control and collection of the excise duty on cigarettes, deferred payment arrangements <Col N="913" /> and related offences and penalties. In the vehicle licensing area, the Bill contains a number of provisions with the primary aim of safeguarding road tax revenue. They are designed to remove any doubts about the legal status of the national vehicle file regarding vehicle ownership and related matters and to confirm the validity of information contained in certificates taken from the file for evidential purposes.  At the trade's request, the Bill changes the high season period of the limited annual licence, previously from 1 March to 31 August, to 1 April to 30 September so as to better reflect seasonal trading patterns for the amusement machines licences duty.</P>
    <P>Regarding betting duty, the Bill includes an enabling provision which will relieve bets placed at a horse race-meeting, in respect of events taking place elsewhere, of the existing betting duty when the proposed Horseracing Authority, as envisaged in the Horseracing Industry Bill, 1994, is established.  Under the latter Bill, it is proposed to apply a levy for the benefit of racing to such bets at the same rate as the existing betting duty, and this provision avoids the double taxation of such bets.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with VAT. It confirms two important measures for business announced in the budget, the increase in the VAT registration thresholds and the change in the availability of the cash receipts basis of accounting, as well as the extension of VAT to the services of loss adjusters.</P>
    <P>Regarding travelling shows and funfairs, the Bill streamlines the VAT regime applicable to travelling shows and funfairs through providing that all funfairs will be liable at the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent with the exception of gaming and amusement machines which will be standard rated.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces provisions which will considerably simplify the arrangements relating to VAT due on long term leases in cases where the lessee is entitled to full deductibility.  The initiative, which requires EU approval, will reduce significantly the cash-flow burden on such business, particularly in a start-up situation. <Col N="914" /> The Bill also provides for a number of technical changes in order to clarify existing law and to confirm present practice and also to bring Irish law into line with EU VAT law.</P>
    <P>The Bill reduces the RPT house value threshold to £75,000 and the income threshold to £25,000.  The single 1993 RPT rate of 1.5 per cent is replaced by three tiered rates &mdash; 1 per cent for houses valued between £75,000 and £100,000, 1.5 per cent on the value between £100,000 and £150,000 and 2 per cent on the value in excess of £150,000.  A value banding system is introduced and is included for houses valued at up to £100,000.  The Bill introduces concessions for those aged over 65 years, widowed and incapacitated persons along with a provision to deal with hardship cases and an easy payment scheme.  The limit for marginal relief is extended from £30,000 to £35,000 generally and to £40,000 for those aged over 65 years.</P>
    <P>Regarding measures to assist employment and enterprise, the Government is committed to putting conditions in place that will encourage the development of Irish businesses in the interests of promoting employment.  The Government is pursuing this strategy across a number of fronts, not least by prudent and responsible management of the nation's finances, with the resulting positive effects on business confidence and on interest rates and in improving mainstream taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government's employment strategy also involves making the tax code more supportive of employment and enterprise.  This is evidenced by the wide range of pro-jobs measures contained in this year's and last year's Finance Bills. These measures will no doubt reinforce the already high level of business confidence and will play an important part in the Government's strategy of maximising the employment potential of the economy.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to the relieving measures in this year's Bill in respect of capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax, which, I believe, will have a particularly beneficial impact on employment <Col N="915" /> by improving the incentives for entrepreneurs and encouraging them to expand and diversify their businesses.</P>
    <P>The new capital acquisitions tax relief for business assets which I announced in the Budget is a positive recognition of the important role played by family businesses in our economy.  The relief will involve a reduction for CAT purposes in the market value of trade-related business assets which are acquired by gift or inheritance.  The first £250,000 acquired by a beneficiary will be reduced in value by 50 per cent while amounts in excess of £250,000 will receive 25 per cent relief. The Budget proposals in relation to the terms and conditions of the relief have been relaxed in a number of important respects with a view to ensuring that the relief is effective in alleviating the impact of CAT on the transfer of family businesses. The proposal that the beneficiary must work on a full-time basis for the business for a specified period after the gift or inheritance has been dropped. Also, the requirement that the beneficiary must hold a minimum 25 per cent interest in the business has been modified to enable a beneficiary with a minimum 10 per cent interest to qualify where his or her family has a controlling interest, and also where he or she has worked on a full-time basis for the business for at least five years prior to the transfer.  The new relief, which will cover most business activities within the industrial and services sectors, will serve as an important complement to the general reliefs already available for the transfer of businesses from one generation to another.  It will enhance the incentives for those trying to build up businesses and so encourage greater enterprise and effort on their part.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a reduction from 40 per cent to 27 per cent in the rate of capital gains tax for equity investments which are held by individuals for at least five years in small and medium sized trading companies.  It will apply as well to equity investments in companies holding shares in trading companies.  I have been particularly concerned to apply the 27 <Col N="916" /> per cent rate very widely in order to maximise its beneficial impact on investment in job creating enterprises.  Thus, all trading activities, with the exception of those dealing in land, buildings and certain financial assets, will be eligible to qualify for the reduced rate.  So also will all individual investors, whether they are full-time working directors or non-active minority shareholders.  The reduced rate will apply not only to unquoted shares but also to quoted shares which were unquoted at the time they were acquired by the individual investor.</P>
    <P>I have also introduced provisions to cater for shares acquired on foot of a company reorganisation or takeover. The introduction of the 27 per cent rate for equity investment has been warmly welcomed by the business sector and it should serve as a valuable incentive for individuals who invest directly in risk capital in new and developing business ventures.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a considerable widening of the scope of capital gains tax roll-over relief to include most trading activities.  Up to now this relief has been confined to activities falling within the scope of the business expansion scheme. The extended roll-over relief will operate on similar terms to the existing relief and will continue to be targeted at entrepreneurs who work in a full-time capacity for a business in which they have a material interest.  It provides for a deferment of capital gains tax where the proceeds of a disposal of shares in an unquoted company are reinvested in new share capital in another unquoted trading company.  The extended relief will facilitate entrepreneurial mobility and new business start-ups.</P>
    <P>Another measures in the Bill which will enhance the availability of risk capital for Irish business is the increased flexibility provided for special investment accounts. Senators may recall that these accounts were introduced last year in order to provide a competitive equity based investment alternative to the 10 per cent special savings accounts made available to cater for the new situation created by the abolition of exchange controls on foot of our <Col N="917" /> EU commitments.  They enabled life assurance companies, unit trusts and stockbrokers to offer collective investment products with a strong Irish equity content on terms broadly comparable with special savings accounts.</P>
    <P>Under the present arrangements an individual investor can put up to £50,000 in either a special savings account or a special investment account or, alternatively, up to £25,000 in each.  This trade-off situation has tended to inhibit investment in special investment accounts, given the general preference for more secure deposit-based products.</P>
    <P>To facilitate a wider take-up of the equity based products, I have decided to allow investors to invest up to £25,000 in a special investment account &mdash; or £50,000 in the case of a married couple &mdash; without losing any entitlement to deposit money in a special savings account.  I have also eased the requirement to invest a minimum proportion of the special investment account in companies with a market capitalisation of less than £100 million from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. Taken together, the changes provided for in the Bill should, given a positive response from the institutions concerned, help to increase the pool of funds for investment in shares of Irish companies, including smaller companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of measures which, in conjunction with the EU early retirement scheme, will greatly improve the environment for early farm transfers and will be of substantial benefit to farmers.  The measures include a substantial improvement in agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax, relief in respect of probate tax and a new stamp duty relief for young trained farmers.</P>
    <P>The House will already be aware of the significant increase in agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax which was announced in the budget.  By virtue of this enhanced relief, agricultural land and buildings valued over £460,000 may transfer free of gift tax from parent to child.  In the case of inheritances, the comparable tax free entitlement is about £406,000.  Relief, at the rate of 25 per cent, is also being extended to livestock <Col N="918" /> and machinery.  The impact of probate tax on farmers has also been eased considerably with the introduction of 30 per cent relief for land and buildings and a full exemption for spouses.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the Bill provides for a two thirds reduction in the stamp duty chargeable on the transfer of agricultural land and buildings to farmers under 35 years of age who have completed an approved training course.  This will entail a maximum stamp duty rate of just 1 per cent &mdash; down from 3 per cent &mdash; for transfers between relatives and a maximum rate of just 2 per cent &mdash; down from 6 per cent &mdash; for transfers between non-relatives.  The new relief will apply to both gifts and sales and will be operative from 7 January of this year, which is the commencement date for the early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a range of relieving measures in relation to stamp duty which are aimed generally at improving the administration of stamp duties and reducing compliance costs for taxpayers and their agents.  The Bill provides that where both stamp duty and VAT are payable on a property sale or lease, the stamp duty is to be based on the VAT exclusive amount payable rather than on the VAT inclusive amount.  This will have a particularly beneficial effect on commercial property leases.  The stamp duty appeals procedures are being updated so as to ensure that all appeals may be heard in the first instance by the Appeal Commissioners. This will make it easier for taxpayers to exercise their rights of appeal.</P>
    <P>The Bill simplifies the valuation of unquoted shares in private family controlled companies for stamp duty purposes. This will help family businesses. The Bill provides for a substantial reduction in the surcharges which apply when property transferring by voluntary disposition is undervalued for stamp duty purposes.  I am satisfied that stamp duty compliance can be maintained with more moderate surcharges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> The Bill also contains provisions which will enable the Revenue Commissioners to introduce more user-friendly information requirements in relation to property transfer deeds which are presented for stamping.  It is also proposed, after full consultation with the Law Society on operational matters, to require the tax reference numbers of the transferor and transferee to be provided where appropriate. The Bill broadens the scope of the present range of stamp duty exemptions for foreign marketable securities.  This will benefit business and employment at the IFSC.</P>
    <P>Under Chapter I of Part VII of the Bill, I am introducing a major reform of the rules governing residence for tax purposes.  Up to now, these rules and arrangements were based on a mixture of old case law, administrative practice and some statutory provisions.  The various rules and conditions are now being put into legislation for the first time, which will be a great help to the taxpayers affected as well as to tax practitioners and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>As part of this process I have made a number of changes to the existing regime. The provisions in the Bill represent a carefully constructed and balanced package. On the one hand, there is a major simplification of the various tests on residence, which are being reduced from five to two main tests and which involve an easing of the look-back test.  These changes will enable wealthy foreigners to own homes and spend longer periods of time in this country, thereby deepening their economic association with Ireland, which could have significant spin-off benefits. On the other hand, I have closed a potential loophole whereby Irish residents could avail of a facility to effect a clean break of their Irish residence and ordinary residence status so as to immediately avoid a charge to Irish capital gains tax on gains which had built up over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I am also ending the discrimination which has existed between two categories of Irish employees who work abroad.  Up to now, where such employees were paid <Col N="920" /> from here their remuneration was fully subject to Irish income tax, whereas if they were paid from an overseas source the remuneration was only taxed here if it was remitted.  In place of this remittance basis I have introduced a new relief, subject to appropriate conditions, for employees working abroad.</P>
    <P>Finally, in response to points made, I introduced a number of amendments to the residence provisions on Report Stage in the Dáil.  These amendments include transitional arrangements allowing the old rules to apply for 1994-95 in certain situations.  The new package of changes will take full effect for all situations on 6 April 1995.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for taking this legislation this week.  Since we debated the 1993 Finance Bill here, the economic situation has continued to improve in line with what I predicted fairly accurately at that stage.</P>
    <P>This year's Bill was widely welcomed by all parties in the Select Committee. Needless to say, there was debate on some measures; but the Bill in general and its pro business content was welcomed by all parties, for which I am grateful.  The business community is equally important, where the 21 reliefs&mdash; as they are known in the various business magazines &mdash; have been widely welcomed. More has been done for the agricultural sector in this Bill, in addition to what was done last year, than has ever been done for agriculture and I am glad to see that that is widely acknowledged.</P>
    <P>We focused on the small business sector because of the two reports &mdash; the report on the services industry and the task force on small businesses.  We have been able to recognise, in a way which did not happen previously, the importance of that sector.  Last year, with the Government's initiative and the efforts of the Taoiseach to generate activity in this area, we spent the entire year talking to them and working out initiatives which would help to stimulate activity.  I am glad that we have been able to do that along with what is effectively a tax package of £330 million with no VAT increases except in one small area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> This Bill will substantially help to generate an economy which has already gained great momentum.  It is nice to oversee an economy where one month money in the interbank market is at 5.5 per cent, inflation is still less 2 per cent, the balance of payments are in substantial surplus, the budget deficit is on line, and the lowest in the European Union except for Luxembourg, and employment growth is still about third in the European Union.  We still have the acknowledged problem of high unemployment rates because of our demographics and the fact that we have not always turned as much growth as we could into jobs.  However, I think we have a healthy position.</P>
    <P>I know that this Bill, from the comments and analyses which it has received, will continue to generate more employment and activity.  All of the measures in this Bill must be viewed and reviewed in the light of what they achieve for employment. It is no good giving tax reliefs &mdash; as I know the Cathaoirleach would appreciate &mdash; if there are not jobs.  If it only increases profitability without creating employment, then it is not achieving its intended aims.  We are not interested in spreading the wealth in just one direction; it is the wish of this Government for it to be refocused right throughout the community.  This Finance Bill reflects that wish and has been welcomed as such.  I look forward to the debate and to participating on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  There are some aspects of the Bill with which we agree.  Listening to the confident manner in which the Minister spoke, one would think all is well throughout the country.  However, that is not the case and that message will be brought home to the Minister next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with most of the income tax issues on Committee Stage.  There should be some other method for the passage of this Bill through the Seanad, because one or two days are not sufficient.  The sections of the Bill that are not being changed could be introduced earlier and <Col N="922" /> we could then deal with the other sections in the final days.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I will deal with income tax on Committee Stage.  The Minister gives the impression that people are better off in regard to income tax since the last budget, but that is not the case.  When one takes account of the changes in mortgage relief, the majority of people paying tax in this country are much worse off.</P>
    <P>Over the last few weeks the Minister for Finance and the Government have made numerous references to the need for our system of taxation to be fair, just and equitable.  I share those sentiments. If a system of taxation is to enjoy widespread support, it must be seen by citizens to be fair and equitable.  Sadly, many of our citizens do not believe that the Bill either represents or will contribute much to equity, justice or fairness.</P>
    <P>There are three criteria for a fair and just taxation.  First, those with equal wealth should pay the same taxes.  Secondly, those with most wealth should pay most tax; and, finally, taxation should not drive people out of business but enable businesses to thrive.  The present tax code does not meet these criteria.  Those with equal wealth do not pay the same taxes; the most wealthy do not pay the most tax, and the tax code positively injures small businesses.</P>
    <P>Some 80 per cent of Irish businesses pay corporation tax at 10 per cent and the remaining 20 per cent pay tax at the higher rate.  The unfortunate 20 per cent of Irish corporate taxpayers, who proportionately pay more than half the total corporation tax yield, are not the big manufacturing corporations or the wealthy multinationals.  They are small indigenous Irish businesses, which are largely concentrated in the service sector. They represent the business sector which, if subject to a less hostile and unjust tax code, could create the most jobs in the most viable sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>We are often told by doctrinaire and ignorant commentators that the native Irish business sector has failed the Irish community.  There has been no such failure; indeed, the opposite is true.  Native <Col N="923" /> Irish businesses, especially in the service sector, have done remarkably well in the face of a hostile, unfair and inequitable tax code which requires them to pay five times the tax demanded of other businesses.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill does nothing to ensure that all businesses pay the same level of tax on the same profits.  Those with the same wealth from profits should pay the same tax regardless of the source of that wealth.  If it is right that most businesses pay 10 per cent, then justice requires that all businesses should pay 10 per cent.  This is far from the utopian ideal.  The situation demands a universal corporation income tax rate of about 20 per cent.  This would achieve current yields and maintain the principles of equity in taxation.</P>
    <P>While our tax code has numerous inequalities, I propose to deal with two specific examples of the failure of the tax code to meet the principles of fairness and justice.  One is a sin of commission &mdash; the Minister is doing something he ought not to.  The second is a sin of omission &mdash; the Minister is refusing to do something he ought to do.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the first briefly because I am certain that events next June will satisfy the Government that they were wrong.  They ought to have conceded in justice, but they will be compelled to concede in fear of the electorate's hostility. I speak of the residential property tax.  This tax does not meet the requirement that those with equal wealth should pay the same tax or that the most wealthy should pay the most tax.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the market operates means that two people may live in identical homes, both as to size and quality, and have the same income, but one citizen may pay property tax on their home and the other may not.  This essentially happens because one must live in an urban area and the other in a rural area.  There are other faults with the residential property tax, but the single fault I have just described renders this tax unjust and inequitable.  The Government has wooden headedly refused to <Col N="924" /> acknowledge what every dog in the street knows to be true, that is, the residential property tax is an unjust tax which penalises urban dwellers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> I want to discuss another tax, which on the face of it is a smaller issue than the residential property tax.  It is the cruel taxation of indigenous Irish service enterprises. It is a serious issue which raises many important questions about the Government's attitude to tax reform.  It is a classic demonstration of the Government's failure to put in place a just and equitable system of taxation.  It also raises questions about the usefulness of the new Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</P>
    <P>Politics is a resolution of conflicts.  It is not so much about securing the greater good, but maintaining public repose.  It is the same in matters of taxation.  One can restore repose by either ensuring that all benefit equally from a tax law or that none benefits.  Either will restore public repose by maintaining equity and fairness. The Minister was offered both alternatives in relation to a most unfair and inequitable part of the income tax provisions but he failed to accept either. As with the residential property tax, the Minister has singularly failed to maintain the public repose.</P>
    <P>At present the tax treatment of a worker's workday meal, the meal he or she must have during the course of their working duties, may seem a trivial matter.  However, it fails to meet the criteria that equal wealth should pay equal taxes, that the most wealthy should pay the most taxes and that taxation should not injure businesses.  The Minister is aware of these points but on the advice of the taxation unit in his Department or the Revenue Commissioners, or both, he has refused to reform the law to remove inequality and render just what is unjust.</P>
    <P>The issue is simple.  A meal provided in a work or an office canteen by an employer is entirely exempt from taxation. A meal provided elsewhere &mdash; in a restaurant, a cafe or even taken from home &mdash; is not exempt.  Most employers who have canteens make full use of this exemption and rightly so and they pass it on to their employees in the form of subsidised meal costs.  The result is that employees with access to a canteen for <Col N="926" /> their workday meal enjoy a considerable tax advantage over those who do not. Although the benefit varies from employee to employee, the general order of benefit is conservatively estimated at the equivalent of a tax free concession of £2 per worker per working day or half the cost of a meal.  Over the year, this amounts to a tax free concession of at least £440.  It is not a large sum but it is most helpful in some cases to people who are in need or not well off.</P>
    <P>In recognising this, the Revenue Commissioners in 1967 allowed workers, who did not have access to a canteen but who received luncheon vouchers from their employer in lieu, a tax free concession of three shillings; that was about half the cost of a midday meal in those days.  The concession ensured justice and equity; the same wealth paid the same taxes. Today, almost 30 years later, the cost of a worker's workday meal has risen to more than £4, with a corresponding tax benefit of £440 to the worker fortunate enough to have access to a canteen.</P>
    <P>By how much did the voucher concession rise?  Was it by 10-100 per cent to keep pace with inflation?  The voucher concession did not rise by a single penny or a fraction of a penny in those 30 years. The concession remains at three shillings, exactly as it was in 1967; there has been one change, three shillings is now 15p.  Is this not a remarkably generous concession? What would have paid for half the cost of a meal almost 30 years ago will today pay for a cup of coffee.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Minister was asked to raise the concession on vouchers but he refused.  Among other reasons, he claimed that the Revenue might lose too much money and that a change would be discriminatory.  The second point is an argument based on justice, equity and fair play.  By using it, the Minister is attempting to maintain the public repose. If he would not reform the law last year by raising the 15p to £1, he would restore equity by reducing the value of the canteen benefit this year.  Such a solution was proposed by Deputy Yates but it was refused.  Equity has not been restored. <Col N="927" /> Discrimination remains because the same wealth does not pay the same taxes.</P>
    <P>The Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs has a special role in resolving issues such as those I mentioned. Unfortunately, the experience of this Bill and the Finance Bill, 1993, makes it unlikely that the Select Committee can perform this role satisfactorily, primarily because insufficient time is allowed.  Its deliberations are rendered unsatisfactory because it is subject to a guillotine.  As a result, financial legislation is adopted but its details are not properly tested by the committee. The Minister should invite the Select Committee to go into special session in order to consider in detail the many issues raised in this and the other House.  If necessary, the Select Committee should be empowered to call witnesses, especially people from the small business community who have personal knowledge of the bad effects of the tax code on indigenous industries.  Such an inquiry would be most useful.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's anxiety to be fair, the Bill is seriously unfair.  It does not ensure that equal wealth pays equal taxes or that those with the most wealth pay the most taxes.  Most assuredly, it does not enable businesses to thrive. Many of the provisions may be good but just as the curate's egg was spoiled by the bad parts so too is the Bill spoiled by its bad parts, whether by commission or omission.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, 1994, is a major disappointment. It represents a substantial increase in the tax payable by home owners and in such cases it will substantially increase the tax take from those in the middle income sector.  We will oppose this Bill because it does not set out any serious strategy to enhance employment prospects through tax reform.  We have the highest level of emigration and the second highest unemployment rate in Europe.  Our performance will have to improve dramatically if it is to be considered adequate.  The Bill deals only with these issues in the context of closing the odd <Col N="928" /> loophole, accompanied by the marginal shifts and technical adjustments.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget speech made small changes in relation to bus operators reclaiming VAT on buses.  I raised this issue during the debate on the Finance Bill, 1993.  I thank the Minister for making those small changes but it is obvious that they only go part of the way.  The reclaiming of VAT should be extended to all types of buses, whether they are second hand or new.  It should also be extended to bus operators to enable them to reclaim VAT on diesel.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister has made no change to the tax treatment of benefit in kind.  The provisions of the 1994 budget were savage.  I ask the Minister to redress this in the 1995 budget.  Prior to the last election, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party gave solemn promises that they would not tamper with mortgage interest relief.  They accused each other of being unreliable on this issue.  These promises have been disregarded.  I assure the House that the electorate will deal with this on 9 June.</P>
    <P>Those on middle incomes feel under siege from this Government; middle income can be defined as those with a joint income in excess of the average industrial wage.  The first assault was on the entitlements of insured workers under the PRSI system.  They are being asked to pay more PRSI for fewer entitlements. There was an aborted attempt to means test contributory widows' pensions.  Pay related benefit has been abolished for those who become ill or unemployed. The taxation of unemployment benefit is particularly insidious for those who have one spouse working and one unemployed. Those on short time or seasonal work have been devastated by the changes. They will soon conclude that they should not work any longer.  Middle income earners do not have medical cards but try to provide for their own health care costs as best they can.  They are part of the 1.3 million people in the VHI who have to pay their own doctor and pharmacy bills.  Section 8 of the Finance Bill raises the threshold for claiming <Col N="929" /> medical expenses for a single person from £50 to £100 and for a family from £150 to £300.  This will restrict tax refunds on medical care and can only be construed as a tax on illness.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 7 to standardise VHI tax relief over the next two years is another attack on self-reliant people.  It will make VHI membership more expensive at a time when the VHI faces the prospect of competition and increasing charges by the Government for private health facilities in public hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The combined effect of the mortgage and VHI standardisation provisions sends out a clear message to those on middle incomes which is that they could and should pay more tax.  Any review of the tax system over the last decade shows that the impact of the income tax code on parents has been particularly harsh when combined with the social welfare system.  A disincentive has emerged against those in employment. Poverty traps have been created through the entitlement to fringe benefits based on gross pay for those at work, while gross and net incomes remain the same for those on social welfare.  There is no recognition of the cost of rearing children in the income tax code in the form of basic tax free allowances.  The role of the spouse who has given up employment to work full time in the home is totally ignored in the tax treatment of the spouse at work.  All these factors need to be changed.  Fine Gael believes that families must be supported through tax reforms with the cost of families formally acknowledged in our tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is only partially implementing the recommendations of the Tax Force for Small Businesses.  It is estimated that three out of every four new jobs created will be in small enterprises. It is a great pity that the Government could not have lowered the rate of corporation profits tax for companies with profits of less than £80,000 to the <Col N="930" /> standard rate of 27 per cent.  Similarly no concession was made in the case of dividend income up to £7,000 per year for full-time directors.</P>
    <P>The modification of capital gains tax on business assets held over six years is wholly inadequate.  Small businesses are at a distinct disadvantage even when it comes to banking terms.  Special concessions should be given to small businesses especially in rural areas and in small towns, and particularly to those businesses which are family owned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not happy.  The small rural family business, whether it be a shop, pub or other form of small concern, will soon be a thing of the past. The Minister should seriously consider providing special concessions for these people, otherwise there will be no small rural businesses left.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has stated that he is now in favour of a third banking force. This Government gives the impression that it clearly does not understand where it is going because only a few weeks ago the Minister was in favour of selling the partly State-owned Trustee Savings Bank.  Surely there would be no logic in this.  On the one hand, you would be setting up a third banking force while, on the other, selling a State-owned bank.  To my mind, the two things do not go hand in hand and that is a great error on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see from this week's papers that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, wants to meet with the banks to set up a policy review committee comprised of officials from his Department and bank representatives.  It is time for the Minister for Finance to get the State-owned bank, the ICC, to lead the way and reduce its interest rates on loans to small businesses.  The reason interest rates for small business are so high is that there are more small businesses than large ones.  The risks and <Col N="931" /> failure rate of small businesses is much higher than with big business; and the banks have to make provision for this. The Minister should introduce measures to give guarantees and reduce the risks to the banking fraternity in relation to small businesses.  The banks will then be in a position to reduce their rates for small business loans in line with what they charge the larger businesses otherwise this will be seen as a cosmetic exercise for the pending local and European elections as well as the two Dáil by-elections.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made a big announcement calling on the banks to reduce their interest rates knowing full well that the Central Bank was about to reduce its rate.  People will not be fooled by this because everybody knows that money rates are market driven.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no research and development policy in this country and the ISO 900 is of little importance to the majority of companies.  We need a strong Department of Industry to give money directly &mdash; with no agencies involved &mdash; to the manufacturers, the people who will improve our manufacturing base and our industries.  Between 200 and 300 patents go through the Patent Office each week. What happens to them?  It takes years to put a patent through.  The other day I was in the Belmullet area where three industries are manufacturing items that will be world market leaders when they are developed.  One is a prototype tent based on a lorry and was used by U2's stage manager in America.  It accommodates 200 to 300 people seated at round tables, can be erected in 20 to 30 minutes and transported to any part of the country.  The Minister will probably <Col N="932" /> be able to hold his next ard-fheis in one of those tents in any part of the country. It is ideas like this the Government should be examining and they should provide capital directly to those manufacturers rather than going through agencies.  That company got a better response from Údarás na Gaeltachta than from the IDA.  I know it is in the Údarás area but they latched on to this idea much more quickly than the IDA, and I want to give them credit for that.</P>

      <P>The time it takes people with ideas to get patents was brought home to us and that suggests that there needs to be a shake-up in this area.</P>
      <P>The tax treatment of investments still militates heavily against enterprise.  Our rate of new businesses established annually is half that of Europe and America. Value added tax remains our second most significant tax with receipts of over £2.5 billion this year.  The Minister said he is raising the tax threshold for both goods and services thus relieving very small businesses of the obligations associated with tax registration.  I will discuss this provision on Committee Stage.  The thresholds have been raised from £15,000 to £20,000 and from £20,000 to £40,000. The business with a threshold of £20,000 should be exempt from VAT because a person who earns £21,000 is at a distinct disadvantage to the person turning over £20,000.  There should be a system to help those below a certain limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has still not seen fit to give any concession to the clothing and footwear industries despite their employment, at retail level, of 30,000 people.  The top rate of VAT at <Col N="933" /> 21 per cent is simply too high.  The Minister will have enormous problems with VAT harmonisation in 1996 if the current proposals are implemented and progress is not made in reducing the top rate.  We have a good clothing industry and the Minister should look seriously at this matter.  John Rocha, one of our clothing designers, won the British Designer of the year Award and that was a significant help to the Irish clothing industry but that industry is hampered by this unjust VAT rate of 21 per cent.  It puts our clothing manufacturers at a distinct disadvantage because those who import such goods no longer have to pay VAT at the point of entry.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Department of Finance is working on the introduction of rates by the back door.  It is common knowledge that this Government intends to introduce a tax on every house in the country.  I am delighted that the writ for the west Mayo by-election was moved this morning.  The people of west Mayo will not accept the introduction of rates and they will give the Government that message on 9 June.</P>
    <P>In 1993 Ireland attracted over 3.25 million overseas tourists who spent an estimated £955 million.  This is an increase of £451 million since 1987 and a growth of 60 per cent in real terms.  Since 1987 tourism has created over 28,000 new jobs in the economy.  This represents more than one third of all new jobs created in Ireland.  In many studies the tourism industry in the west has been highlighted as an area of great potential and the recent bishops' initiative in the west called for proactive Government policies in that regard.  Recent public comment from the Minister for Tourism and Trade suggests less Government intervention and this is a cause of concern to disadvantaged areas such as the west where the infrastructure remains underdeveloped compared to other regions.</P>
    <P>The loss in registered accommodation has been compensated for by the growth in home and self-catering accommodation. However, the registered sector has potential for higher value added and provides more employment <Col N="934" /> opportunities.  The cause of the loss of registered accommodation should be examined and an instrument incentive should be introduced to address this situation. If the Minister for Tourism and Trade adopts the policy of reducing Government intervention and expects the tourism industry to intervene on its own behalf, it follows that those regions with a well developed tourism product and large private sector players will intervene on their own behalf.  This policy will only serve to exacerbate the present imbalance.  In addition, such a policy is contrary to the policy called for in the bishops' initiative and the response of the Taoiseach.  More regional marketing is required to enhance the profile of the west and relieve congested areas in peak season.  We should be allowed to develop under-developed regions with Government incentives.  The playing pitch is not level.</P>
    <P>An article headed &ldquo;£3m marketing campaign aimed at increasing US tourist numbers&rdquo; was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.

    <P>The Finance Bill is the third leg of the autumn-spring treble.  The first leg is the annual expenditure review and control in the allocation for public expenditure is a very important part of that exercise.  The second leg is the budget which gives effect to tax adjustments made on the basis of the Government's decisions on public expenditure.  The third leg of the treble is the Finance Bill which gives legislative effect to the provisions in the annual budget.  The third leg of the treble which the Minister has introduced today is perhaps the most successful of the three stage treble.  It contains the most comprehensive list of instruments and incentives <Col N="936" /> for the promotion of the enterprise culture, particularly in small businesses.</P>

      <P>We have achieved that and we have consistently and vigorously maintained it.  I take some small, modest credit for these achievements because I was happy to be a member of the Government in which the foundations for this healthy condition were firmly laid; the economic and fiscal policies of the 1987 Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> It has not been sufficiently recorded, much less adequately recognised, that the current Minister for Finance, in his role as Minister for Labour in that Government, played a huge role in bringing to fruition our effective strategy under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> part of the overall correction of the public finances.  No other person in Government would have been able to establish the relationship with the labour unions, maintain discipline and partnership with them and make them part of the successful economic development programme now firmly in place.  I think it was the view of all his colleagues of the time, including myself, that no one was as well equipped to do that as Deputy Ahern.</P>
    <P>Having been in the forefront when the difficult decisions were made, it is appropriate that he is now able to develop the economy.  Those decisions were hard but they were necessary and they have released the economy from the overburdening weight of public expenditure and ever increasing borrowing which were crucial problems during those years. Before we can have a Finance Bill such as that introduced by the Minister today, we must regulate and control public expenditure.  That has been a successful criterion of this Government and of the Government which preceded it, which initially took those difficult decisions.</P>
    <P>All international bodies and commentators recognise that Ireland's performance has exceeded that of every other European and western economy. That is a matter of great pride and it has also been a major incentive for external investment.  Investment consultants around the world meet every day to examine the fiscal parameters of every country and the decisions they make in advising their clients will be influenced by the economic conditions in the countries they observe.</P>
    <P>All sources indicate that signals about Ireland are extremely positive.  By comparison with almost any other country in the developed world, we have achieved great consistency in maintaining low inflation, stable Government, strong <Col N="938" /> growth patterns and a positive balance of payments.  These are the parameters which influence investment decisions.</P>

      <P>The trends in 1994 look even healthier than those in 1993. Even last year Ireland had the strongest growth rate in the EU, with GDP growth of between 2.25 and 2.5 per cent compared to a decline of 0.5 per cent in GDP in the EU as a whole.  Not for the first time we were out of line with the rest of Europe.  Previously when we were out of step, other countries were growing and we were contracting.  Senator Cregan will remember the dreadful 1970s and the even more dismal 1980s.  I am happy to say we are still out of line but for different reasons.  Now other countries are contracting but we are growing and expanding under all known criteria.  It is quite clear from the pattern of this Finance Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator and I know, and the IMF, the OECD, the Government, the EU and the European Commission all acknowledge, that Ireland is the healthiest investment base in the developed world.  The IMF and the OECD predict a gradual upturn in the world economy, with growth doubling to approximately 2.5 per cent.  The expectation is that even the EU should return to modest positive growth after the GDP decline in 1993 and this economy is poised to take advantage of the EU upturn.  Government actions over the years have laid the basis and this Finance Bill will further secure that position.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan has raised an appropriate and relevant question.  When will we see this translated into extra jobs? Everyone has a role to play here and when Government does its job, all other institutions must play their appropriate role.  It is especially important for the banking sector and other financial institutions to contribute.  We have had effective Government action but it must be supported and sustained by consistent moves from the financial institutions and the banking sector.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the healthy economic climate, with low inflation and a strong balance of payments position, has created a positive climate for the financial institutions in Ireland.  This positive climate is reflected in the buoyant profits of all the major banks in recent times.  No one is about to sharply criticise those profits but that could not happen without Government action over the years; almost all of these have been record profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> The consistent pattern of improved performance in shareholder dividends and bank profits is reflected in a statement by the chief executive of one bank in today's newspapers.  This is an extraordinary statement but highly significant. Reporting a 39 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, he referred to his bank as a &ldquo;boring profitable bank&rdquo;.  Is it not lovely to be a &ldquo;boring profitable bank&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Quinn, who has experience in the enterprise sector, would love to be able to say that his successful enterprise is a boring profitable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been that way for the last couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the reason for this boring profitability may be that the climate for profitability is so positive that one does not have to work too hard to earn the profits.  Profitability may be a feature of the banking scene these days but it is not a consistent feature of the most vigorous, sophisticated and determined enterprise, particularly in the manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>I have great regard for the services sector in which Senator Quinn is involved.  It also has a major role to play, but it will never talk in terms of boring profitability.  One of the reasons for this is that the enterprise sector, whether manufacturing or services, and particularly small businesses, is experiencing difficulties raising adequate working capital at reasonable rates to finance their growth plans.  They will never complain about boring predictable profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that all the European surveys of the enterprise sector acknowledge that in Ireland the climate for investment is top of the league as a positive <Col N="941" /> boost to profitable investment.  However, we need and we are entitled to vigorous support from the banking sector to ensure that the healthy environment for profits will also be converted into a positive environment for employment.  As Senator Cregan correctly suggested, that is the only significant test as far as the people are concerned.  Anyone who has experience of dealing with the public will know that it is of little relevance to talk in terms of fiscal aggregates and parameters unless job security for the wage earner or the family is at the base.  That is why we all have a role to play.  I will discuss the details later because I do not want to repeat what the Minister has outlined.</P>
    <P>The funding operations in Ireland, through the financial institutions, are limited and expensive, particularly for small business and those on overdrafts or involved in leasing.  While this short term arrangement may be profitable for the banks, it is costly and onerous for the enterprise sector, particularly the small sector on which we rely to generate much needed employment.  The banks and financial institutions must develop an enterprise promotion culture and a partnership attitude to the enterprise sector.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to my time as Minister for Agriculture when there was a crucial need in the agricultural sector, which was the base of the productive manufacturing sector, to increase our national breeding herd.  This was critical for our economy. I had consultations with the banks, the industry and the then Minister for Finance to ensure that we could give special incentives, by way of reduced interest rates, to that sector to build up our national herd in which they had an interest and where they had made their profits over the years.  One of the major banks &mdash; I will leave it to the people to find out which &mdash; refused to co-operate in that vital national programme and, as a result, the other banks felt they could not participate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>They should have been made co-operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I outlined to this bank that it had made its profits over the years from the productive agricultural sector, it still would not play its appropriate role in building up our national asset.  We did it without this banks' help, although we experienced some difficulties. Now it enjoys the benefits and profitability of a healthy cattle and beef sector.  The partnership of risk and investment is an essential feature which has not been a factor in Irish financial institutions. If one is a big customer, one can negotiate terms, but the small customer, who is trying to improve his situation, is not in that privileged position.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the Japanese economy, among others, because, over the years, its success has been firmly rooted in an enterprising and risk taking culture in the financial institutions.  Each one has an enterprise manager involved at every level of its operations.  They are partners in risk and in profit and they have been the foundation of the Japanese success. The same can be said of Germany.  It is time our financial institutions took the same approach because all the objective reports on the Irish economy underline the anomaly between strong economic performance and continuing record levels of unemployment.  No one wants to overstate or aggravate their significance, despite recent improvements.  Spain has a higher level of unemployment than we have; the Greeks and the Portuguese have a different way of calculating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an enthusiast for many of the massaged training schemes.  I would prefer to give the enterprise sector the opportunity to do things themselves rather than having State <Col N="943" /> intervention through a range of agencies and schemes.  The incentive for business is the opportunity for reasonable profit and reinvestment in successful enterprise.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach recently pointed out, the gap between the interest on large demand deposits, for example, and the interest paid on loans for working capital for small business has widened from 2.75 per cent in 1979 to approximately 10.75 per cent recently and now 10.5 per cent. I was the Minister for Finance in 1979. We made some mistakes collectively, but we laid the basis for some things which were right.  I was concerned to ensure that as far as possible a reasonable relationship between interest paid on deposits and interest paid on loans for working capital, in particular, would be maintained.  We have come a long way since then.  It is right and proper to remind that privileged and protected sector of our economy that the economy is not only there to maintain its profitability on the basis of such disparities.</P>
      <P>With such a buoyant economic climate and such generous profits for the banking sector in particular, it is time to radically review the role of the financial institutions in the economy, particularly their protected positions in relation to interest rates and banking charges.  Small businesses, people who are trying to start-up a business, or people looking for loan funding are aware of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that there is disaffection for banking services at a time of unprecedented economic growth and stability; that is an extraordinary criticism.  It is equally significant that disenchantment with the banking system is reflected in the growth of the credit union movement. I have nothing but admiration for the credit union movement.  It will continue to grow because people believe credit unions share the commitment and the deposit responsibility but it also shares the reduced level of interest on borrowings. It is one of the huge growth <Col N="944" /> areas in the community.  The credit union movement is now a feature of Irish life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is big business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is big business.  We will also see growth in community based financial co-operatives.  We cannot ignore this.  Although I admire those involved in enterprise &mdash; there are two Members on the other side of the House at present involved in business &mdash; I could not have been a successful businessman.  However, I had some notion as to what made that particular creature and what gave him the incentive to expand.  That is not being provided by the financial services sector at present.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable to assume &mdash; it would be unthinkable to change policies which are now firmly in place &mdash; that if the Government adhere to the programme of the prudent management of public finances in operation since 1987, the level of external confidence in the economy will continue and it will guarantee continued and even increased levels of investment.  Indications I get from sources outside suggest that is a positive signal at this time.  To achieve continued and increased levels of investment it must, as a matter of urgency, be reflected in a real and sustainable increase in employment.  If that is to be achieved, the profits which have been a consistent feature of the banking sector must become a characteristic of the efficient enterprise sector.  Those involved in that sector are taking the risk but this can only be done with a more supportive and positive policy on the part of the banking sector toward new and small business in particular.</P>
      <P>Even if this was done I do not believe that small indigenous industry could present itself as a boring and profitable business.  It is essential that it should be able to present itself as a productive and employment creating enterprise and it is entitled to support from the banking system rather than the frustration it experiences in the pursuit of the national priority &mdash; employment creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> I would like to refer to a number of areas in the Bill.  The Minister targeted the areas where we need to indicate our continued support by way of tax concessions. I agree with a lot of what Senator Burke said, but he was mistaken when he said there was no mention of an incentive for research and development, particularly by way of relief on patent royalties.  With others, I lobbied the Minister in relation to relief for patent royalties.  I made a strange case to him; my proposal would target relief on patent royalties more effectively to ensure those who use it for bona fide research and development programmes would benefit as distinct from those using it for purposes other than what it was intended.</P>
    <P>If one dissipates the results of reliefs or incentives of this nature, they become less effective for those for whom they were intended.  Significantly, it was the financial institutions, not all the banks, and others which used that provision in existing legislation to get a benefit intended for those who invest in research and development and employ graduates. One such company is located in the Cathaoirleach's home town and it is important to employment in that sector.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Minister amended the legislation to ensure selective targeting of enterprises engaged in vigorous and constant research and which are developing important patents and earning significant royalties.  I hope that, because it will no longer apply willy-nilly to others, it will be an incentive to the manufacturing sector to engage in appropriate research and development and to earn effective royalties from patents which will continue to enjoy relief.</P>
    <P>The tourism sector is of vital importance to the economy and it provides a major employment quota.  The Minister has made significant proposals in respect of tax breaks for hotel development.  In spite of what we would like to think, we do not have a hotel sector in terms of accommodation or services comparable to what is available in other countries.</P>
    <P>I am happy that Egon Ronay recently recorded that we have some hotels at the top setting a standard which many others <Col N="946" /> are trying to emulate.  While this will guarantee continued development and expansion, that standard must be followed and emulated by others which are not at that level.  France, Italy, and Switzerland, for example, have built their tourism industry not only on the basis of the sun &mdash; we may like to believe that &mdash; but also on quality service at all levels. The Minister's targeting of the hotel sector is on the button.  I have no doubt that given the positive attitude to Ireland, its culture, its climate in every sense of the word and its people, who are usually good humoured, now is the right time to target the hotel sector.</P>
    <P>Because of my most recent experience in Government, I would be expected to refer to the farm sector.  I am happy this sector has been specifically targeted because allowances cannot be spread all over the place.  The improved annual allowance for farm buildings is important. This is an area about which I was concerned in terms of animal health, which is of crucial importance, and hygiene standards, which is equally important when developing a food sector.  We cannot have an effective food sector &mdash; this is a priority for many Members &mdash; without a healthy, efficient and hygienic production sector.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improved annual allowances the Minister has introduced.  The measures exempting spouses from probate tax will have a very positive effect in rural Ireland.  It was a matter of major contention and great concern and I hope that, together with the other income tax changes &mdash; which I do not propose to go into detail now &mdash; which apply to everyone, it will have a significant positive effect.</P>
    <P>There is an enterprising group in the agriculture area called the Farm Relief Service Group.  They are a group of young people from Macra na Feirme who saw a need to provide a service to farmers who may want to take a holiday or who may be ill.  These young people &mdash; I had the privilege of meeting and working with them &mdash; launched the farm relief services, which has been a great success.  Anyone who has dealings with them will recognise <Col N="947" /> they are providing a vital service in rural Ireland.  They are also injecting a level of knowledge and professionalism into those farm enterprises.</P>
    <P>I am selecting certain elements of the Bill because I could not go through all of them.  I am happy the Minister has selected this service for exemption from corporation tax on the basis of payments earned from Government.  That is of considerable significance.</P>
    <P>We have tried to maximise the advantages of what we have.  Clearly the confidence of our people in terms of our culture in the broadest sense is a great new feature.  I have always appreciated our culture and the more I came into contact with other cultures the more I appreciated our own as being part of the universal culture.</P>
    <P>People are now aware of the contribution our music, song, dance and particularly our film making industry can make to the future of this country and I am happy to see that recognised in the Finance Bill.  Most people will say the Finance Bill does not have much to do with it, but I welcome the role of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who is enthusiastically committed to promoting our culture in its broadest sense.  The fact that he has been given a new role in relation to tax relief for investment in Irish film making companies in consultation with the Minister for Finance will create a confident environment.</P>
    <P>I have become very conscious, through my contact with people from other countries, that they see great prospects in Ireland, particularly where culture related activities are concerned.  It is right that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should have a role in defining which film making companies should benefit from the very special tax exemptions that have been introduced. That is a very important feature of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I suppose I will be forgiven, as others have been, for being a little parochial. Senator Burke, with the by-election in west Mayo in mind, made a plea for <Col N="948" /> further support for the college in Castlebar. There is to my knowledge, no by-election pending in north Tipperary, but there is an institution there which has been researched and developed with all the best advice not just in Ireland but from other countries as well &mdash; the Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute.  I hope that in terms of national priority, not just because Thurles needs it, although God knows it does, but because of our need for an enterprise attitude in rural development, the concept will be supported vigorously by the Government as has been the development in Castlebar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke said that the Minister has a role to play &mdash; I hope I do not quote him out of context &mdash; in helping small business by reducing the risk to the banking fraternity in their funding of small businesses.  There he and I are diametrically opposed.  I do not see it as a role of the Government to reduce a risk to the banking fraternity in their dealings with small business or any other business.  I hope I did not misunderstand what Senator Burke said, the way to reduce risk to the banking fraternity &mdash; and that is important &mdash; is to create the right climate for investment, inflation must be reduced, public expenditure must be controlled, and the Government must not respond to every demand for funding.  The risk to the banking fraternity is not reduced by giving them extra money or subsidies to pass on to small businesses.  There Senator Burke and I are in direct confrontation, at least on what I understood him to say.  We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to go into detail.  I am glad of the opportunity to welcome the consistent and positive trend which is evident once again in this Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill. I listened carefully to Senator O'Kennedy's, to Senator Burke's and to the <Col N="949" /> Minister's speeches.  The Finance Bill is one of the most important and complex pieces of legislation to come before the Oireachtas each year.  We need to look at how this law is now being handled because it gives rise to some concern.  A massive and highly technical Bill of 74 pages is disposed of in the Seanad in less than two days' debate, and the guillotine at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot give this Bill meaningful scrutiny in that limited time. Let us look at how the Bill is treated in the Oireachtas as a whole.  We are entitled to do this in general terms without encroaching on anybody's privileges. There should be concern about the extent to which the detailed scrutiny of this Bill in the other House has become virtually invisible to the general public as a result of it being debated in a Special Committee. That is an unexpected side effect of the Special Committee arrangements, which in general are very good.  A substantial amount of totally new material was introduced by way of Government amendment at relatively late stages in the process in the other House &mdash; on Committee and Report Stages.  An example of this was the new chapter on taxation on residences.  That meant that a great deal of the very limited time that was available was spent dealing with this new material, and it created a highly undesirable impression of legislation being passed without proper attention being given to it.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties involved here.  Some of this crowding is clearly due to the Government's very heavy legislative programme but that presumably will not go on for ever.  I am talking about the legislative programme, not the Government.  We will have to find a better way of coping with the increasing complexity and the sheer length of the finance legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not like me to make a complaint without making a concrete proposal to <Col N="950" /> solve it.  This Bill falls into two broad areas, one is fairly straightforward which puts into effect the provisions in January's budget with regard to the rates of tax and exemptions.  The other element is the more detailed, more technical and more obvious matters not dealt with in the budget.  A good deal of the Bill is new legislation, some of it involving quite important principles and all of it deserving far more scrutiny than either House can give it under the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>I propose that from now on we should split the Finance Bill into two Bills &mdash; Finance Bill No. 1 and Finance Bill No. 2.  The first Bill could be introduced soon after the budget and would deal with routine matters.  That part of the legislation is relatively easy to draft; I suggest, with due respect to the draftsmen, that a good deal of it could be done by a word processor.  A precedent would be the annual Social Welfare Bill which gives effect to the relevant provisions of the budget.  It appears fairly smartly and gets adequate scrutiny in both Houses.  Soon after the budget, side by side with the Social Welfare Bill, we should have the first of the Finance Bills to deal with the relatively routine matters.  That would relieve some of the time pressures.</P>
    <P>All the other provisions could be dealt with in the second Finance Bill.  This could be taken at this time of the year or in the autumn with the provisions, perhaps, not coming into effect until the following year.  It could be slotted into the legislative schedule in a way that would allow quite detailed scrutiny and a full discussion of matters that would involve important principles.  Under this new arrangement the second Bill could be initiated in this House.  I am aware that the power of this House to amend the provisions of such Bills are limited if, indeed, they exist at all, but that does not matter greatly.  This House has the expertise to make a real contribution to the passing of finance legislation but it cannot do so in the context of the mini debate we try to squeeze into two days.</P>
    <P>My comments on this Bill will be mostly of a general nature.  It is desirable <Col N="951" /> that a clear trend be established in Finance Bills over a number of years.  Citizens should get a clear and consistent message as to where policy is going in its approach to taxation.  I am concerned that, when we look at this Bill in the context of its predecessors, we come across a message &mdash; if we can see one at all &mdash; that is, at best, muddied.  I do not have to tell the Minister or his officials that there is an inexorable logic about the arithmetic of taxation.  Unless we suddenly strike oil, and we seem to have given up hope of that in recent years, the amount we have to raise from taxation in the future will not be significantly less than we need now.  On that basis we have two options.  We can have a wide tax base at low tax rates, or a narrow tax base at high tax rates.  We cannot lower tax rates without widening the tax base.  There are two ways to do that &mdash; more taxes and/or fewer exemptions to taxes or no exemptions at all.</P>
    <P>What message does this Bill send out on the trend in taxation?  Successive Finance Bills should give the same message year after year, which is that the long-term consistent trend is toward widening the tax base and lowering rates.  Unfortunately, the message is a little muddied &mdash; it is a question of one step forward and, sometimes, two steps back.  Even within the confines of this year's Bill we have attempts to widen the base and attempts to narrow the base uneasily sitting side by side.  One of the difficulties created is that the people who stand to lose by any particular widening of the base feel they have been hard done by.</P>
    <P>Blue murder has been screamed at the Minister over the past few months. People are not against tax reform when it applies to them, rather they are against it when it seems arbitrary and unfair and when the principle of widening is being contradicted by narrowing at the same time and by the creation of new exemptions and new reliefs.  After the budget the Minister was heard to observe rather bitterly, and understandably, that if people could not swallow the relatively modest extension of the residential property <Col N="952" /> tax there was little hope for general tax reform.  I disagree; tax reform can be sold if it is seen to be fair and consistent. Consistency is the key; picking a principle and applying it year after year until the job is done.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem is that the debate on tax reform has been about lowering tax rates instead of convincing people that the only way to lower tax rates is by widening the tax base.  That is what the discussion should be about.  If it was about that people could eventually be persuaded that a wider base is a worthwhile price to pay for lower tax rates. As long as we restrict the debate about taxation to the sole question of lowering taxes we are building up expectations on which we cannot deliver now or in the future.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing totally against using the tax system to stimulate economic activity.  The urban renewal incentives have been quite effective in speeding up a process that might never have taken place without them.  What we have done to attract inward investment, most recently in financial services, is worthwhile and the Minister is to be congratulated on it.  This is all right when it happens on the margins but when incentives and exemptions start to erode the tax base &mdash; as has been the case for many years &mdash; the time has come to put the process decisively into reverse and clearly signal that as the direction which is being taken.  It is a point of principle of which the Minister is aware and I urge and encourage him to strengthen his resolve in that regard.  It is a sales job that has to be done.</P>
    <P>I would highlight a few aspects of how easy it is for the tax system to become dysfunctional and end up doing exactly what it should not do.  It springs from the fact that every distortion entered into the system usually has a bad as well as a good effect and sometimes the bad effect can outweigh the good.  One distortion which made sense at one time but which now seems downright dangerous for the future is the favourable treatment which has been given for over 30 years to manufacturing at the expense of services.  I was <Col N="953" /> interested to hear Senator O'Kennedy speak about this matter, so I hope I am not just speaking as a vested interest.</P>
    <P>Service companies pay corporation tax at a rate four times higher than manufacturing companies.  That made sense when it was introduced originally. However, it does not make sense any longer because the service sector is where the jobs will be created in the future. Indeed, all present growth in employment is in this area.  This system penalises the areas that can address our most serious national problem.  There must be something wrong with that principle. How long will we go on perpetrating that out of date policy?  I do not know, but it should be tackled.</P>
    <P>The second distortion that this Finance Bill is in the process of introducing is putting a premium on businesses staying small.  This discourages them from growing. I have long been a champion of small businesses &mdash; I have spoken often about them in this House &mdash; and I am glad to see they are getting some of the attention they lacked for many years and I congratulate the Minister for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister was clearly impressed by the report of the Task Force on Small Business &mdash; he often referred to it in his speech &mdash; and has taken steps to do something about it.  In reaching out to encourage small business, we are in danger of thinking it is worthwhile to encourage small business only because they are small.  The reverse should be the case.  We want to encourage small businesses to become bigger and to grow. Our emphasis should be on growing businesses, not small ones.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the provisions in this Bill extend concessions to businesses only as long as they stay below a certain size.  Of course that is not the intention of this Bill, but it will have the effect of discouraging growth beyond a certain point.  As anyone in the development agencies will say, a major problem is that many companies are not motivated to grow because they are doing well at their present size.  The State has a vested interest in encouraging them to grow, instead of confirming and endorsing their <Col N="954" /> reluctance to do so, and we have to be careful not to encourage the wrong approach.  This provision must sound to somebody thinking of investing and taking on more people that they are okay as long as they do not get any bigger because if they do, they lose those benefits. That is not the intention of the Bill, but there is a danger of it happening.  I know the Minister is aware of it and he will try to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The last distortion is an area in which I have direct personal experience and a vested interest.  I raised this matter on last year's Finance Bill and I got the impression the Minister listened sympathetically to my point of principle.  I want to return to it now because not enough has been done in this area.  This distortion arises with family companies as they compete with other kinds of companies &mdash; public and foreign.  Family companies, even after the concessions in this Bill have to provide for passing on their shareholding in a way that is different to other companies; on the death of the holder.  The State, in section 60 of the 1985 Act, encourages families to be prudent and to take out insurance to cover the tax liability.  The distortion arises because it imposes an extra running cost on that family business which reduces its ability to compete on a level playing field with non-family businesses.  The world marketplace is getting increasingly competitive and the family business is competing with one hand tied behind its back. Each year the owner has to take money out of the business; public companies do not have to do that.  The Minister has taken steps to remedy this but it still places that family business, which is another growth area, at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>First, the expense of the insurance has to be met each year.  That cost is, in effect, almost doubled because it is not allowed as a business expense and has to be paid out of net rather than gross income.  I am not making any special plea.  The State has an interest in helping family businesses to make the transition from one generation to another as smoothly as possible.  That is the only way we will maintain those businesses <Col N="955" /> and jobs.  That was recognised in the 1986 Act.  The inadvertent consequence of that provision is that it handicaps family businesses competing with other types of companies, including foreign ones.  That is yet another case of how easy it is for the tax system to have consequences which were not anticipated or intended but still could be the outcome of a well intended measure.  We penalise the area where the main jobs are &mdash; services; we encourage companies to stay small when the real objective should be to make them grow and we make it harder for the family firm, which is the backbone of the economy and job creation, to compete effectively in the marketplace.  I am concerned about these areas, and so is the Minister.  I believe he will take steps to ensure these anomalies do not have the wrong effect.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the provisions of this Bill; I have concerns about others, but we should find a better way to deal with this crucially important legislation year after year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech and the general trend of the Finance Bill.  I can see in it measures that will encourage employment and enterprise. Unemployment and emigration have bedevilled this country through our history, and not only today.</P>
      <P>When discussing the budget we are referring to broad multi-part units.  There is no manna from heaven here as far as giving concessions is concerned.  They have to be financed from taxation.  The focus of this year's Bill is a series of policies to assist in the creation of sustainable employment.  That is done through tax reform, especially in the personal income tax level, and in a variety of measures the Minister has introduced to build up competitiveness, to promote the use of our natural resources and to stimulate and reward genuine enterprise. I am glad the Minister took into account the views expressed by the Task Force on Small Business and the Task Force on Jobs in Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made special concessions with regard to the special capital <Col N="956" /> gains tax rate for individuals in respect of shares in unquoted trading companies. The aim of this measure is to provide funds to develop job creating businesses to keep our people in gainful employment and off the dole queue.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the roll-over relief by way of capital gains tax and the business assets relief under capital acquisition tax. All these measures will help to stimulate employment and encourage employers to take on more workers, as will the seed capital scheme with its easier income qualification tests for new start up businesses by employees and the unemployed. I welcome the raising of the VAT thresholds for the goods and services sectors. Many small businesses, such as shops, which have been hard hit by various circumstances will benefit from this relief.</P>
    <P>I especially welcome the incentives for urban renewal.  People in rural areas do not often see the decay in our cities. The nearest cities to me are Cork and Limerick, but this decay can also be seen in Dublin.  While incentives are in place for the bigger towns and cities, consideration should be given to the smaller towns and villages &mdash; down to the crossroads trading areas where the small pub, the shop, the store, the school, etc. were a hive of activity before the advent of the motor car.</P>
    <P>There are buildings, or parts of buildings derelict in some smaller villages and towns which require attention and they could be converted into houses for the elderly so that these people would be near essential services.  New houses should be built in town centres rather than on the outskirts and there should be urban renewal in towns and villages which have vacant rooms over shops, etc. These rooms should be converted to provide homes for the elderly, the young, lone parents, etc.  Such developments would benefit everyone &mdash; those living there, the owners of the buildings, etc. &mdash; and they would add to the attractiveness of the locality.  This, in turn, would benefit the tidy towns sector and the local tourism industry.  In view of this, urban renewal should be considered in a <Col N="957" /> general way and it should not be confined to the cities and larger towns as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improved annual capital allowance for hotel development and farm buildings and the granting of capital allowances for the purchase of computer software or the right to use such software. The computer cannot be ignored in the development of any business, big or small.  Highly technical services are required, and anybody developing a start up business must have the necessary software and technical equipment.</P>
    <P>The new provisions by way of relief on investment in the film industry and the assistance provided to low budget Irish films are to be welcomed, as are the reliefs provided in respect of stamp duty, including the new appeals procedure which will benefit those involved in the transferring, inheritance, making of gifts, etc., of property.  At present such transactions can be a considerable financial worry and burden for those involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the major steps forward in the Government's tax reform programme as set out in the Bill, especially on income tax.  Many taxpayers have been removed from liability to pay income tax at the higher rate.  Consideration must be given not only to the person paying income tax at the 48 per cent rate, but also to those providing employment.  If an employer wishes to give his employee a rise of £1, it will cost him more than £2 in real terms.</P>
    <P>The increase in the tax free allowance from £2,175 to £2,350, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for married people, widows and single persons, is to be welcomed, as is the increase in the standard tax rate band of £525 for the single person, and, where the exemption limit applies, the increase of £100 per child.  I especially welcome the reduction in the marginal rate of income tax from 48 per cent to 40 per cent with regard to the exemption limits.</P>
    <P>These limits affect people on modest incomes.  Often a retired person with a contributory old age pension may have a pension from the county council, forestry or whatever.  When the two pensions were combined the person could have been entitled to pay income tax at the 48 <Col N="958" /> per cent rate.  This created difficulties and, in consequence, such people became the new poor.  In this respect, this reduction in the rate of income tax is of great importance because it provides these people with a proper stand of living in the latter part of their lives.</P>
    <P>Often a deduction of £1 or £2 from these pensions caused considerable hardship. For example, I recently met an old man, a friend of mine, who showed me his county council pension cheque.  The cheque contains a number of boxes representing deductions for superannuation, income tax and so on.  There were many blank boxes on my friend's cheque, but he noted that PRSI had been deducted previously, but not on this occasion.  He asked me if himself or his wife was admitted to hospital would they be covered for health services because there was no PRSI deduction.  I advised him that anyone earning under £9,000 per annum was now exempt from PRSI deductions. In his case it meant he had an extra £1.83.</P>
    <P>This sum may appear small but it illustrates this man's concern.  He knew why he was paying this amount weekly and he thought a service would be taken away from him if he stopped paying it.  At least the matter has been clarified for him. He knows that anyone earning less than £9,000 is exempt from paying the health contribution and the employment and training levy.  This provision is of great benefit to the average taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tightening up of the section regarding the artists' exemption. There are many young people in the country who, arising from the changes in the education system had the advantage of developing their talents in arts and crafts.  In previous years those students would have taken academic subjects &mdash; Irish, English, Mathematics, History and Geography.  This change has led to the emergence of many gifted artists.  These people are providing employment for themselves and their helpers and these exemptions are welcome.  I am pleased to note that the loopholes have been closed and that the artists' exemption must show the benefit for which it was introduced.</P>
    <P>As regards the co-operative farm relief <Col N="959" /> service, I welcome the help for contractors who provide the farm relief services. Until the five day cow is introduced, farm relief schemes will be required to enable people get away from the land.</P>
    <P>I am glad tax relief on investment in Irish film making companies is being amended and that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will certify all films on which relief is claimed in accordance with guidelines laid down with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  It is important that we see the amount of employment generated or value added to the economy resulting from relief.  There is no use giving relief on a once off basis to someone who will pocket the money and then be gone.</P>
    <P>Film making in Ireland is in its infancy and has tremendous potential.  I saw the making of two films in recent years in my area.  &ldquo;Broken Harvest&rdquo; was made in a small village about eight or nine miles from me; &ldquo;Buttons&rdquo; was made in a village near Skibbereen.  These films generated tremendous local interest.  These villages became tourist attractions because people came from many parts of the country to see the films being made. There was also an employment factor. Many local people had to supply costumes. Young people were employed in the making of one film and were paid a certain amount each day; others were hired to do work on the sideline.  These examples show that the development of film making could generate a large amount of part-time, and eventually fulltime, jobs.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal schemes should be extended to towns and villages so that they can be made better places in which to live and better facilities can be provided for old and young people and those in need of housing.  Such an extension would provide more work in areas where it is badly needed because it would result in the construction and refurbishment of houses.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is doing everything to encourage the development of Irish businesses so as to promote employment, <Col N="960" /> to take more people off the dole and to stop emigration.  The Bill is pro-jobs and the Government's strategy is to maximise the employment potential of the economy, especially since it is performing well at the moment.</P>
    <P>Many retired people saved money during their working lives; these savings often resulted from the sale of their businesses. Some widows and widowers have to survive on these savings.  They do not qualify for pensions because they ran little businesses.  Since they did not pay voluntary contributions they do not qualify for contributory pensions.  However, because their savings are above a certain figure they do not qualify for non-contributory pensions.  These people are often poor because they may have to spend their savings at the age of 60, 65 or 70 and then they have nothing left.</P>
    <P>I welcome the special savings accounts interest on which is subject to 10 per cent deposit interest retention tax.  The Minister is also introducing special investment accounts.  Special investment policies are offered by life assurance companies, special investment units by unit trusts and special portfolio investment accounts by brokers.  If people have £50,000 in special savings accounts they can invest £25,000 in special investment products.  This will yield interest which may give them a reasonable living as only 10 per cent is deducted from this interest. This is very important for retired people, pensioners, widows and widowers who have no other income in their golden years.</P>
    <P>I am glad relief is being granted in respect of the capital acquisitions tax, probate tax and stamp duty paid by young, trained farmers.  In line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the Bill provides for a reduction of two-thirds in the stamp duty chargeable on the transfer of agricultural land and buildings to farmers under 35 years of age who have completed an approved training course.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair that the House has only two days to debate the Bill, because we cannot do it justice in that time.  This Bill is being rushed through unnecessarily.  Over the years the Seanad has devoted a fair amount of time to the Finance Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  He knows what is happening throughout the country.  However, I do not agree with the Bill generally.  I am my party's spokesperson on Social Welfare and am concerned about taxing social welfare payments.  There is a tendency to try to get money back on payments made by all Departments.  There is a view that payments made to people relying on social welfare, particularly pensions, should be taxed.  I want to make sure this does not happen.  There is also a view, which has not been denied by the Minister for Social Welfare, that in years to come it may be decided people will not be entitled to social welfare pensions if they are receiving other pensions.</P>
      <P>I regret that I only have 15 minutes to speak because there are many things I wish to say.  Rushing this Bill through this House is very unsatisfactory.  We should be able to say what we wish on this Stage so that Committee Stage is confined to discussing amendments.  Senators will broaden the debate on the next Stage and this should be noted by the Minister for future reference.  A person who has something to say should be allowed say it.</P>
      <P>It is said that the country is doing well. I do not deny that we have strong economic growth.  In 1994 our GDP will be 4 per cent, the highest in Europe.  I am a simple person and work in a simple way. That is my way of doing business. However, I seriously question whether the right people are gaining.  Senator O'Kennedy deserves great credit for the way he spoke today about priorities.  I would like to speak about priorities and incentives.  There is a general impression that good incentives are being given but, if that is the case, I must be living somewhere else.  It is not the case outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> Interest rates are, on average, 10 per cent but should be at least 2 percentage points lower to compare with the basic cost of money in Europe.  The financial institutions should be seriously questioned. I am thrilled that at long last our Taoiseach spoke about this matter last Thursday.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment spoke about it yesterday. I do not know if it is a tactic between the two of them in connection with the selling of the Trustee Savings Bank, but that is another argument.</P>
    <P>At long last we are getting our act together to help people who want to get moving in business.  I do not want to be negative or to knock anybody who will do well for the country.  However, I want to give some examples.  Many people are now questioning the number of requirements for people who want to set up in business.  Anybody who is not aware of that is living in another world.  There are too many Department asking questions of people who want to do something for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am a member of an enterprise board in Cork city and a former Lord Mayor.  I would gut the Minister for one job for Cork city and I make no apologies for saying that.  We must never forget that we are a service country.  We can create a great deal of jobs in the services sector. We have well educated people who want to create jobs but we are not giving them the opportunities to do so; instead we are doing the opposite.</P>
    <P>We should look at our planning regulations and the amount of documentation needed before anyone can start up in business.  The incentive is to not employ and nobody can tell me otherwise.  Any manager will say they want to take people on but do the opposite.  There is a view that it is not worth creating employment.</P>
    <P>This is very important to small businesses. America is built on small businesses, not multinationals.  If one walks down a street in Manhattan one will see many people working in small places; all the big concerns do not create the same amount of employment.  There is tax relief provided in this Bill for software, a measure with which I disagree.  Software <Col N="963" /> eliminates jobs and results in my son or somebody else's son emigrating.  Our unemployment rate has risen from 87,000 in 1986 to over 300,000 today, not counting those who emigrated.  It is an awful record, irrespective of who is in Government. What annoys me is that these people have ability.  I can see opportunities which are not being taken because there is no incentive to do so.</P>
    <P>I could speak for an hour on this and I mean every word I say.  It is very unfair to give the impression that things are going well; they are going well for multinationals and people who want to create less employment but there is no incentive to do the opposite.  For example, with regard to tourism, what incentive is there when we are now questioning whether people who provide bed and breakfast should pay taxes?  We should slow down. It costs £57 a head to bring every tourist in and then we want the person who will look after them to pay.  Visitors want to be comfortable and get a nice meal.  They do not want to be rushed; they want to play golf without it costing a fortune, they want to go fishing, etc.  I welcome the initiatives the Minister mentioned in his speech.  However, I worry that we are too interested in getting in more money to pay people who do not want to do anything.  That is sad.</P>
    <P>The Minister can rest assured that on Committee Stage tomorrow I will question in detail whether we are doing the right thing.  We can speak about 4.5 per cent growth and say that the rest of Europe is delighted with us but how we honestly say that we are doing well?  For example, 86,000 people were unemployed in 1986 and inflation was running at 12 per cent.  I do not deny the importance of keeping inflation low or that the work done by Ray MacSharry as Minister for Finance or by Deputy Bertie Ahern as Minister for Labour was very important in getting us onto the right track but we must ask if we created a situation where we unnecessarily eliminated jobs and undermined the infrastructure of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> In local authority areas we abolished jobs where there was no need to do so. We moved people from one place to another and gave them the same money.  We took 550 jobs in Cork Corporation from general operatives who were receiving £112 a week and sent them to the labour exchange where they got £110 a week, and we gave them redundancy money. There is no logic in that.</P>
    <P>There is no incentive for somebody to employ an extra person.  Instead employers are faced with PRSI, tax, insurance costs, etc.  We must create an incentive to employ.  This Bill does not do that and that worries me.  It gives relief for capital gains &mdash; the vast majority of people about whom I am talking could not spell capital gains, but they could create jobs.  I know of one person who took over a little business which was privatised &mdash; the company decided to privatise their trucks.  In the middle of June last year this person was working for the company as a truck driver and he took over the business and started delivering for himself under contract to the company. At the end of August a sheriff's messenger was at his door with an estimated demand for VAT.  He got the fright of his life.  His family could not understand this.  Such people should be left alone and let work where they will create other jobs.</P>
    <P>When I started in business I did not know who were in government.  I just wanted to work, rear a family and pay my taxes.  There was never the pressure which exists today.  Before the average person starts up in business today, 16 different Departments will call on them. The Minister must sort this out because there is no incentive to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are currently at 9 per cent which is not bad, although I would like to see them down to 8 per cent.  A person can borrow £100,000 and pay back £9,000, which is all he is interested in. However, it is unlikely that he will invest that money in creating employment because it is not worth it.  There is too much hassle and too much is asked of such a person.  It is too much trouble to take on two employees and if one of them <Col N="965" /> is unsuitable, he cannot get rid of him. This must be stopped.  We must create an atmosphere where people can be asked to do more and where less will be asked of Government.</P>

      <P>That is the problem.  It is sad that I do not have another ten or 15 minutes because I would like to get my points across.  However, I can do it tomorrow.  We should not be rushing the Finance Bill through the House or rushing speakers.  I listened to Senator O'Kennedy, who was very positive and deserves great credit for opening up, as our Taoiseach did last Thursday and Deputy Quinn did yesterday.  I seriously question what the Minister, Deputy Quinn, is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask if we can create the incentive for people with money to do more. Much of the money made by the Irish financial institutions is made in Ireland. They might say that it is 1 per cent of <Col N="966" /> their total turnover.  However, the banks are making £430 million a year.  That is £1.1 million a day, which a large amount of money.  We should not forget that they are only open for five hours a day.</P>

If we are to involve the semi-State banks in structures where they have no rights and where they would naturally be lending money at cheaper rates than other banks, they are obviously going to be undermined and will be out of business in a few weeks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past number of years the budget has been treated as just another day out in the Dáil.  So many changes took place during the year that the budget speech became slightly irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This year significant changes have been made and the Finance Bill emphasises this.  Since the budget speech was prepared, it has been brought home to many people that there are significant changes in personal tax, company tax and tax reliefs.  This year's budget <Col N="967" /> and the Finance Bill extends the idea of simplifying the tax system.</P>
      <P>During every year every single interest group in the country comes into the Minister for Finance looking for concessions for their trade or profession.  In many cases one would think that their trade, profession or job was the most important and could be separated from the totality of Irish society and business.  There seems to be a view that if huge concessions are given to a particular sector, it will not impact on other sections of society.  This is not true.  A change in one sector cannot be effected in isolation as it impacts on other sectors as well.</P>
      <P>For many years I have been lobbying various Ministers for Finance on aspects of the motor industry and what was considered to be an over burden of taxation on the industry.  Concessions were made at the behest of the motor industry to bring VAT on the service element of the motor industry down from 21 per cent to 12.75 per cent.  There is no doubt that helped eliminate problems associated with the black economy operating in the motor industry.  When there was a 21 per cent tax on service, it was much cheaper for somebody to go to the someone with the tools in the boot of the car rather than have the car serviced in a registered garage.  When I say a registered garage I am not talking about a garage registered with SIMI but a garage which is within the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is reducing the rate of vehicle registration tax from 31.8 to 29.5 per cent in respect of category A vehicles exceeding 2,012 cc and from 25.75 to 23.2 per cent in respect of category A vehicles with a lower cc.  This has had a significant effect on the motor trade and will also have a huge effect on the revenue the Government will receive. It was argued in the past that if there was not a high rate of vehicle registration tax, too many vehicles would be brought into the country and that this would increase the foreign debt as so much money would have to paid out.  This is not quite true and it has been proven that the sale of cars since the reductions were announced <Col N="968" /> has been very significant.  It has not increased to what it was eight or nine years ago, but the impact has been significant. It would appear from the newspapers today that there is going to be a reduction on vehicles up to 2,500 cc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, in view of the escalation of violent crimes throughout the country, calls on the Minister for Justice to immediately bring forward a schedule of reforming legislation to radically amend the law in the following areas:</P>
      <P>(1)  Reform of the bail laws;</P>
      <P>(2)  Repeal of the petition system;</P>
      <P>(3)  Abolition of the unlimited right to silence;</P>
      <P>(4)  Reform and expansion of our prison system so that prisons are places of discipline, productivity and detoxification;</P>
      <P>(5)  Establishment of the Criminal Injuries Tribunal on a statutory basis with adequate funding;</P>
      <P>(6)  The appointment of at least four additional Circuit Court Judges to end the delays in both the Circuit Court and the High Court;</P>
      <P>(7)  The replacement of the listing system in the High Court by a modern, computer-assisted appointments or diary system and a total review of the courts system; and</P>
      <P>(8)  The introduction of the promised Juvenile Justice Bill to tackle the high incidence of juvenile crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join in welcoming the Minister to the House.  The motion presents an opportunity to the Progressive Democrats to put on the record of the House our plan to combat and contain the crime wave. We were all appalled today by the serious incident in which a body was found in a car in Athlone.  This incident follows the incident in County Clare.  Rather than dwell on these matters and give a redundant expostulation or condemnation of the surge in crime and lawlessness, the <Col N="970" /> Progressive Democrats have tabled a worthwhile agenda which would be both balanced and effective.</P>
    <P>Our first proposal is for the establishment of a modern and effective criminal code.  Almost every other common law jurisdiction operates on the basis of a criminal code in which all the ordinary criminal law is set out in one statute. There are many models and precedents from which Ireland could choose and develop.  All that is missing is a criminal law review committee to get on with the task.  In this context, the valuable work done by the Law Reform Commission should be acknowledged but there is no reason to believe that the commission has the resources or mandate to accomplish such a task.  On the contrary, the other tasks facing the Law Reform Commission suggest that codification of the criminal law should, as the Whitaker report on the penal system suggested, be entrusted to a specialist criminal law reform committee.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Law Reform Commission is currently conducting a review of the law on bail.  It is not, apparently, engaged in preparing recommendations for a change.  Short of a referendum, the Progressive Democrats believe that the widespread abuse of bail could be tackled by making a bailsman liable to forfeit bail if the accused commits an offence while on bail.  At present, he or she is only liable to forfeit bail if the accused absconds.  By making bailsmen liable as sureties for the good behaviour of the accused, in addition to failure to turn up for trial, the State would prevent the abuse of bail.  The amount of bail in such circumstances could reflect the criminal past of the accused without prejudicing his right to a fair trial.</P>
    <P>The present law on bail is too lax and the changes made in the 1994 to require mandatory corrective sentences for offences committed while on bail, while of some value, are clearly not enough.  If the statutory changes proposed above to modify bail law are implemented, a referendum may be necessary.  However, the people demand some significant <Col N="971" /> changes, and they are correct.  In the course of travelling throughout Leinster over the past weeks, the view of the electorate in terms of bail and these matters has been underlined in the comments I have heard.</P>
    <P>In relation to speeding up criminal justice, there is no need for the present delays.  Summary offences are commonly dealt within six to 12 months after the event because of court listing problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure is that after the proposer and seconder have contributed, I will call on a Fianna Fáil Senator to move an amendment.  They have eight minutes.  Senator Dardis has 12 minutes and the seconder has eight minutes.  The Minister can come in when she wishes after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Appeals for summary convictions frequently take six months.  The length of time it takes to deal with the court listing problems is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  Trials on indictment normally take 12-18 months after the events charged.  This delay is also the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, needs urgent reform to end the practice of taking every witness's evidence down in handwriting by the deposition proceedings, where the accused so demands. This is being abused by serious criminals to delay and avoid criminal sentencing. It should be possible to circumvent the present District Court procedure by allowing the prosecution to serve a book of evidence without any right, except in rare cases, for depositions to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent events in County Clare have shown again that a person sent forward for trial in custody on one offence is immune from any power of interrogation or from any obligation to provide scientific <Col N="972" /> samples in connection with the same or different offences while in custody. This loophole is of major significance. It has been known for many years but nothing has been done.  The Minister should tell the House why nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>In relation to delays in serious appeals, I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that because of entirely avoidable delays, persons who are convicted on indictment of major offences cannot be confident of appealing the verdict to the Court of Criminal Appeal within 18 months.  It is a scandal and responsibility for it also lies with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that the Minister for Justice should be required in every case where a sentence is remitted to publish the fact in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Even if the identity of the person concerned in some cases should be kept secret, the bare fact of the remission should be a matter of public record.  The power of remission and parole should be exercised on the advice of a properly constituted paroles and remissions board.</P>
    <P>The device of temporary release is being used to disguise the fact that offenders now serve between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of the sentence term on average; sometimes it is very much less. The abuse of temporary release must be curtailed.  Many serious crimes now are committed by people who are temporary release from prison.  In future, the use of temporary release should be fully documented and supervised by a paroles and remissions board.</P>
    <P>Extra prison space is required.  As things stand, the system only works by releasing convicted prisoners prematurely. If an accused is remanded in custody, a convicted prisoner is released to make room for him.  In our crazy Alice in Wonderland system, the guilty are released to make room for those still presumed innocent.  The new facilities are Wheatfield and Castlerea are not adequate to deal with the problem. Instead of Mountjoy, we need a modern, purpose built prison which could function alongside Mountjoy while the present <Col N="973" /> demographic bulge in offenders between 15 and 25 years passes through the system.  In time, we could retire Mountjoy.  This will cost money but so does crime.  If the cost of operating an adequate prison system was compared to the cost of not having one, the arguments would be clearly in favour of building adequate prison accommodation now.  If finance is the problem, a lease-purchase plan for the new prison accommodation could be considered with the private sector.</P>
    <P>Our present jails are sumps of drug abuse and despair.  The Minister has a clear duty to stop our prisons from becoming drug abuse havens.  She is failing in that duty.  Modern visiting facilities that prevent drug abuse and the taking of blood samples from prisoners suspected of abuse would be some response to the drug wave in our jails.</P>
    <P>What type of society is it if we compensate victims of uninsured driving in full but often give nothing by way of compensation to a young woman who is raped or an elderly woman who is crippled by muggers or an elderly man who loses an eye while being beaten by burglars? In a society dominated by compensationists, the Minister has a clear responsibility to give some modest compensation to the weakest section of our community, the victims of crime.</P>
    <P>At present, some victims of crime are reimbursed their medical expenses; those healthy enough or young enough to be at work get compensation for loss of earnings. However, even those meagre gestures at compensation are delayed by up to 30 months.  Frequently, it takes two years for an award to be pronounced by the criminal injuries compensation tribunal. However, it takes a further two and a half years for the Department of Justice to pay the money to the victim &mdash; a delay of nearly five years from crime to payment.  This, again, is the Minister's responsibility.  She must put the criminal injuries compensation tribunal on a statutory basis and use more fines to pay part of the cost of compensating victims.</P>
    <P>The Government has spoken about a juvenile justice Bill but what we need is <Col N="974" /> a juvenile justice Act not merely talk of a Bill.  We also need proper resources for the supervision and detention of juvenile offenders.  Thus far we have had nothing but hot air.  These and many other measures will be set out in detail in the forthcoming Progressive Democrats' policy on crime.  We need more judges and courts to deal with offenders promptly in addition to prompt appeals and speedy trial procedures.  We also need fair and transparent parole and remissions, workable bail laws and action from a complacent and incompetent Government.  We need to see the Minister's proposals for change in all these areas now.</P>

Senator O'Toole has eight minutes and his seconder also has eight minutes.  That is the procedure and I hope Members understand it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment her for her efforts so far in the area of justice.  However, as my colleague has outlined, there are huge areas that need to be addressed which are of major concern to everybody and not only to people in cities.  While the level of crime in our larger cities is high, people are also concerned about increasing levels of crime in rural areas particularly among young people.  The motion before us deals with many areas and my colleague, Senator Dardis, has dealt with most of them.  However, I would like to elaborate on some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the reform of the bail laws, a recent Garda magazine editorial said that &ldquo;bail for serious crimes from the current breed of organised criminal merely supplies an opportunity to build up a nest egg for when they come out of prison&rdquo;.  The current laws, which refuse bail to people only on the basis that they <Col N="975" /> will intimidate witnesses or not turn up for trial, are totally inadequate.  They take no account of whether the person is a persistent offender or if evidence is produced that he is likely to reoffend. This is totally unacceptable.  If necessary my party would support a constitutional amendment to change it.</P>
    <P>People need to be reassured that our system of justice can deal with criminals who, if they come before the courts, will not be allowed out on bail to continue reoffending.  This is of major concern particularly to elderly people who feel it is hardly worth the garda's while arresting people and bringing them to court only to see them all out again to continue their illegal deeds.  The Minister would have the full support of our party if she introduced changes in this area.</P>
    <P>We have raised the repeal of the petition system when dealing with other Bills before this House.  This is of both public and political concern and should also be of concern to the Minister.  The Minister has outlined several times that she feels it is a reasonable system and that judges, when handing down fines or sentences, may not be aware of all the circumstances. The present system, however, is not very transparent and is a huge waste of the Minister's time because everything has to be referred to the Minister for Justice.  Obviously some consultation must take place with the judge in the case but we should have that system only in exceptional cases.  If we are to be transparent names should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  I understand this was the procedure up to 1961 but had to be changed due to the large number of cases coming before the Minister for review.</P>
    <P>In the past year the Minister has introduced several Bills in this House, including a system allowing for appeal against lenient sentences.  People feel that we are being two-faced and hypocritical about this.  What is the point in handing down increased sentences if people can then appeal for leniency and have the sentences or fines reduced?  The general public are very dissatisfied with this. Some of my colleagues will probably say <Col N="976" /> they have found the system very useful and I am sure the Minister will also say that in her reply.  Ordinary people are very concerned when they see others being taken to court and, in many cases, receiving what they would consider to be inadequate fines or sentences.  Such people can then appeal and have their fines or sentences substantially reduced. This is not acceptable and the Minister should consider the situation.  I have heard the Minister and the Minister of State speak on this matter several times and there seems to be some feeling that this cannot be done.  I admit that there are some hard cases but these are the exceptions.  We should make such exceptions only in very special cases.</P>
    <P>The reform of our prison system is of major concern to all.  At the moment prisons are not seen as places of discipline or rehabilitation.  A recent report by a visiting committee concluded that the lack of work for prisoners was of great concern.  I saw that problem myself when I visited a women's prison.</P>
    <P>Overcrowding in our prisons must be looked at.  Many problems in the system need to be dealt with, including the delay in getting cases to trial, remand prisoners being detained in prison, and others who have been convicted being allowed out before their term is served.</P>
    <P>We must examine why such huge numbers of prisoners continue to reoffend. The governor and prison officers in a women's prison I visited told me that the women come back again and again and that in many cases their mothers were there before them.  The prison staff said they felt that these women's children would also be in prison in years to come. That is a huge indictment on us as a society.  I know the Minister intends to spend £66 million on changes in the prison system but building more prisons is not the answer.  While there is a need for extra places of detention we have to ensure that prisoners will not end up in prison again and again.  If not, this problem is going to escalate with the current prisoners' children, and their children, eventually serving prison sentences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> The system of education and detoxification must also be examined because 30 per cent of our prison population are drug addicts.  A recent visiting committee's report stated that many prisoners are mentally ill and that prison was not the place for them.  We must consider what other facilities can be provided. There is no place for young offenders to go at the moment so many of them end up in prison in the company of hardened criminals; this is totally unacceptable. The huge percentage of crime committed by young people is frightening.  If people get involved in crime at an early age they are likely to continue along that road and they will have little hope for the future.</P>
    <P>As Members of this House we are failing in our responsibilities if we do not highlight that problem and try to implement procedures that will change the system.  For far too long it has continued in the same vein.  I know the Minister has good intentions.  I respect her; I think she is doing an excellent job but she has a huge task ahead.  We have to be imaginative and see how we can change the present unacceptable system which is not doing any good for those in prison.  It is not acceptable to our judiciary either, so we must look at radical ways of reforming it.</P>
    <P>The appointment of additional Circuit and High Court Judges would help to reduce delays in the courts.  However, the large numbers of people on remand are leading to overcrowding.  The whole courts system needs to be modernised and computerised.  The Minister has our full support in what she is trying to do. Although I did not have time to discuss this matter, the establishment of a criminal injuries tribunal on a statutory basis with adequate funding is vital and must be addressed immediately.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann commends the very significant measures taken by the Minister for Justice to <Col N="978" /> improve the effectiveness of the Criminal Justice System; and urges her to continue to devote the necessary resources to deal with the crime problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have spoken many times on the criminal justice legislative measures which have been passed in this Chamber in the last couple of months.  We welcomed the public order legislation and it was well received in the community.  The Minister was in tune with how people in the community felt and she responded accordingly. The Minister moved effectively in introducing legislation on the confiscation of drugs.  The legislation sought to curtail the problems associated with drug abuse and to deal with drug dealers and those who satisfy their habits through crime.  The Minister is busy and has shown tremendous energy and commitment in the area of justice.</P>
    <P>We must start at the beginning.  We are not talking about crime; we are talking about the nature of crime.  What causes crime?  We cannot assume that crime just happens, that we are not in a position to deal with it and that the Minister for Justice must answer for all aspects of crime.  When we discuss the nature of crime we must also talk about social welfare and the planning that has produced the concrete jungles in our cities.  Crime is not the responsibility of the Minister for Justice alone.  Other Ministers are involved.  The Minister has previously referred to that aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>I saw the Ronanstown report today and I am amazed that I have not seen it before now.  It is a very important document. I am sure the Minister would like this document to receive more publicity because she was instrumental in it being written.  The report spoke about the various issues which cause crime.  It referred to the responsibility of parents and disrespect for society, authority, our institutions and people.  Teachers, for example, cannot chastise a child without parents coming in to chastise the teachers.  Every aspect of authority is being challenged.  Perhaps we do not deal with students strongly enough in our education <Col N="979" /> system.  Perhaps we should involve parents more.  I am quite concerned about this issue and my thinking on it has come around full circle.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be held responsible for what we do in the educational sphere.  Social welfare policy and issues such as second chance education are community issues and they affect the crime problem.  The Minister should concentrate on her area of responsibility. However, she should open her Department to involvement with the Departments of Education and Social Welfare to see how the Departments can dovetail to deal with the crime problem.  I could speak for a long time on this aspect of the issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister and other speakers on the issue of bail.  The easy availability of bail should be examined. The Minister has referred the issue to the Law Reform Commission and I hope she will return to the House to discuss its recommendations.  I am concerned that the number of judges should be increased and the Minister has indicated that this will happen.  I have great interest in the juvenile justice system.  It is the subject of exhaustive debate because it relates to the education system.  It involves the junior liaison officer, home school links, public health nurses, career guidance teachers, parents and the rest of the community. If we can get those areas to dovetail it will be the means to deal with crime.</P>
    <P>Crime is a societal issue.  We cannot say that it is the Minister's responsibility alone and that she should be answerable for it.  She has done a superb job in the areas I have outlined.  However, we cannot expect the Minister to do more than she is doing at present.  We must involve the other Ministers.  We must accept that this issue will not be solved by the Members of the Oireachtas.  It will be solved by the community and the community must accept its role in that regard.  I must refer again to parents. Disrespect for authority is very much in evidence.  Where does that start?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> I compliment the Minister on her work and I am delighted to move the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not like to say that.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde referred to the report on urban crime and disorder.  As an educationalist I welcome that report. It is the first time such a report has looked beyond the area of justice and included other aspects of the problem, including education.  I was determined to include an educational element in this motion. The Minister's Department might not have been very enthusiastic about that. However, the issues I raise are based on our experience in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last two years I have conducted a follow-up investigation into the tragic case of a young man who committed <Col N="981" /> suicide in Mountjoy.  I wanted to find out about the educational background of that person.  Typically, he came from a highly disadvantaged area.  It was close to the inner city but not in a broadly recognised disadvantaged area.  He was a young man in his twenties and I spoke to the teachers who taught him when he was in infant classes.  The teachers remembered vividly the problems he created. They sought help at the time and called for support from the local inspector. Throughout the primary system they sought psychological reports on the young man.  They failed to get such support &mdash; the structure was not there to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Suffice to say that he went from primary to post-primary education and he did not last long in post-primary.  He dropped out of school and dropped into a life of crime very easily.  He terrorised people in the neighbourhood and got involved in petty and then more serious crime.  Eventually, in the course of a larceny in a house in the area, he was disturbed by a person who happened to be a teacher.  The teacher challenged him and a scuffle ensued.  In the end the teacher was murdered and the young man was sentenced to Mountjoy for that crime.  He was in Mountjoy for about four or five months when he committed suicide.  Two lives were lost as a result of a problem which was identified when he was four or five years of age.  The Minister, being a teacher, will have come across similar situations, although perhaps not as harrowing.  She knows that when a problem is recognised at an early stage something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>I told the Minister on another occasion that when the report about the north Clondalkin area was published, the Dublin west branch of the INTO considered it, spoke to the local teachers and came back to me with their views.  My amendment is a proposal to take the report forward.  I have chosen the wording carefully; this is not a proposal without limits.  It suggests that steps be taken in a restricted way and that these could be assessed and monitored with the full <Col N="982" /> co-operation of all groups to see how it would work.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that the provision of hot school meals might be more important than the building of more prisons. This may seem an exaggeration, but we must analyse why a large proportion of the prison population comes from recognised and identifiable disadvantaged areas.  We must also discover why people enter a life of crime.  In speaking to the Minister's officials and those who drew up the report, one crucial issue which emerged was that the first crime committed by those who went on to a life of serious crime was pilfering from a supermarket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Which supermarket?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to frighten my colleague, Senator Quinn; I hope he will support the amendment.  Such pilfering usually involves items of food.  This happens not only in Ireland but in other countries and the problem has been mentioned to me by teachers and officials from the Minister's Department.  It is impossible for a system to intervene positively if children are hungry.  I suggest we give hot school meals and develop the system of home school liaison officers and child welfare officers, which will be a combination of school attendance officers and juvenile liaison officers.</P>
      <P>It is known and accepted that crime begins at an early age.  It is also known that truancy leads to crime.  As recently proved by the Department of Education, one of the reasons for children not attending school is that they have not had breakfast; they have no reason to get up in the morning and so will not go to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to respond to these problems progressively.  We should try to introduce hot school meals in a number of areas, to increase the number of home school liaison officers and combine school attendance officers and juvenile liaison officers in a new expanded position of child welfare officers.  We should also give resources to schools to deal with children who are constantly disruptive <Col N="983" /> and troublesome.  Such children have a dual impact, both on the other children in the classroom and on themselves in that they lose out.  It would be more acceptable if they could be dealt with in the school.</P>
    <P>The other great seed bed of crime is unemployment.  Half of those unemployed have no qualification beyond primary school; therefore we should begin the process of coping with unemployment at that level.  There is no point setting up extraordinarily expansive and expensive training schemes for people who cannot read or write, or have difficulty doing so.  Such people will not gain from those schemes.  An investment at primary level enables people to gain more from post-primary education, become qualified and gain employment.</P>
    <P>If crime is endemic in certain areas, we must start at as early an age as possible. This report is progressive, forward-thinking and extremely useful.  All those involved in it are to be complimented, as is the Department.</P>
    <P>I agree with some aspects of the main motion but I would be completely opposed to the abolition of the right to silence, although it may need to be amended. The return of flogging, hanging and the stocks will not improve the position in the prison system or outside it.  Early intervention is necessary.  I ask the Minister to look favourably at the amendment to the amendment and implement the suggested schemes, in as limited a way as she wishes.  The teachers in the north Clondalkin area who have examined this report would be happy to be involved in the monitoring and implementation of such a programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to amendment No. 1.  Senator O'Toole concentrated on measures to avoid crime and attack the seeds to ensure crimes are not committed.  Senator Ormonde said we should not simply put the onus on the Minister; this is a duty of the community as a whole.  For some years I have been chairman of a judging committee for the neighbourhood watch schemes and the <Col N="984" /> community watch schemes, which are strongly supported by the Garda.  These measures do a world of good and are exactly what the Senator is talking about.</P>
      <P>This motion is greatly concerned with resources and in some cases those resources are quite substantial.  No doubt we will hear, as we have in the past, that not everything can be afforded.  It is fundamentally wrong that our approach to criminal justice should be dictated by resource constraints.  I do not suggest the justice system should not be subject to the same budgetary control as all other areas.  Our resources are limited and we have to set priorities.  However over the past decade the availability of resources, or lack thereof, has begun to dictate our approach to criminal justice.  We have talked and failed to do what needed to be done because there was no cash to put into operating the system we would like to see.</P>
      <P>A good example of this is sentencing. The amount of time people spend in prison after conviction is greatly affected by the amount of space available in prisons. People are being released because the system has no room for them.  We should consider the alternatives to physical incarceration, made possible in recent years by developments in technology. These methods, called house arrest, electronic surveillance or tagging, may not be appropriate for the violent crimes referred to in the motion.  They could be applied to offenders whose crimes are less serious, or to people who have already served the bulk of their sentences. In the case of some crimes house arrest could be used as an alternative to a custodial sentence in the first instance. In other cases it could be used as a halfway point between a custodial sentence and complete freedom, a sort of electronic parole for which offenders could qualify after serving a certain portion of their sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from the benefits for those directly concerned, the prisoners, an important result would be the amount of space that would be left free in the prison system which we could use to deal with more serious offenders.  It would provide <Col N="985" /> space to ensure that those convicted of serious violent crimes would always serve their full sentence; or at least, if they did not, it would not be because there was not enough space in the prison system.  It would also allow us the scope to increase sentences on those convicted of the most serious crimes, if that was thought appropriate.</P>
    <P>Electronic house arrest is now a fact of life in the United States, where it has been developing for ten years.  Of the 50 US states, 42 have established such schemes, or are about to establish them. We should carefully examine this scheme here.  It has been promoted in America because of the problem of resources, the same subject which concerns us here. They also have problems with overcrowded prisons, although it is much more acute there than here.  I do not suggest we explore this approach solely from the resources standpoint.  However, since that is an issue, we should do more with the resources available rather than do no more than we do at present.  In the United States the concept has been frequently used for pre-trial detention as an alternative to bail or in cases where bail has been refused.</P>
    <P>As the motion suggests, bail is a problem in this country.  Our ability to refuse bail is severely constrained for constitutional reasons.  The Minister is concerned about this problem, but we cannot continue to avoid it.  In America the electronic approach has also raised questions about civil liberty, privacy, etc., but it is considered worthwhile to continue experimenting with the concept of electronic surveillance.  We could also explore this possibility.  I was surprised to see that people are given a choice. They are asked if they prefer to go to jail or to avail of this procedure.  In most cases people accept electronic surveillance.</P>
    <P>We are not as ready to embrace technology in the service of justice as we should be.  I am not sure we use technology enough in the prevention and detection of crime.  Our approach to the custodial side of criminal justice is technologically adverse.  We have not taken <Col N="986" /> the first steps in that direction.  Our detention system is based on a series of pre-20th century concepts, where one locks offenders away, often in degrading conditions and with little possibility of rehabilitation, in order to keep them out of trouble.  That may be the only answer in some cases, but not in all.  We must open our minds to the different technological ways of achieving what we want to achieve.</P>
    <P>Detention deprives people of their liberty and it is used as a means of retribution and rehabilitation, as a deterrent, and as a means of protecting the community.  At one time the only way to deprive people of their liberty was to lock them up and throw away the key. There are other alternatives if we are prepared to look for them, and I am sure the Minister is hungry to find them.  Some of these, such as electronic house arrest, could save the State the expense of detaining some offenders and it would also give the detainee a better chance of rebuilding a normal life.  It would be possible to stay at home and to continue working for certain hours of the day, but they would have to remain in their own homes because it would be controlled by technology.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important thing these alternatives could do is to broaden the range of responses available to deal with offenders.  One size does not fit all.  For some people prison is an appropriately severe sentence and punishment.  For other more serious offenders, and we are faced with the growth of a relatively small number of hard core serious offenders, the type of prison sentence they are now getting is decreasing in effectiveness as a deterrent.  For the serious offender involved in violent crime we must increase the certainty of being caught and, once caught, the certainty that they will be effectively punished.  That is what the motion is about and what the amendment is hoping to achieve by trying to get at the roots of crime.  To do that within the constraints of the available resources in our system, we must find new and better ways of using those resources than we have done in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> We live in an age where the horizons of what we can do are greatly extended by the onward march of technology. Unfortunately, the public service in general and, perhaps, the justice system in particular, is slow to take advantage of that opportunity.  We should try to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Dardis and Senator Honan for affording me this opportunity to speak about the significant measures I have taken, and plan to take, to improve the effectiveness of the criminal justice system.  I have been afforded quite a number of such opportunities in the recent past both in Dáil Éireann and in this House.  Senators will forgive me if there is an element of repetition in what I say.  I can only surmise that interest is so great in what I am doing that there is a view that it bears repetition.</P>
      <P>Before I get into the subject matter of the motion before the House, it is appropriate and opportune that I should address a topic which I have not had occasion to address before now but which has become the source of misleading comment in the media and elsewhere.  I refer to an impression which has somehow gone abroad to the effect that contact and business generally between the Garda Commissioner and I is conducted in a tense, unfriendly atmosphere.  One newspaper went over the top on the subject last Sunday by quoting anonymous &ldquo;official&rdquo; and anonymous &ldquo;sources&rdquo; and I have since taken the matter up quite firmly with the editor of that newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators may also be aware of an extraordinary but unsuccessful attempt by an Opposition Deputy in the Dáil today to suspend the business of that House under Standing Order 30 in order to discuss his allegations, conveyed in advance through the media, that in my dealings with the Garda management and in the discharge of my responsibilities in relation to prisons I have been guilty of abuse of power. He referred in particular to my decision that Salthill Garda station be upgraded to district headquarters level and he also <Col N="988" /> referred to the fact that I personally examine all temporary release applications in the case of offenders from Galway.</P>
    <P>When I, or any of my predecessors, have had occasion to meet the Garda Commissioner on matters of business, we are invariably dealing with matters of substance which can be of real concern to a great many people There are times, as anybody who has served either as Minister for Justice or Garda Commissioner will know, when it is difficult to know the right answer to the many problems we face, but which must be answered and sometimes under considerable time pressure.  The public would have genuine cause for concern if it were the position that either the Minister, the Garda Commissioner or both thought it best to adopt a meek, submissive, unquestioning approach towards the serious matters on hand for the sake of an easy life, or for fear that somebody might conclude that a candid exchange of views, or an admission that there were at times differences of views, signalled the existence of personal animosity.</P>
    <P>Let me put the record straight.  I have the utmost respect for the Garda Commissioner's professionalism and I greatly value his integrity and honesty in our dealings since I became Minister for Justice. Neither of us is so squeamish that we go sulking or running for cover whenever there is healthy tension concerning matters of substance and neither of us has the slightest intention of allowing misleading comment to damage our excellent working and personal relations.</P>
    <P>As to the matters on which a Deputy sought to bring the Dáil to a standstill this morning, let me say a few brief words in case anybody considers it appropriate to raise these same matters in the course of this debate.  As regards the upgrading of Salthill to district headquarters level, I have already fully outlined the circumstances which led to this decision, by way of reply to a Dáil question and, unless Senators think otherwise, I see no reason to waste the time of this House by <Col N="989" /> repeating what I have already put on the record.</P>
    <P>As regards the release of offenders from the Galway area, I examine applications and it would be extraordinary if I, like my predecessors, did not do so, given my special knowledge of the Galway area and the fact that I am quite well placed to assess the advice I get about the likely impact on the community of decisions I make in that regard.  It is completely misleading to suggest that I look at Galway cases only.  I look at all serious cases and it is quite erroneous to conclude that, by dealing with all applications relating to the area which I know best, I learn nothing about what happens elsewhere or about the advice I receive on all other applications.  I do learn, sometimes quite a lot, and I assure Senators that what I learn has an impact on all the decisions made in my Department.</P>
    <P>Returning to the terms of the motion before the House, I have been conscious since taking office as Minister for Justice that my primary task is to address the problem of crime.  Crime is something which impinges on all our lives to a greater or lesser extent and there is huge public demand that it be tackled. However, there is no magic solution and no quick fix strategy which will suddenly reverse crime trends.  This is the universal experience.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to tackle the problem in a planned and methodical way. We do not have unlimited resources to throw at the problem.  In the area of criminal justice policy, as in all other areas of public policy, choices must be made and priorities set.  We must have a coherent and planned approach if we are to get on top of the crime problem, and this I have.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive package of law and order measures, which I announced on 14 December last, is designed to improve the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána in the fight against crime throughout the country.  The following elements in the package are especially significant in this regard and will be seen in time as a major contribution towards tackling the problems <Col N="990" /> we face.  The package is not the end of the road.  The situation needs to be kept under constant check and if we need further strategies or different responses, I will be the first to pursue them.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, recruitment to the Garda force is being accelerated so that 407 gardaí are being recruited in 1994 and an annual intake of a further 350 will take place each year over the period 1995 to 1997.  I have obtained Government approval to recruit 200 clerical civilian staff between 1994 and 1997 for clerical and administrative work.  This will increase the number of clerical civilians in the force to over 900.  It will also increase the operational strength of the force by 200 by releasing an equivalent number of gardaí for outdoor police duties.  In addition, I propose to recruit civilian staff for certain key areas within the Garda management structure where special qualifications are required.  The areas involved include personnel, financial control, organisational development and press relations.</P>
    <P>A major information technology plan for the force, drawn up with the assistance of outside consultants, is to be implemented.  It is one of the largest information technology plans in the public sector.  The information technology plan will make a substantial contribution in the years ahead to the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána by enabling gardaí to spend more time on outdoor policing duties and less on paperwork, by increasing crime detection rates and improving overall Garda responsiveness, by providing computerised fingerprint identification facilities to help to solve more crimes, and by providing improved management information so that more effective use can be made of Garda resources.  The package also provides for the purchase of additional Garda vehicles, including specialist vehicles for the Garda fleet over and above the normal fleet replacement requirements.  This will ensure optimum replacement of vehicles in the Garda fleet over the next four years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> Extra funding will also be made available for the upgrading of the Garda communications network to enable Garda radio hand-sets and radio car-sets, purchased in the early and mid-1980s, to be replaced with modern equipment.  It will also enable a more modern communication system to be installed in Cork city in the next year or so to ensure more effective use of Garda resources.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department are already at an advanced stage of discussions with the relevant authorities in regard to the installation of closed circuit television cameras in Dublin city centre. The operation will be totally under the control and management of the Garda Síochána.  It is planned to install the cameras in the city centre area and in the Temple Bar area.  It is also planned to install fixed closed circuit television cameras to detect and collect evidence of speeding offences on roads.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is already involved in two successful youth diversion projects in the Dublin area &mdash; the KEY project in Killinarden and the GRAFT project in Ronanstown.  Funding is provided by my Department towards the running of these successful projects.  I have increased the funding available to this type of project by £100,000 per year for the period 1994 to 1997.  This will allow further new projects to be established.</P>
    <P>In another initiative, a pilot scheme involving juvenile liaison officers and professional social workers will be introduced to concentrate on the drug problem among juveniles at risk in Dublin. Two social workers will be employed to coach selected juvenile liaison officers in drugs counselling and related work.</P>
    <P>Arising from the recommendations of the Government Advisory Committee on Fraud, I have also provided additional funds to recruit two additional detective inspectors and three professional accountants for the Garda Fraud Squad and to purchase specialised fraud related IT equipment.  These measures form part of plans to establish a national bureau of fraud investigation headed by a chief <Col N="992" /> superintendent.  I am confident that these measures will make an enormous contribution towards the fight against crime and I assure the House that the situation will be kept under review and that no effort will be spared to prevent and deal effectively with incidents of serious crime, in particular those aimed at sections of the community most at risk.</P>
    <P>In relation to the prison system, I draw the attention of Senators to the Programme for a Partnership Government which includes a commitment to the finalisation and implementation of a new set of aims, objectives and agreed priorities for the prison system, including a programme of positive sentence management and a timetable for the implementation of the Whitaker report on prison reform.</P>
    <P>As I already stated publicly, I am in the process of completing a policy document, a five year plan, for the prison system which I plan to publish next month.  The document will draw extensively on the philosophy and recommendations of the Whitaker report; review the main specific recommendations of the Whitaker report and indicate the approach being adopted towards them; contain overall aims and objectives for the prison system as well as objectives for the important elements within it; contain an action plan for the development of the system over the next five years, including the concept of positive sentence management, and a strategy for dealing with high numbers of prisoners taking account of the Government decision to provide an additional 210 spaces, including 60 for women in a new purpose designed facility; set out strategies for dealing with particular problem areas including drug abuse in prisons; and include new draft prison rules and a draft code of discipline for prison staff.  I am satisfied the prescription I propose will represent a modern, progressive approach to the prison system and go far beyond the confines of the motion before the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal in more detail with some of the specific issues referred to in the motion and to refer in particular to <Col N="993" /> the amendment in names of Senator O'Toole, Senator Lee, Senator Norris and Senator Henry.  I am not satisfied that the repeal of the petitions system is either necessary or desirable.  The power to exercise clemency and to mitigate penalties is conferred by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>While the right of pardon and power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are vested in the President under the terms of Article 13.6 and 13.9 of the Constitution, Article 13.6 also provides for such power, except in capital cases, to be conferred by law on other authorities.  Pursuant to this, the power was conferred on the Minister for Justice under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and the delegated authority of Government dated 30 March 1951.  It is right and proper that the Executive should have the power to provide a remedy in those cases where the strict application of the penalties imposed would, on any objective assessment of the matter, cause unwarranted hardship.  I exercise that power to the same and no greater extent than each and all of my predecessors in office.</P>
    <P>I receive approximately 4,000 petitions each year and, judging from the numbers received from Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas on behalf of their constituents, I suggest there is overwhelming support for the system.  I am satisfied that the system is justifiable and operated with care and that calls for its repeal are misguided. I am not aware that the operation of the system is the source of general concern to the Judiciary, indeed, I have had contact and correspondence which suggests the opposite.</P>
    <P>As regards Senators' call for a schedule of reforming legislation, including a Bill to reform the bail laws and the Juvenile Justice Bill, I believe the House will accept that the Government has embarked on a major programme of criminal law reform.  I will mention a few examples.  Last year we had the Criminal Justice Act which focused on the plight of victims in three fairly novel ways.  First, it enables unduly lenient sentences to be appealed, second, it authorises criminal <Col N="994" /> courts to require offenders to pay compensation for any injury or loss caused by an offence and, third, it places an obligation on the court before passing sentence to take account specifically the effect of violent crime on the victim.  The House will recall the lengthy debate we had on what has become the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and the widespread support which there was for its provisions.  I believe that Act provides our police and our courts with appropriate and effective powers to deal with modern realities in this area.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, which is before the House at present, contains severe measures which will enable the courts to confiscate the proceeds of crime.  Particular emphasis is given in the legislation to cracking down on those involved in the deadly trade of drug trafficking.  Again, there has been widespread support for this measure and I believe that most people would accept that the severity of its provisions are an appropriate response to the evils inflicted by these people on society.  This Bill recognises that the reality of crime today is that it has increasingly an international dimension and the legislation contains a comprehensive series of measures which will enable us to co-operate effectively with other jurisdictions in the fight against crime.  The Bill also takes steps in line with a European Union directive to prevent money laundering.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the present pace of criminal law reform will continue. For example, the comprehensive Juvenile Justice Bill, to which the Senators refer, is at an advanced stage of preparation and, among its many provisions, it will address the issue of the responsibility of parents in relation to the delinquent behaviour of their children.  I was most interested to hear the views of Senators on how they see the proposed Juvenile Justice Bill tackling crime.  I say that because, historically, most urbanised societies have approached the problems presented by juvenile crime in one of two ways, the &ldquo;get tough&rdquo; approach or the &ldquo;treat them softly&rdquo; approach.  The fact that countries continually oscillate from <Col N="995" /> one approach to the other strengthens me in my view that neither approach on its own works over an extended period.</P>
    <P>The Juvenile Justice Bill being prepared by my Department recognises that a balanced approach to juvenile crime is needed and that legislation by itself is just one element of that balanced approach.  It will reflect modern thinking in many countries, based on years of research, that custody alone does not work.  Experience elsewhere has shown that the more punitive a regime of juvenile justice, the worse the outcome.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being prepared on the basis that the way to tackle juvenile crime is by a positive use of cautioning and community based strategies combined with ensuring that parents are made to face up to their responsibilities.  It sounds like an unbalanced &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; approach, but it is not.  Community based sanctions can be exacting and challenging for those juveniles on whom they are imposed and, of course, detention will be available as a last resort for juveniles who are persistent in their offending or who commit serious offences.</P>
    <P>The new Juvenile Justice Bill will be a major and comprehensive piece of legislation which will repeal the 1908 Children Act.  The 1908 Act, which was known as the Children's Charter, was itself the culmination of over 50 years of legislative development in the area of care and protection for children and the treatment of young offenders.  The new Juvenile Justice Bill will deal with all aspects of the juvenile justice system.  Work on it is at an advanced stage, but because it is a major undertaking with significant implications for other Departments, I do not expect to be in a position to publish the Bill until later this year.</P>
    <P>Among other criminal law measures in the course of preparation at present is a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, which will greatly reduce the amount of time the Garda Síochána spend in court thus freeing them to spend more time on operational duties.  I also have legislative proposals well advanced in the areas of criminal insanity and fraud.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> The motion calls for legislation to abolish what is referred to as &ldquo;the unlimited right to silence&rdquo;.  There are, in fact, a number of statutory provisions which relate to providing information to the Garda Síochána in relation to particular offences.  For example, sections 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, allow a court or a jury to draw inferences from an accused's failure or refusal in the course of Garda questioning to account for certain matters.  This is an area of the law which I am keeping under review.</P>
    <P>The motion also call for reform of bail laws.  I am aware of the legitimate and widespread public concern about the operation of the law in this area and, indeed, I have made it clear publicly that I share that concern.  It is an unfortunate reality that serious offenders facing the likelihood of long periods of imprisonment on other charges are tempted &mdash; and sometimes do &mdash; to use their time on bail to commit further offences.  That situation is clearly unacceptable and I am determined that it will be addressed effectively.  That is why earlier this year I raised the problem with my colleagues in Government and we decided to request the Attorney General to secure the advice of the Law Reform Commission on the options that may be open to bring about a change in the law on bail.</P>
    <P>There is no point pretending that complex issues do not arise in this area but I believe the House will accept that the Law Reform Commission is uniquely placed to provide the type of detailed analysis and considered and comprehensive proposals for change that are necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope that the House can accept too, particularly in the light of the track record I have outlined in relation to criminal law reform, that when the commission's proposals are available they will be acted on with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the concerns which the Senators have raised about our courts system, I am of course very concerned by delays in the hearing of cases in our courts.  A review of activity levels in all <Col N="997" /> courts has been carried out by my Department to assess the impact of the increased civil jurisdictions introduced by the Courts Act, 1991.  The results of this review will form the basis of proposals which I will be bringing to Government shortly with a view to eliminating present delays in the courts.  The question of additional judicial resources will be addressed by these proposals.  As the House will appreciate, I cannot be more specific as to the content of these proposals prior to their consideration by Government.  With regard to delays in the hearing of criminal cases, I would like to inform the House that, as part of the law and order package, I have already obtained Government approval for the appointment of three additional judges, one to the District Court, one to the Circuit Court and one to the High Court, to deal with delays in the hearing of criminal cases.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware that delays in the hearing of criminal cases give rise to much anxiety on the part of the victims of crime, particularly where the defendant is remanded on bail.  As I already mentioned, defendants remanded on bail whose cases cannot be heard for lack of a judge are in effect free to commit further crimes.  The three additional judicial appointments will address this.  The necessary legislative provision will form part of a new Court and Court Officers Bill currently under preparation.</P>
    <P>As this House will appreciate, the organisation and management of the High Court, including the listing of cases, is the responsibility of the President of the High Court and is one in which I have no function.  I am of course committed to providing within the resources available to me the facilities necessary, including computer facilities, to enable the courts to give an efficient and effective service.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to two distinct aspects of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal which I will deal with in turn.  First, it proposes that the tribunal be established on a statutory basis.  I have not been convinced by the Senators' arguments of immediate advantages that would arise from my doing this.  The <Col N="998" /> scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted commenced in February 1974.  The effective date of application of the scheme is 1 October 1972.  During the 20 years since its establishment, the tribunal has received almost 12,000 applications for compensation. Awards have been paid in about 7,800 cases.  The total amount paid out in awards up to the end of 1993 is £41.3 million.  Decisions as to the awarding of compensation and the determination of the amount of such award are, in accordance with the scheme, entirely a matter for the tribunal, and the Minister for Justice has no role in these matters.</P>
    <P>A statutorily established criminal injuries tribunal as envisaged by the Senators would, in my view, be operating in an almost identical manner to the present tribunal.  While in the long term it might be desirable to give the Tribunal a formal place in our legislative code, it is not among my priorities for legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of funding for criminal injuries compensation is the second point raised by the Senators.  The payment of awards by the tribunal is made from funding provided in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice.  Overall, in the past six years the very sizeable sum of £18 million has been paid out on such awards.  The 1994 Estimate includes a sum of £1 million in respect of awards.  I would like to have been in a position to secure a larger allocation for the criminal injuries compensation scheme in 1994, but there are many competing demands for the limited resources available and it was not possible to secure a larger allocation for criminal injuries.  If, however, the opportunity presents itself of adding to the sum available as a result of savings elsewhere, I will certainly give it priority.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment in the names of Senators O'Toole, Lee, Norris and Henry in relation to the establishment of intervention programmes at primary school level, I suppose the obvious temptation would be to say, as Senator O'Toole suggested I might, that the specific matters raised &mdash; provision of <Col N="999" /> hot meals for schoolchildren and so on &mdash; are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Education, and leave it at that. While it is a case that the specifics are matters for the Minister for Education, I fully appreciate, having worked as a school teacher myself, the importance of understanding the interplay between the education system and the criminal justice system, particularly in relation to the problem of young children at risk.  As the inter-departmental group's report on urban crime and disorder puts it, &ldquo;the atrisk child who is neglected today stands a more than even chance of becoming tomorrow's offender.&rdquo;  In many cases, non-attendance at school is closely associated with school-related problems such as poor educational attainment, the unsuitability of curricula and methodologies in addressing the particular learning needs of certain pupils who are likely to see little value in schooling, and the disaffection of such pupils with teachers and with the general authority structure of the school, as quoted by Senator Ormonde.  This group often, sadly, become what are referred to as &ldquo;drop-outs&rdquo; from the educational system.</P>
    <P>We all know of course that there are non-school related factors involved in the drop-out syndrome, if I can put it like that.  Malnutrition and lack of proper clothing, for example, and the low priority placed on education by families who find themselves in stressful situations are probably the main contributors to the problem.  The recent school attendance/ truancy report by my colleague, the Minister for Education, refers to the fact that the National Youth Policy Committee report, 1984, provided the most comprehensive analysis of records for persistent non-attendance at school.  It found the more widely based reasons for non-attendance to be hidden disabilities, such as brutality, hunger, or moral danger within the home; broken homes arising from alcoholism or domestic violence; delinquency due to alcohol and drug abuse and trouble with the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> There are limits to what I, as Minister for Justice, can do within the sphere of my functional responsibilities.  I have referred to my initiative in establishing and funding certain projects in particular areas of economic and social deprivation and of my plans to expand on these initiatives, which are targeted mainly at young people who may find themselves in trouble with the law.  I also met, as he generously acknowledged, with Senator O'Toole and some of his colleagues to discuss matter such as those mentioned in the addendum to the motion.  This followed an earlier meeting with senior officials in my Department.  Most importantly, perhaps, I will be bringing these matters to the attention of the Government shortly in the context of proposals to give new impetus to the implementation of the report of the inter-departmental group on urban crime and disorder to which I have already referred. I will have more to say on this subject in due course.</P>
    <P>I have summarised the more important policies and measures I have adopted in terms of the criminal justice area and I have explained that many of the specific issues referred to the in the motion are being addressed.  However, as I also explained at the outset of my remarks, not everything can be done at once.  I have ordered my priorities in terms of what, on the evidence and advice available to me, will have the most immediate and beneficial results.  I cannot therefore accept the critical import of the motion put down by Senators Dardis and Honan. I commend instead the amendment tabled by Senator Wright and proposed by Senator Ormonde to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom fáilte a chuir roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo agus comhghairdeas a ghabháil lei maidir leis an obair mhaith atá á déanamh aici chun cosc a chur ar coir agus creachadóireacht.  There is no doubt that we have many problems in that regard and I sometimes wonder what the answer is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 25 years ago we had very little crime.  It was possible to come to Dublin, <Col N="1001" /> park a car anywhere around the city and go window-shopping at night and nobody would go near the car.  Despite our great educational system, which is one of the best in the western world, crime and vandalism are becoming a huge problem.  We should look at the amount of time, money and work which has been spent on psychologists, psychiatrists, social welfare workers and remedial teachers.  Despite all this we still do not seem to be coming up with an answer to the crime problem.</P>
    <P>I have said with regard to the health and the educational area that I believe our two biggest problems are the abuse of alcohol and drugs.  Either of those once brought into a home is capable of wrecking it, but when both are brought in it can really destroy a family.  For that reason we must try to put an end to the drug barons and those who seem to be able to import drugs.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, the Government and the Garda Síochána on the amount of drugs that have been seized recently.  They are certainly making an all out attack on it.  When the assets of these people can be confiscated, it will further hinder them and bring peace to our streets.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder what has happened to responsibility, another word we hear very little of now.  We hear a lot about rights, but not about responsibilities or respect.  Over 90 per cent of our youth today are as good or better than they were in the past.  They are involved in a lot of very good community work, but that small minority are causing many problems.  There is no doubt that some youths are not attending school &mdash;&ldquo;scheming&rdquo; as we called it, truancy as it is called now.  Why can we not come to grips with these problems?  In the old days the garda would visit the school three or four times a year and questions were asked about anyone who was not attending.  In the old schools the teacher knew every pupil and their parents and would know the child who might have come to school with no breakfast, for example.  I remember in my old school in Carney we would be sent up to a woman called Mrs. Dunne to get a cup of tea <Col N="1002" /> and some bread and butter.  That human personal touch no longer exists.  If we are to have a good society we must have a good community with the personal touch.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána does a good job and I am happy with the information the Minister has given us this evening.  The gardaí will be able to spend more time on outdoor policing duties and less time doing paperwork.  There is a view abroad, right or wrong, that gardaí have to have so many court cases to exist.  We should put an end to this view.  Honest hardworking people may violate the law in some way, perhaps coming home in a tractor without the lights on after a hard day's work or in a car with something minor wrong.  They can be brought to court and they get annoyed and do not co-operate with the law as they should. If it is the case that gardaí have to have so many cases, then it should be abolished. The Garda want the co-operation of all of the community.</P>
    <P>In the old days the Garda sergeant was, as the old saying goes, &ldquo;monarch of all he surveyed&rdquo; and his right there was for none to dispute.  He was based in an area and he knew everybody there and everybody knew him.  There was a great community spirit with no law breaking. Nowadays, the gardaí do not know the people in their area; they are not in communication with the community as in the past because their work schedule is completely different.  I would like to see the gardaí have a more personal role and something done to instil greater respect. In days gone by there was great respect for the school teacher, the parish priest, the curate or parson and for the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there respect for politicians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In those days there was. For whom is there respect today?  Something is wrong when that respect is lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old practice of not reporting anybody or &ldquo;telling tales out of school&rdquo;.  In order to confront the crime wave, we have to encourage the community. In my village 33 or 34 years ago whether or not one locked the shop at <Col N="1003" /> night no one would interfere with it; one could leave cars unattended on the street. We now have to have burglar alarms and secure and lock everything.  In itself crime is a big business and it creates many jobs for security firms etc.</P>
    <P>Another problem now is that criminals are motorised and can move quickly from place to place.  The Garda have a problem in being able to follow up crime fast enough, because the criminals are often one step ahead as they are often good clever planners.  Policing is a difficult task and it is unfair that the Garda Síochána is sometimes accused of not doing its duty.  It does a good job and I commend the force.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bring in more on-the-spot fines.  If one is stopped for speeding it would be easier to have the fine paid there and then.  At present, if one is stopped for speeding in Kinnegad and one is from Sligo, one has to get a solicitor to plead at the court sitting in Kinnegad. More use should be made of on-the-spot fines.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on doing a good job.  She is one of the best Ministers for Justice we have had since the first Government in 1919.  She is facing up to the problems and taking the difficult decisions.  In the next couple of years we will see a change.  She is doing the right things at the right time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The growing level of crime is extremely disturbing.  Statistics show a serious upward trend, which is a cause of concern for all citizens.  People are affected by crime throughtout the country, whether in the cities or in the rural communities.  The statistics present us with hard facts indicating the failure of <Col N="1004" /> the Government to halt the unacceptable increase in the crime rate and to protect the people and allow them to feel safe in their homes, on the streets, commuting to and from work, at their place of work or at their place of entertainment.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about rural policing policies.  The present arrangements whereby small rural Garda stations are open for a limited number of hours per day is totally unacceptable.  The gardaí are not in touch with the community and are not aware of what is happening in the locality.  When the Garda sergeant lived in the rural station and members of the Garda lived in the community there was much more awareness of deviant activity and the gardaí were always on the alert to cope with it.</P>
      <P>Commuting gardaí to rural areas is inadequate for the purpose of rural policing. This has been mentioned in the context of the recent tragic occurrences in County Clare.  There is a strong belief in that community that if the present rural policing policies had not been introduced, matters would have been different. I ask the Minister for Justice as a matter of urgency to re-examine the Government's policy on rural policing and bring the Garda back to rural communities.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House calls for a reform of the bail laws and this requires an amendment to the Constitution.  It is regrettable that the Government will not take the opportunity to have a referendum in June to do this.  It was an excellent opportunity for the Minister to introduce the constitutional change necessary to allow the bail laws to be reformed.  Murderers, rapists and robbers are being freed by Irish courts.  The bail laws facilitate this outrageous situation. The law must be amended to stop people who are charged with crimes being freed and to compound this with further offences because they know that they will not be punished in any event. The law needs to be tightened up urgently so that the courts will not have to free people who are likely to commit further serious crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> Our bail laws are the most lax in the world.  The problem is that bail cannot be refused by the court on the grounds that there is a likelihood that further offences will be committed by the accused.  A constitutional amendment is necessary to restore the discretion to the courts.  As a matter of urgency the Government must arrange the necessary referendum to allow the law to be changed and the Minister should address this as a priority.</P>
    <P>Over the years notorious organised criminals have had little difficulty in getting bail and abusing it.  For the more serious offences such as rape and bank robbery there is little ground in Irish law for objecting to bail, even if prosecutors know that the accused is likely to commit these crimes again.  We have seen shocking scenes of organised criminals out on bail having engaged in gun battles with gardaí and putting the lives of all at risk. These were people who were caught by the Garda for serious crimes, such as bank robbery, and granted bail only to be caught in the act once again.</P>
    <P>The provision for consecutive sentencing in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, has had a deterrent effect on petty crime but little or no impact on serious criminals. Organised criminals, who know that they are going to jail for one offence, have no compunction about committing other crimes because they are aware that they will serve only a fixed period of time in the overcrowded prisons.</P>
    <P>The right to silence is a relic of the last century when individuals had no access to free legal aid and punishments were more severe.  Moreover, as it stands, this right is currently a major obstacle to the Garda in its investigations into organised crime.  A suspect can refuse to answer questions or give any explanation about matters put to him in the course of an interrogation.  Experienced criminals do this as a matter of course and subversives are especially adept at it.</P>
    <P>While the abolition of the right to silence would greatly help Garda investigations, it would also protect suspects in cases where over-zealous police officers might try to extract confessions.  The <Col N="1006" /> abolition of this right would remove the importance of obtaining a self-incriminatory confession in many investigations.</P>
    <P>The right to silence was introduced at a time when an accused was rarely represented in court and could not give evidence.  Today these rules are only helping an increasing number of professional criminals to avoid conviction. The new system would simply mean that it would not be an offence to refuse to answer questions or to give explanations, but an adverse inference could be drawn from silence on a particular issue.</P>
    <P>This approach is not unique to the Irish context.  The present right to silence does not protect self-incrimination in a variety of statutory offences.  Under the Road Traffic Acts in cases like drunk driving, suspects are required to provide blood or urine samples on which they may later be convicted of an offence.  Likewise, genetic fingerprinting obliges the subject to provide a DNA sample.  If he does not, the court will be allowed to draw an inference from that.  In the case of the Revenue Commissioners, a person being investigated cannot use the right to silence to mask giving potentially incriminating evidence to tax inspectors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister saying that she will seriously look at this matter.  It is the first time the Minister has reacted positively to the many times this issue has been brought up in this House.  Criminal interviews should also be video recorded to protect the Garda from false allegations and also to ensure the rights of the individual are protected during detention.  This would also provide the courts with a true picture of the difficulties facing the Garda in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to reform our criminal law system.  Many of our laws date back to the last century and are totally inadequate to deal with the current situation.  We should immediately update and codify our criminal law.  The alarming increase in the number of inmates in our prisons is at a high cost to the taxpayer.  The whole system should be re-examined.  Prisons should only be for those convicted of a serious crime, <Col N="1007" /> against the person or against property. Sentencing duly imposed by the courts should not be arbitrarily set aside by earlier releases for reasons of overcrowding. There should be more alternatives to prison for minor offences such as the nonpayment of fines and debt.  The Minister should introduce measures where those convicted of serious offences should serve their full sentence, only allowing normal remission for good behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Government should provide resources so that those serving prison sentences would undergo training and treatment to avoid returning to criminal life.  The present drug culture in our prisons is totally unacceptable.  It is now accepted that those admitted to prison are continually exposed to peer pressure there to experiment with hard drugs.  It is a disgrace that such drugs are freely available in our prisons and it should be fully investigated.  A programme of action to deal with this difficulty should be initiated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Problems are arising in our courts. They have become punch drunk from the sheer volume of criminal cases coming before them.  We, as a society, are moving too far towards conferring privileges on our deviants while we deny our law abiding citizens their rights.  Our criminal justice system must be critically looked at and reformed.  Every day, District Courts are swamped with persons charged with all types of criminal offences.  Sometimes the sentences handed down to those people fit the crimes, but too often they fall short of what one would expect.  There is no clearly defined sentencing policy.  Criminal trials are cluttering up the system, which is in chaos because of the bureaucracy surrounding the courts.</P>
    <P>There are insufficient members of the Judiciary to deal with the level of work. Courts are cluttered up with cases that could easily be efficiently dealt with under a different system.  Courts are busy dealing with committal orders, instalment orders and so on.  These should take place elsewhere.  The Government <Col N="1008" /> should establish a debtors panel or court to relieve this area.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the proposal in the motion that the Circuit Court and our High Court systems should be modernised as part of the total review of our court system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the proposals she has brought forward in this document.  I also commend the Progressive Democrats for introducing this motion.  There are many matters in it that need to be addressed urgently and the Minister has gone a long way in there report towards doing that.</P>
      <P>I know there is a major amount of work to be done on this matter throughout the country, but criminality is currently changing.  Many people blame the lower classes and the poor for crime.  However, criminals do not come only from these sectors of society.  There are also criminals from the middle classes and the reasonably well off, tax dodgers, who regularly bleed the system, dole dodgers and drug barons who come from so called respectable areas.  There is also insurance fraud and the changing role of the itinerant. They used to trade their wares but now many people think they are involved in serious crime.  This was not part of their culture in the past.</P>
      <P>I welcome the package of law reforms introduced by the Minister on 14 December; indeed, she mentioned a few of them in her report.  I welcome a number of them, especially the allocation of 200 clerical staff to be brought into the service between 1994 and 1997.  Too many gardaí are doing paperwork in their stations when they should be out on the beat, and not only in cars.  Over a number of years, there have been some reasonably serious problems with crime in my home town of Letterkenny.  The gardaí in the town have been wrongly rostered.  They seem to spend more time on clerical work than walking the streets.  The problem could be dealt with and addressed if they were released from clerical duties and allowed to do their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people have a lack of respect for the Garda.  When a garda walked the <Col N="1009" /> beat many years ago, he was known by young people and their parents.  If any problems occurred, there seemed to be an understanding with the garda.  These problems were quickly dealt with and never seemed to get out of hand.  The perpetrator was identified early on. Someone always seemed to have the ear of the garda and the word came through the system.  This is now lacking.  There should be more gardaí on the beat, not sitting in cars or in offices.</P>
    <P>The situation is being blown out of proportion.  Many people come on the media and claim there is a major drug or crime problem in their town but give no figures or information to back this up. The Garda then say they have the situation under control.  This so called information should be curtailed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the major information technology plan outlined by the Minister.  It covered many of the issues I raised. Gardaí should be policing and not sitting behind desks.  Many other proposals were in the package.  Extra vehicles will improve and make efficient the Garda fleet.  The extra funding provided to the Garda network is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Garda commission on fraud, it was unfortunate that only the areas of high unemployment in Dublin were considered, such as the area depicted in the series &ldquo;The Family&rdquo; on RTE and BBC television.  Other areas should have been considered, such as those involving people who are much better off, the golf playing set and so on. There are major problems within these areas which could have been addressed rather than picking on an area of high unemployment and poverty.  It is always the lower classes which are picked on when examining issues such as drug abuse, sexual abuse and domestic violence. The television series &ldquo;The Family&rdquo; could have depicted the higher classes and people who are extremely well off. In this respect it was an unfortunate attack on the less well off.</P>
    <P>Regarding the prisons, occasionally people are remanded by the courts in County Donegal, my home county and <Col N="1010" /> sent to Dublin; but, because of lack of space in the holding centre or whatever, they are moved on to Spike island, County Cork.  It then emerges, for example, that one such person must travel 300 to 400 miles up the west coast to appear in court in County Donegal, but because the book of evidence, or some such, is not ready, the person has to be taken back to remand in County Cork.</P>
    <P>I have advised the Minister of State previously of this matter and suggested that consideration be given to providing a remand centre close to my area in the north west of the country.  This would save a fortune for the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Regarding the system of bail, a person in my own town had approximately 40 charges against him.  That person was being picked up for committing a crime and allowed out on bail.  But he broke into shops, was caught, charged, released again and so on.  One of the tougher aspects for the person whose shop was broken into was the fact that the insurance companies covering the premises would not provide indemnity because the insured had not given proper consideration to the small print of the insurance contract.  The shop owner endured the double blow of being broken into and having no insurance cover.</P>
    <P>It appears that the same people are committing crimes over and over again. It is easy to blame the parents; but in regard to the parents I have spoken with on many occasions, nothing but sympathy should be offered them because they have done their best to survive in this difficult situation.  In this respect I am pleased to note that the Minister indicated to the House today that this matter would be examined.</P>
    <P>Regarding the system of petitioning the Minister, which appears to be allowed under the Constitution, it is a system which I welcome and which should be retained.  I recall one case where I had reason to make use of the system.  It involved a person who had been fined a large amount of money.  He had seven or eight children and he found it difficult to <Col N="1011" /> pay the fine.  I agreed to petition the Minister for help if he agreed to do something about his alcoholism.  The Minister helped him 18 months later and the man has obtained help for himself.  In this respect the system has worked well.</P>
    <P>This is an important motion which must be welcomed and the Minister is dealing with most of the problems raised by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation regarding crime in this country has taken off and nobody is secure.  The most extraordinary aspect of the situation is that nobody feels responsible for it.  The Minister painted a picture for the House today of her intentions and the intentions of her Department and the Garda Síochána. Like all pictures, it looks good on the wall; but standing on the ground and travelling around the country, in urban or rural areas, it becomes apparent that people are afraid.  They are not afraid of the presence of the gardaí, or in regard to the promises of change and the PR exercises in which the Minister for Justice is engaged.  People are afraid for their own personal safety and their own property, and nobody is going to tell me otherwise. Furthermore, the crime situation appears to be on a slippery slope. Approximately 3.5 million people live in this country, which is not an excessive number in terms of population density. Given a country with such a small population, the availability of modern equipment and modern facilities, there has to be something wrong when the Garda Síochána have lost the battle against crime and the criminal is winning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many changes have been introduced &mdash; for example the closing down of Garda stations in rural areas.  In any war, if an army of occupation vacates its positions and withdraws to other areas, what will happen to the vacated area?  The enemy will move in and take it over; and, regrettably, this has happened.  Criminals are driving around in vans and so on, 50, 60 and 70 miles from home, calling on people and making excuses to gain access to houses.  Everybody knows that these <Col N="1012" /> people are scouting out, but there is nobody to apprehend them.  As it is her sole responsibility, the Minister for Justice must take seriously the fact that crime is winning in this country, that people are genuinely afraid in their homes and that taxpayers and old people are entitled to security, something they do not have today.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of bail, the Garda arrest people but they are then bailed out from remand.  They wave at the gardaí, showing them they are out again.  Once out on bail they commit more crimes.  If the Minister is serious she should immediately deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>An application in respect of the refurbishment of the courthouse in Longford is with the Department of Justice for a long time.  I ask the Minister to deal with this urgently.  We want to see it refurbished. The courthouse in your home town, a Chathaoirligh, was refurbished this week and opened by the Minister. What is good enough for Athlone should be good enough for Longford.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has a difficult job. I have always been a supporter and defender of the force.  It is the last line of defence.  A country without a police force is in chaos.  The Garda needs support from the Minister and the Department.  I appeal to the Minister to initiate action on the ground to root out criminals and lock them up.  We have too many laws but not enough order.  People must be defended and order restored.  The Minister must set about this task.</P>
    <P>The community alert scheme in rural areas has received a great deal of support from the community.  People have supported it because they are afraid for themselves and their neighbours.  This is a sign of where we stand today.  I am not an old man but can remember when doors were always open during the day and night.  Now people, especially the elderly, are afraid to open their doors and shiver if they hear a knock.  One could understand this if there were ten, 15 or 20 million people living on this island.  The day will come in the not too distant future when people will defend <Col N="1013" /> themselves if the forces of order break down and cannot control the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael supports most of what is contained in the motion.  Most of its points are part and parcel of our policy.  We favour reform of the bail laws. We called on the Government to hold a referendum on them on 9 June to coincide with the European and urban elections.  Such a referendum would be worthwhile.  I believe most people would support reform of these laws.  I regret the Government's failure to take this opportunity.</P>
      <P>I have seen the petitions system working on occasion and it has some good points.  However, the existing system is unsatisfactory and needs close scrutiny and some changes.</P>
      <P>I and a number of people in my party are concerned about the existing right to silence.  It is an outrage that people accused of serious crimes and brought to Garda stations are able to order meals and ask for their doctor and solicitor before any examination starts.  This will now be videotaped.  The battle is lost at this stage because people have an unlimited right to silence.</P>
      <P>There is considerable fear throughout Ireland and I believe terror stalks the land.  Some years ago everybody would be concerned if a murder had taken place.  Details of an unsolved murder were given on the television programme &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; the other night.  There are three unsolved murders in the west.  I am not certain of the situation regarding the body found in Athlone this morning and will not comment on it.  There are at least four, possibly five, unsolved murders. This has not occurred in my lifetime before.  There is no doubt that a certain level of responsibility falls on the Minister and the Government because of the existing situation.  If people want to commit murders, they will be able to do so irrespective of what kind of police force we have.  However, one should not facilitate and make it easier for a person to commit such crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke against the changes made to rural policing by the then Minister for <Col N="1014" /> Justice, Deputy Ray Burke.  More gardaí were moved from towns in Laois, Offaly and the midlands than the number of gardaí which look after Ministers for Justice. Up to ten gardaí perform this role, whereas small villages and towns were deprived of the two or three gardaí they had continuously over the years.  I appeal to the Minister to re-examine what is happening to the rural policing system. The only way to have communication between ordinary citizens and the Garda is for gardaí to live among the people. Senator Maloney gave a cogent description of how he saw the situation in Letterkenny. I agree fully with the points he made.  It is essential for gardaí to walk the streets and meet people so that they are part and parcel of the local community. This was always the strength of the Garda, whose members lived in the community and were part of its life.  This situation is changing rapidly and for the worse.  I hope this will be re-examined by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a serious crime which was committed.  The wife of a member of the Garda &mdash; I will not say what rank &mdash; was approached and asked to convey important information to him.  The person who was giving the information was afraid to be seen talking to a garda because of the significance of the information. They quietly conveyed the information to the wife in a supermarket.  The point I am making is that the person was only able to convey the information because they knew the wife.  There is a breakdown in communication here and it is absolutely essential that we re-examine it.  The Minister should ensure that Garda stations are reopened and, if necessary, houses should be provided so that gardaí can live in those villages and towns.  If this problem is left unattended, people will no longer bother speaking into the green man on the door but will keep the information to themselves.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention by a number of gardaí that they are obliged to bring in a certain number of summonses every month.  Could the Minister tell me if that is true?  Gardaí have told me they have to go out and serve summonses. <Col N="1015" /> It is not the duty of a garda to serve summonses but rather to prevent and control crime.  The Garda Síochána were never intended to be revenue collectors or to collecting fines for summonses. Their duty is the protection of citizens' rights.  If the country is so stuck for finance that ordinary people, in cases where a caution would suffice, have to be brought to court for minor offences, then we are heading down the wrong street.  If it is not true I will go back to those gardaí and tell them that is not Government policy.</P>
    <P>Our prison system should be a rehabilitation area but it should also serve as a deterrent.  Regrettably, it is not a deterrent. What is sad about our prison system is that so many people come out of prison involved in drugs or with AIDS.  The prisons should be clean and properly run. However, they should be a deterrent and people should have to work while they are in prison.  The existing situation needs to be examined.  The revolving door is part of the cause of the continually spiralling level of crime.</P>
    <P>I cannot support the amendment which commends what the Minister is doing because, regrettably, I cannot commend what she is doing.  I believe that if the people were asked to vote on whether to congratulate the Minister on what she is doing the answer would be in the negative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this important debate.  It is a matter of some disappointment that, on an issue of this gravity, the full muster could not be brought to bear on the Government side of the House.</P>
      <P>The motion calls on the Minister to take certain actions and, to be fair to her, she dealt with some of the issues in her reply &mdash; unlike the Minister for Equality and Law Reform who dealt with very few of the issues which were raised when we were discussing public liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the disappointing aspects of her reply is that once again we are into this paralysis of analysis &mdash; Whitaker produces a report and then we produce a <Col N="1016" /> policy document on the report; we decide that the Law Reform Commission must look at the matter and, in due course, bring forward its recommendations; we then probably have a review of the recommendations and eventually, at some undefined time when the Government's period in office has expired, it becomes an issue for the incoming Government and so on and so forth <i>ad nauseam</i>.  That is why we do not do anything.</P>
    <P>However, the demand within the country is that we do something decisive and effective now.  As Senator Enright said &mdash; to use the cliché &mdash; fear stalks the land.  There are people living in fear, afraid to leave their homes even during the day; there are people who are afraid to walk down the streets of our cities. That is an appalling reflection on our society and it is up to the Government to deal with those defects.  It is not society's fault that all of these things happen. Some of the blame can be firmly laid at the door of the Administration and the Government.  Those responsibilities must be dealt with where they lie, which is what is being asked here this evening.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's respect for the Garda Commissioner whom I know to be an effective and hard working officer and someone who does his job well.  I agree with her that there are no quick fix solutions. However, the motion does not ask for quick fix solutions but considered and detailed solutions brought forward in a balanced and reasonable way.</P>
    <P>The question of resources was mentioned and the Minister's reply was anticipated by Senator Quinn in his contribution.  If we were to take a clinical balance sheet approach to this issue, we would have to say that the cost to society of crime is much higher than the investment which should be made to rectify the situation.  It would be money well invested.  During my earlier contribution, I indicated where some of the resources could be found from outside the State apparatus through the leasing of prisons and so on.  There are ways of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> The extra provision of gardaí, clerical workers and staff are to be welcomed. The increases to the fleet are also to be welcomed provided that the cars are not smashed up by the potholes when in pursuit of criminals.  However, the resources which, according to the Minister, are being allocated in respect of fraud are totally inadequate to deal with the type of white collar crime which exists and which is just as bad and has just as pervasive an effect on our society as more extreme forms of crime.</P>
    <P>I was in Ardee this afternoon where I saw the green man.  The point about the green man is that it comes back to the necessity of having gardaí on the beat.  It is no good pressing a button in Ardee at 10 p. m. to call somebody in Navan to respond to a crisis in Ardee.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell mentioned that when we were growing up we looked up to and respected the local policeman.  As youngsters, we sometimes feared him because our parents made us fear him. The Garda are doing a very difficult and dangerous job and they are not getting the support they deserve either in resources or in law.  It must be a great frustration for them to go to court and see people whom they, in all conscience, believe to be criminals and who should be convicted walk free and laugh at them. That is not how the Garda should be protected and resourced by the State.</P>
    <P>Returning to earlier days, I remember in the fabled time of &ldquo;Lugs&rdquo; Brannigan when I was a university student when there was mayhem in the Olympic Ballroom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The serious point I wish to make is that we have got to the stage that if a garda lays a hand on anybody he <Col N="1018" /> is the criminal and not the person he is apprehending.  There is something wrong with a society where that happens.  Let us give the Garda the resources, respect and protection under law which they deserve.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem in society as a whole may be related to the violence we see on our televisions daily in Northern Ireland, paramilitary activity and so on. The balance is wrong.  It is the victim who should be supported but frequently it is the criminal who is supported by the apparatus of the State, not the victim.  I met a lady in Wexford whose house was burgled.  The criminal was convicted but she cannot get her possessions back from the local Garda station.  She has had enough trauma without adding that to it. The emphasis is in the wrong place; the victim must be supported.</P>
      <P>The matter of the bail laws has been discussed.  If a referendum is required, let us have it.  It will be carried overwhelmingly. Incidentally we did not ask for the right to silence to be abolished. We asked for the abolition of the unlimited right to silence.  There is a distinction which was dealt with effectively by Senator Neville.  The area of compensation for victims should be put on a statutory basis as should the pain and suffering element.  It could be funded from the seizure of the assets of criminals. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was welcoming the fact that in section 21 there is an increase from £10,000 to £13,000 in the capital value &mdash; using the term capital allowances and deduction for running expenses &mdash; to be granted for tax purposes in respect of cars used for business.  There has been an increase in the sale of new cars since 1 January 1994 as a result of the budget concessions.  These matters are now being addressed in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Many people have been concerned by the proposal in the Finance Bill to address the taxation of unemployment benefit particularly in relation to people who are systematically in short term work.  In the south east we have quite a large number of such workers in the dairy industry employed by the major co-ops in Waterford and Kilkenny.  This is seasonal work.  These people will be adversely hit by the section which makes unemployment benefit reckonable for tax purposes. It has been decided in the Finance Bill that there will be a derogation of this tax until April 1995, however, it is causing quite an amount of concern among the large number of people in what is considered to be short term employment but is systematically becoming part-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motor industry has benefited from this provision.  The Minister is reflecting the benefits that will come to the Department of Finance as a result of budgetary changes regarding the motor industry for which I thank him.  Major changes have been made in concessions to the film industry.  It has been announced in the last few days that there is a major film being made in Ireland.  During recent years a number of small films have been made in Ireland and they have had a tremendous impact on the economy of some small towns and villages.  Last year a film of a book by Maeve Binchy was <Col N="1022" /> made in Inistioge, County Kilkenny.  This year another film has just completed shooting in that village.  The amount of short time work generated by such film making has been of tremendous benefit not only to the village of Inistioge but also to the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>People do not consider County Kilkenny to be a tourist area but we know the beauty of Kilkenny and appreciate its historic importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Inistioge is one of the most beautiful villages in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tourism in Kilkenny has grown as a result of film companies working there.  It is not only people associated with filming who benefit but also carpenters, fitters and other technical personnel, some of whom might have been unemployed for some time.  One recent major benefit of film making in Kilkenny was the transformation of the facade of a Government building into that of a mock hotel.  It demonstrated how beautiful that building could be.  It was built in the 1960s for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and it is one of the ugliest buildings approaching Kilkenny Castle.  I have had a problem since the filming finished because the facade has been taken down.  The facade showed what could be done with the building.  I welcome section 35 which assists the film industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of elements in the Bill will be of long term benefit to industry and employment in Ireland.  There is a realisation at Government level that the Finance Bill following the budget can play a major role in increasing the employment prospects of many of the unemployed. There have been significant changes in personal income tax reliefs and in VAT thresholds.  The increase in those thresholds will be of benefit to small companies. The reduction of the threshold for payment of VAT on cash receipts to £250,000 will also be of great benefit. Smaller firms have been suffering for many years because they have been paying VAT on sales and not on cash receipts.  There is no doubt that small <Col N="1023" /> firms which give credit and which have difficulty getting payment within the specified two month period will benefit from that measure.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme which is being extended to smaller towns is welcome. The urban renewal scheme in Kilkenny has been very good aesthetically for the city centre and it will generate much industry during the next ten to 15 years.  However, there are problems associated with the incentives in such schemes.  Unfortunately, many small businesses will close as a result of the effect of rates and the tax incentives being given in these areas.  The impact of major supermarkets in such areas means that the playing field is no longer level. We must ensure that, when we extend the urban renewal schemes, we do not go too far in offering incentives.  We must be equally cognisant of the traders who have been there for some time and who also have the right to live.</P>
    <P>While there are problems in the taxation system and in the collection of taxes, the Finance Bill, 1994, goes a long way towards resolving the problems that confront us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  It is a universally acknowledged fact that one can recognise how an economy is performing by the proportion of money spent on the arts.  If the economy is bad the arts budget is cut, so all must be well with our economy because there has been an improvement in the allocation of moneys for the arts in this budget.  In addition, there is recognition of the value of important art collections and historic houses.  Tax relief has been given to the owners of such collections and houses who open them to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to talk about the sections of the Bill which relate to the visual arts. I wish to discuss how the performing arts are addressed in the Bill.  The section of the Bill which deals with the film industry is very welcome and the recent success of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in having a major film made in this country is incredible.  Smaller films, <Col N="1024" /> as other speakers have said, have been produced here and others are currently under production.  Some have done well in competitions so the dividends can already be seen.</P>
    <P>However, we must look at the full range of the performing arts as an industry. It is an industry in which we excel and in which, if it receives attention particularly from the Department of Finance, there can be enormous growth in the future.  Many Members are experts on the popular music industry.  Apart from praising the efforts of our national and international stars and groups, I was delighted when we won the Eurovision Song Contest for the third time in a row. What is all this nonsense about another £1.5 million to stage it?  How many countries would not give their eye teeth to have such a tremendous opportunity? What a wonderful advertisement for the country.  When it is demonstrated that one is good in one area people get the impression that one is capable in other areas also.  Anybody who watched these productions can see that it was not simply artistic endeavour that was important, although there was obviously great skill involved in producing the entire show.  I envisage a situation where our song writers will be bought, like major soccer stars, by other countries.  The only hope of some countries winning the Eurovision Song Contest might be to buy an Irish songwriter.</P>
    <P>I applaud what is achieved in the popular music sector.  Many young Irish people are employed in that industry, not only singing and dancing in front of the cameras but also in live performances and many ancillary services.  It is an industry which must be encouraged.</P>
    <P>We must have a central focus for the performing arts.  The National Concert Hall has been one of our most successful ventures, particularly in recent years. Over 300 events take place there every year with an audience of almost 300,000 people annually.  There is an average seat occupancy of 80 per cent of which any theatre anywhere would be extraordinarily proud.  A tremendous wide range of artistes perform there.  In the <Col N="1025" /> recent past there was Isaac Stern, Nana Mouskouri, Acker Bilk, Anne-Sophie Mutter, visiting orchestras, the National Symphony Orchestra, school choirs, youth orchestras and tremendous educational programmes for children; in other words, there was something for everyone.</P>
    <P>The Minister has greatly increased the grant to the National Concert Hall but in the coming year he should address the original plans for the concert hall site, which have not yet been brought to fruition. The site was to have been a centre for the nation's performing arts but its potential has not been fully recognised or realised.</P>
    <P>It was proposed that there be a smaller second auditorium in the UCD medical library.  Other parts of the UCD medical and engineering faculties which remain on the Earlsfort Terrace site were also to be incorporated in this national performance centre so that there could be better facilities for storage of instruments, administration of the concert hall, etc.  The UCD faculties have still not been consolidated in Belfield, which would make room for this important move at the concert hall.  The Iveagh Gardens could be incorporated into the site, which would bring them to their full potential and give great pleasure to Dubliners and people visiting the capital.</P>
    <P>It would cost money to move the remainder of the medical and engineering faculties to Belfield but one wonders how economical it is to have them where they are.  If we move them out we might save money and also have a fine performing arts centre at Earlsfort Terrace. Few capital cities could envisage having so wonderful a site in which to begin such a project.</P>
    <P>There is a dearth of facilities for the performing arts in Dublin.  Practice places are necessary for gigs, concerts, theatre shows, etc.  It is sad to see the Ambassador cinema at the top of O'Connell Street in such an appalling state of dereliction.  Somehow finance must be acquired to improve this building on our capital's main street which has traditionally <Col N="1026" /> been a centre for entertainment.</P>
    <P>I recently attended the &ldquo;Music in the Classroom&rdquo; seminar staged by <i>The Irish Times</i> and RTE in the NCH.  Both organisations must be praised for this venture. In his keynote address the renowned violinist Issac Stern spoke of the value of music in our education and how little importance is attached to it at present.  A dedicated primary teacher spoke about forming a concert band in school, initially with tin whistles.  This gave incredible joy to the children involved.  He later expanded to harmoniums and recorders.</P>
    <P>Another teacher working in a deprived area spoke of forming a choir.  This gave tremendous stimulus to the local children who had little on-site education available in the area and became a focus of after school activity.  When listening to the discussion on this evening's motion about juvenile crime, I felt that if the same amount of effort had been made in that area as had been made by these teachers, we might have far less need for juvenile detention centres.</P>
    <P>Money will be needed to start these bands.  The Minister must know the allocation for starting a school orchestra is £225.  I have confidence in the ability of the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, but she could not even start a tin whistle band with that money.  The next time a Department of Finance official is passing Walton's or McCullough Pigott's, he or she should go in to ask the price of a flute or violin.</P>

      <P>Musical events are not my only concern.  The theatre needs the same encouragement and discussion given to the film industry.  As the Bill indicates changes are under way to the manner in which money is allocated to theatre, especially the Abbey, our national theatre. Perhaps I should not say too much about the Abbey because all the staff are under protective notice.  The funding to all theatres is given by the Department <Col N="1027" /> of Finance through the Arts Council but it is given on such a short term basis that planning is difficult.  Grants are given to the Abbey, the Gate and the Cork Opera House but since they do not know what funding they will receive from year to year they have problems making long term arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Irish theatre is important because it is an area in which we excel.  However not every production will be a hit and we cannot run pantomimes all year round, so we will have to accept that we must subsidise some of these productions.  We must look on the theatre as an industry because there are offshoots from all these productions, actors must be trained, as must set designers, lighting and sound people, etc.  We should not consider money given to a theatre as money wasted even if it does not have a good production in a given year.  We are still training people who may be successful in other areas.  I was glad that travelling shows and funfairs will pay the reduced 12.5 per cent VAT rate, because they were the lifeblood of entertainment in Ireland for so long.</P>
      <P>Urban renewal grants seem to be directed at residential and industrial development.  What happens to groups who wish to develop theatres outside urban areas?  In Dún Laoghaire there was a thriving theatre above the Gas Company for a long time but there has been a hiatus for some years.  A new group is trying to develop a theatre complex on the old Pavilion site.  What tax relief could they expect on their capital expenses?  Would they receive BES money?  It appears this has not been considered and it would be useful to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arts Council does its best with the money it receives and its funding has increased in this budget but we must think ahead.  Our famous actors, like Barry McGovern, are booked up until 1999.  They cannot be called up at short notice to come into a production.  We should be in a position to tell our great actors they will be employed for two weeks every year at a given location but because of the way money is distributed <Col N="1028" /> at present we cannot do this.  If we want a good theatre industry we will have to examine the issues carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Burke and Senator Cosgrave for getting me a larger audience.</P>
      <P>This is a good day to discuss the performing arts in this House because the best and most attractive demonstration I have ever seen was outside the House today.  A group with balloons was playing, singing and dancing.  It was a new, non-aggressive form of demonstration.</P>
      <P>As regards urban renewal and the theatre, I spoke about Dún Laoghaire, but it is also important to help theatres in other parts of the country.  Cork Corporation, as Senator Kelleher will be aware, gives one of the most generous grants to the arts.  Coming from Cork myself, I realise how important this is.  The Cork Opera House is also well supported by the Arts Council.  However, the people of Cork must be praised for their own individual industry which they started with little encouragement and help.  The Irish Operatic and Repertory Company Limited is Cork based.  As a result of drive and hard work, it now has a good small local orchestra and choral singers who are trained into one of the best professional choruses in the country.  These are employed people in an industry which is spread over the country.  It is easy, from the arts point of view, to say the sculpture factory in Cork is an industry.  However, we must envisage the Vanbrugh string quartet as being part of the music industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Theatre is an essential Irish art form because we excel in this area.  I am not a believer in false modesty when we discuss this art form because we should say what is true.  The theatres must run throughout the country.  Films are important, but the <Col N="1029" /> State cannot afford to fund films.  It would cost 50 times more to make one film than to produce a play, which could run in any of the Irish cities for a month or more.  I ask the Minister in his next budget to help the small theatres and small theatre companies in places like Cork, Galway, Limerick, Sligo, Waterford, and throughout the country by being as imaginative as possible in his dealings with the theatre and with those involved in the performing arts.  As he has seen with the theatre and with those involved in the performing arts.  As he has seen with the film industry in this budget, proper indigenous companies in this country can be established and I am sure we will get as good a return as we appear to be getting from the film industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  On numerous occasions we spoke about giving incentives to people to do something for themselves and to encourage competitiveness and an entrepreneurial instinct.  Recently I spoke about the Task Force on Small Business and I am glad that many of its recommendations have been implemented or acknowledged in this budget.  It is important that those who looked at the negatives in the Finance Bill, 1994, acknowledge this fact. This Bill is another step in helping to bring about economic growth, a stable economy, low inflation and low interest rates and to help people to go to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister spoke about tax reform, particularly in the area of personal income tax.  It is important to acknowledge this fact because for too long we said that the price of labour in this country was too high.  This was not so for employers, but the burden placed on them by the Exchequer meant they <Col N="1030" /> could not compete.  We lost our focus in this area many years ago.</P>
    <P>I am confident there will be an upturn in the economy as a result of prudent fiscal management.  I have listened to the Opposition's claims that they want money paid out, but then they call for tax reductions.  I do not have to explain the equation to the Senators, but they must remember the speeches they made last year.  Income tax has been acknowledged as the greatest obstacle to creating employment in our State.  We have now realised this and done something about it.  The ESRI report and the European Union have said the Irish economy is the most stable of the 12 member states.  The OECD countries have also reiterated this view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was not elected in Cork either.  I want to speak on the Finance Bill, 1994, without interruption.</P>
      <P>The Task Force on Small Business suggested that income tax was the greatest obstacle to creating employment.  This has been acknowledged in the Finance Bill, 1994, and steps have been taken to implement the recommendations on personal taxation made by the Task Force on Small Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to what the people have endured since 1987.  They should be celebrating because they have suffered for too long and they have made sacrifices since 1987.  The reward has been seen and I am confident that with the upturn in the economy, due to prudent fiscal management by the Governments since <Col N="1031" /> 1987, the people will be able to say they endured to succeed.  A great person in Irish history once said &ldquo;Those who endure most prevail&rdquo;.  The sacrifices made in 1987, 1988 and 1989 have now come to fruition and I am confident this will be borne out in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Everyone blames politicians and individuals, but banks and institutions have a major role to play in Irish society in the creation of employment, in encouraging entrepreneurial instinct and in encouraging people to create work.  For far too long the banks have operated in an uncompetitive environment.  Competitiveness is the backbone of any modern economy and it encourages people to work.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, banks put a millstone around the neck of the average person looking for a loan or capital to start up their own business in order to take themselves off the dole or out of a State agency and, perhaps, provide a job for someone else.  These issues must be addressed. We have got everything right, with the exception of the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Banks do not see themselves as a partner in any risk taking business, but unfortunately they reap the profits.  It is time to open up the banking sector and to provide competition.  Banks have been profitable over the past number of years and I welcome that because it is an indication of how sound the economy is.  If banks are making money, it shows we are confident and that foreign investment is coming into the country and that people are willing to invest in the economy.</P>
    <P>Our aim in the coming years must be to encourage banks, not by way of legislation, to provide finance at a reasonable rate.  The Task Force on Small Business claimed that the biggest problem in Ireland was, not the start-up or the entrepreneurial instinct, but the failure rate, and that was acknowledged in its report. The reason for this was personal taxation &mdash; no reward for risk and a lack of reasonable finance.  The budget has acknowledged the first two, but it is not within its ambit to acknowledge the third.  That <Col N="1032" /> is why I based my contribution on banks, because they are the final cog.  If the banks come together with the Government, with the continuing prudent fiscal management, which has given confidence to the people, over the next few years we will be rewarded by an upturn in our economy and in the economy worldwide. The indications are good and we should see a decrease in unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>I refer to the urban renewal schemes. I come from a constituency with a large urban area.  It has been suggested that it is socially deprived.  The urban renewal schemes in this area have been successful and I am glad the budget has provided for their continuation.  In recent years in Cork city and in the Temple Bar area of Dublin, we have seen growth where deprivation once existed and where buildings were demolished on a large scale.  There was unacceptable deprivation in the inner cities.  However, the urban renewal schemes have given hope, life and buoyancy to cities.  People have been encouraged to live in commercial areas, and that is referred to in the Bill. It important that people live in inner city areas over shops, thus encouraging them to contribute to the vibrancy of everyday life in cities.</P>
    <P>Few Members mentioned the positive aspects of the budget and I am confident that Senators who will speak after me will do so.  If one concentrates on the negative aspects of the Bill, one will have a short speech; on the other hand, if one concentrates on the positive aspects, one will have a long speech.  I welcome the Bill and I look forward to Committee and Final Stages tomorrow.  Little improvement may be made to this Bill.  We must not be side-tracked; we must continue with tight prudent fiscal management, which has put this economy back on the rails.  That must not be forgotten.  If we allow ourselves to be distracted, we will find ourselves in the situation we were in 1987 when this country was effectively finished.  I congratulate the Minister, his Department, the Government, and the Governments since 1987, on the way they have handled this.  As the youngest <Col N="1033" /> Member of the House, it gives me hope that such a Bill is before the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I would not like to disappoint Senator Kelleher, so I will deal with the positive aspects of the Bill first.  The Minister said that the focus in this year's Finance Bill is firmly on taxation policies which will promote and assist in the creation of sustainable employment. Everyone agrees that this is what the Finance Bill should be about.  Senator Kelleher believes it has gone all the way in this regard, but my party believes that personal income tax is still too high and that significant tax reform is needed in this area.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher said he felt sorry for the people since 1987 and how much they had to put up with, but that now everything was great.  I do not understand how he can say that, because last year was the first year in which the lower and higher rates of tax were not reduced.  It was reduced during the three years in which my party was in Government.</P>

I support the Government's commitment to maintain the main discretionary reliefs, such as mortgage interest relief and health insurance relief.  It is reducing them to the standard rating and I and my party have always supported that.  I also support &mdash; this may not be too popular &mdash; the taxation of unemployment benefit. My party believes all incomes should be taxed equally from what ever source they come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the increase in capital allowances in relation to cars, and the Minister promised that this will be reviewed over the next few years to bring it up to <Col N="1034" /> £16,000.  I accept many of the measures to encourage small industry and I welcome the special section in the Department of Enterprise and Employment to implement the proposals of the Task Force on Small Business.  There are certain positive aspects of the Bill which are welcome.</P>
    <P>Because this Government was only in office for a short period before it introduced its budget, this year's budget and Finance Bill have given us a clear indication of this Government's policy. Because of the fact that the Government has had a year to work out its strategy, we may judge this Bill more harshly than last year.  This Government has the largest majority in the history of he State and, therefore, it has an enormous political capacity to put through whatever economic strategy it wishes.  We have an economic growth rate which is good compared to other EU countries.  Predications suggest that there will be further growth in the future and we must welcome that.</P>
    <P>Given the large majority this Government has and the good indications regarding the performance of the economy, the real test of this Government will be how it will address the fundamental structures of the economy.  The Government must use that to the best of its ability.  If it does not do so, these opportunities will be lost.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Government has set out a strategy to remedy the key structural defects in the economy.  My party supports tax reform.  I do not believe there is tax reform of any substance in the Government's agenda and it is a core defect of this Bill.  Recently I read two publications, which I recommend to Senator Kelleher, on successful tax reform, <i>Lessons from the Analysis of Tax Reform in Six Countries</i> by Cedric Sandford and another entitled <i>Key Issues in Tax Reform</i>.  They would make very interesting reading and he might see in them what we are talking about in regard to tax reform.  A comprehensive blueprint was provided by the Commission on Taxation and we still have not recommended most of the structural reforms suggested by it.  Frederick Sandford in his <Col N="1035" /> publication looked at the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, the United States of America, Canada and Ireland and he said:</P>
    <P>The essential requirement for successful tax reform is a strong political will and such a political will has to come from a champion.</P>
    <P>I am looking to the Minister, Deputy Ahern, to be that champion.</P>
    <P>He also went on &mdash; I did not intend to say this, but as Senator Kelleher referred to the hardship the people suffered from 1987 to date, I will:</P>
    <P>The only effort at tax reform in the Irish Republic was in 1989 when the Progressive Democrats joined in a coalition with Fíanna Fáil and promised a complete overhaul of the tax system.  This coalition was responsible for the biggest reduction in personal income tax, the phasing out of tax relief on life assurance premiums and the attack on fringe benefits, the reduction in corporation tax from 43 to 40 per cent and the phasing out of accelerated depreciation and for most of the reforms on VAT and excise duty.</P>
    <P>I recommend that Senator Kelleher read these books further because there are some other ideas in there on tax reform he might be interested in.</P>
    <P>The criteria on which we must judge this budget must be the capacity of the Government to deal with the fundamental problem, which we all agree is high unemployment.  Why do we have such a high unemployment rate?  Why do we have such a very high dependency rate in this country?  Every ten people who are working here support 22 others. Perhaps that explains to some extent why our taxation has to be so high, but there are other reasons.  The only way to deal with the fundamental problems facing the economy is to change the high dependency rate, to encourage more people to become self-reliant and to increase the opportunities to participate in the development of the country by creating jobs.  We can generate jobs through radical <Col N="1036" /> pro-jobs tax reform, but we have seen little of this.  Senator Kelleher disagrees with me.</P>
    <P>The Minister will ask how are we to fund this tax reform.  My party suggests that the easiest way to fund fundamental tax reform is by the sustained control of public expenditure, but that has not happened.  The proposed expenditure for this year will see public expenditure rising by 17 per cent.  Inflation rose by 1.7 per cent last year and it is expected to rise by 2.5 per cent this year, which is about a quarter of the increase in public expenditure. If we have additional public expenditure we must have additional taxes to fund it.  We have to decide how we are to cope with the fundamental problem facing the economy, that of unemployment, and how to use the positive signs that are out there to best effect. Control of public expenditure would enable us to enjoy the fruits of the economic growth.</P>
    <P>The Minister and many Ministers in this Government say that unemployment is our greatest problem and everything we do must be related to that.  They also say they are supporting the Culliton report and its recommendations. However, Culliton identified tax reform as the major tool with which to tackle the unemployment problem.  I do not see any targets or measures set out in this budget. The Minister has not told us what the basic rate of tax is expected to be by the end of the lifetime of this Government, what the higher rate of tax is expected to be, or how he intends to increase the tax bands.  Culliton said that no more than 20 per cent of taxpayers should be paying tax above the standard rate.  We have to set out how we are going to achieve this and these targets must be publicly stated. Then achievements can be measured as progress is made.  I accept that it is very difficult to achieve this overnight, but we must give ourselves targets and then we can see where we are going.</P>
    <P>We need reforming strategy to assist families, and particularly those on low pay and on social welfare.  I welcome the fact that some targets have been set out with regard to those who are on low pay, <Col N="1037" /> because many people in this country who are on low pay feel they would almost be as well off unemployed.  People start paying tax at such a low level that it could be a disincentive, particularly to families with large numbers of children.  I recognise the fact that family income supplement and other measures were introduced to try to combat this, but it is still a major problem.</P>
    <P>People will ask where specifically public expenditure can be cut.  One of the major problems that has contributed to the increase in public expenditure in this country has been centralised pay bargaining. The ESRI and Kieran Kennedy of the ERSI have suggested pay cuts and have said that the economy could not sustain another central pay bargaining round such as the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.  During the lifetime of that programme, unemployment rose in this country by 40 per cent.  This year alone the public sector pay bill will rise by £250 million.  Last year it rose by something like £347 million.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we should reduce public expenditure and embark on tax reform by implementing a policy of low pay for public servants.  Civil servants should be paid more and we should get much higher productivity from them, but the numbers in our public service are the problem.  No effort is being made to change this.  Instead of giving the extra £250 million this year and the £347 million last year, we could have used that money to introduce tax reform.  This tax reform would have particularly benefited lower paid public servants, who, we are often told, provide the reasons for the public sector needing large pay increases.</P>
    <P>There are many civil servants, particularly women, especially in the lower grades, who are very badly paid.  Tax reform would benefit them greatly.  We have the highest level of tax on work of all the OECD countries and we must address this if we wish to tackle our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Some issues in the Finance Bill need to be examined.  One of them is the withholding tax.  This matter was raised and I raised it at the time Senator Kelleher <Col N="1038" /> talked about the Task Force on Small Business.  It was recommended that withholding tax be abolished.  My party has tabled an amendment proposing this, because the basis on which that tax was introduced is no longer with us.</P>
    <P>There has been self-assessment in this country since 1987, and taxation on the self-employed is now assessed on an actual year basis rather than on the basis of previous year's figures.  People who are subject to withholding tax do not benefit from the actual year basis on which income tax for the self-employed is assessed.  This amendment was also put down in the other House.  I do have an interest in this amendment, but I did not suggest it.  My husband is a GP, he has a big GMS practice and he pays quite a bit of withholding tax.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, when he was talking here on the Task Force on Small Business that the Government, by eliminating the withholding tax over a period of years, could use that as an incentive to people paying withholding tax to create employment. For example, very few GPs in this country employ secretaries and nurses.  In the United Kingdom the situation is different. Withholding tax could be used as a bargaining tool to get business people to employ more.  The task force said that the withholding tax had a particularly negative effect on professional practices with employees pursuing activities such as engineering consultancies, architecture and the rest.  Withholding tax could be used to encourage them to employ more people.  I accept that there would be a cashflow problem were the Minister to do this and go back to an actual basis, but perhaps he could introduce it over a number of years, particularly as we are hoping for buoyancy in the economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of urban renewal relief, but it has to be more transparent, particularly when decisions are being made on the areas that are to qualify for urban renewal.  Some of the urban renewal schemes have displaced businesses in traditional areas.  My own area in Portlaoise is one example.  It is appalling <Col N="1039" /> that urban renewal status was given to a green field site on which a shopping centre was built.  The main centre of the town was as a result transformed into an area that will need urban renewal in the future.  This should not be allowed to happen.  We are learning as we go along with this scheme, but that was a scandal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts, as mentioned in this Bill by the Minister, to encourage small firms and service industries.  I have a problem with just one other area there. Provisions were introduced in last year's Finance Bill regarding trading operations that qualified for tax relief on seed capital. The two agencies that were given authority to authorise this were the Industrial Development Authority and Bord Fáilte.  At the time the county enterprise boards were not set up.  The county enterprise boards do not qualify for this, so somebody who obtains funding under the county enterprise boards cannot get a refund of income tax under this section. I have raised this with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who is very concerned about it.  I have talked to officials in the Department of Finance and they have been very helpful and understanding, but they did not change it.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Government will give funding to county enterprise boards to support small industries which believe they will qualify for this tax refund scheme and not allow them qualify.  I have tabled an amendment on this matter.  I have discussed this with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and with the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, but not with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern.  The growth in jobs will come from small firms.</P>
    <P>With all the positive points I made to Senator Kelleher I am now out of time. The Progressive Democrats would like to see tax reform.  We are looking to the Minister to champion this cause and we would like to see the buoyancy created by the improved economic circumstances used to reform the tax system and to make it more employment friendly.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill, 1994, is exceptionally complex legislation and most of the 147 sections are technical in nature.  There is nothing one could say that is positive about it and two of the most significant developments are in the taxation area.  The recent Social Welfare Bill introduced the imposition of unemployment benefit, and the introduction of the poll tax will, it seems, be reserved for another year.  The decision to tax unemployment benefit and pay related benefit will hit people on relatively low incomes, will reduce their living standards and add to their difficulties in making ends meet.  It is another example of making people at the lower end of the scale pay more while further concessions are provided for the well off.  The annual yield from this tax on benefits is estimated at £30 million.</P>
      <P>I met a person recently who, in 1993, had a disability claim from October until December.  They received £600 in disability benefit for a genuine certified illness. When that person's new tax allowance was issued it was reduced by £600.  I have been in public life since 1967 and this is the most atrocious element of legislation ever introduced which taxes a person on disability benefit.  In 1993-94 that person had a tax allowance in excess of £3,000, or £61 or £62 per week; it is now reduced to £43 per week.  That person had to drive 20 miles to a job in Cork from the Mallow area.  There is no justice in that.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners will take account of unemployment benefit and pay related benefit when dealing with claims that refer to the refund of tax after a person becomes unemployed.  That is outrageous.  In the Cork area the people are up in arms about it.  I met a lady today who had come up from Cork.  She told me that her husband gets £67 pounds a week; the total household income is £155 per week, and there are six in the family. How in the name of all that is holy can a family of six be expected to live on that amount?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>One is on an invalidity pension and the other is on long term unemployment assistance.  They have a fixed income.</P>
      <P>This Bill continues the pattern of recent years of additional reliefs and concessions for business with merely cosmetic changes for the PAYE sector. Despite the impression given at the time, it is now clear that the supposed benefits for the PAYE sector are largely a mirage, and that many low and middle income families will be worse off as a result. There are two reasons for this.  First, the few concessions provided for the PAYE sector were little more than a token, especially considering the level of tax most people are paying.  In addition, the combination of reduced interest rates over the last year and the budget decision to start reducing the level of interest relief available meant that virtually all mortgage holders, other than recent buyers, had their allowances cut and thus lost heavily.</P>
      <P>Tax should be deductible when assessing a person's income for full eligibility for the health services.  That would be fair and proper.  The assessment should be based on a person's disposable income.  While some progress was made in regard to the self-employed, they are still paying an average of more than £200 less than those on PAYE.  I cannot understand why PAYE workers whose earnings are an open book, where tax is not deductible for eligibility for higher education grant purposes, for example, are not marching in the streets because of the pressure on them and the hardship it is causing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is evidence of substantial tax evasion.  A tax official told a recent conference that audits of the tax returns of the self-employed showed average underpayments of £22,000.  A tax amnesty was given to the wealthy people while PAYE people at the lower end of the scale cannot afford to make ends meet.  According to the tax official, tax fraud is taking place on an enormous scale in the self-employed sector.  It is not even necessary to resort to tax evasion if one can afford the tax experts and <Col N="1042" /> consultants who can help people to avoid taxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an exemption from corporation tax of employment grants for farm relief services.  I am aware of a good number of people who are now employed in farm relief services under the system of C45 certificates.  Their income is low and about a third of it is deducted under the C45 system &mdash; the same system as used by Coillte for most forestry workers.  The workers have to wait to claim back that tax.  I cannot understand what this exemption from corporation tax of employment grants for farm relief services is about.  Are we referring to those who are involved in a pool to provide farm relief services operated by this well organised body &mdash; I will not use the word &ldquo;cartel&rdquo;?  Before the workers get their wages they find that there is a third taken under the C45 system.  I will not dwell any longer on that point.</P>
    <P>There is a myriad of new reliefs in this Finance Bill for the business and commercial sectors from whom it has received a virtually unprecedented welcome. Most of these reliefs are justified on the grounds that they are designed to encourage enterprise and investment and thus promote job creation.  We see little of this job creation in the Bill and we will say it is worthwhile when this becomes evident.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge there have been substantial changes in the business expansion scheme to close off some of these abuses. There is a constant battle of wits between the Revenue Commissioners and the business sector as the State tries to ensure the reliefs are used for the purposes for which they are intended while tax consultants look to find and exploit more loopholes.  I dwelt a lot on that aspect because we see these glaring anomalies and injustices.  The wealthy seem to be getting away with these abuses.  I welcome the inclusion of Mallow in the urban renewal scheme.  It has been trying to get into this scheme for many years and this will benefit it greatly.</P>
    <P>Rothschild said give me control of a country's finances and I do not care who <Col N="1043" /> makes the laws.  That is what the Finance Bill is about.  There is not enough being provided in the housing, health and social welfare sectors.  Consequently, I now see something I thought I would never see in this country, and that is poor people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When one reads the Finance Bill one would expect, especially this year given the repeated Government statements, that since unemployment is our single biggest problem job creation would be the most important issue.  One would have expected to find in this Bill an outline of the Government's proposals to tackle the problem.  The Finance Bill is the most important legislation that passes through both Houses each year.  It states how our public money will be spent over the next 12 months and one would hope to find in it specific incentives and attractions to generate employment and to retain jobs.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock referred to attacks on unemployment and disability benefits. Because of the changes being introduced by this Government especially on unemployment benefit, the average industrial worker on part-time employment will have an income of less than £800 per year.  There are many low paid employees who, if they find their income reduced further, would be better off remaining on full time unemployment benefit and assistance rather than engaging in part time work and drawing unemployment benefit for part of the year.  This Bill is seriously deficient in addressing that issue.  In the future, more people may choose to be unemployed rather than work part-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a factory in my area which is seasonal by nature because it manufactures ice cream.  These workers have to go on unemployment benefit for a certain number of months each year.  The current Government proposals will ensure their income is reduced by over £800 a year.  Many of them are seriously concerned and are questioning, given the benefits they would have on permanent unemployment benefit, whether they should remain permanently on the unemployment <Col N="1044" /> list.  This is regressive, rather than progressive, legislation.</P>
    <P>One repeatedly hears the Government say there is great potential for job creation and employment growth in the tourism sector.  There is nothing in this legislation which suggests that industry is being provided with any incentives to generate employment.  The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Tourism and Trade ought to have worked out a joint strategy to decide, direct and show how genuine jobs in that sector will be created and generated.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, there is potential to create tourism related jobs in a certain area, what is the Government doing about it?  Most of this potential lies in our rural areas, and in the west in particular. However, what we find is that the necessary infrastructure is not being put in place.  What needs to be supplied &mdash; not necessarily in this order of priority &mdash; is an adequate water supply, proper sewage facilities and a good road network into these areas.  If the relevant Ministers, with the Minister for Finance, are not working together in a common strategy towards generating employment in this sector, are they really serious about creating employment?</P>
    <P>Many of our most attractive resorts are small places which do not provide the type of facilities tourists require.  Why not?  Because they are not getting the necessary injection of finance and grant aid.  I speak especially about small hotels in rural Ireland.  If a hotel has fewer than 40 bedrooms it will not qualify for the type of grant assistance that the major Dublin hotels get.  If these small hoteliers cannot develop their hotels and provide an enhanced, improved and attractive facility for residents in these areas, people will not go there.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government has set up many committees, investigative groups and task forces to examine this issue but when these groups have finished their work, we do not even hear their findings.  In Shannon, a task force was established <Col N="1045" /> under the chairmanship of Gillian Bowler.  It reported to the Minister but its conclusions have yet to see the light of day.  Nobody but the Minister seems to have seen them.  That is not to the advantage of the taxpayer who paid for this report.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade has set up an investigative group to study the tourism sector, Dublin based consultants, Tourism and Leisure Partners. It has been paid £60,000.  What is that money for?  What we are seeing from this Government is jobs for the boys.  These reports, research studies or task forces are having little real effect and there is no feedback on the ground.  This cannot be accepted by the public.</P>
    <P>This Bill is interesting in so far as it is an admission by the Government of its lack of success, especially on the question of the 1 per cent income levy.  It was forced to withdraw that levy, which was introduced in last year's Finance Bill.  It admitted that it was not a good idea.  It has also admitted the mistake it made last year on probate tax by rejigging it.</P>
    <P>The announcements in the Budget Statement by the Minister concerning the residential property tax was interesting but what was even more interesting were the repeated announcements by the Minster and the Taoiseach.  What will next year's Finance Bill have to offer given the various pronouncements, especially by the Taoiseach, since this Bill was published?</P>
    <P>The Government is confused and is unconcerned for those who are prudent and are trying to provide their own homes and decent living accomodation for themselves.  Many are on large mortgages and will be subject to a penal and unacceptable tax.  The Bill leaves much to be desired on this issue.</P>
    <P>There are many issues which could be addressed in the Bill.  Of major concern is the communication which takes place between the relevant Government Departments.  The Minister for Finance decides the funding for the respective Departments.  What kind of discussions, negotiations and contact takes place between Ministers, especially the key <Col N="1046" /> Ministers involved in job creation?  It is evident from the Bill that there is a lack of coherent policy between the various Departments, or within the Government, regarding any type of strategy for job creation.  For example, on taxation, there is merely a rearrangement of the situation, fiddling with the figures, attempting to close loopholes but doing nothing substantive, with no major theme or strategy for tax reform.</P>
    <P>In view of the repeated public discussion over the past year, the Minister should have taken the opportunity in the Bill to provide specific incentives to people starting their own businesses.  I had hoped that the Bill would provide proposals regarding such people not having to come into the tax system, especially in regard to PRSI and VAT, for the first 24 months of their business. It is a well known fact from research that has been undertaken that businesses succeed or fail within the first two years, and if they survive the first two years they are likely to continue to succeed.  There should be incentives and breaks provided therefore to those in start up businesses, but unfortunately there are none.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the spectrum, there has been no substantial increase in the budget regarding social welfare payments and the misery and misfortune which people continue to live in will continue while the Government remains in office, especially for those misfortunate people who are unemployed and in long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>I had also hoped that, given the input of the Labour Party and socialist philosophy in Government, there would have been provisions aimed at specifically improving the poorer sectors of our community. However, there are no such provisions and the issue of poverty, which applies specifically to those on unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and the low paid worker, has not been addressed.  The low paid worker with a mortgage belongs to a category of poverty which is not usually recognised and the Bill does nothing to address this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> The Bill is nothing more than a book keeping exercise, an arrangement of the figures for the year in the hope that they will balance out.  Unfortunately, it does not address the 300,000 unemployed, including the 100,000 long term unemployed, and the thousands at the lower end of the income category who are employed but are on low pay and are finding it difficult to succeed.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, I do not expect the Minister to introduce any substantial amendments on Committee Stage and the provisions of the Bill are most unfortunate for the people of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a book keeping exercise which does not address the problems facing the people.  It does not address the main issues and the opportunity to do so is lost.  The Bill fails to deal with the unemployment problem, it does not create an incentive for business, it does not attempt to reform the system which creates disincentive for enterprise and for those wishing to take up employment. There is a need to provide incentives for people to create their own jobs, to create jobs for others and to boost the economy.</P>
      <P>The taxing of pay related benefit and unemployment benefit is insidious. Those who are rendered unemployed are highly vulnerable while adjusting to their new situation.  It is a traumatic experience to be made redundant and to face a period of unemployment and uncertainty, especially as many of those made redundant have commitments, such as mortgages and so on.  Most of those made redundant do not expect it.  Their lives are thrown into disarray and they face pressures, both financial and psychological, which require every assistance and compassion from the State. However, in this instance the Government and the State have decided to reduce their benefit by taxing their unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same measure applies to somebody on disability and who is concerned about their health and future income. While disability is in many instances a <Col N="1048" /> short term situation, this is not the case for many people.</P>
    <P>I empathise with those who have been made redundant and endure a period of unemployment drawing unemployment benefit.  When I entered the Seanad in 1989 I was unemployed.  I was on unemployment benefit and went through the trauma experienced by many.  I therefore feel strongly about the Government's decision to tax unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Regarding the taxation of social welfare benefits for those on short term employment, the Government is creating a further poverty trap.  In my own town of Rathkeale, the meat factory, AIBP, is constantly on short time and the employees have a hard choice to make as to whether they should stay in employment and suffer a loss, as happens when expenses are considered, or make a gain by going on unemployment assistance. These employees have spoken to me and to other public representatives, including those from the Minister's party, of their concern regarding the choice they face to leave work and improve their standard of leaving, or to stay in work.</P>
    <P>Many of these people have worked for 20 years in reasonably good employment and they now find themselves trapped in a terrible situation where they may be forced to decide on leaving work.  I would like to provide the Minister, if she is interested, with examples regarding two such people whom I have selected at random from a group who have discussed the situation with me.  The first example refers to a person on £48 per week unemployment benefit.  He receives a payment of £58.21 per week from the company and this provides a total of £106.21.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Minister, examples are being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>On unemployment assistance the person would receive £91.10 per week, therefore incurring the expense of travelling to work to obtain £15 per week. He is asking me why he should continue work?  The reason he is continuing at present is because he wants to work.  He <Col N="1049" /> enjoys his work and the camaraderie of work, but he is losing money.</P>
      <P>The second example is in respect of a person on £92 per week unemployment assistance and in receipt of £62.42 net from the company.  This provides a total of £154.42 per week.  If this person was on unemployment assistance full time, he would receive £155.10.  He asked me why he should continue working.  He wants politicians to create incentives to make it worth his while to continue working, which he wants to do.  He wants to be productive.  I worked with him at one stage, I recruited him in 1974.  He is now working two or three day weeks.  He wants to continue this but asked me to explain to the Government and politicians that there is no incentive for him to do so.  He would be better off staying at home as he would not have the expense involved in going to work and says he is being unfair to his family by incurring this extra expense.  A group of about 20 people are appealing for the creation of an incentive to enable them to continue working.  It is inevitable that they will have to make a hard choice and take redundancy, which the company would be willing to give them to correct their situation &mdash; it is emotive to talk about getting rid of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1989 I have raised matters on motions for the Adjournment of the House relating to the introduction of an urban renewal scheme for Rathkeale in County Limerick.  I make no apologies for raising this.  Rathkeale has a unique problem in relation to its town centre, which has been bought up for storage purposes.  Shops and houses have become stores for antique furniture.  They have been bought by wealthy members of the travelling community.  They have denuded the centre of the town and many businesses have closed.  For some time we have proposed that the centre of the town should become an urban renewal area and be made attractive for people to establish businesses and shops there, so that it can be opened up like many cities have been.  Excellent work has been done in Patrick Street and other areas of Limerick city.  I have been told that <Col N="1050" /> Rathkeale town centre may be too small, but I was delighted to hear Senator Sherlock refer to Mallow.  The differences between these towns are marginal in the context of urban renewal.  I ask the Minister, as I have asked other Ministers since 1989, to look at the unique problems of Rathkeale and the necessity to open up its town centre and create an incentive for people using former shops and houses as stores for furniture to move elsewhere and release these premises for commercial purposes so that there will again be growth there.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the old hairy chestnut of county roads.  The Minister for the Environment announced recently that over £1 million in EU Structural Funds will be spent on roads in County Limerick. There is a dilemma regarding this in the county.  The county manager insists that these funds must be used for certain projects and cannot be used for other purposes.  These projects include constructing new roads to facilitate industries, one of which will be to Foynes Harbour.  These are worthy projects.  A candidate for the elections to the European Parliament, who is a member of one of the Government parties and a former Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; I will not mention his name &mdash; says this money must be used to fill potholes.  He criticised the county engineer and his staff because the money is not being used for this purpose. Could the Minister clarify whether the candidate to which I referred will allow us repair roads in urgent need of repair, or will the money be used only on the projects for which it has been dedicated because of constraints on the allocation of funds to the county?  I assure the Minister this is a live issue in County Limerick as it is in other counties.  The Minister for the Environment will be in Limerick next Friday and if the debate on this Bill is completed by then, I will raise the issue with him.</P>
    <P>We are disappointed that value added tax imposed on the clothing and footwear industries is not dealt with in the Bill. VAT receipts amount to £2.5 billion and is the second highest contributor to the tax pool.  Despite many representations <Col N="1051" /> by representatives of the clothing and footwear industries, discussions, arguments and meetings around the country with them and the damage done to the level of employment in these industries, the Minister failed to look at the crippling high VAT rate of 21 per cent.  We will make our points on this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The residential property tax hits those who pay most tax, that is, middle income PAYE workers who inherited their houses or obtained high mortgages to purchase them.  Many of these houses have increased in value.  This problem is not confined to Dublin but applies to every county.  There are such people in Adare, Patrickswell, the environs of Limerick city, Newcastlewest, Tralee and Killarney.  These people have been major contributors on a <i>per capita</i> basis to tax revenues.  They now see themselves as soft touches who are hit again.  The days of treating this section of the community as a soft touch are at an end.  They will not tolerate the crucifying level of tax they have to pay.  The statements by the Taoiseach on the extension of this tax and their subsequent rejection by the Minister for the Environment create not only confusion but fear that people with property, such as inherited family homes, will be further hit and that disincentives will be put in the way of people who want to have decent houses in decent areas. In my village of Adare two-bedroomed houses are valued at over £60,000.  They were bought by people who worked in the local estate for £1 about 30 years ago. They are now in danger of having to pay the property tax.</P>
    <P>My time is now up.  I would not like to overstay my time, unlike other speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few general points about the Bill; we will have an opportunity to discuss the detail tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I wish to talk about job creation.  The situation in the west has been highlighted by the Catholic bishops and I will not go into detail on that matter.  Basically, the Catholic bishops <Col N="1052" /> have been highlighting the problem of the depopulation of the west.  I am from County Offaly and we, in Offaly County Council, are preparing our plan for the next five years, looking at trends over the last number of years and examining projections for the future.  Regrettably, depopulation in County Offaly is similar to that in the west.</P>
    <P>There will be an opportunity to examine all the other county plans when they are published.  I am sure they will all be forwarded to the Minister who should examine the trends in the past and the projections for the future to see which counties are suffering population decline. We are suffering a haemorrhage of population loss in County Offaly and this concerns me.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently commented on the figures published by the Bank of Ireland.  The Governor of the Bank of Ireland issued his comments and the Taoiseach spoke about profits, bank charges and interest rates.  Much of what the Taoiseach said is correct.  There is a problem, and interest rates are too high. I suppose the Taoiseach will be claiming credit for the fall in interest rates in the last few days but, irrespective of how it happened, they have been reduced marginally.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see a major confrontation between the banks and the Government because whatever its faults, we at least have a solid banking system with a good foundation which is working well.  In some European countries there can be difficulties with cashing sizeable cheques, obtaining bank drafts and so on. Here, at least money is paid on demand if there is money in the account.  It is essential that we have a good working banking system.  I hope that matter will be examined and solutions sought to obvious problems.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to speak about the problems of financing small firms.  A problem which nobody has mentioned recently is that of small firms which are having difficulties in making payments of PAYE, PRSI, VAT and so on.  I work on the assumption that most people and <Col N="1053" /> firms are honest &mdash; a certain number are not and it is up to the Government to ensure that they are tackled and made pay whatever penalties are due. However, at present, any firm which fails to pay is faced with a penalty of 1.25 per cent per month, that is 15 per cent per annum.  If it is even part of a month late it must pay the arrears for the full month.</P>
    <P>The banks, on occasion, withdraw credit, sue people, bring them to court, etc., and sometimes firms go into liquidation because of how they were treated by the banks.  However, the policies of the Government and the Revenue Commissioners also contribute to the closure of firms.  I do not say that in an antagonistic way or to score points because the penalty of 1.25 per cent has been there for quite some time.</P>
    <P>I was recently talking to a successful businessman who had a very sizeable firm but whose world had crashed around his ears.  He had a number of orders prepared but the firm which he was supplying was not able to take the order and suddenly his business collapsed.  He was left with substantial debts and he owed the banks quite an amount of money.  He went into liquidation.  He was shattered. He told me that at no stage did anybody from a Government agency, Department or semi-State body ever ask him what his problems were and how he would tackle the situation if he was starting again.</P>
    <P>It is easy to ask people what they are doing if they are very successful but we should talk to somebody who has been through the mill and knows what that is like.  We have not taken enough interest in the reasons so many firms are closing. There is a great deal of publicity and hype when a new firm arrives in Ireland but we must ask ourselves why so many of our native firms are closing.  Cork is an example of an area where many established firms have closed.  We have also lost companies in Offaly and elsewhere. If we can get the answer why so many firms are closing we may be able to help ourselves in the future.</P>
    <P>The 1.25 per cent penalty can often make the difference between a business staying open and closing.  We must question <Col N="1054" /> the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to close firms, send in the sheriff and seize goods.  Many of these people should be helped to earlier rather than having a computer spouting out statements and penalties on a regular basis.  At the weekend, the businessman and his wife are at home wondering how they will keep their business open.  The computer is resting but there is turmoil in that house where the business and home are threatened.</P>
    <P>An example of these problems is the clothing and footwear industries, to which Senator Neville referred.  It was lunacy to increase VAT in that area.  The VAT increased from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent to 21 per cent.  This is a sensitive industry.  We have been proud of our clothing and footwear industries and we like to read in the social columns about how people are dressed.  However, many of the people who have devoted their lives to those industries have been put out of business because we are importing clothing.  I compliment anybody who goes to the trouble of trying to find Irish made goods.  However, the 21 per cent VAT is crippling.  Some of our top fashion designers in Dublin have gone out of business because they could not beat the system.  That is a tragedy.  Job creation is important, but it is essential that job maintenance be examined.</P>
    <P>The probate tax is being modified to some extent, but it is not being modified sufficiently.  I still have great reservations about it.  There were changes made with regard to widows.  I met a widow for whom we had to organise a loan to pay probate tax.  We got it back, but the difficulty that widow had in getting the money together was quite considerable. There should be an exemption where families are involved.  I ask the Minister to have a further look at the area.</P>
    <P>The residential property tax is a tremendous mistake.  It will not just affect Dublin, Cork and Limerick but it will also impact on towns like Tullamore, Birr, Nenagh, Portlaoise and others across the country.  In a short time large numbers of people will find themselves caught in the residential property tax net.  That is neither <Col N="1055" /> right nor proper.  We should ensure that the family home is exempt.</P>
    <P>With regard to comments made by the Taoiseach and added to by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance, I hope we never return to rates in this country again.  Rates were an unfair system and I dread the day that they would return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The urban renewal scheme has been a great success in the town of Longford and I am happy that it is being continued in the next round.  It is an example to the Minister and the Government that if there is an incentive for people, there will be a reaction.  It is a pity that this incentive is not present in other areas which generate employment &mdash; for example, the clothing industry. The cruel VAT on clothing has decimated employment and jobs across the board in the industry.  The Irish clothing and fashion industry had stepped on to the world stage.  However, instead of encouraging this growth industry which is a significant area of employment, the Minister and the Government have put the clampers on it by not facing the reality that if one does not have a sufficient profit margin, one cannot compete.</P>
      <P>The urban renewal scheme offers an incentive which attracts investment and generates employment.  There are a number of areas in the economy in which employment could be created if incentives were given.  It is the only way in which employment will be created.  There is no point in having the will to do something or talking about doing something if priority is not given to the area and radical approaches made.</P>
      <P>Training and temporary work schemes have done much good by bringing people back into the system and giving them employment and self-esteem.  However, everybody knows that it is only on a temporary basis.  I am disappointed that the incentive approach has not been extended to other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in VAT on the telephones is a direct Government taxation on telephone <Col N="1056" /> calls.  Everybody knows how important it is to the business community, because much business is done over the phone.  The Minister sees this as an opportunity to collect more revenue. Instead of a reducing or maintaining the present level of VAT, it will now be increased.</P>
    <P>These are areas where, with a little imagination and foresight, the Government could have intervened to help the hard pressed business community in their fight to retain their businesses and maintain their current level of employment. Small businesses have to compete against larger companies, shopping centres and other factors militating against the success of their businesses.  It is an area of which the Government and the Minister for Finance should be more conscious.</P>
    <P>When bigger companies go under, there is a large debt outstanding to the Revenue Commissioners.  One often wonders how this comes about.  It may be that these businesses present their case to the Revenue Commissioners and mention that there are many jobs on the line. The small business community does not seem to have the same clout.  The tax collectors are on their doorstep very quickly.  People would like to see a fair distribution of tax collection across the board.</P>
    <P>The system seems to be against the small business person who is struggling to keep a business going with high overheads and a small turnover.  There should be special conditions to enable those people to survive.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this wide ranging debate.  It covered not only the items of the Bill but also the state of theatre and the arts in this country, the job situation, urban renewal and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill gives effect to decisions in the budget which have at their core the need to deal with the problem of job creation.  A specific effort was made in the budget to target relief on the low paid.  This includes reducing the 2.25 per cent levy charged to people earning <Col N="1057" /> £9,000, who would not benefit from tax relief because they are under the tax thresholds; increasing tax exemption limits, particularly for those with children; an average increase of £6 a week in the family income supplement, again targeted at the low paid; and reducing employer PRSI for people under £9,000. That limit is as much as can be afforded at this stage.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the tax package is pro jobs tax reform, with a particular focus on the low paid and those who are likely to be caught in unemployment traps.  I took great note of the case mentioned by Senator Neville in relation to a person working part-time and on unemployment assistance.  Those type of cases are the sort of anomalies we want to try to eliminate and we hope we can tackle them in the future.</P>
    <P>At present we have the best economic forecast in 30 years.  There was an increase of 16,000 net non-agriculture jobs last year.  The job forecasts for the current and the next number of years are very good.  We still have a huge unemployment problem but we have made a good start in our first 16 months in office. I assure the House that tackling the jobs crisis is central to the policies we will endeavour to pursue in terms of budgetary policy and the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to take up a number of specific points that were raised in the debate. Senator Henry included the arts in her wide ranging speech.  We are making great progress in that area and I welcome the establishment of the separate Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. She raised the issue of urban renewal and theatres.  The purpose of the scheme is to engage in urban renewal in particular areas that are encountering problems.  It is not to focus on a particular type of activity, such as theatres.  The type of project she had in mind in Dún Laoghaire may qualify under the BES.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan talked about jobs and tax reform.  In my experience, the Progressive Democrats are not interested in restructuring the tax system.  They would prefer us to abandon quality public services. When they participated in Government <Col N="1058" /> there was a rundown of the public housing programme and a large increase in homelessness and a rundown of the health services.  That is not the way to achieve tax reform.  There should be quality public services.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the growth in public expenditure.  I am happy to see money put into tackling housing waiting lists and an extra £27 million put into tackling the problems of those with a mental handicap.  Some of the increase in public expenditure to which she adverted refers to the carryover effects of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which was negotiated when her party was in power.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock referred to the taxation of disability and unemployment benefits.  The Commission on Social Welfare, of which I was a member, and the Combat Poverty Agency believe the right way to go is that all income should be treated as income.  The real problem is that our tax exemption limits are low and that is the area in which future reform should be concentrated, rather than treating particular forms of income in a different way.  If we are serious about integrating the tax and welfare code and attacking the type of rip offs that have existed in some aspects of the social welfare system, such as where people have gone sick at the right time of the tax year to claim tax subsidies, the way forward is not the separate treatment of different forms of income.  Instead, we should examine whether we can increase exemption limits and tax allowances.  We have a good start in this budget in that regard.</P>
    <P>The tax package contained in the Finance Bill is worth £330 million in income tax reliefs in a full year.  It is a substantial programme of tax reform.  We also took the opportunity to restructure the tax system and to move taxation away from income.  We had a taxation system which was over favourable to property but not favourable enough to work.  If we are serious about generating jobs, we need to move towards a system which favours employment.  A good start has been made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> I was pleased to have a provision included in the Finance Bill, 1993, in relation to tax relief on heritage gardens where there was no heritage house attached.  This year there is a revision of the taxation provision with regard to heritage houses and gardens which provides for greater public access, longer opening hours and informing local tourist authorities about the availability of such facilities.  Such houses are the people's heritage and if somebody is receiving public money by way of tax relief, there is a public obligation.</P>
    <P>In that context, section 23, as it stands, provides for tax relief in relation to rented residential properties.  I want a situation, which I hope can be covered in a future Finance Bill, where anybody who is receiving tax relief in relation to rented residential property will have to show that they are in order with regard to the regulations made under the Housing Act, 1992, by issuing rent books to their tenants and by obeying the conditions of minimum standards that exist.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville made a point in relation to the need for urban renewal in Rathkeale and the problems in his town. I will bring those concerns to the attention of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, who has special responsibility for housing and urban renewal.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright said that small firms are instantly hit with a penalty if their taxes are slightly late.  We should examine this in terms of the administration of the tax code.  Obviously we do not want people to build up large arrears of unpaid tax, but perhaps there is room for a little flexibility where genuine businesses may be a couple of days late with a particular payment.  The Senator made a fair point in his examination of why some established firms are going out of business.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the need for a jobs strategy.  As I said, the whole thrust of the Finance Bill is pro jobs tax reform. The opportunity is being taken not only to give gross tax relief but to give higher tax reliefs on income and to use the chance to restructure the tax system. That is substantive tax reform by any <Col N="1060" /> standards.  We are making a move in the Bill in relation to recommendations of the Small Business Task Force.  All sides of the House are anxious that small business can make the maximum contribution to job creation.</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that the residential property tax as extended is both a modest measure of equity in the tax system and a contribution towards tilting the balance in the tax code more in favour of productive investment, which helps to create and safeguard employment. People who are not reasonably well off and comfortably housed are not asked to pay this tax.  One does not start to pay it unless one has an income of £25,000.  A married couple with an income of £25,000 are getting £690 back in terms of the income tax and levy aspects of the budget.  One does not pay the full tax unless one has an income of £35,000.  On that income, there is £890 by way of a reduction.  People must look at the budget as a total package.  The Opposition very often look at one aspect and neglect the counterbalancing pluses. It would have been irresponsible of the Government to have simply engaged in an exercise of tax reduction this year without taking the opportunity to restructure the tax system in a way that would generate more jobs when we are in a position to deliver net tax reductions to every taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The changes made in the residential property tax and mortgage interest relief areas were about restructuring the tax system in a way that has been recommended by every ESRI report, the OECD, the Commission on Taxation, NESC and the Culliton report, etc.</P>
      <P>This country has a high saving ratio, but that is not being translated into the rate of job creation that we might otherwise achieve.  It is important to take the opportunity, when we are in a position to make people net better off, to restructure the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the differential between the corporation tax <Col N="1061" /> rate for manufacturing and service industries. It is important to look at the different characteristics and needs of those industries.  There is a particular regime relating to firms which export.  In this context, if we are putting a higher burden on other taxpayers by reducing it for others, it is important to look at the concept of what we are net creating.  Are we displacing jobs in one area of the economy, or are we generating a net gain?  By concentrating on issues such as internationally traded goods and services we can subsidise net job creation and not simply displacement in that context.</P>
    <P>We will be endeavouring to work within the existing policy framework to enable growth in manufacturing and in service employment.  There have been a number of changes in VAT in the Finance Bill which are pro-business and proenterprise initiatives and which have not been fully covered in the debate.  The increase in the VAT registration thresholds will be of particular benefit to small business.  The extension of the cash receipts basis of accounting will provide an important stimulus to a variety of Irish businesses, many of which have significant potential for job creation.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry recognised what we have been able to do for fairgrounds.  I am particularly pleased about that.  We all need a bit of bread and circus in this country.</P>
    <P>The problems of the clothing industry were referred to.  The Government had a working party which looked in great detail at what could be done to help employment in that area.  While it was not possible to ringfence clothing manufacturing, the budget reduced the employers' PRSI in the low paid area. That will be of particular benefit to the clothing industry.  Since some 80 per cent of clothes bought in this country are imported, the Exchequer is losing out. Through the employment side we have helped the manufacturing basis of our clothing industry.  I try to wear Irish clothes at all times because we should encourage our own manufacturing companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the difficulties faced by family businesses competing with concerns that are not family <Col N="1062" /> owned.  Considerable recognition has been given in this Bill to the needs of family businesses and their transfer from generation to generation.  I hope the people who inherit these businesses will also inherit the necessary skills, otherwise we may not be doing the right thing. However, we have made that concession in the Bill by introducing business relief in respect of capital acquisitions tax which should be of substantial benefit to family owned businesses.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for new reliefs in respect of capital gains for equity investment. One of our major concerns is that the economic signals up to now dictate that it makes more sense to invest in property than in equity or expanding a business.  We have one of the highest savings rations in Europe but we want to see our savings put into something in this country that will create long term employment.  For example, if I extend my home I may give short-term employment. However, if I put the same investment into extending my business, when the building workers have moved off site, continuing employment will be provided. We want to see a climate where our tax system encourages investment in general job creation.</P>
    <P>This year's budget and Finance Bill sought to address the most important issues in mainstream income tax.  By any standards the relief given was substantial, amounting to £330 million in a full year. The budget also includes a major restructuring in the PRSI system which would significantly improve the competitive position of firms with large numbers of low paid employees.  There have been major areas of achievement in the area of corporate taxation with the tax base being greatly widened enabling the standard rate to be cut by ten percentage points.  This reform has greatly shifted the balance of incentives in favour of job creation.  In indirect taxation, the standard rate of VAT has been reduced over the last number of years from 25 per cent to 21 per cent.  There has also been a considerable simplification and consolidation of the rating structure with the 12.5 per cent rate now applied to a wide range of employment intensive sectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> This is the second full Finance Bill and second budget introduced by this Government in 16 months in office.  We have made a good start.  There obviously is a lot more to achieve and we have certainly not got an ideal system at this stage.  Many of the points made by Senators on all sides of the House will be carefully considered in the Department of Finance.  The very good economic outlook gives us a chance to look ahead and seize the opportunity to do something about jobs, particularly for the long term unemployed and those people who, without active intervention, are likely to remain outside the economic system.  I hope that in future budgets we will be able to improve on what we did this year, to continue to ease the tax burden on the low paid, to tilt the tax system in a way that is pro-jobs and to ensure compliance with the tax system.  While the tax system is often used to achieve particular objectives in areas like urban renewal, it should also be used to ensure that landlords issue rent books.  We want to extend those principles in the area of tax clearance to other areas.</P>
    <P>The Opposition made the point that this is a bookkeeping exercise, moving <Col N="1064" /> money around.  There are no magic answers.  If we are to deliver tax relief and reduce taxation, that money has to be found somewhere.  We are running the economy in a competent way and economic growth is providing some of the resources from which we will be able to deliver future pro-jobs tax reform.  But inevitably in any system of tax reform we are dealing with things which are balanced, one against the other.  We must have the maturity to look on changes in the tax system as a package.  It is not a question of being thankful if there is a reduction on one side while people scream blue murder about increases on the far side.  We need to have the maturity as a society to look at the net picture and the net changes otherwise we will get into a state of paralysis where change will become impossible.  If we do not achieve change we will not be able to tackle the area of unemployment seriously.  I hope we will have constructive discussions about how our tax system can be restructured and improved as well as how we can use our fiscal mechanisms and tax structure to generate the maximum number of jobs the economy is capable of supporting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cathaoirleach, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade should grant aid a feasibility study for the establishment of a major multi-purpose world centre as an extension to the Centre for International Co-operation at Shannon.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, who will respond to this matter and perhaps she will be able to get European funding for this proposal.</P>
      <P>The Centre for International Co-operation is a non-governmental and non-profit making organisation, supported since its establishment by Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, SFADCo and the Irish Peace Institute, as well as corporate and private donors.  The patron of the centre is Dr. Patrick Hillery, former President of Ireland; the president is Dr. Brendan O'Regan, who is also president of the Irish Peace Institute and Co-operation North; and the chairman is Mr. Tom O'Donnell, former Government Minister and MEP.  The mission of the centre is to promote contacts between Ireland and eastern Europe and develop these into managed programmes of co-operation in education, training, economic development, business, culture and youth activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the centre has established personal contacts through face to face meetings with high ranking decision makers in 415 international organisations.  The network in the CIS and Baltic States is a valuable national asset for developing new markets for Ireland.  The wide range of high level international contacts have <Col N="1066" /> already yielded spin-off benefits for tourism, industry, commerce and services. This global network of high level contacts adds a major new dimension to the international profile of Shannon and opens doors to existing and new opportunities for generating substantial additional tourism and business for the Shannon region.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House requests grant aid for a feasibility study to establish a major multi-purpose world centre at Shannon.  This will maximise the opportunities created by the Centre for International Co-operation.  A site has been earmarked and preliminary steps taken to get the project under way.</P>
    <P>The development envisaged is an international park with a number of pavilions, one of which will depict the economic development of modern Ireland over the past half century and highlight the growth and development of Shannon and the Shannon region.  Other pavilions would illustrate the European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations; outstanding examples of international co-operation since World War II, to which Ireland has made a significant contribution. It is expected that each of these organisations would locate an information office or a subsidiary organisation in the park.  The park would also include a world trade centre with exhibition and conference facilities, as well as an international training centre to provide training facilities for eastern European and Third World personnel.</P>
    <P>In relation to this proposal, that great visionary, Brendan O'Regan, who opened up rural Ireland to industrial development and job creation, said:</P>
    <P>What is needed now in Shannon is an imaginative and exciting new development which will have major economic and social impact locally, nationally and internationally; a development which will promote peace and co-operation while generating increased airport traffic and contributing to the expansion of trade, commerce, tourism and employment. Given the same commitment and dedication, and the co-operation of State, semi-State and private sectors, which have resulted in so many major <Col N="1067" /> developments in the Shannon region in the past, I am confident that such a project can be brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that all the activities in the proposed centre would have a major impact on the amount of traffic through Shannon Airport.  The location of offices of international organisations such as the European Union and the United Nations would mean the numbers of people from abroad passing through the airport would increase dramatically.  Furthermore, the proposed development would result in a major exploitation of the region's resources and the economic benefits of such a venture would be quite substantial.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is happy that for once a mid-west politician has spoken positively, without any criticism, about a development in Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the positive contribution made by Senator Neville.  His contributions in this House have always been so.  As the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, is on a trade mission to Germany, I have been asked to take this matter on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Centre for International Co-operation is a non-profit making organisation set up in November 1987 to promote international contacts in a variety of sectors. It is based in Shannon and has organised a number of international conferences there.  It is the Minister's understanding that the centre's main focus at present is on developing the commercial potential for Irish companies in eastern Europe using the contacts the centre has built up since its establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The centre has in the past obtained funding for its activities from Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, SFADCo, the Irish Peace Institute and private sector donations. For the period 1994 to 1996, An Bord <Col N="1068" /> Tráchtála has undertaken to provide in the region of £50,000 to assist the centre in developing a co-operation programme focusing of business leads for Irish companies in eastern Europe.  The objective is to provide a set of business guides to individual republics of the former Soviet Union for the benefit of Irish companies wishing to expand in those markets.</P>
    <P>As the Senator knows, it was originally proposed to establish a world trade centre in Shannon in the 1980s.  There are a number of world trade centres already in existence, for example in Chicago, New York, Singapore and Amsterdam, each drawing on strong local commercial hinterlands.  Supporters of the establishment of a similar centre at Shannon based their proposal on its geographic location, being equi-distant between the USA and the USSR. However, the ending of the cold war and the opening up of eastern European markets have somewhat weakened the basis for this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister feels the centre should maintain its current focus and establish the sound commercial track record required to enable it to assist Irish companies to strengthen and develop their trade links with the emerging new economies previously behind the Iron Curtain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I have impressed on the Minister that the opening up of the USSR is a positive aspect of the proposal.  I ask the Minister for a commitment that she will pass on the strong views of Dr. Patrick Hillery, Mr. Brendan O'Regan, Mr. Tom O'Donnell and of myself to the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, in the hope that he will develop and support a feasibility study. We are not asking for the centre tonight, but for a feasibility study because it deserves one.</P>
