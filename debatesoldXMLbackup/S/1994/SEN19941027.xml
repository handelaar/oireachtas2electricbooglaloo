      <P>I have notice from Senator Honan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to clarify the present position of the new peat fired station in the midlands as outlined in the National Plan.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The deterioration of water quality in Lough Derg, its effect on water life and the action the Government proposes to take to control and improve the existing conditions.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1.  With the agreement of the House, this will be taken without debate.  Committee and Subsequent Stages of Item 2, the Solicitors <Col N="574" /> (Amendment) Bill, 1994, will also be taken if time permits.  I suggest a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and that the Adjournment will take place at 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>May I take this opportunity to inform the House &mdash; we will circulate this information to the Whips and leaders in today's Whips notice &mdash; of future business. We will, obviously, debate the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill today and the Adoptive Leave Bill and the European Communities (Amendment) Bill next week.  After that, the House will debate the Maintenance Bill, the Maternity Protection Bill, the Courts and Court Officers Bill, the Electoral Bill, the Stock Exchange Bill, the Consumer Credit Bill, the Casual Trading Bill, the Ethics in Public Office Bill, the Dublin Institute of Technology (Amendment) Bill, the Regional Technological Colleges (Amendment) Bill and the Family Law Bill.  I will also circulate another list which contains legislation expected to be published</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for his full reply on pending legislation and I am glad he will circulate it.  I am also glad that he will give the House details of other expected legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that under the heading of non-statutory papers laid before the Seanad on today's Order Paper, there is the Final Report of the Inspector into the Affairs of County Glen plc, pursuant to section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990.  As all Members would be aware, the report of the inspector is a comprehensive document which raises some enormously important issues about the operations of the Companies Act and the ethics in business aspect of our private sector.  This extremely important report has cost an enormous amount of money to produce and it raises questions about the way in which legislation which was passed in these Houses was implemented.  It also raises enormous questions about loopholes in that legislation because there is currently a serious question mark over whether the legislation will be able to follow up on <Col N="575" /> what the inspector identifies as blatant wrongdoing and theft on a grand scale.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing here is legislation passed by this House which may not be effective.  I know there may be <i>sub judice</i> restraints, a Chathaoirligh, but would the Leader of the House, after advice, come back and let us know next week if it is possible for this House to debate over the next few weeks this highly significant paper which has laid before the House?  It is something which Members on all sides would very much want to be able to pursue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in thanking the Leader for publishing the list of forthcoming legislation. I am not sure if he mentioned the Occupiers Liability Bill, which was published this morning.  When could we expect it to come to this House?</P>
      <P>Could the Leader also indicate to us when we might discuss Item 9 on the Order Paper, noting the 1993 Annual Review and Outlook for Agriculture, the Food Industry and Forestry?  It would be nice to discuss it before 1994 becomes 1995.</P>
      <P>Has the Leader any information for us as to when it is intended to fill the vacancies which occurred on the benches opposite?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you have a candidate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader arrange a debate fairly soon on a number of related matters?  These include the INTERREG, the IFI, the Leader programme and EU funding.  I would ask the House to have a debate and to note the serious difficulties that have been created in the Border counties, south of the Border in particular.  This House could make a valuable contribution and recommendation regarding this funding.  Such a debate is necessary in the light of the substantial funding announced by the EU that is now coming through the International Fund for Ireland.  It is important for all of us to be <Col N="576" /> aware of that.  The areas we represent expect us to be vocal and to contribute. We will not have a second chance, so this would be a useful debate.  I hope the Leader will arrange it at an early date under all the complementary headings. I would value the House's contribution on those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Leader on bringing forward a comprehensive list of proposed legislation for this session.  May I ask about amendments to existing legislation regarding copyright?  Some months ago we had a two-hour debate in this House on the copyright issue and there was also a public debate.  We were promised at that time an amendment to the 1963 legislation or that perhaps some new legislation would be brought in.  I would like to ask the Leader if there are any proposals to bring forward that legislation in this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Following from what Senator Finneran said, may I also ask for a debate on copyright in the widest terms?  It is not clear if the European Union is going to produce a new view of copyright extending its terms by 20 years to 70 years after the death of the holder of the copyright.  If in certain circumstances that were to be applied retrospectively it would mean that authors such as James Joyce who have emerged from copyright and whose books have been re-published would go back into copyright to the great disadvantage of publishers and authors.  The whole principle of retrospective legislation is anathema to the law.  I would be very surprised indeed if the European Union was considering something so foolish.  In this Parliament, particularly with our great literary tradition.  We should take an interest in that.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House about the Refugee Status Bill, which I do not think he mentioned in his list of forthcoming legislation.  I wondered if there was any particular date on which this might come forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> I also want to express concern and suggest that we might perhaps have a debate on another subject which I think will be of interest to Members of the House.  This concerns the apparent activities of elements of the Provisional IRA in attempting to establish a policing function both in this jurisdiction and in the North of Ireland.  They apparently took away and interrogated somebody in the North of Ireland in recent days. Just yesterday the headlines of the evening newspapers were full of the fact that they were taking unto themselves policing functions with regard to drug abuse in the city of Dublin.  I do not believe that this is appropriate or that they would be accepted as a proper policing authority in this State or in the northern part of this country.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I express concern and suggest that we might have a debate or discussion on the way in which certain political issues are treated.  As an independent politician I am increasingly concerned at the way in which elements of the Opposition pursue, apparently for party advantage, particular issues that they consider have voter appeal.  I am thinking in particular of issues like the recent modest enough salary increases which all Deputies and Senators welcomed universally on a private level, and then set about attacking in the media.  I am thinking also of what I consider to be perfectly legitimate trips by leading members of the Government to conduct the policy of this country, which are subject to the same rather cheap attacks.  I suppose that it would be inappropriate for me to refer to matters that were discussed in the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting for a minute that it is inappropriate to raise ethical questions.  However, I do think it is important that we should be clear about the issues; that they should be significant, major issues and not raised just <Col N="578" /> for political advantage because, if so, a credulous public will be confirmed in its belief that all politicians are corrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Finneran and Norris in calling for an urgent and full discussion on copyright in general. At the present time illegal duplication is decimating the jobs of artists as well as the live music industry in Ireland.  I would welcome as a matter of urgency, within the next two or three weeks if possible, a discussion on the lack of legislation and on penalties which are so out of date as to be unreal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with much interest to the Leader as he told us what our programme of business might be between now and Christmas.  I did not hear him mention Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If he did not, I hope it is not to be assumed that we will not be debating Northern Ireland again this side of Christmas.  I hope that the Forum will not take the place of discussion on the matter in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my concern, and indeed that of many people both inside and outside both Houses of the Oireachtas, at the level of debate that we have seen in recent days.  I am particularly disappointed with the Fine Gael Party.  I have great respect for the Fine Gael Party and its Members but I am particularly disappointed at the way in which we have seen Minister Brian Cowen treated over the last number of days, particularly yesterday.  I want to express that concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to make the point because it is a matter of great concern to many people, especially reading the papers this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the same example happen here in recent times. The level of debate that we have reached, the way accusations are being made, completely without foundation or substantiation, is drawing all politicians into a very low&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am certainly happy to have a debate and I am making this point in a genuine way.  I do not often make points on the Order of Business, but I know that I have agreement from a lot of people on the Opposition side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>that it is vitally important that we politicians uphold the proper ethos of our profession.  Certainly, what we have seen in recent times is degrading to all of us and should be of major concern to us all.  I would hope that we have seen the end of it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Fahey.  We should have a full debate on this issue and this side of the House would be quite happy to debate it today.  We in the Fine Gael Party will always ensure that we have a vigilant, active Opposition and we have no problem in justifying our position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The list I mentioned earlier was a legislative programme.  I assure Senator Wilson that the situation in the North of Ireland will always be to the forefront in this House.  We will have as many other debates as have been called for this morning.</P>
      <P>One or two specific Bills were mentioned by Members.  There is an extensive list of further legislation which should be dealt with between now and Christmas and early in the new year. This list will be circulated.  The Refugee Bill and the Occupier's Liability Bill were specifically mentioned and are on the list.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning requested a debate on the final report of the inspector into County Glen, which we will note.  As he mentioned, we will have to take advice on it.  Items 9 and 10 were mentioned and I hope that the Whip will be in a position to organise those debates as soon as possible.  Copyright and other issues were also raised and the Whip will do his best, with the help of the House, to ensure that these issues are debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The addition to subsection (3) is welcome.  The Law Society has set up a considerable number of <Col N="582" /> subcommittees throughout the country. The members of those committees carry out important work on a voluntary basis.  Without these people, who are willing and able to give of their time to assist, advise and co-operate with the committee which in turn works and cooperates with the Department of Justice and the courts, the society would have great difficulty functioning.  I pay tribute to many of those people who put in time and effort at their own expense.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 8 to 10, inclusive, agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (5), line 42, to delete &ldquo;£1,500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£3,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe that £1,500 is a very low level of sanction under this section.  The Bill will be in operation for quite some time and, as usual, inflation will reduce the effect of this fine.  A higher fine would give the courts greater leeway.  The sum of £1,500 in this day and age is an inadequate deterrent.  There should be a greater deterrent for refusing to co-operate under the provisions of subsections 8 (1) and 8 (2) of this Bill.  It would be reasonable to double the fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will be aware that I reviewed the level of fines on summary conviction in respect of offences under the Bill.  There were a number of amendments proposed on Committee Stage in the Dáil which sought to increase the fines on summary conviction under this section and others. Throughout the Bill, where a summary offence is being created the maximum fine provided had been set at £1,000.  I was advised that the figure of £1,000 could be safely increased to £1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> All of the relevant provisions of the Bill were amended on Report Stage by increasing from £1,000 to £1,500 the maximum fine on summary conviction. This represents a significant adjustment and had the effect of increasing the general level of maximum fines in respect of summary offences in the Bill by 50 per cent.  I propose to go no further on advice and that is why I, regrettably, cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>To keep the question of penalties in perspective, I would add that the fine in the section is backed up by the potentially heavier sanctions which may be imposed on a solicitor for misconduct pursuant to section 24, including any contravention of the Solicitors Acts or any order or regulations made thereunder.  For example, solicitors who fail to comply with any provisions of the Solicitors Acts may have practising certificates suspended under section 58 of the Bill.  In addition they could be brought before the disciplinary tribunal and ultimately struck off the roll.</P>
    <P>The society also has a power under section 61 of the Bill to refuse to issue a practising certificate to a solicitor who fails to comply with the provisions of sections 8, 9 or 10 of the Bill.  Taken together these provisions represent a strong deterrent and I doubt if any solicitor would willingly wish to face having a criminal record and also have his or her career as a solicitor either suspended or terminated.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville made the point that the Bill will be in existence for a long time before we amend it.  The Senator may or may not be aware that the Minister will shortly introduce legislation in the other House to provide for the indexation of fines.  The level of penalties here will, I am advised, come under that.  The penalties will increase in accordance with movements in the consumer price index.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's promise that legislation will be introduced to index fines.  However, I have been in this House since 1989 and that <Col N="584" /> was one of the first issues discussed. Five years later it is still being discussed. Could the Minister confirm that this legislation will be published before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay arose because the Law Reform Commission was asked to report on the matter as it is fairly complex.  My understanding is that the Law Reform Commission have reported.  Work on the legislation is very advanced.  I cannot definitively state that it will be published before Christmas but I know that work within the Department on the legislation is at a very advanced stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This section concerns the power to inspect documents and is very important.  There are occasions when the Law Society may have concerns about a firm of solicitors or a practice and will want to call to it.  They can do so without any prior notice.  They can attend and show their authority to attend on behalf of the Law Society. Because of the position of trust solicitors hold and, on occasion, the vast sums of clients' money involved, this is essential in the public interest and that of the Law Society, which must make good any moneys lost.  This provision, which already existed but which is being improved and strengthened, is welcome.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(1) Investigation of any written complaint concerning the handling by the Society of a complaint about a solicitor made to the Society by any person, shall be the duty of the Ombudsman as established by the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  The Minister shall, in consultation with the Society, set an annual contribution to be made by the Society, towards the cost of the Office of the Ombudsman.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is important that an independent person investigates complaints against the solicitor.  There is a need for transparency in such investigations and if it was the Ombudsman's duty under the Ombudsman Act, 1980, there would be more confidence in the application of the principles of the Act.  There should be a system where investigations into complaints would have credibility.  If this amendment is accepted it would be more open and transparent and the public would have more confidence in the procedures.</P>

      <P>As regards this amendment, it is appropriate as a matter of policy to maintain a division between complaints machinery for the public sector and for the private sector.  The primary function of the Ombudsman for the public service is to investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a Department of State where a complaint is made by a person against such a Department.  It is not the role of the Ombudsman to investigate complaints relating to services provided commercially in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an obvious advantage for complaints about solicitors' services if machinery exists to deal exclusively with them.  By comparison, the range of complaints handled by the Ombudsman for the public service, includes complaints in regard to the Civil Service, local authorities, health boards and Telecom <Col N="586" /> Éireann.  The proposals in section 15 are a response to public concern about the absence of an effective and accountable system for dealing with complaints about solicitors.  It is vital that a specialised mechanism be put in place to improve public confidence in the manner in which complaints against solicitors are dealt with.</P>
    <P>Some Senators expressed concern about the independence of the adjudicator given the requirement on the society to pay the costs of the office.  At the end of the day the society will have to foot the Bill for the adjudicator's office and that will apply under the provisions of section 15 or under the provisions of the proposed amendments.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the provisions of section 15 underpin the independence of the office, and three key provisions ensure this.  The Minister's consent will be required for the appointment of an independent adjudicator by the Law Society.  The adjudicator will be required to report annually to the Minister on the discharge of his or her duties as he or she will be under a statutory obligation to act independently in the exercise of his or her functions.  It will be open to the adjudicator to raise any issue of interference with his or her independence in the course of these annual reports.  The Minister shall also require publication of the annual reports and shall lay them before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Any difficulty encountered by the adjudicator in discharging his or her statutory functions will then be a matter of public record.  It is specifically provided that the adjudicator shall not be a practising solicitor, a member of the society or a practising barrister.  I am satisfied that section 15 ensures that the adjudicator will be independent of the solicitors profession.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for the State to establish the adjudicator's office, with all the attendant administrative costs which would be involved for the taxpayer. The credit institutions and the insurance industry have established their own Ombudsman schemes and it is past time for the Law Society to <Col N="587" /> establish an adjudication scheme to review decisions of the society in relation to complaints made by the public. I believe the society should establish an adjudication scheme without delay.  If it fails to do so, section 15 enables the Minister to require it to do so.  Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>The general principle in other countries is that the State sets up an Ombudsman's office to deal with complaints in the public sector.  In most countries with which I am familiar a system of self-regulation applies to the private sector.  A particular profession or business will set up its own Ombudsman and that is what we are doing here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us what type of office he has in mind to carry out independent investigations? Will it be similar to the Ombudsman's Office and what costs will be involved in the setting up and running of this office?  As far as I am aware, the Law Society has in the past stated that it is in favour of such a procedure, that is, setting up some type of independent investigation body.  The reason the Law Society favours an outside investigation body is because in the past aggrieved clients believed that matters were being investigated by Law Society members because they were investigated by its own disciplinary committee.  It is, however, concerned about the level of costs involved and I would like the Minister to tell us what they will be.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point about the separation of the powers of the Ombudsman, who investigates the workings of local authorities and public bodies.  The Office of the Ombudsman was set up in a competent and efficient manner.  The Ombudsman is highly respected and his Office has been objective in its views.  For that reason Senator Neville's amendment, which refers to the Ombudsman's Office, is worthy of consideration.  I am not totally opposed to the Minister, but it is worth bearing in mind.</P>

      <P>As regards costs, discussions are ongoing between the Department of Justice and the Law Society.  The position is that the Law Society knows what is in this section, it knows what it must do and it is looking at this at present.  It has some time to set it up, although I know it is unhappy about incurring extra costs and I understand its position from that point of view.  We decided that, as in other private sector areas where there is an Ombudsman, the profession will bear the cost; it will not be borne by the taxpayer from central funds.  The Law Society knows what it must do and it must decide the best way to do it.  If the society does not do this, the Minister can require them to do so.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 5,000 solicitors in practice so the cost per firm, if divided between solicitors, will be low. I appreciate what Senator Enright said about the public sector scheme.  It is a good scheme which has worked well.  As far as I am aware, no country which has set up a public Ombudsman scheme has extended it to investigate any branch or part of the private sector.  It would open a very dangerous door and we are not going to do that here.</P>

      <P>The Minister said finance and insurance companies have an investigation scheme.  However, bodies such as the four main banks, including Bank of Ireland and AIB, and insurance companies have vast sums of money available to them because they are wealthy organisations.  We are dealing with different amounts of money.  The Law Society depends on funding, payments or contributions on an annual basis from solicitors.  They are an entirely different body and it is creating two entirely different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years there has been a very broad measure of agreement among the member solicitors to try to have such a body as the Minister is proposing set up, but it was at all times felt that a contribution should be made by the Department of Justice.  This legislation introduces regulations.  I do not know <Col N="589" /> whether it is possible at a later stage to make a regulation allowing for a contribution from the Department to finance it in some way, but it is worth looking at.  The Minister has mentioned that there are about 5,000 qualified solicitors at the moment, but I do not think they are all employed.  It is something that the Minister should consider further.</P>

The solicitors themselves know what is in the legislation, they know the level of complaints they are getting.  We will see what is coming in by way of appeal to the Ombudsman and I will bear the Senator's suggestion in mind.  We will see when the scheme is operating if it is so large and extensive that the Law Society cannot possibly bear it.  In that case we would have to reconsider, but let us get it set up now and see how it operates first.</P>

      <P>In page 17, paragraph (f), line 23, after &ldquo;Society&rdquo; to add &ldquo;unless the adjudicator feels there are reasonable grounds for admitting an appeal&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be some flexibility in regard to the length of time after which an investigation of a complaint can be dealt with.  There could be circumstances where a person was ill or mentally incapable for a period of three or four years and they were not in a position to raise the issue.  A person might not be aware of their rights.  The whole area of law is very complex and people are often not aware of their rights and the rights they will have under this legislation. I ask the Minister, even when this Bill is law, how many people will be aware of the content and the new facilities which it is giving to the general public? There should be some flexibility, <Col N="590" /> but I agree with the Minister that you cannot have an open ended situation where after 50 or 60 years a person could raise a complaint against the society.  There should be flexibility and an investigation should take place after a time lag.  It would be up to the adjudicator to determine whether it was fair and reasonable, given all the circumstances, that after a period of three years a complaint against the society could be raised and dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as published provided that an adjudicator could examine a complaint made after the expiration of two years following the determination by the Law Society of a complaint. After careful consideration I amended this retrospective period to three years. There must be certainty in the matter of defining time limits and I would be opposed to introducing a discretionary power allowing the adjudicator to admit appeals where the three year period is exceeded.  The fairest approach is to have a definite time limit with no provision for variation.  Unfortunately, time limits, which we must have, are of their nature arbitrary.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that three years is a very fair limit.  It gives complainants to the adjudicator ample scope to have their case dealt with.  There are definite time limits in other areas of law.  There is a six year period after which it is not possible to initiate action.  There is a three year period after which it is not possible to initiate action.  I can foresee all sorts of difficulties here now if we move away from a definite time limit.  People will complain to TDs and everywhere else that the adjudicator allowed some appeals and did not admit others.  On reflection Members will agree that a definite cut-off point is preferable.</P>
      <P>Members can rest assured that both the Law Society and the Department of Justice will take all necessary measures to ensure that the provisions of this Bill and the new rights people are getting under this Bill will be publicised as widely as possible.</P>

      <P>I raised the matter of timescales on Second Stage because, as I saw it on a first reading, there was in some cases a timescale of eight years within which matters could be raised again.  I stated that this appeared to me to be excessive.  I agree with the Minister on this one.  As a practical matter, when keeping a file and trying to keep evidence together for such a long period of time it is not possible to raise the matter at a late stage and expect it to be dealt with and have people's memories refreshed at such a late time.  The procedure allows ample opportunity to any complainant to raise the matter at any stage, and having extended it from the two to three years, I think nobody has any cause for concern about that issue.</P>

      <P>While I accept, to an extent, that there should be a cut-off point, there will always be hard cases where it will be unfair to somebody to have their case not dealt with and our amendment would leave it up to the adjudicator to determine what was fair. We would see a very small number of cases coming into this category.  The adjudicator should have the leeway to allow appeals in certain circumstances which he would determine.  If somebody was ill, was in hospital or mentally incapacitated and did not have the opportunity within three years to raise the issue, the adjudicator should be able to look at it and determine that the case could be dealt with.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister might be able to clarify the point he has made.  Senator Neville mentioned a person of unsound mind or somebody who was mentally ill or an infant.  In some of these cases the time limit on taking an action is suspended for that period of time, so there can be exceptions.  Somebody who is mentally ill and is not aware of his rights or an infant would be able to bring their case even after the three years anyway.  Perhaps the Minister is in a position to comment on that.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that.  We are talking about a situation where a person goes to the Law Society, is not happy with their determination and it goes on then to the Ombudsman.  We cannot have it open ended.  We cannot have a situation where it is theoretically possible, as it would be under the amendment as proposed, to take action 30 years later.  The initial period suggested was two years.  The general view in the Department was that two years was sufficient.  I do not agree with Senator Neville, incidentally, that we are talking about a small number of cases.  Potentially, the number of cases could be very large.  We thought two years was sufficient.  I listened to reasoned arguments, both here on Second Stage and in the other House, and I decided to extend that period to three years.  We cannot complain about the costs which the Law Society will have to bear because of this and then increase those costs by putting in this sort of an arbitrary provision.  We will have to stick with a definite time limit here now. We will see how it is operating in practice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I proposed this amendment because we have every trust in lay people to be able to adjudicate on disciplinary issues.  I fail to understand why one needs two solicitors and one lay person on the tribunal. <Col N="593" /> Why could it not be one solicitor and two lay people?  As the Minister is aware, the Employment Appeals Tribunal has this type of system where there is one legal person and two lay people who adjudicate.  I would have every confidence that the lay people appointed to the tribunal will determine fairly and honestly on any disciplinary matters.  Will the Minister therefore justify why there should be two solicitors and only one lay person who will determine disciplinary matters in respect of solicitors?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <P>Very good, but, as the Senator will be aware from his membership, the Employment Appeals Tribunal is a body to which an employee makes a complaint against an employer.  There is an employer's representative, a representative from the trade union, an employee's representative and a legal person in the centre.  It is presumed that the employer's representative will consider the case from the employer's point of view.  I do not suggest that he will invariably agree with the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>However, there is no analogy between it and the situation under consideration at present.  The principle underlying the solicitor's profession and its regulation is that it is self-regulating and we wish to leave it self-regulating. If there was to be a majority of lay people on the disciplinary tribunal <Col N="594" /> or any committee thereof, then the solicitor's profession would not be effectively regulating itself, but it would be the public.</P>
      <P>The proposals contained in section 16 of the Bill are framed on the basis that the policy of self-regulation regarding disciplinary matters should continue as it does with regard to the many other professions.  Professional standards of behaviour must be based to a large degree on consensus among the members of each profession.  Section 16 of the Bill represents a strong vindication of the public's right to have a say in the deliberations of the disciplinary tribunal, which exercises significant functions with regard to the control and discipline of the profession.</P>
      <P>At present all members of the existing disciplinary committee must be solicitors. For the first time up to five lay members will be nominated by the Minister for appointment to the tribunal. The balance of solicitors and lay members is correct, especially in view of the self-regulatory nature of the profession. The purpose of including lay members on the disciplinary tribunal is to ensure that the interests of the public are represented.  This must be considered in the context of other provisions in the Bill which allow the public to become involved in the disciplinary and complaints machinery of the profession.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment in the name of Senator Neville, I am satisfied that we have got the correct balance of lay members and solicitor's members on the tribunal.  Consequently, I am happy with the composition of divisions of the tribunal.  The Bill provides that committees of the council of the society may include lay members and we have also provided for the appointment of an independent adjudicator to examine complaints regarding the handling of complaints against solicitors by the Law Society.  However, it is not the purpose of the Bill to remove the responsibility for the regulation and control of solicitors from the profession itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> The Bill ensures that there will be accountability on the part of the tribunal. Under section 17, a complainant may appeal a decision of the tribunal to the High Court on the grounds that the penalty imposed was inadequate, or on the grounds that the tribunal should not have imposed a sanction &mdash; that is, the limited sanction &mdash; but rather should have referred the matter to the High Court for decision.  A solicitor may also, of course, appeal to the High Court against the decision of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In all cases where a disciplinary tribunal holds an inquiry it must embody its findings in a report to the High Court.  The tribunal is a tribunal of the High Court.  It is appointed by the President of the High Court and is responsible for its actions to the High Court.</P>
    <P>In this instance the policy is one self-regulation. With regard to the disciplinary tribunal, self-regulation was interpreted up to now to mean that solicitors formed the composition of the tribunal.  For the first time we are allowing members of the public onto the tribunal; we are letting in the light.  We are allowing in members of the public to let them see how complaints from the public are dealt with by the disciplinary tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The disciplinary tribunal deals with very serious matters which can have the most profound implications for solicitors and I would be completely opposed to the idea of lay people deciding these important matters by majority.  It would not work. However, we have come a long way.  We are allowing members of the public to comprise one third of the division, because cases will usually be heard by a division of the disciplinary committee, and if a case is to be heard by the full disciplinary committee, the members of the public will comprise one third of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> The public will therefore be in a position to see how complaints from their fellow members of the public are being dealt with by this most important tribunal, which has far reaching powers, and will now acquire a number of new power as a result of the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister advises that he is letting in the light.  However, we are anxious to open the door and allow the public to have more of a say and an influence on issues of concern to it. While the Bill contains self-regulatory provisions with regard to the legal profession, there is a great desire that there should be openness and involvement with regard to the public.</P>

If the public was seen to be more involved in the disciplinary regulations and the work of the disciplinary tribunal there would be more confidence in the entire legal machinery.  The objective of this legislation is to create more transparency and create greater confidence among the public.</P>

      <P>The membership of the disciplinary tribunal comprises a ratio of 2:1 between representatives of the legal profession and members of the public. This measure has been sought by the Law Society for many years and the <Col N="597" /> Minister's Department has been anxious over the years to have such a body established.  In addition, many people with grievances might have been happier with decisions if a lay person had been involved in them.</P>
      <P>Law is an adversarial business.  For example, if two neighbours have a serious conflict regarding a farm, right of way or a business, or if a family has a serious dispute which divides them in half, and there is recourse to law, one family or one neighbour wins by a decision of the High Court or Circuit Court.  The family or neighbour who loses decides to go to the disciplinary tribunal, alleging that their case was not properly heard or conducted.  The case then proceeds to the disciplinary tribunal. The tribunal will comprise two members of the public who will have no knowledge or experience of law and may not understand the difficulties and intricacies of the case.  At that stage the disciplinary tribunal makes a finding and matters then proceed to the High Court.  Under section 18 of the Bill the court has extensive and wide ranging powers in this area.  It may, for example, impose fines, suspend a solicitor for a short period, have a solicitor struck off the role entirely or prevent a solicitor from ever resuming practice.</P>
      <P>The Law Society is a self-regulating body and this Bill seeks to introduce more regulations and powers to the society.  In this respect the Minister has gone a long way and has opened the window and let in light.  It is now a matter of observing how matters proceed, but an important step forward has been made on this issue.  It is difficult to achieve a correct balance, but thus far the present proposals are reasonable and fair.  While in many instances I appreciate Senator Neville's concerns, the Minister's achievements go a long way towards meeting the feelings and desires of the vast majority of the general public.</P>

The gazette is regularly read by those working on national newspapers and, therefore, matters which are published in it are often published in the daily and Sunday newspapers also.  The public now has considerable access to information about complaints which are received and the outcome of their investigation. It opens many windows and lets in more light.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 33, before section 26 (but in Part III) to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;Fines imposed by a Court under any provision of this Act shall be indexed annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index and regulations setting out this index shall be published annually by the Minister and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas not later than the 31st day of March in each calendar year.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister dealt with this section earlier.  The amendment expresses our concern about the need for the indexation of fines.  I am disappointed the Minister could not give a definite time scale for the introduction of this legislation.  Obviously, it will not be introduced during this session which is disappointing.</P>

      <P>As the House knows, the Minister for Justice, since taking office 20 months ago, has put through nine very important pieces of legislation.

I think that is an all time record.  We have only a certain amount of resources and we cannot do everything together.</P>
      <P>However, I refer Senator Neville to the famous work <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> in which Alice states at one point that around here one has to run very fast to stand still.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, hit the ground running when she came into the Department and we are all gasping trying to keep up with her.  As I said, this is an all time record and she is a tremendous Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases where genuine mistakes are made which are covered under indemnity provisions. There are cases where there is actual misappropriation of funds which should be condemned and the Minister and the Law Society should take every possible action to prevent or prosecute such conduct.</P>
      <P>However, there are cases where a solicitor may be engaged in transactions in which the Law Society may incur losses because of the way moneys have been appropriated by a solicitor on behalf of firms or undertakings he has given. These are not cases of dishonesty but can result in the Law Society finding itself facing claims which are outside the normal business of the funds involved. Huge sums of money can be involved. For example, a solicitor acting for an international company might invest funds in property and at a later stage the property could drop in value.  The Law Society has no control over the conduct of a solicitor.  Does the Minister understand the point I am making and what are his views on it?  It is a difficult area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very difficult area. The section states:</P>
      <P>Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Society that any client of a solicitor has sustained loss in consequence of dishonesty on the part of that solicitor or any clerk or servant of that solicitor arising from that solicitor's practice as a solicitor within the jurisdiction of the State, then... the Society shall make a grant ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, this has been the requirement. The society must interpret that <Col N="603" /> properly and make the appropriate grant.  I understand the Senator's point. It is difficult in those grey areas.  From what does it arise?  Does it arise from his practice or not?  If it does not arise from his practice as a solicitor, for example, if there is dishonesty in some other walk of life, the situation would not be covered.  However, if it arises directly from his practice as a solicitor, the compensation fund comes into play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a grant.  It is one thing if one is talking about a 100 per cent grant or contribution. One example might clarify the position.  A solicitor is acting for a senior executive in a major financial institution who has access to and control over large sums of money.  The sums are invested with the solicitor to purchase property or to hold in trust for a particular reason.  The solicitor is asked to buy property on behalf of the client and he uses the money.  Perhaps he should have been more careful in checking out where the money came from, but it is difficult on occasions to ask somebody where they obtained funds.  The solicitor could act in good faith, although not as prudently as he might have been, but the Law Society could find itself faced with a gigantic bill.  This could cause financial consequences for the society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 43, subsection (3), line 35, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or local authorities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to extend the exemption from the annual contribution to the fund to solicitors employed full-time by local authorities.  These solicitors do not maintain a client's account and have specifically obtained exemption from the Incorporated Law Society from compliance with section 31 of the 1960 Act.  There is therefore no capacity for them to interfere with a client's account which is non-existent.  In that regard they are clearly similar to solicitors in full-time service of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of this discrimination against local authority solicitors is that public moneys are being used to compensate people who could not be defrauded by solicitors in full-time service <Col N="605" /> of a local authority.  For example, in the case of Dublin Corporation alone, a sum of £4,200 was paid in 1994 and this is rising annually to cater for this position.  The moneys involved are not large because the number of solicitors employed full-time by local authorities is small.  The amendment proposes to extend the present exemption for solicitors employed full-time by the State to solicitors employed full-time by local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would exempt solicitors employed by local authorities from contributing to the compensation fund.  The duties of local authority solicitors are no more analogous to the duties of a solicitor in the full-time service of the State than they are analogous to the duties of many solicitors employed in the semi-State sector and in private practice.  Many solicitors employed in private practice, who, for example, are practising exclusively in criminal law, have no access to clients' accounts and may have little other opportunity for fraud.  Employed solicitors in private practice, that is, solicitors who are not partners, seldom handle or control clients' funds. However, all solicitors in private practice are required to contribute to the compensation fund regardless of the risk, if any, that they may steal clients' money.  This requirement has been justified on the grounds that the fund is intended to provide protection to the clients of all solicitors.  It is for the good of the profession as a whole and should therefore be contributed to by all solicitors. In other words, it is an insurance type concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exceptionally, solicitors in the full-time employment of the State have not been required to contribute to the fund since it was established under provisions of the 1954 Solicitors Act.  Any proposal to extend the exempted category to include local authority solicitors would be likely to lead to strong pressure from <Col N="606" /> solicitors in private practice who do not handle clients' funds to be similarly exempted.  It is imperative that no steps are taken which would tend to undermine the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that in private practice solicitors, by internal arrangement, do not deal with clients' funds?  However, they must comply with the 1960 Act procedures regarding a declaration for the handling of clients' funds.  If solicitors do not hold clients' funds in private practice, it is an internal arrangement by the company. Local authority solicitors are identical to those working in the State area.  Is the Minister justifying that perhaps solicitors in the State area should contribute to the fund?  The logic of what he said is that perhaps State sector solicitors should contribute to the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Neville that there appears to be something of a contradiction.  Traditionally, solicitors in the State sector have not been obliged to contribute to the fund and this is not being changed.  However, the fund exists to compensate clients of solicitors who act dishonestly, that is, who steal clients' money.  Obviously, the only solicitors who will steal clients' money are those who are in a position to do so.  There may be many solicitors in the country who would like to steal clients' money if they could get their hands on it but they have no opportunity to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, they must all contribute to the fund.  It is an insurance type situation.  From that point of view I am not willing to open the door any further.  The State has been traditionally exempted.  Perhaps there is a question of whether that is right or wrong, but whoever introduced the legislation in 1954 decided that point. <Col N="607" /> We have decided not to change it. Senator Neville is correct that in many firms there is a private internal arrangement as regards who will have access to clients' funds.  However, there are other solicitors &mdash; for example, those practising exclusively in the criminal or family law area &mdash; who have no access to clients' funds whatsoever.  They are similarly caught for the compensation fund, which is an insurance type concept. Although one category of solicitors has been exempt since 1954, I do not propose to open the door any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think it is best.  We have had extensive discussions with the Law Society about this and they felt that to reduce the number of claims and the number of negligence cases &mdash; which is doing no good for the reputation of the solicitor's profession &mdash; somebody would need a grounding of three years, which it felt was a reasonable timescale, before they would enter practice on their own and deal with clients themselves as a principal in a firm.  There is a provision in the first line of the section which states: &ldquo;A solicitor shall not, without the written consent of the Society ...&rdquo;.  A solicitor who has been practising with somebody else for three years can apply to the society and if the <Col N="608" /> society feels that for some reason the person is sufficiently grounded to safely carry on practice on their own it has discretion to allow them to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>May we go through the sections a little more slowly as we have points we wish to make?  I would like the Minister to comment on the provision that somebody has to be employed full time for three years before practising on their own.  In section 42 the apprenticeship is lowered from three to two years.  Is there a contradiction here in that the apprenticeship period is two years but one cannot set up until one has qualified post apprenticeship for a period of three years?  Would it be better if the apprenticeship period was extended to three years so that a person would have experience at apprenticeship level in a firm under the master and may be better able to obtain employment post apprenticeship?  In other words, the person would have more experience post apprenticeship and then the period of experience could be reduced to two years before they could set up practice on their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe not, but certainly a lot more than an apprentice.  This is for the benefit of the profession also. We have had representations from many quarters asking for the period of apprenticeship to be reduced and we are doing that.  We are allowing people to come out of an apprenticeship earlier and command whatever salary the market will bear for a fully qualified solicitor, <Col N="609" /> which will obviously be more than for somebody who is just an apprentice.</P>
      <P>We have discussed with the Law Society how long a person should be working for somebody else as an assistant before they can become a principal or practice in their own right or as a partner in a firm, and we feel that a maximum of three years is right.  If they feel that after two years they are qualified to set up on their own they can apply to the Law Society which will put them through their paces and see if they are sufficiently safe to practice on their own.  The Law Society will have discretion to give them permission to do so.</P>

      <P>On obtaining a degree one can enter into an apprenticeship for a two year period, which is quite short. A person is employed as an apprentice and is paid.  There is a period of time during the apprenticeship when they are out of the office attending courses.  It is a short period of apprenticeship &mdash; it was four years when I did it and three years when Senator Gallagher did it. One does need a certain level of practical involvement in an office to appreciate the problems and pitfalls that can arise and the enjoyable work to be done.  It is a short period of time and I will not hold up the discussion over it, but it is worthy of examination.  Senator Neville is right; there can be dangers in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difference when somebody has been working as a law clerk and has amassed experience over a considerable time.  However, the study of law in an <Col N="610" /> academic environment and the day to day work involved are poles apart.  The matter is worthy of consideration, if not now then in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate Senator Enright's point, colleagues of mine went to an institution in Belfast to train as solicitors and then took two years apprenticeship while my period of apprenticeship was three years.  It depends on the training programme and how much practical experience the apprentice is allowed to gain in the individual firm.  A two year period is long enough because one gets a good grounding in the primary degree and a lot of practical experience in the office; the Law Society courses are now very practical as opposed to academic.  It takes long enough to qualify and I would not make it any harder.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that there would be more competition and no restriction in obtaining access to the profession of solicitor.  This is an issue about which the public has been concerned for some time and which crops up regularly.  In all other professions there is free access.  If one qualifies as an accountant one can practise as an accountant provided the proper examinations are completed.  I do not see why there should be regulations to restrict access to the profession of solicitor.</P>

      <P>The amendment is not necessary as there is separate legislation governing competition and restrictive practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The competition Act of 1990 prohibits anti-competitive practices.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has a Bill before the Dáil at present amending and strengthening <Col N="612" /> that Act by providing for public enforcement of the law on competition by the competition authority.  The Law Society, like any other controlling body of a profession, is subject to the provisions of the competition Act of 1990 and will be subject to the amended provisions. That Act provides a comprehensive scheme for dealing with allegations of anti-competitive practices.  I am advised that using regulations in order to restrict access to the profession would leave the society open to challenge under the competition Act.</P>
    <P>The amendment is a stand alone provision which makes it an offence for the society to restrict access to the profession. I admit that it is commendable. However, the offence might be difficult to prove.  While I appreciate what the Senator is trying to achieve, I do not believe the amendment is the best method of attaining his objective.  The competition Act appears to be the most appropriate vehicle for dealing with anti-competitive practices by any profession.</P>
    <P>One area where the Law Society could restrict access to the profession is obviously education.  The vocational training of solicitors at present is ruled by the Law Society.  However, there is a provision in section 49 of the Bill which requires that any regulations made in regard to the education and training of solicitors and apprentices shall be made only with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.  The Minister, therefore, will have a power of veto over any draft regulations prepared by the society in the area of education or apprenticeship. If the Minister is not satisfied with any draft regulations he or she can refuse to concur with them.</P>
    <P>It was precisely because the Government was concerned about access to the profession that the restrictions on apprenticeships are being eased through a number of measures in this Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 72, subsection (1), line 14, to delete &ldquo;client&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;person giving the instructions&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is essentially a drafting amendment.  The draftsman has been consulted about this matter and he is satisfied with the way the section has been drafted.  &ldquo;Client&rdquo; has a wide meaning in section 2 of the Bill.  It is defined as including the personal representative of a client and other persons.  However, this wide definition of a client is qualified by section 2 which states that the wider meaning applies unless the context otherwise requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draftsman's advice is that under section 68 the context requires a narrow definition of the word &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  Subsection (1) must be read as a whole and it is clear that the client referred to in line 14 relates to the person who gives instructions to the solicitor in the first place.  In summary, I am advised that &ldquo;client&rdquo; should be given its ordinary and natural meaning and not its wider <Col N="615" /> meaning.  I ask Senator Enright to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;provided however that a solicitor shall not be obliged to furnish such particulars where the total amount of the charges payable to the solicitor including any value added tax payable thereon in respect of the subject matter of the instructions does not exceed the sum of £150.00 or such greater sum as the Minister may provide by regulation from time to time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this amendment the amount involved is small.  I do not anticipate that the cost of drafting or preparing a bill should be necessary in this instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is to apply a lower cut-off threshold to the requirement in section 68(1) to give full details of costs in advance of the solicitor and client doing business. This is one of the central consumer driven measures in the Bill.  I would not like to see it diluted, although I understand the Senator's point of view.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned that many transactions at, for example, £100 cost would not be covered by the new requirements if this amendment were accepted.  This amount may represent a considerable outgoing for many clients and solicitors and I would not want them to be kept in the dark about the extent of their commitment.  The cost to solicitors of complying with these new requirements should be negligible where very small charges are involved. I envisage a simple procedure being put in place using a standard form for setting out charges and I am sure the Law Society will draft such forms and circulate them in the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> I am advised that there may be technical problems with the amendment. The power proposed for the Minister to increase the sum of £150 as proposed may well exceed the powers which may be delegated to a Minister in making regulations.  There would also be the question of making any such regulation delegating power subject to a requirement to lay the regulations before a House of the Oireachtas.

      <P>Section 69 concerns advertising.  One repeatedly hears of the insurance companies' concern about a small number of solicitors who have earned a reputation of being good at getting money from those companies. Does any provision exist whereby advertising by those solicitors can be monitored or controlled?  More generally, is there any monitoring of solicitors who appear to be in the business of eliciting high claims from insurance companies, which consequently lead to high premia?  Presumably, the Law Society is <Col N="617" /> concerned about this, along with everyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fahey has raised an important point which is of concern to us all.  We have to find a balance because we are trying to reduce solicitors' costs to clients and one way to do that is to allow solicitors to advertise their services and fees.  We decided to allow that because as far as we can ascertain it achieved the desired effect in Britain.  On the other hand, we must be in a position to guard against irresponsible advertising.</P>
      <P>This is precisely why section 69 (3) provides that the Law Society shall not prohibit advertising while subsection (4) allows the society to prevent advertising which is likely to bring the profession into disrepute, is in bad taste, reflects unfavourably on other solicitors, contains an express or implied assertion by a solicitor that he has specialist knowledge of any area of law or practice superior to other solicitors, is false or misleading in any respect, comprises or includes unsolicited approaches to any person with a view to obtaining instructions in any legal matter, or is contrary to public policy.  The Law Society now has wide powers to prohibit advertising which falls within any of those categories.</P>
      <P>The society has assured the Department that it is fully aware of the problem to which Senator Fahey adverted.  I have every confidence it will use this power to alleviate that problem as far as it possibly can.</P>

      <P>The difference between Ireland and Britain is that there is civil legal aid in the other jurisdiction.  I have on occasion acted for people who had returned from Britain.  These cases are processed for a considerable period before a decision is made on whether civil legal aid can be granted.  Unless there is a basic case legal aid will not be granted in Britain.  Here, solicitors advertise on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis, which is downright unsatisfactory.  I dislike that advertising and approach and many solicitors view it unfavourably. Advertising should be monitored closely by the Minister and I fully agree with Senator Fahey that we are not giving it enough attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will speak later about capping awards, which will probably feature in future legislation.  Having awards capped is fine for people who are paying insurance premia but it is not beneficial for a person who loses a leg or an eye. There are two sides to the story and I hope the Minister bears that in mind.  I also hope the Minister and the Law <Col N="619" /> Society continue to monitor advertising. I note the restrictions contained in the Bill, but even with them there will always be someone who will veer close to the wind, which is not beneficial to anyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>What monitoring system is in place?  I have received complaints from an insurance company that a specific solicitor is constantly touting for and getting business.  That company is concerned about the nature of the claims he is making and about the professionalism of this solicitor.  It feels he is trying to extract money from the company and that it is not warranted.  What procedure exists to identify such people and have them brought to heel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1988 solicitors have given themselves power to advertise their services.  Now for the first time they will be allowed to advertise their fees.  Judging from what I hear on the radio and see in the newspapers, the monitoring system is not adequate at present.  Perhaps the Law Society feels it does not have the power to monitor advertising properly but we are now specifically giving it power.  There are a number of types of advertising which it can prevent: advertising in bad taste, which reflects unfavourably on other solicitors, which is false or misleading, which is contrary to public policy, or which involves unsolicited approaches, such as cold calling.</P>
      <P>There will be no excuse from now on. The Law Society is being given the power to monitor advertising and if it does not do so properly we shall have to do something else.  In the meantime the reputation of solicitors, which has fallen considerably in recent years, will fall even further.  They will soon find themselves as disreputable as politicians if this type of advertising continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Enright mentioned the civil legal aid system in the UK.  Some <Col N="620" /> months ago I represented the Minister at a Council of Ministers meeting.  The meeting of Justice Ministers took place in London during Britain's Presidency of the EU and was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay.  I was intrigued by the fact that he asked all people present to give a synopsis of how the civil legal aid system operated in our respective countries.  The <i>per capita</i> expenditure in Ireland was close to that of other countries except Britain, which was considerably out of line.  The <i>per capita</i> expenditure there was about ten times the EU average.</P>
    <P>I later asked the Lord Chancellor why he had asked for the comparative costs. He said he wanted to know what was happening in other countries because he wanted to cut the expenditure in Britain.  He said the British had made a terrible mistake in setting up their system. It has swept out of control and is a huge burden on the British Exchequer. That system may not continue as it is for much longer; at the highest level of government there is an intention to bring it into line with the system of civil legal aid in other EU countries.</P>

      <P>There is much concern about the level of fraudulent claims being made against insurance companies. Anyone in or on a local authority is well aware of the level of such claims. This is akin to stealing and there should be sanctions against people who bring such claims.  At present there is a free for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully agree with Senator Enright, Senator Fahey and the Minister about controlling the level of advertising, because the type of advertising happening at present will lead to an explosion of such fraudulent complaints. The type of advertising taking place now will lead to an explosion of such fraudulent complaints and of the difficulties insurance companies have in defending these claims.  The area of proof should be looked at to ensure that <Col N="621" /> those with genuine claims are honoured and compensated and those who bring fraudulent claims are not successful.</P>

It is not good enough that elderly people and others walking the streets should fall and hurt themselves. I am a member of Offaly County Council and am happy to say that the level of claims against the council which have been successful have been at a minimum because the council takes its duties to the public seriously.  If an accident occurs it makes sure there will not be another one at the same place the following night.  It is time people in charge of these bodies put their own houses in order rather than trying to reduce the levels of lawful damages.  I am glad the Minister will monitor advertising because it is in everybody's best interests that it is kept under control.</P>

I ask the Minister to assure us that difficulties will not arise as a result of this change. One is happy to have open competition. However, I am concerned that if this leads to difficulties for families following deaths and the reading of wills or taking them to probate, the Bill should ensure that proper legal expertise is available to them.

      <P>I assure Senator Neville that we have thought about this very carefully and the section will not lead to difficulties.  This is my intention.  Senator Neville will know from reading the section that we are not giving credit unions the right to make wills or extract grants of probate.  The legislation provides <Col N="623" /> only that the Minister can make regulations to give them such power. Such regulations will ensure that the power is circumscribed to provide the maximum protection for people for whom they provide those services.  The regulations will include, among other things, that adequate compensation is available for any person in respect of negligence, fraud or other dishonesty on the part of whoever is carrying out this task on behalf of the credit union.  The regulations will cover matters like the qualifications and experience of personnel generally engaged in the provision of the services on behalf of credit unions.</P>
      <P>Section 79 provides for an investigation and complaints procedure.  The regulations will be drawn up in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who has statutory responsibility for matters dealing with credit unions.  We will ensure there is the maximum protection, even if it involves including in the regulations that only a qualified solicitor will be engaged by a credit union to do this work.  I am not sure if this will be in the regulations; it may be possible to provide protection short of doing this.  We will ensure an absolutely level playing pitch with regard to complaints, people who have been defrauded, people who are suffering as a result of negligence, the Ombudsman and so on.  We will put credit unions who do this specific, restricted type of work on the same level as solicitors who do this work. Unless regulations can be drawn to give the recipient of the service the very same protection as if he or she had gone to a solicitor, we will not proceed; but I think it is possible to do this by regulations if they are properly drawn.</P>

      <P>Credit unions are normally established and run for the benefit of their members, who are usually middle and low income earners and <Col N="624" /> not particularly wealthy.  My understanding is that each branch must be self-regulatory and pay its way.  I am concerned that unless a credit union has taken out a good insurance policy, it would be very serious for it to take out a grant of probate or an administration. If an error was made this could result in a negligence action against that credit union for, perhaps, £0.25 million.  A house, cars, some investments or a farm worth £250,000 or £300,000 could be involved.  If something went wrong in such an administration it would be essential to have a level playing pitch. This was mentioned by the Minister.  I am concerned that many members of credit unions who have amassed small humble savings, but which are of immense importance to them, will suddenly feel that if something goes wrong or an error is made, everything they have in the line of physical possessions will be in danger of being interfered with or lost.  This is unlikely but we should reassure people with considerable investments.  The number of credit union accounts is vast.</P>

However, the regulations must ensure that there is a system in whatever branch people go to, whether it is in Offaly, Limerick, Donegal or Dublin, so that they will be fully protected if anything goes wrong. Otherwise, we will not put it into operation. We are satisfied that we can and that is why we are giving ourselves the power to draw up these regulations.  The Senator can rest assured that the regulations will not be introduced until they are drawn in such a way so as to ensure that the client will be as protected as if he had gone to a solicitor.</P>

However, many villages and smaller towns do not have permanent staff.  They work on a part-time basis and when they finish their work they go home after doing their civic duty to the public.

      <P>This was one of the first Bills to go to special committee.  I do not know how many years it has taken to put this Bill on the Statute Book, but a lot of work has gone into the planning of this Bill.  I pay tribute to the special committee and the work of the Members of the Dáil.  They worked hard to get this Bill together over a long period of time.  I often criticise rather than praise Ministers, but the Minister has acted with considerable expertise and he presented this Bill in a competent and efficient manner.  People from all <Col N="626" /> sides of the House appreciate the work he has put into it.  It is excellent legislation and I hope it will be a landmark as regards improving the services provided by the legal profession on behalf of clients throughout the country.  I thank all the members of the Government parties, our party and other parties for their help and co-operation.  I also thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>I am glad we have come to the end of this legislation. As Senator Enright rightly said, there have been a number of Solicitors Bills over the years, but they were either dropped for one reason or another, or they were not revived after the Dáil fell. This legislation has been around for several years and we are glad it has gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas. I thank Senator Enright for his kind remarks, which are deeply appreciated. I also thank my colleagues on all sides in the Dáil and the Senators for their enlightened contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accepted substantial amendments to the Bill as originally drafted.  Although my advisers in the Department of Justice are excellent, they do not have a monopoly on wisdom.  That is why we have debates.  If an argument is well presented and I see the need for change. I will accept it if it is correct, regardless of which side of the House it comes from.  The final shape of the Bill reflects that.  I thank the Senators for the expeditious and intelligent way they have dealt with this Bill today.  It is now ready to go to the President.  From what I gather from my officials who have spoken to the Law Society, members of the profession and the public, this legislation <Col N="627" /> is badly needed.  I hope it will have the desired effect.</P>

      <P>The uncertainty surrounding the proposed peat fired electricity generating plant in the midlands is a matter of grave concern to all the people of that area.  That is why I am pressing the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to tell the people where exactly this proposal now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be recalled that the proposed peat fired station was the only major project for the midlands proposed by the Government in the context of the National Development Plan.  It would provide jobs in the station itself and in Bord na Móna, thereby benefiting the entire area.  The uncertainty about whether this project will actually go ahead comes against a background of a loss of approximately 3,000 jobs, both in <Col N="628" /> the ESB and Bord na Móna, in the midlands region over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>The midlands, including the counties of Laois/Offaly and west Kildare in particular, is one of the country's worst unemployment blackspots.  The region has been devastated in terms of job losses over the past decade.  It is understandable, therefore, that the people greeted the proposed peat fired project with great enthusiasm, only to have it dashed, at least temporarily, by the new threat that the project is now in doubt and that an independent appraisal has to be completed before EU funding for it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I understand that consultants have been appointed to carry out an appraisal of this project.  I want the Minister to tell the House today what is the latest news on this study, whether it is been completed and what are its findings.  It is unfair that the people of the midlands should be left in a state of uncertainty about the economic welfare of the area. We already know that there are up to 3,000 other ESB jobs under threat by that company's rationalisation programme. The concentration of generating stations in the midlands could lead to a large number of job losses there and is a cause of great anxiety for the people.</P>
    <P>Because of that I feel it is vital that the midlands region secures a major flagship project such as the peat fired generating station.  That is why the people there are entitled to know from the Minister, who also represents the area, what exactly is going on.  At present, for young people leaving school there is little hope of finding employment in the midland counties.  They too, as well as their families, are watching the present uncertain situation with great apprehension.</P>
    <P>Besides telling us where the consultancy study of the peat fired project now stands, I want the Minister to also give clear assurances to the people of the midlands that in the event of EU <Col N="629" /> funding not being advanced, that, in line with his former commitment, he will spell out clearly what the Government will do to ensure that the station is built and that the people of the midlands will get their fair share of the national economic cake.</P>
    <P>This is the heart of a balanced and coherent regional development plan for this country.  We cannot tolerate a situation where the fruits of economic growth and development end up enjoyed wholly disproportionately by the people of one particular region.  It is the responsibility of the Government of the day to ensure a balanced regional development programme.  In that context I am insisting that the people of the midlands get their fair share.  I am calling on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to ensure that the present Fianna Fáil/Labour Partnership Government deliver on that entitlement to the people and communities of Laois/Offaly and west Kildare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Honan for sharing her time with me and I support what she has said.  I also welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the critical situation facing the traditional peatland communities in the midlands and in particular to what has happened in my area of west Kildare. Over the past seven years some 2,600 jobs have been lost in west Kildare and north-east Offaly.  That is a much more serious haemorrhage than some of the highly publicised company closures that have happened elsewhere and it appears to have attracted little media attention. Most recently there was the closure of Bord na Móna's Lullymore briquette factory and the ESB's power station at Allenwood.  Apart from the jobs themselves, there is a huge knock-on effect on the local economy, which traditionally has been so dependent on the bogs. I am sure that both the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications <Col N="630" /> and the Minister of State will be only too well aware of that fact.  The very survival of some of these peatland communities is now in question.</P>
    <P>An immediate concern is the future of the remaining workforce at the Ballydermot Bord na Móna works outside Rathangan.  Employment there has shrunk from 250 people at peak times to just over 60 people.  I would like the Minister to give me an assurance about the future of the works, its status and its staff there.  The most positive assurance would be for the Minister to announce when work will commence on the proposed peat fired generating station, as outlined in the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>Since there will be a three year leadin period before the plant is completed and commissioned, this matter is urgent. We have had repeated forecasts from the Minister and his Government colleagues in the press and on local radio, most notably during the European election, that the power station would be built.  Hopes have been raised in the hard pressed communities of the area. The Minister now needs to deliver on the promises.  What has been done to convince the European Union and the Commission of the merits of this proposal, where does it stand at the moment and when will the station be built?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to the contributions of both Senators.  I am glad of the opportunity to inform this House of the latest position in relation to the proposal to construct a new 120 megawatt peat fired power station in the east midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dáil on 11 October I informed another midlands colleague of the Senator of the <i>de facto</i> situation.  I wish to confirm that this evening and to say there is no uncertainty whatever pertaining <Col N="631" /> to this project.  I can understand that a party like the Progressive Democrats being uncertain about the matter, but I cannot understand why it cannot accept the categoric assurances given by both the Minister and myself on a number of occasions.  We have a National Development Plan which will come into force on 1 January.  It has been underpinned by European funding.  If we push projects too hard, we are told that we are politically interfering; but if we allow them to come through the system, then there is uncertainty about them. We cannot have it both ways; we must accept the <i>de facto</i> situation.</P>
    <P>First, let me briefly outline the key objectives of Irish energy policy and describe how peat forms an integral part of this policy.  Irish energy policy incorporates three main objectives: the supply of a choice of fuels as efficiently as possible, at internationally competitive prices, taking account of supply security, socio-economic and environmental considerations; the consumption of this energy as efficiently as possible; and the production of as much as is economically possible of national energy requirements from indigenous sources.</P>
    <P>The use of peat for power generation fits into this policy on all fronts.  First, in the absence of a new discovery of natural gas reserves, peat will be Ireland's only significant source of indigenous energy.  Secondly, the role of peat in providing a secure source of energy will consequently become more vital, even though its contribution to our overall energy needs will remain relatively small.  Finally, by using the latest technology and taking advantage of the most modern and efficient methods available for harvesting, peat will be a competitive source of energy when compared with other fuels for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Ireland has extensive peat resources but only about 8 per cent are developed for productive purposes.  Most of this <Col N="632" /> development is carried out by Bord na Móna and much of their activity is concentrated on the production of milled peat for electricity generation.</P>
    <P>Peat is a major national energy resource and it would be negligent not to continue to harness it for the benefit of the nation, particularly in the light of the enormous advances in efficiencies which can now be achieved from modern peat burning plant.</P>
    <P>When the existing peat stations were commissioned in the 1950s and 1960s they had efficiencies comparable with the alternatives then available and their development had wider benefits in terms of supply security, employment and infrastructural support in our rural areas.  These wider benefits remain as valid today as they were 30 years ago and as efficiencies have advanced, there is a continuing incentive to invest in modern peat burning technology.</P>
    <P>Against this background and in order to utilise peat resources that would otherwise not be used to full advantage, Bord na Móna prepared a feasibility study for the construction of a new station.  The study demonstrated the economic feasibility of the project and the Government has demonstrated its support for the peat industry by including the project in the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>The main features of the proposed station will be: a fuel requirement of one million tonnes of peat per annum. An improved conversion efficiency of 36.7 per cent compared to the average of 25.5 per cent in the existing peat stations.  The direct employment on a permanent basis of approximately 90 people in the new station.  The employment of 450 people at peak during construction involving over 700 man years in total, with bog preparation work creating a further 1,120 man years employment.  The support of 250 permanent and 250 seasonal jobs in peat extraction when fully operational.  There will be a direct income impact of £19 <Col N="633" /> million during operations, the vast bulk of which will accrue to the local economy.</P>
    <P>As part of its consideration of our application for Structural Fund assistance, the EU Commission, as is normal for major projects of this kind, requested that an independent socioeconomic cost benefit analysis be carried out.  That study has now been completed. The proposal has, I believe, been demonstrated to be economic.  We are expecting final confirmation of European Union funding in the near future and the project will proceed as planned. The House can be assured that Minister Brian Cowen is totally and absolutely committed to this excellent project which is of vital importance to Counties Offaly, Laois and Kildare, and indeed the midlands in general.</P>
    <P>As regards the request from Senator Dardis pertaining to the Rathangan works, I had no knowledge of that question. If he is prepared to let me have the full details by letter I will be only too delighted to extract the full information for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply indebted to you, a Chathaoirligh, for affording me the opportunity, two evenings running, of raising a matter on the Adjournment.  I welcome the Minister and appreciate the fact that he has come straight from the Dáil, where he was answering questions, to respond to this important matter.  It is a matter of mutual interest to us both because I am in County Clare and the Minister is in North Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with the quality of water in Lough Derg, one of the largest lakes in the Republic, which is a major national resource both as a source of <Col N="634" /> public water supply as well as for tourism, recreational and leisure purposes. The importance of Lough Derg nationally and to County Clare in particular cannot be overestimated.  Unfortunately, in recent years, and particularly over the past 12 years, the quality of water in Lough Derg has deteriorated.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that a water quality report was undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Teagasc to establish exactly what the causes were as well as to try to arrest the situation and improve the current position.  I am delighted that that report has been published and that specific recommendations have been made which local authorities in the area are proceeding to adopt.  Clare County Council has adopted the main thrust of the report and has basically accepted its guidelines.  As a result of that we hope to arrest the situation and improve the quality of water in Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that all is not dead in Lough Derg.  I would not like it to emanate from here or anywhere else that there is a crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a crisis but it is manageable and that is important.  Lough Derg is a magnificent facility, given that high water quality is a factor in increasing demand.  For tourism purposes it is important that we improve the existing quality of our water supplies and that is why I have raised this issue here.  To improve the quality of Lough Derg we need the support of the Minister, the Government and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that a submission has been made to his Department recently by Clare County Council. In Clare we acknowledge that quite a lot of the pollution in Lough Derg occurs upstream outside the area under <Col N="635" /> our own immediate control.  Nevertheless, in our area we have responsibilities and Clare County Council is a contributor to the pollution of Lough Derg.  An area of particular concern to the local authority is Killaloe, a town which requires a proper sewerage scheme. Proposals have been put to the Department of the Environment for £1.997 million for this scheme which is No. 2 in band 1 of our priority list in County Clare.  We are anxious that consideration should be given to that.</P>
    <P>Another important area is ScariffTuamgraney, where there are great difficulties. A submission has been made to the Department for grant aid for a scheme there, in addition to Whitegate where a small amount of money &mdash; about £100,000 &mdash; is required.  You may ask why we are so concerned about this. You can appreciate that in Clare the local authority has statutory responsibilities to impose environmental legislation on those who are breaking environmental laws by creating pollution. Clare County Council cannot do this with credibility if it is a major contributor to pollution itself.</P>
    <P>This is the case with many other local authorities throughout the country.  Much of the pollution occurring in waterways emanates from the municipal discharges of various towns and villages under local authority jurisdiction.  However, in order to be in a position to enforce the laws one should not be an offender.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look seriously at the situation of Lough Derg, but the wider scale of pollution emanating from the industrial sector is another area that needs to be addressed.  Negotiations must be conducted between the Minister's Department and the various industries involved which have been identified in the report as major polluters of Lough Derg.  Equally, difficulties are arising with Bord na Móna in relation to the necessity to contain peat <Col N="636" /> discharges.  All these factors must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem from the agricultural sector.  The report shows that there is an overuse of fertilisers resulting in fertilisers entering the water and creating root growth on the bed of the lake as well as algae growth, which is causing the difficulty.  It is a monumental task to address.  I believe, however, that it is manageable.  I urge the Minister to deal with the aspects concerning County Clare.</P>
    <P>A very definite submission was made by Clare County Council to the Minister for the Environment dealing with Killaloe, Scariff and Whitegate on Lough Derg.  It is important to address this issue.  The Shannon Task Force issued a report recently.  This is not within the Minister's ambit.  However, they recommended a large scale activity holiday centre on the shores of Lough Derg. This is to be based on the centre parks model in the UK and would cater for up to 1,000 overseas visitors providing self-catering accommodation and a wide range of activities.  There would also be an indoor element with an all weather attraction.</P>
    <P>Lough Derg is a magnificent area surrounded by beautiful scenery and with much potential.  The bottom line is job creation and keeping people in their respective areas by providing employment for them at home.  We need to do that more often because there is a job crisis in this country.  Everything we do should be with a view to creating more employment.  This is an opportunity to create more employment in tourism with a wide range of projects.  If the Minister adopts the right strategy and co-operates with the local authorities involved, particularly Clare County Council, this can go from strength to strength and we will see improvements coming on stream very quickly.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for attending this evening.  I know he is very busy and I appreciate his attendance.  I also thank <Col N="637" /> you, a Chathaoirligh, for again allowing me the opportunity to raise a matter on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I liked the sensitivity of Senator Taylor-Quinn's contribution. There are unfortunate aspects to some of the publicity attaching to Lough Derg.  Emotive terms such as &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; and &ldquo;dead&rdquo; are used.  These are not only untrue but do enormous damage to the investment which has been and will continue to be made in tourism and other developments in that beautiful part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>We will not go into the history.  The report, as the Senator said, demonstrated that the lake itself was highly trophic.  The main concentration of problems related to agriculture and the lack of final treatment of sewage as well as a mixture of industry detergent, peat silt and a lack of pump out and other facilities for cruisers.  Each one of those has to be attacked in turn.</P>
      <P>We have spent in the region of £20 million in the last couple of years in Ballina, Athlone and Castletroy.  We now have to intensify that programme in the light of this information.  A range of areas will be covered in south Offaly, north Tipperary, Westmeath and back down to the Clare border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this proposal the two mentioned in Clare are Scariff and Killaloe. This forms an integrated proposal. <Col N="638" /> It is not possible to pick out one because there are strict criteria for drawing down Cohesion Funds which I have to meet by combining a number of considerations. I am anxious to ensure that those two schemes proceed in tandem with the work on the total Lough Derg catchment area.  The Senator also mentioned Whitegate.  This is quite a small scheme which will probably have to be carried out in the context of village renewal.  I will examine it.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the problem, the Department of Agriculture has introduced the rural environment protection scheme.  It is hoped that farmers will participate and help deal with the reduction of fertiliser use, management of waste, spreading of slurry and other contentious issues which create problems for the environment at particular times of the year.  A new scheme for the control of farmyard pollution is being introduced and is specifically designed to help smaller farmers who were unable to avail of the previous schemes.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing negotiations with industry on non-phosphate detergents. From a standing start in 1988, the detergent market now has a 40 per cent non-phosphate content and we have to keep building on that.  There are a number of areas along the Shannon which have pump out facilities but they are still needed in Portumna and other places. This will be done in tandem with the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis there is a united community around the lake comprised of people who have invested in hotels and self catering facilities, to which the Senator referred, and in cruisers.  Public funds have also been devoted to the enhancement of that facility as it links with the Ballyconnell canal and the Erne catchment.  That is one side of the equation.</P>
    <P>There is an all out attempt in terms of resources at both domestic and EU level to make sure that we come to grips with a problem we have inherited.  This <Col N="639" /> problem will not be solved overnight, but the public can be confident that it is being addressed in a comprehensive and successful way.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that in dealing with such an emotive question Senator Taylor-Quinn was conscious of the detrimental effect some of the publicity which attached to this lake has had.  We can say that we have a rescue plan and that we are working on it.  It would be different if these attacks were being made in circumstances where one did not have solutions or one was not prepared to listen.</P>
    <P>While it may be a long haul, we will see not only an improvement in the quality of the water in the lake but an ultimate solution to the problem with the co-operation of everybody concerned. The provision of these facilities will deal with water quality problems and contribute to a better understanding <Col N="640" /> of the environment in the agri-sector. Places such as Killaloe, Scariff and Whitegate while availing of these schemes can also develop in their own right.  The scheme does not only deal with water quality.  It also allows for other developments, including hotels and other facilities which would be restricted under the current planning codes.</P>
