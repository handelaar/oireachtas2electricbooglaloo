      <P>A number of Senators have indicated that they wish to make a reference to the sad events in Galway and Clare over the last week.  I must remind the House that there is a real possibility of serious criminal charges being brought.  Under the rules of the House there is an onus on Members to avoid comment which might prejudice the outcome of proceedings.  Accordingly, Members should exercise discretion in their contributions and, if possible, should avoid making reference to persons outside the House by name or so as to be identifiable.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1, the Referendum Bill, 1994. With the agreement of the House, we hope to deal with all stages between now and 6 p.m.  Item 40 will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to your words at the outset, a Chathaoirligh, I will simply join in the vote of sympathy because words cannot express the shock, horror and sadness we all feel about what has happened.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, could the Leader of the House in the next couple of weeks &mdash; and certainly before the European elections &mdash; give us an opportunity to debate events in Europe and the European Union, especially the question of enlargement?  Also, could he give us more definite information about the possibility of a debate on developments in Northern Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the relatives, friends and colleagues of Imelda and Liam Riney and Fr. Joe Walsh on the tragedy in east Clare and south Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the vote of sympathy.  It is important that an inquiry be held as soon as possible in view of the public disquiet following these sad events.  It should be conveyed to the Minister for Justice from this House that the most important issue in Ireland today is the need to reopen rural Garda stations which would be manned on a full-time basis.  It is only in those circumstances that the gardaí can know what is happening in their areas.  I am sure if that were to happen, the commission of many such crimes would be prevented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was shocked and horrified yesterday to hear that the opening of a factory in Kilkenny which was to provide between 460 and 700 jobs will not go ahead.  I believe the IDA went as far as is possible to accommodate the group concerned.  I agree that the Minister <Col N="731" /> for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and the Government went as far as they could to get this company. The fact that a foreign company made agreements with Ireland, through the IDA and the Government, and then decided to up the ante signals the need for a major debate in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on our attitude to attracting foreign companies.  It is obvious that blackmail was used in this instance and it was also decided to up the ante.  It would not have been possible to provide one sustainable job if we had gone along with ask the Leader of this American company.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister the need for an urgent debate on this matter.  It is obvious that jobs are needed in this country more than anywhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Tomorrow we will have a debate on South Africa which will be, in a sense, confined to events to date.  We must, however, take account of what has been happening in Rwanda.  I was glad to hear John O'Shea of Goal say this morning that conditions in the camps outside Rwanda were reasonably well organised and that the United Nations went in. <Col N="732" /> However, we must have an urgent debate on the role of the United Nations which deals with Rwanda and other current conflicts.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the families of the victims in Clare and Galway over the weekend.  In deference to what you said at the beginning, a Chathaoirligh, I will not elaborate on that.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come into the House and make a statement on the treatment, by the VHI, of women who contracted hepatitis C through the anti-D virus.  The Minister set up a group in his Department to examine the matter but it needs urgent action and we cannot have any further delays.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I also wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the people of north-east Clare and south-east Galway.  I live quite near and, while such deaths would be horrific anywhere in the country, the fact that they occurred in such a beautiful place, with such friendly and open people, was particularly horrific and shocking.  In deference to what you said, a Chathaoirligh, I will finish on that.</P>

      <P>In view of the Law Reform Commission's report which confirms that the approach taken by Fine Gael is correct, I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to introduce a Bill similar to the Fine Gael Bill which was voted down last week.  There should be no delay in drawing up this legislation.  The details are there and the Bill should be introduced forthwith.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the future of education in rural areas.  There is an ever increasing budget for education and small rural schools in Ireland are under threat.  We would like the Minister for Education to come into the House so that we can ask her about her future plans. Will rationalisation be the norm?  Will the future of education in rural areas be totally based on the economics of that service?  This is an important issue, particularly for rural Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week a prominent Irish MEP suggested that the neutrality of three of the four new members could be a problem in the context of European Union.  Over the weekend it was suggested that Ireland should be a full member of the Western European Union.  There are issues to be debated and I have suggested on several <Col N="734" /> occasions that we need a full debate in this House on the European Union Treaty, specifically on the common foreign and security policy.  I ask the Leader of the House to organise this.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible for the House to discuss the Dublin Transport Initiative at an early stage?  The DTI has gone seriously off the rails and political prompting from this House would help to redirect its thinking.  In my view, the DTI is now more interested in feather-bedding an inefficient State enterprise than creating what we would all wish for, a fully integrated transport system for the greater Dublin area, including north Wicklow.  I ask that the DTI be discussed at an early stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in expressing sympathy to the families of the bereaved and to the people of County Clare.  It was an unusually horrible occurrence, particularly taking into account the youth and vitality of the people concerned, a young mother and her child and an apparently vital young priest who was contributing very strongly to his local community.  I was most taken with the words of Bishop Kirby when he said that this young man represented the wonderful energy and talent of so many young members of the clergy in this country. Although I do not always support Vatican policy on every issue, I echo those sentiments; many people will feel a great deal of good work is done there.</P>
      <P>I was also particularly pleased that there was a bishop from the Church of Ireland among the six bishops at the Mass.  The entire community is diminished by the deaths of these three young people.  I hope this matter will be brought to a speedy and satisfactory resolution. When that has happened, perhaps we could arrange to have a full debate on rural policing.  This is not the time to take a particular position but, echoing Senator Sherlock, it would be useful after the matter is closed for this House to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to be a little more contentious, as it is my nature.  My colleague Senator Quinn said last week that we have to earn <Col N="735" /> the respect of the Government.  I had some qualms about that but the list of ministerial pensions in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> does not do politics or the image of politics a great deal of good. Perhaps the Leader could arrange a debate on the question of people receiving ministerial pensions while they are still serving in the House.  I do not begrudge them a pension, I will be looking for one myself, but I do not think it is appropriate, while somebody is still employed, to receive a pension as if they had retired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the people in Clare.  It was a great tragedy, one of the worst to hit this country.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice on the way she handled such a sensitive issue; I thank her for setting up an inquiry to allay the fears of many people.</P>
      <P>I would also like to propose a vote of congratulations and good wishes to our popular Minister for Health and wish him a happy birthday; bliain sona sásta an bliain seo chugainn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose a vote of congratulations to Nelson Mandela on becoming President of South Africa on this historic occasion.</P>
      <P>Two months ago I raised a matter on the Adjournment about upgrading a national secondary road to national primary status.  You gave a ruling on it and said it could not be put before the House because the Minister for the Environment had set up a National Roads Authority to which he has handed over responsibility for the funding of national primary and secondary routes.  However, I find in the <i>Western People</i> of 27 April 1994 a report that &ldquo;secondary roads serving Ballina and Westport were to be upgraded to national primary status, the Minister for the Environment, Mr. Michael Smith, has announced&rdquo;.  The Minister made the announcement when he met a deputation from the North Mayo roads action group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want the Leader of the House to clarify the position in relation to what the Minister said about the National Roads Authority.  He stated that he will not receive notices from this House; yet he met a deputation from a roads action group but would not come before this House.  It is disgraceful for the Minister to treat this House in that manner.</P>

      <P>I want to take up a point made earlier about schools and to point out that, at least, this Minister did reverse the previous trend in not closing small schools.</P>

We are entering <Col N="737" /> into the five most crucial years of the European Union during which we will see the implementation of the Social Charter and many other issues affecting this country. After enlargement, we may become net contributors to the Union; this is the time we need to benefit most from it.  I am also concerned by the severe lack of investment in ships fishing off the Donegal and Galway coasts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  Sadly, the situation there appears to be back in the depressing mould of last year.  We should send our sympathy to the family of the woman in Northern Ireland who was murdered in her sittingroom last week.  There are few more horrific things one can imagine happening to one in old age than being shot dead in one's sittingroom.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Honan asking the Minister for Health to keep us up to date on the situation regarding the anti-D immunoglobin and hepatitis C. Senator Honan and I have given the Minister a great deal of support in dealing with this problem.  Both of us have also received many queries and we would be grateful if the Leader of the House would ask the Minister to keep this House informed on this serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last week, we will endeavour to have a debate on the enlargement of the European Union between now and the end of this term. That debate will include discussion on other issues, such as neutrality, which <Col N="738" /> were raised today.  Senator Henry is correct when she says we should condemn what is happening in Northern Ireland. Although we may not voice our condemnation of the violence when we meet every week, our feelings on the issue are clear.  We reject and condemn the daily violence in Northern Ireland.  We debated the situation in Northern Ireland on a number of occasions last term and I am confident that we will have another opportunity to do so between now and the summer recess.</P>
      <P>We all regret the fact that a multinational has decided not to invest in Ireland.  Senator Lanigan correctly raised this issue and its implications.  The legislation for the rationalisation of the IDA was discussed in this House and I am sure the Whips will agree on a debate on the promotion of our country for both multinational and local investment.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues raised can be discussed at other times, for example, during Adjournment debates and Private Members' Business.  Senator Honan and Senator Henry mentioned the Minister for Health.  He has visited the House many times and I am sure we will be brought up to date on this very important issue.  The Senators rightly asked for a progress report and we will arrange that.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville's query regarding landowners will be discussed in the House before the summer recess.  This House has had many debates on education and the special debate requested by Senator McGowan will also take place.  The DTI can be dealt with during Private Members' Business.  The Order of Business is not the forum to celebrate the birthday lists which appear at the weekend.</P>

    <Title>Referendum Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford)</i>: This Bill represents a further step <Col N="739" /> in the programme of reform of electoral law which commenced with the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1992, and was followed by the enactment of the Presidential Elections Act in 1993.  The objective of the programme of reform is to update each branch of electoral law and to provide for uniformity of practice between the different codes as far as practicable.</P>
      <P>Existing law in relation to the taking of a referendum is contained in eight enactments, the principal of these being the Referendum Act, 1942.  The 1942 Act was enacted in order to provide a statutory basis for the holding of referenda, as envisaged in the Constitution.  The first referendum on a proposal to amend the Constitution was held in 1959 and a further 15 have been held in the period since 1959.</P>
      <P>It can be seen that the referendum code is an important element in our electoral law and the trend in the past quarter of a century has been towards relatively frequent recourse to the referendum mechanism.  In this context it is essential that all aspects of the law relating to the conduct of a referendum are maintained in an up-to-date condition, having regard to the benefit of the experience of operating the system in practice.  It is also desirable that referendum law be kept in line with corresponding provisions of other branches of electoral law.</P>
      <P>A similar approach has been adopted in the case of this Bill as was followed in the case of the Presidential Elections Act, 1993.  The provisions of the Electoral Act, 1992, relating to Dáil elections which are common to polls generally are applied with the necessary modifications. These provisions relate, for example, to postal and special voting, polling on islands, procedures in polling stations as well as arrangements for counting the votes and electoral offences.  The provisions will as far as practicable be identical for all elections and referenda.  In this way procedural discrepancies that have developed between different codes over the years will be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> The Bill introduces a number of worthwhile improvements to aspects of referendum law where omissions and deficiencies have been identified in the course of the operation of existing law over the years.  For example, under existing law a recount of votes at a referendum may be demanded in individual constituencies but there is no provision for a complete recount of all the votes cast.  At a referendum voting might appear clear cut in individual constituencies but the overall vote, when aggregated, could be quite close.  In that situation the only recourse for a person wishing to question the accuracy of the count is by means of a referendum petition to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses this and includes a provision to enable the referendum returning officer to order a complete reexamination and recount of the votes cast in every constituency, if he or she considers it necessary.  This procedure will be in addition to the existing right of any agent present at the count in an individual constituency to demand a recount of the votes in that constituency.  The new provision could be an important mechanism to remove doubt in the case of a close result in certain circumstances and could obviate the necessity for a referendum petition with its associated delay, inconvenience and expense.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeats the requirement in existing law that the proposal which is the subject of the referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing the Bill containing the proposal, using the short title.  The Bill will, however, enable the Minister for the Environment to provide, by order, for the entry on the ballot paper of a descriptive heading to indicate the subject matter of the proposal.</P>
    <P>Where the polls at two or more referenda are taken on the same day this arrangement would assist electors in distinguishing between the separate ballot papers which would otherwise look rather similar.  Descriptive headings were included on referendum ballot papers in 1978 and again in 1992 when a number of referenda were taken on the same polling day.  On each occasion special legislation was enacted to provide for <Col N="741" /> the inclusion of headings on the ballot papers.</P>
    <P>An order providing for headings on ballot papers, pursuant to this Bill, will require approval in draft by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is envisaged that an order would be considered only when two or more referenda are being taken together.  This provision is in addition to the requirement in existing law that different coloured ballot papers must be used where two or more polls are taken on the same day.</P>
    <P>Under existing referendum law an elector unable to vote at his or her normal polling station because of employment by the local returning officer may be authorised to vote at another polling station in the same constituency.  The provision restricting the exercise of this facility to the constituency for which the elector is registered is being removed.  In future it will be possible to authorise an elector employed by a local returning officer to vote in the constituency in which he or she is so employed.  This will bring the referendum law into line with the Presidential Elections Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The law in relation to the questioning of a referendum by means of petition is being tightened up.  Under existing law leave of the High Court to present a petition must be sought within ten days of the publication of the provisional result; under the Bill this is reduced to seven days.  The period allowed in the Bill for the presentation of a petition after the grant of leave by the High Court is three days; under existing law a petition may be presented within 21 days of publication of the provisional result.  The objective of these changes is to provide adequate opportunity for challenging the result of a referendum while, at the same time, ensuring that the coming into force of a constitutional change, which may be urgent, is not unduly delayed.</P>
    <P>The Bill also effects a number of changes which, while minor in themselves, together constitute worthwhile improvement in referendum law.  An example of the kind of change involved is that the consent of the Minister will no longer be required for the appointment of a deputy <Col N="742" /> local returning officer or for the selection of a counting centre which is outside the constituency concerned.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Constitution provides for two types of referendum. Article 46 provides that every proposal for an amendment to the Constitution, having been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, shall be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people.</P>
    <P>Article 27 provides for the reference of a Bill, other than a Constitution amendment Bill, to the people by referendum. This is referred to as an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; referendum, although in practice such an event would be out of the ordinary and no such referendum has yet taken place.  Under that Article, a majority of the Members of the Seanad and not less than one-third of the Members of the Dáil may jointly petition the President to decline to sign and promulgate as law any Bill which is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on the grounds that it contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people on the Bill ought to be ascertained.  The President may, after consultation with the Council of State, decline to sign the Bill unless and until the proposal has been approved by the people at a referendum or by a resolution of the Dáil following a general election.  The Constitution confers a pivotal function on the Seanad in this regard.</P>
    <P>No so-called &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; referendum has been held since the enactment of the Constitution and the likelihood of the circumstances contemplated in Article 27 occuring appears rather remote.  Nonetheless, it is considered appropriate that the procedures in the present Bill should apply to &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; as well as constitutional referenda.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, this Bill represents a further stage in the continuing programme of electoral law reform.  It is essentially a consolidating and updating measure with the opportunity being taken to effect desirable amendments and, as far as practicable, to bring procedures in the case of each category of poll into line with one another.  I consider <Col N="743" /> the Bill to be a worthwhile contribution to the wider process of making the law generally more relevant and more accessible not just for practitioners but for the ordinary citizen.  I hope the House will facilitate its swift enactment into law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House today provides a comprehensive mechanism for conducting a referendum.  It provides for different stages in a referendum, including the appointment of polling day, the taking of the poll, the counting of votes and the possibility of a petition being made to question the result of the referendum.  The legislation replaces the Referendum Act, 1942, and it deals with constitutional referenda as well as those held in pursuant of Article 27 of the Constitution, which is termed an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; referendum.  This Article applies to a Bill other than a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution. As the Minister said, under Article 27 it is often forgotten that the Seanad has a special responsibility in this matter.</P>
      <P>A majority of Members of the Seanad and not less than one third of the Members of the Dáil may jointly petition the President to decline to sign and promulgate as law any Bill before it is referred to the people for judgement.  The Minister also said that under Article 27 an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; referendum has not taken place since the establishment of the Constitution in 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People often ask if we need a new Constitution.  The structures created under the present Constitution, the Parliament, the Executive and the courts, have served us well and have given us no reason to look for change.  The Constitution requires amendments from time to time.  It is right and proper to have legislation in place before putting such amendments to a referendum.  That is the measure before the House today.  Those who talk about replacing the Constitution often do so on the grounds that it does not conform to their ideology.  They should remember they need to persuade not only a debating society but the people <Col N="744" /> because the people's consent to change must be forthcoming before we replace the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of measures in the Bill.  Under existing law a recount of votes may be demanded in an individual constituency but there is no provision for a recount of all votes cast and, as the Minister said, this might be necessary in a tightly contested referendum.  The Bill addresses this point and includes a provision to enable a referendum returning officer to order a complete re-examination and recount of all votes cast in every constituency, if he consider it to be necessary.  The Bill also provides for the entry on the ballot paper of a descriptive heading to indicate the subject matter of the proposed referendum.</P>
    <P>There has been a problem with recent referenda in that a certain amount of confusion has arisen.  In some cases the electorate was so confused it did not know for what it was voting, while in other cases it did not vote at all.  I hope information on future ballot papers will be simple and uncomplicated so that the public will understand what it is voting for or against.  Reading the Bill, I was struck by the fact that grounds for a referendum petition are limited.  It would appear they are limited to electoral offences, such as the obstruction of the referendum, failure to conduct a referendum in accordance with the Bill or a mistake or an irregularity likely to affect the result of the referendum.  If the information &mdash; and this is unlikely &mdash; in the descriptive heading on the ballot paper was misleading, it should be included as grounds for petitioning a referendum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the transfer of votes.  A person employed by a local returning officer may be authorised to vote at a polling station other than that at which he or she is employed, even if it is outside his or her constituency.  I hope people who work at polling stations will be made aware of this so they may use their franchise.</P>
    <P>As regards the entitlement of people to vote in referenda, I welcome the proposal for postal votes for the handicapped as in general elections.  This postal vote also <Col N="745" /> extends to the Army, the Garda Síochána, Army personnel serving abroad and the Diplomatic Corps.  We may ask why this does this not extend to Irish citizens living abroad.  Recently arguments have been made about votes for emigrants.  I understand and accept there are difficulties in relation to this in view of the fact that the Constitution states that seats must be apportioned in accordance with population.  This requirement does not hold for referenda.</P>
    <P>An Irish citizen working abroad for a temporary period or a student studying abroad &mdash; my son has been studying international relations at Kent University for the past four years and he takes an interest in Irish affairs &mdash; is required, under Article 9 of the Constitution, to show fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.  If an amendment is being made to the Constitution in his or her absence, he or she should have the opportunity to express his or her view.  Difficulties relating to general elections and local elections for those living abroad do not relate to referenda.  A mechanism should be in place to enable Irish citizens living abroad to vote.</P>
    <P>Constitutional lawyers will say the Constitution is the people's document and it does relate to this or the other House.  When we amend the Constitution, all citizens, whether living here or abroad, should be given the opportunity to express their view on these matters. The purpose of the Bill before the House is to amend and consolidate the law relating to the taking of a referendum. I welcome the updating of the law on this matter and I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill to the House.  This is the third occasion in two years this Minister has been in the House to present a reform package of electoral law.  We should update our electoral Acts.  This is a continuation of the process started in 1992. We are talking about reform of the Acts which cover referenda and it is appropriate that it would be brought into line with electoral law dealt with in the Electoral <Col N="746" /> Act, 1992, and the Presidential Election Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>The changes that are proposed here are welcome.  To some extent they are necessary but we should consider them in the context that we are one of the few countries in Europe that has a written Constitution.  That in itself gives an opportunity and a responsibility to the people to have their say in matters pertinent to them.  That became apparent when we dealt with the Maastricht Treaty and the reform of the Treaty of Rome. We were one of the few countries in the 12 member states of the European Union whose people had the opportunity to make a decision whether to accept the amended Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>We are privileged to have that opportunity and it goes back to our forefathers and the founders of this State.  They thought it appropriate that we should have a written Constitution.  Many other democracies in Europe which do not have such a written Constitution are at a loss because they are not given the same opportunity that is presented to the Irish people.  The Irish people take referenda very seriously and their response must give encouragement to legislators when it comes to amending the Constitution.</P>
      <P>There are a number of welcome provisions in this Bill.  It is appropriate that this Bill does not deny a person working in a polling station the right to vote, irrespective of whether they are working in their own constituency and that is right and proper.</P>
      <P>The opportunity for a total recount needed to be addressed and it is addressed in this Bill.  While there was provision for a returning officer to have a recount in a constituency, there was no opportunity for an overall recount other than through the High Court.  That has now been remedied. This is an important step because it eliminates any question later that the result of a referendum may not have been free and fair.  The opportunity is there now for a recount of the overall result. That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> The Bill is short but necessary.  It is part of an ongoing process of electoral reform.  I welcome the Bill which will have the support of the House.  I hope it gets a speedy passage through this House.  We, as legislators, are affording the people an opportunity to be more involved, so that they will have a better opportunity under the Constitution and under the law to offer their opinion in referenda.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome this important legislation updating the law relating to referenda.  I was very glad when, under the Electoral Act, 1992, the necessity for those who had to have special voting arrangements no longer had to have a certificate saying they were of sound mind before they could vote.  If that rule was applied to all of us heaven only knows where we would be.  If that notion had caught on some people might have wanted to stop others voting as they wished.</P>
      <P>According to this Bill it seems that the medical profession will again be involved.  Naturally, I am pleased if any employment is made available for doctors but I wonder about the wisdom of the loose provision of section 31 (2). This provides that if, within seven days before polling day, one can satisfy the local returning officer, by reason of a physical illness or disability, that one is not in a position to go to the usual polling station, one can go to another.  I presume as this is in the same constituency it could not make too much difference.  However, it is a vague way to start giving medical certification.  I admit a proprietorial interest in this area; I wonder who will be giving certification for those who have a physical illness or disability if not a doctor.  I am sure the Minister will be able to explain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised a point which I support.  I am sorry we have not begun to address the problem of postal votes. This problem has been satisfactorily resolved throughout the EU, and <Col N="748" /> recently we saw it working for South Africans living in this country.  Like Senator Doyle, I have children who have been abroad for short periods on work experience and were anxious to have voting rights in their own country.  It seems foolish that we do not try to address this problem properly.</P>
    <P>It is one of the topics on which I get most correspondence &mdash; being one of the University Senators with a large postal vote I am bound to be one of those targeted. There is a growing body of young people who are not in Ireland at present but see their future here, which resent that they cannot vote here.  A referendum Bill would have been ideal legislation to begin to deal with this.  We are constantly told these young people are not up to date with the views of political parties but a referendum, we hope, would be easier to explain, and this Bill would have been an ideal instrument to extend the postal voting franchise.  We need to tackle this problem as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also made the important point that the wording for a referendum has to be simple.  It could not be stated in the Bill but it should be implied.  I was involved in the 1983 referendum and I opposed the amendment to the Constitution because the wording was not clear.  Sadly, this proved to be true when the wording of the amendment was eventually interpreted in the Supreme Court and many people found that their interpretation was not upheld by the Supreme Court.  Of course, this is how the law is interpreted.</P>
    <P>I warn against resorting too frequently to referenda because it is hard to get clarity in them.  Proceeding by legislation is of greater importance.  On another occasion Senator Gallagher spoke about the possibility of having photographs of candidates on ballot papers.  This does not come within the scope of this Bill but it might be worth examining for ordinary elections in the future.  It would be sad if, in a country which should have a completely literate population, we had to resort to this practice.  The Minister has wisely introduced in this Bill a section which will ensure that those who cannot <Col N="749" /> read the ballot paper can be suitably assisted and the Minister stressed that confidentiality is required by those giving this assistance.  Rather than looking for photographs, perhaps we should look for further adult education so there will be no possibility of any of the electorate not being able to read a ballot papers.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and hope it will have a speedy passage through this House.  Far be it for me to hold up its progress.</P>
      <P>It is interesting, reading between the lines of this Bill &mdash; it always is in a ministerial brief &mdash; to see the thinking behind certain aspects of it.  I could not help being struck by the language used on the ordinary referendum.  I confess a blissful ignorance on this section of the Constitution. Indeed, I am grateful to the Minister for having elucidated that Article 27 provides this extraordinary addendum to the democratic process. However, the sideswipe the Minister's remarks give to this Article would seem to bear out the reality.  While the theory is fine, there seems to be some obtuse reason, at least according to the Department, for including Article 27 in the de Valera Constitution of 1937.  The Department seems to give the impression that it would be preferable if it was not there, but it cannot be ignored unless it is removed by a referendum.  Because of that, it extended the provisions of this Bill to Article 27 in the unlikely event of their provisions ever seeing the light of day, which is sad in a way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> My first reaction to this would have been similar to the language of the Minister; what is the point of Article 27?  I am reluctant to remove pillars of democracy in a democratic State, irrespective of how obtuse, uneventful or remote their consequences. It always reminds me of those who say that if, in the morning, there was a referendum to abolish the Seanad there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of it.  This comment is not only made outside this House but also by some of our colleagues in the other House.  I usually reply by suggesting that if a similar referendum was held to abolish the Dáil, there would be an equally substantial majority in favour.  This would also apply to the Presidency not because of the incumbent, but because some perceive it to be, like the Dáil and Seanad and other paraphernalia of the State, surplus to requirements.  If that were to come to pass that would lead to dictatorship and a one person Government. Then we would be up the lake without a paddle in our canoe.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the thinking behind Article 27 was that it was a further mechanism in the checks and balances of Government. Ultimately, the people could decide on it if they were asked.  I am cynical when I see remarks &mdash; they were picked up by some of my colleagues &mdash; that the Seanad holds a pivotal role.  There is an inbuilt Government majority in this House and it is highly unlikely the entire Government majority will join one third of their colleagues in the other House &mdash; who would presumably be made up of the Opposition &mdash; to petition the President to the effect that a Bill is not acceptable. Having laboured the point and squeezed whatever I can out of it, I will let the matter rest other than to say that I am delighted Article 27 is in the Constitution, and long may it be so.</P>
    <P>Regarding the culture of referenda, it is surprising that from the enactment of the Constitution in 1938 through to 1959 the people were not required to express any opinion on the Constitution.  This was a period of placidity in Government. The people were happy, although they certainly were not well fed if one recalls <Col N="751" /> the hungry 1940s and the dour 1950s. However, the various Governments of that time did not go to the people and, ironically, the first occasion on which Mr. de Valera decided to hold a referendum on the Constitution was in respect of a proposal to change the voting regulations to the use of the single transferable vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the single vote, not the single transferable vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is correct. The referendum was called to introduce the first past the post voting system and to alter the multi-seat constituencies.  I am grateful to Senator Doyle for reminding me of this as the era was well before my time.  However, I recall the famous Norton amendment which, if it had been accepted, might have changed the pattern of voting and the complexion of Government.</P>
      <P>Mr. de Valera, a towering figure, introduced the referendum after his Government decided it was right and proper to change the voting system.  Given the complexity of multi-seat constituencies, the implications it has for elected Members and the political instability of the early 1980s, there are still traces of this policy in the Fianna Fáil Party which must be addressed at some stage.</P>
      <P>The people appeared to be naturally suspicious of the Government and they threw out the referendum proposals in 1959, but it was an important watershed as it changed the political culture.  From 1959, democracy went down to the people.  Over the past 30 years, people say &mdash; especially those working in constituencies dealing daily with people's problems and with communities and voluntary organisations &mdash; that there has been a growing awareness, coupled with greater access to education, and a greater demand for a say in how they are governed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People now want to know not only that a Government is elected and proposes and disposes in the Dáil and the Seanad, but they want a direct input into the <Col N="752" /> legislative process.  This is why the lobby system has become more effective and has attained a higher profile in recent years, as any Member of either House will testify.  People have come together in groups at voluntary level and they lobby in a way which makes them an essential part of the business of Government.</P>
    <P>In this context the concept of the referendum is central.  It is an essential cog in the democratic process.  Since 1959 Governments have responded to this changed culture because there were 20 years of silence between 1938 and 1959 but in the following 30 years there has been a plethora of referenda, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have gone to the people on a number of occasions on major issues and I have no doubt that future Governments will return to the people whenever they feel the need to consult their views on any aspect of the Constitution.  I welcome this healthy development, and I say this with a certain amount of smugness considering what happened yesterday in the Mother of Parliaments &mdash; as they style themselves &mdash; in the UK.  The British politicians, both on the Government and Opposition sides agonised over whether they should hold a referendum. There was much tut-tutting emanating from the right wing of the parties on both sides to the effect that referenda are not part of the British tradition. Those who lecture the rest of the world on parliamentary democracy, democratic government, on government of the people, by the people for the people, are wrestling with their conscience over whether they should have a referendum on a momentous issue.</P>
    <P>This is an issue which this country will no doubt face in 1996 or 1997 with a referendum because of the implications which will flow from the review of the Maastricht Treaty in 1996.  This does not pre-empt any decision which the Minister or the Government will take on the holding of a referendum, but on the basis of the precedents set regarding European legislation on issues such as the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, <Col N="753" /> there will be a referendum on what flows from the intergovernmental conference in 1996.</P>
    <P>This country should feel proud that it has, within the Constitution and its parliamentary democracy, this important mechanism for going to the people whenever the Government of the day feels it necessary or whenever the groundswell coming from the people demands that the Government provide the mechanism of a referendum.  In this respect, Senator Henry referred to her involvement in a referendum in 1983.  I hope the Government will grasp the nettle and put the abortion issue to the people in a referendum and ask for their opinion.</P>
    <P>As regards giving Irish citizens living abroad the postal vote, I would be more enthusiastic about giving emigrants the vote in Dáil and Seanad elections than in referenda.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the use of the words &ldquo;referendum&rdquo;, &ldquo;referendums&rdquo; and &ldquo;referenda&rdquo;. I do not suggest that he consult an English dictionary because I became so confused yesterday listening to the debate in the House of Commons where reference was made to referendums&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To my surprise and irritation yesterday, the word referendums was referred to by Mr. Major, Mr. Smith, Mr. Ashdown and other politicians in the House of Commons.</P>
      <P>The Government should move speedily towards a resolution of yet another lobby, that is, the vote for emigrants. This is not an issue that is concentrating minds in the same way as unemployment or the economy.  However as a former emigrant I empathise with the point of view held on this issue by people living in the UK and the USA where there is a continuous flow of news coming from this country.</P>
      <P>In this respect, RTE, the national broadcasting station, has extended its daily coverage so that now, through the wonders of telecommunications, people living abroad, and Irish people especially, can tune into national radio from Ireland 24 hours a day, on the Astra Satellite throughout Europe and late at night on the ASC 1 Satellite in North America.  In consequence of Ireland getting onto the information highway in recent years &mdash; to use that great buzzword &mdash; an increasing number of our emigrants are aware in a more immediate way of what is happening in this country.  No longer do they have to rely on the emigrant letter to fill them in on local news or on the local newspaper, which used to arrive several weeks later.  The situation no longer exists where they never obtained the national newspapers or heard the national radio network.  The Irish abroad hear debates on the issues of the day at the same time as we do. People abroad want to feel they are part of the Irish nation in a practical sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument has moved on to the point where I do not believe the Government's position is sustainable.  I know it committed itself in the Programme for a Partnership Government to votes for emigrants and I ask it to speedily address this issue, and this Bill is an ideal opportunity to do so.  As I said, I am more enthusiastic about providing votes for emigrants in Dáil and Seanad elections than in referenda.  As a result of public comments I made, which were reported <Col N="755" /> in the <i>Irish Post</i> in the UK, I received correspondence from Irish citizens who have been living in the UK for a generation and have been assimilated there, although they are proudly Irish.  They voiced the opinion that they should not be given votes in referenda because they do not pay taxes here.  The UK is their adopted country and is where they live and work.  While they have emotional ties to Ireland, are anxious for its well being and have more than a passing interest in what happens here, they stop short of demanding that they should have votes in uniquely Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Government has addressed this issue but I stop short of enthusiastically endorsing the right of Irish citizens abroad to vote in referenda to change the Constitution, whereas I am more enthusiastic about allowing them to vote in Dáil and Seanad elections. However, this is splitting hairs.  In principle, I am an enthusiastic supporter of the right of Irish citizens abroad to have the vote.  This is an opportunity for me to tease out the issue of votes for emigrants. I am sure the Minister will refer to this in his reply.  I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss aspects of an interesting and fascinating Bill, which will go a great distance to consolidate the many areas of electoral law which apply to referenda and which have developed since the foundation of the State.  These are now contained in one Bill and will make the operation of referenda much easier in the future.  I heartily endorse the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, especially in the light of what Senator Mooney said about the supremancy of authority in our Constitution deriving from the people.  There is no more effective way, perhaps no other way, of ensuring that the authority of the people is respected and vindicated than by referendum. Article 6.1 of the Constitution indicates very clearly and without qualification that: &ldquo;All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people...&rdquo; The <Col N="756" /> source of the powers exercised by us in this House, the Government and the Judiciary all derive from the people.  The article continues: &ldquo;...whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This clearly establishes two or three basic elements in the construction of the Constitution and the exercise of powers by the Government, Parliament and the Judiciary.  The powers of those in office for the time being, that is the powers of the Government, Members of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary, derive from the people.  They have no right to power or claim to exercise it without respecting and recognising that those powers derive from the people, who are the source and fountain of all power.  This is the fundamental characteristic of our Constitution. It is nothing if not consistent in this.  Significantly the first referendum held in respect of the powers of the people was to enact and adopt the Constitution itself; this was enacted by the people in a referendum on 1 July 1937. This has always been the major and consistent plank on which the authority of the State is exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 6.1 clearly outlines the ultimate right of the people &ldquo;to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good&rdquo;.  It is not accidental that it says the people have the right &ldquo;in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good&rdquo;. This underlines a number of important elements.  In the event of the questioning of the exercise or administration of power by any one of the executive functions of the Constitution, whether it be the Executive, the Judiciary or Parliament, the Constitution clearly states that it is the right of the people, on final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy and that this must be done according to the requirements of the common good. It does not say according to the requirements of the State.  Sometimes the State in its current form may be confused about what is the common good.  It is important <Col N="757" /> that this power of the people not only remains with them but is respected so that where on occasion there may be conflict within the organs of the State. the final appeal to the people is supreme.</P>
    <P>In normal law the Supreme Court is the final court of appeal, particularly in determining whether the laws passed by the Legislature are in accordance with the Constitution.  The Supreme Court is not the final court of appeal in relation to the Constitution and the powers of the people.  Under Article 6.1 the people are clearly the final court of appeal.  It is important that we recognise that the people should be consulted on any major issue where there is a dispute between the laws we pass and their exercise.</P>
    <P>Referenda did not begin with the 1937 Constitution.  It was a very important element of the original Constitution of the Irish Free State, Saorstát Éireann. The relevant Article gave the right to the people to initiate referenda &mdash; a right which did not pass on to the people under Bunreacht na hÉireann.  It is important that under the 1922 Constitution of Saorstát Éireann, the people had a right to petition a referendum in a fashion which does not exist in the 1937 Constitution. That was not a deliberate omission in terms of trying to exclude the right of the people from the 1937 Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is worth nothing that the authority of the people was recognised before the 1937 Constitution.  The Minister's Bill intends to reform the exercise of that power to prevent any unnecessary delays, obstructions or whatever and to ensure that the outcomes of referenda, being the decision of the people, are seen as conclusive.  There is nothing more conclusive than the decision of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had 16 referenda since 1959. To the best of my knowledge, all but two of those 16 were adopted by the people. Significantly, the two which the people refused to adopt were both in relation to the electoral system.  The first, which has <Col N="758" /> already been referred to, was the 1959 referendum on the voting system which proposed the single seat non transferable vote system.  I recall it as I had my first vote at that time.  The second was the 1968 referendum on the voting system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two referenda that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, there was one on the formation of Dáil constituencies. I presume that both would have fallen together.  However, the hook on which the coat was hanging, so to speak, was the referendum on the voting system.</P>
      <P>That referendum followed a constitutional committee which was set up by the late Seán Lemass in 1966.  I was privileged, as a young Member of this House, to be invited onto that committee by Seán Lemass with other young Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; Deputy David Andrews, who is now the Minister for Defence, Deputy Bobby Molloy and the late Deputy Don Davern.</P>
      <P>I recall the request, which was a very special privilege, which I received from the late Seán Lemass, and I presume that he wrote in the same terms to the other young men at the time; he said that it would be our function to try to operate the institutions of State and to make them efficient and effective in accordance with the needs of the time.  He thought it was appropriate that we, the young men, &mdash; and remember that we were watching the passing of a great generation at that time on all sides of the House &mdash; should take a hand in the reform of the Constitution for the generation in which we were going to be acting as legislators or Ministers, as the case might be.  The proposals of that committee still bear very close examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer in particular to our electoral system, which was touched upon earlier by Senator Mooney.  I greatly regretted that the recommendation which we made in 1966 <Col N="759" /> for single seat constituencies was taken out of context by the Minister of the day, who did not have regard to the sequence in which we put our recommendations. We did recommend single seat constituencies but we always gave our recommendations in our order of preference and I can recall clearly, without ever referring to the text, that our first preference was for the single seat transferable vote system.</P>
      <P>I mentioned young men who were on that committee, but I am glad to say that it was not left to the decision of immature young men because we had some very senior figures, whom I think one could call statesmen, on that committee to guide us.  The late Seán Lemass himself, after he retired as Taoiseach, came onto the committee and played a very active and truly objective role.  Members on all sides were privileged to be in the company of someone who had been there at the formation of the State and showed an objective approach towards the renewal of our Constitution.</P>
      <P>We also had the former Chief Justice, long time Deputy and Minister, Tom O'Higgins, who is now a judge of the European Court of Justice.  We had Declan Costelloe and the late George Colley, men whose commitment and standing was beyond any question or reproach.  We had the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman, a man of really vigorous approach to the authority of the State, unyielding in his assertion of the obligations on all and not a man who compromised on issues where he felt we had an obligation.  In addition, we had some very experienced TDs such as the late Minister, Jim Tully from the Labour Party and the late Deputy Seán Dunne, who was probably one of the most experienced Members of the House.  There was also the then Senator Eoin Ryan on our side, a distinguished former Member of this House.  If I have left out one or two people it was not deliberate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant aspect was that we reached a consensus on a range of issues &mdash; not that what we said would be cast in stone, far from it.  However, that is still <Col N="760" /> worth referring to and the kind of consensus which we reached then could be a guide, at least, for the kind of consensus we could now put in place.</P>
    <P>Returning to the issue of the single seat transferable vote, we on that committee knew that as recently as 1959 the people had decided that they did not want a straight vote system.  In that knowledge, we were hardly likely, seven years later, to make a recommendation that we go back to the people again and say that they had made a mistake and should change their minds.  I want to make it quite clear that that was not our intention. However, it was our intention that the single seat transferable vote system, which we now know as the by-election system, would be put to the people.  At the time there was a mood throughout the parties, certainly in the all party constitutional committee and some Deputies and Senators understandably had reservations about it.  In the 28 years since then &mdash; and I have been involved all that time &mdash; my view in relation to that proposal is stronger now than it was then.</P>
    <P>Proportional representation is an essential feature of our Constitution and I do not disagree with that. However, the current operation of the multi-seat proportional representation constituency has brought about a situation where Deputies who are elected by the people to represent them in Parliament in the framing and passing of laws spend most of their time doing quite the opposite. They spend most of their time preoccupied by competition with their party colleagues.  The effort, frustration and tension that has been a feature of public life in Ireland since then need never have been and in my view should never have been.</P>
    <P>Whatever about competing with the members of other parties, our role is not to devote most our energy to competing with the members of our own party. Under the Constitution all power derives from the people.  Having presented ourselves to the people and been endorsed by them, we spend our time in competition and, in many cases, in conflict <Col N="761" /> with each other.  That is hardly what was intended by the Constitution.  The experience we have had over the years suggests otherwise.</P>
    <P>Some may say that the current multi-seat constituency is the fairest system. On balance the result more or less reflects, for accidental and other reasons, the percentage of first preference votes cast.  A number of us have been Members of the Lower House.  Is it not clear to all who would be honest about it that most of the energy is dissipated because of the unnecessary and sometimes unnatural tension and opposition that is created by the current system?  It does not always stop with Deputies.  It extends to their families, friends and supporters. Deputies themselves, because of a reasonable involvement in the exercise of politics, may take a mature approach to their running mates and try to keep on an even keel.  I would like to think that I tried to do that over the years.  However, when one's supporters identify the enemy, it is often&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The duplication of effort in relation to issues and problems of individual citizens is not only a matter of record but was worthy of recording in the epic tales of Ireland.

Depending on the size of the constituency, one will find three or four different people competing with each other getting letters in and letters back.  I will not spend too much <Col N="762" /> time on this issue, but this Bill concerns referenda and how they are conducted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I would like to refer to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Referendums have been proposed on this issue from time to time.  I see, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, that your assistant is getting a little uneasy but I will not spend too much time on this matter.</P>
      <P>A number of points must be borne in mind in the context of suggesting a referendum on this issue.  The consequence of a failure would be disastrous. I am not the only person who holds that view.  The consequences it could have for Nationalists in the North of Ireland would give rise to unnecessary tension.  I am not suggesting that we hold such a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we make it clear to our fellow Irishmen who are of a different tradition, the Unionist people of the North of Ireland, that Articles 2 and 3 do <Col N="763" /> not represent a claim by us on them. They cannot because we have no right to make such a claim.  I hope that in any reconsideration of constitutional issues that one thing would be quite clear.  The provisions which state:</P>
    <P>Pending the re-integration of the national territory ... the laws enacted by the Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstát Éireann and the like extra-territorial effect.</P>
    <P>can never be represented as a claim by us in the South on those in the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have finished that point.  However, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, you would have to recognise the reality which, unless you and I live in different worlds, is that this issue is constantly being discussed as being appropriate for referendum.  I have just given a reason why I do not think this would be the appropriate way to pursue the matter at present and I have also given an explanation of what is and is not involved. Surely that is relevant to the issue of referenda which the Minister has introduced in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> Senator Mooney made a number of other suggestions; however, I do not have sympathy for one of them which is the need for a referendum to give emigrants the vote.  I have sympathy for emigrants and their fundamental rights given that they were born here, or even if their parents were born here, but, having regard to the nature of the Irish diaspora, the majority of those who are entitled to citizenship are actually resident outside the State.  That is no reflection on them, much less rejecting their rights or entitlements from us as the Legislature.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, although we would wish them to have all their rights and entitlements &mdash; as some of Senator Mooney's correspondents suggested to him &mdash; while they are not resident or paying tax here, even though it is not their fault and they are concerned about it, the overwhelming majority of them would outnumber those who cast their votes at home.  It would not be feasible to have the termination of Government or the Members of Parliament vested in a majority who are outside the country, even if it was practical to administer such a referendum, general election or by-election.</P>
    <P>One feature of the Irish experience, more than any other nation, would be overlooked, the diaspora of the Irish people.  This is reflected in our literature and our dán deoraíochta.  It has been a special part of our culture for generations and it would be overlooked if we suggested that the huge majority should determine current arrangements here.  I would support every other provision we could make to recognise emigrants but not in terms of direct votes for them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another important matter Senator Mooney raised.  I make my case on the basis of Article 6 of the Constitution which states that the people have the right &ldquo;in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good&rdquo;.  If there has been a contentious issue in recent times in relation to referenda, it was the court decision in the X case.  This has come back into the news recently as a consequence of the criminal <Col N="765" /> trial of the man at the centre of the case. Incidentally, I was wrong earlier and I am glad to correct myself.  There was another occasion on which a proposal to amend the Constitution was defeated, the referendum on the dissolution of marriage in 1986.  It would be remiss of me not to note that as a significant decision of the people.  It bears thinking about and I will refer to it later.</P>
    <P>Regarding the referendum to the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, the right to life of the unborn, I expressed strong reservations at the time about the need for that provision.  I also expressed strong reservations about the wording.  I do not say this with a great degree of comfort or with the benefit of hindsight because my colleagues, both in the parliamentary party and in Government, will recall my views.  I said the outcome, which we eventually faced, was likely in the light of the interpretations that could be put on that provision which states:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>Whether one tried to maintain a balance, as in those terms, it invited the type of consequence about which we now know, with some degree of disruption to and tension in the body politic.  Nevertheless, it is significant &mdash; this opinion is shared by many and clearly by Senator Mooney &mdash; that there is an overwhelming view among the people that it was never intended that the Constitution would give a right to abortion.  I strongly believe that and the power of the people to which I referred with regard to Article 6 is there again to be vindicated in the event of anything that would breach this fundamental right to life.</P>
    <P>It is so fundamental that it hardly needed to be stated in the Constitution. It is the most fundamental right of all. One cannot be a citizen unless one has the right to life.  It is supreme and anterior to all the elements that are written into the Constitution.  It was not within the <Col N="766" /> contemplation of the framers of the Constitution that there was ever a need to include it.  However, it has now been called into question through the consequences of the 1982 Bill and 1983 referendum. I agree with Senator Mooney that before anything else is contemplated that might in any way undermine the fundamental right to life, it is appropriate and essential to go back to the people from whom all the powers derive under our Constitution.  It is not for us as legislators, the Government as the Executive or even the Supreme Court as the judge of our exercises, to determine the views of the people.  The people alone will determine that.</P>
    <P>It is particularly appropriate on this day when we celebrate &mdash; although we have strange ways of celebrating such a major event &mdash; the sacrifice of those who gave us the right to be where we are now, our 1916 leaders who were executed on this day almost 80 years ago.  They would and could never have contemplated a Constitution or laws which would provide for the infringement of the most basic right of all, the right to life.  When they made a sacrifice with their lives, it certainly was not to ensure that the decisions we would make later would allow us to terminate that fundamental right of others.  We do not recognise and celebrate that event in everything we do.  As one who was involved all those years, I feel a certain sense of guilt and shame about this but, in any other country, an event of that nature would be celebrated as it should be.  It would be recognised as a measure of total service and commitment to the people and as a measure of the ultimate sacrifice but we are somehow apprehensive and apologetic about it.</P>

I do not think any of us would start talking about an issue from today when the Minister himself, quite properly, referred to the number of referenda that have been held, the reasons behind them, their purpose, and the need to update the actual provisions for holding them.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not stray much further, let me assure you of that, a Leas-Chathaoirleach; you will not need to appeal.  If the Chair would trust my discretion, judgment and sense of responsibility to the House, I can assure him that I will not dwell on it further.  I would prefer not to take issue with the Chair.</P>
      <P>When one hears people saying constantly that we should have a referendum on this matter to enable the view that we really hold to be inserted in our Constitution, I think we should listen because the Constitution says they are the ultimate power.  It is well known that I view the right to life as a very sacred, untouchable right.  Some Senators share that view and others may have different views. Like Senator Mooney, I hope that before too long we would see that opportunity given to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Behan might have said, there is a darling way of introducing change and proposals, and a darling word which is the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo;.  So when proposals are introduced to reform, anyone who questions the proposals to reform is immediately, by definition, against reform.  Who is against reform?  I am not. However, you can reach any conclusion from a false premise.  If you start from a false premise that certain changes are reform then you can reach certain conclusions. One of the great fallacies of <Col N="768" /> logic is that you can reach conclusions which demonstrate that what you were talking about in the first place was not reform at all.  For instance, in relation to reform of the Constitution and our laws relating to marriage, we had one decision not long ago in a referendum.  In any event we have in our law divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>.  You can, of course, terminate an existing marriage.  I know there are hard cases but hard cases make bad law.</P>
    <P>Our fundamental obligation is to regulate for society at large.  Having had experience of living in other countries where the reform that we are being asked to accept is a feature, I do not accept that the condition afterwards is anything like as healthy for society as the condition before the alleged reform was introduced. I do not accept that the rights of citizens, children &mdash; who were not consulted about the decision of individuals who we are told are free to make their decisions &mdash; should be of secondary importance so that two mature adults can exercise their rights.  They may be their rights in the terms they wish for their own personal reasons to exercise them but I do not accept that as an argument.  I respect the other view and if we come to it here I hope we can have a mature discussion.</P>
    <P>However, before any proposals for reform are introduced, it would be important to put the consequences of that proposed reform &mdash; pro and con &mdash; before the people as clearly as any other proposal we are being asked to consider. I hope we will have the maturity to do that and not see this as being a troglodyte approach on the part of people who question it or an irresponsible approach on the part of those who promote it.  Rather we should look at the issue in an objective fashion and then come to a reasoned conclusion.</P>
    <P>I know it is here but I have still not traced the relevant Article; I thought it was Article 26 in the original Saorstát Éireann Constitution.  If I am right I think it was 80,000 people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;75,000 people were empowered to bring about a referendum. We do not have that power under the current Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann.  Because it reflects the supremacy of the people and the power that derives from them, it is a power towards which I would have a certain disposition.</P>
      <P>In Britain, where Westminster talks about itself as the Mother of Parliaments, occasionally they want, rather belatedly, to refer certain issues to the people when they find that exercising their own powers is uncomfortable.  I hope I am not being too critical but in my view it is not because they really want to refer to the people but it is because it may help to solve political tension within the House of Commons or within the governing body. That was never to be the purpose of a referendum.  It was not meant to be used in that sense.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the original Constitution of Saorstát Éireann had a lot to commend them in that connection. However, insofar as we are now operating under the Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann, it is important that we would acknowledge that and never let us forget it.  I have been privileged to be in Government and I have also sat on the Opposition benches.  We are all in Government for a specific time only.  No matter how long we have been there or what power we exercise, none of us should overlook the fact that we are custodians and, at best, trustees of the power that is firmly placed by this Constitution in the hands and authority of the people. That is why I welcome this opportunity to make some observations on referenda and related issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this Bill is mostly concerned with the efficient administration of a referendum it has my blessing, but I thought it would be appropriate to make a few observations on some issues that are being canvassed regularly in relation to referenda.

      <P>I compliment Senator O'Kennedy on a wide-ranging and discursive address.  I am glad the Leas-Chathaoirleach showed tolerance and maturity in allowing the discussion to range over the fundamental issues which were raised by Senator O'Kennedy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is non-controversial legislation.  It updates and deals with a number of matters which required attention.  It is a sensible Bill and bears the hallmark of the accuracy we expect from the franchise section of the Department of the Environment.  I compliment the officials of that section.  They do a difficult and sensitive job extremely well. Their integrity is accepted by all parties and groups.  This is an area about which people might feel resentful if there was any doubt or question about the highest standards being in place.  We are familiar with the rows that are generated by close counts or disputes at elections, even &mdash; or, perhaps, especially &mdash; at party conventions where the count can be quite close or where there might be doubt about the procedures to be followed.  This Bill reflects the highest standards.</P>
      <P>I regret that it is not sufficiently innovative. There is a strong case to be made for, at least, a discussion on the possibility of weekend or Sunday voting.  That was not within the remit of the Bill.  We would like to see ways of updating the register of electors, especially in the period before and election when people can, through no fault of their own or anybody else, find they are not on the register.  This creates a great sense of frustration.  We saw that frustration in the days when we were allowed to stand outside polling booths.  Perhaps, in the age of computers, the Department might take an ongoing interest in that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Americans know about referenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this book very well because I wrote the chapter on Ireland.  However, much has happened in that area since then.  These learned academics attempted to resolve whether &ldquo;referendums&rdquo; or &ldquo;referenda&rdquo; was the correct usage.  Like all good economists, they came down on both sides of the question.  Their definitive conclusion is that both words are acceptable and correct. Although Senator O'Kennedy, as a classicist, prefers to use the word &ldquo;referenda&rdquo;, I can relieve Senator Mooney's worries.  Both words are acceptable.</P>
      <P>Listening to Senator O'Kennedy's reflections on the historical antecedents of the referendum, I was struck that the referendum question was almost glossed over in the debates on the 1937 Constitution. If our Constitution was intended to be rigid and not easily amended, it was inevitable that referendums would be held in order to change it.  Curiously, However, nobody in 1937 thought it would be a much used device and little attention was paid to it.  There was nothing in the past experience of those who drafted the Constitution to lead them to believe that the referendum would become an extraordinarily important instrument in the determination of public policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened since then is the inevitable consequence of having a rigid <Col N="772" /> Constitution which has to withstand changes in society, the unpredictability of the Supreme Court in finding rights within the Constitution which might not have been there or might not have been seen to be there by those who drafted it and the momentous decisions which confront people.  The referendum has come from a position of obscurity in the debate of 1937 to occupy today a central place in Irish political life.  For that reason the legislative framework within which the referendum is operated must be as careful and correct as this Bill attempts to be.</P>
    <P>We are lucky to have the referendum mechanism.  We have held referenda at some definitive moments in our history. It was to the advantage of this country and to public life in this country that the people were asked to vote on the most important issue to confront them since independence &mdash; our entry into the EEC. The fact that the people were consulted and the size of that vote and subsequent votes on EC and EU issues since then has removed from public debate any question or doubt about what we believe is our destiny as a nation.  It has prevented us from getting embroiled in the incredibly divisive and often dishonest debates which are taking place in British politics today.  The debate in Britain is often not about the European question &mdash; there are hidden agendas.  At least the referendum has allowed us to face up to such a major issue.</P>
    <P>I differ from Senator O'Kennedy on the divorce referendum.  We were on different sides on that issue.  Like him, however, I welcome the opportunity of having a full debate on a fundamental issue for the future of Irish society.  We have learned from the 1986 experience exactly how one should not hold a referendum. If we are to hold, a referendum on a major issue of public policy, it is vital that the supporting legislation be in place, that there be as full and as open a debate as possible preceding the referendum and that the people are not asked to rush to judgment in the three or four weeks prior to a referendum.  This Government has learned that lesson.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> I am a strong advocate of the introduction of civil divorce in this country. I do not advocate it out of a sense of enthusiasm.  Divorce and the divorce process is sought only after a great deal of pain, suffering and thought.  In many cases a dissolution of the marriage is better for all concerned.  That debate, however, is for another day.  It is good that we have a referendum so that such a fundamental issue can be decided by the people.</P>
    <P>Great lessons should be learned from the 1983 referendum which was an even worse example of how not to make public policy.  The circumstances in which the commitments were given, the way in which the issue was debated in both Houses &mdash; and I was a Member of the other House then &mdash; and the intemperate and partisan nature of the debate was something which all of those involved in it would probably regret.  On such issues it is important that the preparation for referendums is conducted in as open and as non partisan a way as possible.  We have learned from previous referendums. Nobody or very few people in 1937 anticipated how important the referendum would become as a means of shaping public policy.  In the 16 or so referendums that have been held the issues have varied from those which were not of a fundamental nature but which because of their inclusion in the Constitution had to be put to the people, to the utterly fundamental issues I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to easy access to referendum.  This is a fundamental question.  It is not addressed in the Bill because it was not within the remit of this legislation.  The late John Kelly used to say frequently that one could do worse than read the principles in the democratic programme for the First Dáil.  This was an example of a pure form of democracy and many of the principles bear repetition today.  The same could be said of the 1922 Constitution.  It is a much forgotten document but the greatest tribute which could be paid to it is that the late Mr. De Valera incorporated large chunks of it in the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> Behind that Constitution was a great belief in popular participatory democracy, which was fashionable among new democracies at that time.  The provisions on referenda quoted by Senator O'Kennedy was a part of that.  We adopted an extreme form of PR because those framing the Constitution believed that as far as possible the Dáil should reflect as wide as spectrum of views as possible. This was similar to the beliefs of the time in Weimar Germany.  They saw PR as an ideal system which allowed parliament to be widely representative, almost a microcosm of the nation as a whole; I think they were wrong in that.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Kennedy said, the 1922 Constitution provided that if 75,000 people signed a petition, a referendum could be held.  The provision has an interesting history and there is much to be learned from what happened, because two important principles of democracy were brought into conflict.  The Fianna Fáil Party entered the Dáil in 1927 and initiated a petition on the abolition of the oath of allegiance.  There was no difficulty in obtaining signatures.</P>
    <P>The Government of the day took the view that the oath of allegiance was part of an international treaty between the Irish Free State and Great Britain and therefore one party could not unilaterally break that treaty.  The Government then abolished the right of easy access to referendum, as it was then possible for it to amend the Constitution without referendum.</P>
    <P>At that time Mr. de Valera and his party made great capital out of this move and said when they came to power this right would be restored.  As Senator O'Kennedy knows, matters often look different from behind the Taoiseach's desk than from behind the desk of the Leader of the Opposition.  When in power Mr. de Valera strongly resisted any attempt to allow easy access to referendum on a popular basis and when the Constitution was debated in 1936 Mr. de Valera was no longer as keen on the idea.</P>
    <P>These events lead us to ask what type of political system we want.  Do we want <Col N="775" /> easy access to referendum, allowing the people to vote on a whole range of issues? Or do we regard the referendum as a blunt instrument, useful for deciding fundamental issues, but decide that better and more subtle law can be derived from consultation, discussion, Committee Stage and other parliamentary deliberations? Popular and populist issues might frustrate Governments which have a four or five year programme.  Impossible demands might be made, because people might want to vote for moves which are popular but might not be feasible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we can look at Senator O'Kennedy's question again at some later date. It highlights an aspect of our referendum system with which I have difficulty, that access to referendum is restricted to the Government of the day.  It is not possible for the Opposition or a large public group to initiate a referendum; there must be a majority in both Houses and it must be initiated by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I now move to another point raised by Senator O'Kennedy and I thank him for the material he has provided for my contribution.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to the committee which reviewed the Constitution in 1967.  That committee's report is a most underrated document.  It is enormously important and I regret that more of its recommendations were not put into effect.  The Senator quoted one of our greatest Taoisigh, the late Seán Lemass, who said the younger Members should have a say in deciding how the Constitution of the future should look.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An all-party committee to review the Constitution is long overdue.  The chemistry in the previous committee worked well, as the Senator, who was a member of that committee, confirmed today.  It would be worthwhile to have an all-party <Col N="776" /> joint committee of these Houses reviewing the Constitution on an ongoing basis. Such a committee should not be under any time constraints but should simply examine what changes might be made in the public interest.</P>
    <P>We should be wary of overusing the referendum.  It is a blunt instrument.  We should not see it as in any way replacing the central role of Parliament in defining public policy.  I would have reservations about there being too easy access to the referendum process.  This Bill provides a good legislative framework within which we can carry out the operation of referenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford)</i>: I express appreciation for what has been a useful and constructive debate.  I thank Senators for their contributions.  I found it stimulating to be taken back in time by both Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Manning to 1922 and the Lemass committee.  It was most interesting to hear them debate the various aspects of the Constitution through the years on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P>There has been a general welcome for the Bill and I thank Senators for that. The Bill has been recognised as solid reforming legislation which continues the reform of electoral laws which began in 1992.  It will enable the central referendum returning officer to order a complete re-examination and recount of all ballot papers in each constituency.  Provision is allowed in the Bill for polling station staff deployed outside their own constituency to vote in the polling station where they are on duty.  It also enables the Minister, by order and with the approval of both Houses, to include a descriptive heading on ballot papers at a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle mentioned the need to inform electors about the subject matter of each referendum.  The Bill provides that each voter shall be sent a polling card, explaining the issue on which he or she is being asked to vote.  The statement will also be displayed on posters at polling stations.  It also provides that copies of a <Col N="777" /> Bill containing the proposals to be the subject of a referendum will be made available in post offices for free inspection by the public.  The statement on polling cards and posters must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and I think this should ensure it is impartial and not biased.</P>
    <P>Publicity campaigns by interest groups or political parties are matters for such groups or parties themselves.  It may be expected that the detailed information and guidance on amendments would be issued from such sources.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle and Senator Mooney raised the question of emigrant voting. In the last year we have debated the voting rights of emigrants on at least eight occasions in both Houses.  Article 47.3 of the Constitution provides that every citizen who has the right to vote at an election for Members of Dáil Éireann shall have the right to vote at a referendum. The implication of that provision is that a citizen who does not have the right to vote at Dáil elections cannot be given the right to vote at a referendum. As already indicated on a number of occasions, the legal advice is that under the present constitutional provisions there is only limited scope to grant voting rights to those temporarily absent from the country.  As has been mentioned, the Programme for a Partnership Government accepted in principle that there should be a constitutional change to give voting rights to emigrants and that this issue would be further examined. This examination is taking place in the Department but no decision has been made.  I will keep the review committee and the Minister informed of the views expressed here today.</P>
    <P>The political parties and I have listened to many discussions on the right of emigrants to vote but there is no agreement on how it should be done.  On a number of occassions in the Dáil the Fine Gael Party suggested that emigrants should be represented in this House by a Senator or a number of Senators.  The Labour Party has different views, as does the Fianna Fáil Party, even among its members, on how this should be done. <Col N="778" /> The review committee is examining this issue and the Programme for a Partnership Government has made a commitment that proposals will come before both Houses of the Oireachtas during the lifetime of this Government.  There will be a wide ranging and detailed debate when that happens because of the different views among political parties.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked if the plural for referendum is referenda or referendums. Senator Manning dealt with this point reasonably well when he stated that both forms are acceptable.  It is traditional among the people and in the Constitution to refer to it as referenda, therefore we should keep that wording.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

        <i>(Wexford):</i> As Senator Manning said, either word is appropriate.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to the right of the people under the 1922 Constitution. Once again, Senator Manning dealt appropriately with this issue. Unkind people might say that the change came about because there was a possibility of activating the procedure.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to disabled voters and the need for a medical certificate. Polling stations should be more accessible to disabled voters and the returning officer should allow disabled people to vote.  We should not need medical evidence, particularly if a person cannot vote in one polling station.  For example, if an person in a wheelchair can be facilitated at another polling station, which is accessible, they should not need medical evidence for the person in charge to allow them to vote.  This provision is not widely known, but my Department recently brought it to the attention of the National Rehabilitation Board in order to ensure that disabled people became aware of it.  We hope it is availed of at future referenda and elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing law the following facilities are provided for voters with physical disabilities.  A disabled person who is unable to go in person to vote at his or her polling station may apply for registration <Col N="779" /> as a special voter and vote at home; a disabled person who has difficulty in gaining access to his or her own polling station may apply to have his or her vote transferred to another polling station in the same constituency; a disabled person who requires assistance in marking his or her ballot paper may be assisted by a companion or by the presiding officer.  In addition, returning officers are advised by the Department of the Environment at each election and referendum that polling stations should be so located as to provide easy access to the disabled electorate and the provision of ramps should be considered where necessary.  Returning officers are not paying attention to what the Department of the Environment is saying because many polling stations around the country are either upstairs or downstairs and are totally inaccessible to people with disabilities. The Department must again discuss this issue with returning officers because many schools, halls and areas where elections take place are not user friendly to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the question of including photographs of individuals on ballot papers.  This is not relevant to a referendum because photographs would not be an issue.  Apart from the problems associated with including photographs on ballot papers, many people have reading and writing difficulties and would require assistance to mark the ballot paper.  This matter must be considered in the context of the law relating to the conduct of elections in the first instance.  I assure Senator Henry that we will bear her views in mind in future reform.  This suggestion has been made on a number of occasions in the Seanad and we will take on board the views expressed when the appropriate time comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Good looking candidates would have an advantage, but all is fair at election time.</P>
      <P>Sunday voting was mentioned by Senator Manning and others.  The Electoral Act, 1992, removed the statutory barrier to voting on Sunday.  There is now no reason an election or referendum should not be held on a Sunday.  On each occasion a decision must be made as to which day should be appointed as polling day.  However, it is clear that some minority churches have difficulty with the concept of voting on a Sunday on grounds of conscience.  The position of these churches must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also raised the question of errors on the register and names being omitted from it.  Section 15 of the Electoral Act, 1992, provides for a supplement so that people omitted from the register can have their names restored. Anyone in this position can apply for reentry on the supplement up to 12 days before polling day.  Many people are availing of this opportunity prior to the forthcoming urban and European elections.  I appeal to people and to political parties in particular to tell their supporters and the public that they can now avail of this provision.  This worthwhile change was recently made by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 20, subsection (2), line 29, after &ldquo;disability&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;as certified by a medical practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Recently there has been a lot legislation relating to reforms in the electoral area, including the Local Government Bill and the Presidential Elections Bill.  We are now dealing with referenda and there will probably be changes in Seanad elections to allow the regional technical colleges, the new universities and, perhaps, those living abroad be represented.  That is something we can look forward to.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about including section 31 (2) without objection.  If this subsection is included in this Bill it could be reflected in future legislation.  I am not worried about the problems experienced when bringing someone in a wheelchair to vote.  I do not know of any situation where a physical illness or disability of seven days duration is looked on so casually as not to require a medical practitioner's certificate.  If one applies for sickness benefit, one does not require a doctor's certificate for the first three days. However, on the fourth day, in order to be paid, one must have such a certificate. If one wants to be paid from the first day, one must have the certificate back-dated by the medical practitioner to the first day.  We are worrying about a medical practitioner's certificate for three day's pay.  Yet in this important electoral Bill we are setting up something which could be reflected in future legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does this Bill seek self-certification? Does the local returning officer need a medical qualification so he may argue that a person's illness is not severe enough and he or she should return to their own polling station if the person gives a week's notice?  This could lead to problems.  Could the Minister advise me of other circumstances as serious as the one where a person seeks to change where they cast their vote?  Again, one must remember that this Referendum Bill concerns one constituency.  What happens if it is reflected in other legislation where, for example, we know the <Col N="782" /> number of votes from one electoral ward to another.  The number of votes in those wards may make a difference to the outcome. This is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see creeping non-certification by the medical profession starting in this legislation.  I would like to know if there are other serious areas where a person, a returning officer or one's aunt, can say one's physical illness or disability disbars one from voting?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford)</i>: Section 31 provides that the local returning officer may authorise an elector to vote at another polling station in his or her constituency where the elector is unable to vote at his or her normal polling station due to physical illness or disability. The situation envisaged is that there might be steps or other obstacles in getting into that station.  The effect of the amendment tabled by Senator Henry would be to require an elector who wishes to avail of this facility to support his or her application with a medical certificate.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the points made by Senator Henry.  However, arrangements made in this section are intended to apply to physically ill or disabled electors who are not registered as special voters and who wish to vote in person.  An elector who applies to the returning officer to vote at an alternative polling station must satisfy the returning officer of his or her eligibility.  The elector may, if he or she wishes, submit a medical certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as drafted is intended to be flexible and to allow the returning officer maximum discretion as to how a particular elector should satisfy him or her of the entitlements to vote at another polling station.  I understand that the returning officer normally accepts the elector's statement without further formality. The returning officer may request an elector to submit a medical certificate. On the other hand, if the elector is known to the returning officer, this may not be necessary.  It would also be open to the returning officer to consult with his or her local staff who may be in a position to confirm that the elector had previous <Col N="783" /> difficulties in gaining access to a particular polling station.  I understand a medical certificate would only be sought in exceptional circumstances where there might be doubt about the bone sides of the application.</P>
    <P>In many cases electors may not apply for authorisation to vote at an alternative polling station until close to the deadline, as the elector may not be aware until then that a particular building is proposed to be used as a polling station.  In that context it is essential that the minimum requirements are imposed on such electors and the provisions be as flexible as possible.  The inclusion of a requirement that a medical certificate be produced in each case would be inconsistent with this flexibility.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that there is already a system in operation for Dáil and presidential elections and it is working well.  We have received no complaints in this regard and we intend to extend this system of voting to other areas in further electoral reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the action being taken by the Government to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group on the Food Industry, in particular, the announcement that £7 million is to be provided for food research in 1994; and requests <Col N="786" /> that measures be taken to ensure that commitment to the Food Industry is maintained in the future.</P>
    <P>I thank the expert group on the food industry for its report.  The group was made up of representatives from all levels of this important industry.  The group came up with an action plan.  The motion refers to £7 million which is to be provided for food research in 1994.  We welcome this provision because this money is essential for food research, particularly with regard to added value.</P>
    <P>The food industry is the engine of growth of the indigenous sector of the economy.  Although we continuously complain about our climate and, in particular, the rain, it is the climate that provides the necessary conditions for good quality food from the land and the sea.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to implement a development programme for the food industry following consideration of the expert group's recommendations. It also gives a commitment to put in place an operational programme for the food industry in the new Community Support Framework.  The cost of the plan will be in the region of £720 million over five years.  Money will come from the EU, the Exchequer and the industry.</P>
    <P>The action programme would maintain existing employment levels and I refer, in particular, to the concept of added value.  For too long the industry has been concentrating on the side of beef, the pound of butter, etc.  However, we know from experience that if one is selling beef on the hoof, for example, it is not to the best advantage of the producing country. Many jobs in processing will be lost if we do not concentrate on the added value aspect of production.</P>
    <P>We can look at supermarket shelves and see the way foreign products are presented.  Before it is too late we will have to work out ways of gaining added value.  This is the age of TV dinners and pre-packed foods and we will have to be prepared for that.  Considering what has <Col N="787" /> happened in the agriculture sector with set aside and loss in the primary sector, we need to build up the jobs &mdash; 1,200 jobs per year would be needed &mdash; in the added value sector to maintain existing employment levels.</P>
    <P>The programme will enable the food industry to develop in a world dominated by CAP, GATT and the Single Market and will enable the industry to identify and respond to market and consumer needs.  Most importantly, it will greatly augment the value of the food industry involving a significant increase in employment. The central aim of the report of the expert group is to maximise the value of the food industry to the economy.  We need competitiveness in the economy; this will encompass interest and exchange rates and transport and communication costs, all of which are central to the food industry.</P>
    <P>The seasonality factor has bedevilled the food industry, particularly in beef cattle and milk production, and ways will have to be found to increase the added value of that production.  Reduced seasonality would facilitate a significant switch from butter to cheese production and a major movement in the beef sectors toward vacuum-pak production.  Specific targets are proposed for those areas and for the development of pig meat production. This would make the industry more market orientated.  The expert group also sees the prime development possibilities as being in prepared consumer foods and food ingredients and in producing the staple products in more consumer ready form.  Special targets are also set for these areas.</P>
    <P>Investment aid should be concentrated mainly on those principal development areas, on the processing facilities necessary as a result of the seasonality change and an expansion of pig meat processing. Specific criteria to govern investment aids are suggested include aid to develop Irish brand products.  Many of our products are being sold as coming from other countries; the goods originally came from Ireland but there was another step in their processing.  We lose the identity and <Col N="788" /> the quality of our food because it is often sold as the product of another country. We need to have our brands on world markets and use our own good name in food production.</P>
    <P>Significant additional resources are required for research and development in the food industry and greater co-ordination and focus are required in the training schemes available to the industry.  We cannot make these changes overnight. We have to take high specialisation and health considerations into account in expanding the food industry.  Quality standards should be rigidly enforced and membership of a recognised quality scheme should become a requirement for eligibility for national development aid. Co-ordination and the central direction of policy for the food industry is an essential prerequisite for the development of the industry and for maximising the benefit of the resources available to it.</P>
    <P>The group also recommends a single operational programme for the food industry in the new EU Structural Funds and a new single food promotion agency incorporating the export, promotion and market development agencies, in conjunction with or replacing An Bord Tráchtála and Forbairt.  Responsibility for the formulation of all policy for the industry and most of the operating policy will be with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>The group stressed the need to strengthen the Department's food function, particularly to define more clearly the critical role of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the Department in ensuring the interests of the food industry are given prominence in relevant national or EU decisions.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should have overall responsibility for the operational programme and Forbairt and IDA Ireland for the new food promotion agency and for providing the conditions in which the potential of the main growth area in the food sector could be achieved.</P>
    <P>Coming from an area where the production of primary products is of the utmost importance, not only on the production side but also in the follow up <Col N="789" /> process, great work is being done in the co-operatives in County Cork, especially west Cork, and in the CPC processing operation not too far from my home where valuable employment involving indigenous primary products is being given.  They are providing employment in areas affected by emigration and high unemployment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the moneys allocated for research and development.  The motion, which says that &ldquo;measures should be taken to ensure that commitment to the food industry is maintained in the future&rdquo;, is of the utmost importance not only for this country but also for the producers, farmers, horticulturists and the fishermen.  Food will always be in constant demand.  If we produce food of a proper quality, the market is there for it at home, in Britain, the EU and throughout the rest of the world.  Money is needed to develop food research.  The expert group on the food industry have done their job and the Seanad should fully back this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  In doing so, I emphasise the importance of the food industry to our economy.  The £7 million allocated to the food industry is a welcome step; I hope it will be the first of many.  As Senator Calnan pointed out, food production is what we do best. No matter how well we can produce goods, what is important is how much we can sell.  There is little sense, either on an economic or moral basis, in having our warehouses full of unwanted food at too high a price.  Our food policy must be market oriented.  As Senator Calnan said, it is a shame that much of our food products, especially powdered milk, is exported from this country and sold back here under a foreign brand name.  We must sell an identifiable Irish product into the market.  That costs money, because if one wants to get a brand name established in any market, a great deal of market research and promotion is required.  Unless we are now prepared to put that money into market research and promotion, we will not be in the race, <Col N="790" /> but at the whim of multinational food producers.</P>
      <P>In this respect there is a vital role to be played by our large co-operatives.  There is little point in any Government Department taking this role on its own.  It needs the co-operation from those who are expert in that field to ensure our goods are promoted at every level.  It is sore to see in supermarkets rows of food products like yoghurt, for example, which are made in France, Belgium or the United Kingdom.  These products can easily be made in this country.  The leading brands hold the major share of the food shelves of our larger supermarkets.  These spaces should be taken by Irish companies.</P>
      <P>There is also a role for the smaller producer.  Food centres, such as the one in Raheen in County Limerick, and advisory groups have been set up to facilitate and help the smaller producers so that goods can be produced to satisfy niches in the market.  It does not have to be an elaborate or widely distributed product, maybe only a few people producing local farmhouse cheeses, yoghurts, jams or other food products. These small groups should be given every possible assistance to bring their products up to a standard of hygiene and quality that would be accepted under EU regulations, which are increasingly impinging on the production and display of food.  In this I can also see a role for our larger co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Horace Plunkett set up the cooperative movement approximately a century ago, its aim was to help farmers come together.  By operating as a mutual support to each other, they would help each other prosper.  That idea should never be lost.  The co-operatives have a duty to promote small businesses within their catchment area.  People in County Limerick, for example, have complained that they are one of the largest milk producers, but there are few, if any, milk producing plants within the county boundaries; they are located outside.  The large co-operatives have a duty to go back to the areas that produce food products such as milk, meat and fish and set up small units producing speciality goods. <Col N="791" /> Working with a product that is indigenous to that area is one of the few ways to stem rural depopulation.  We cannot be forever looking for foreign industries to create employment but we must see where we can help ourselves.  Some of the larger co-operatives &mdash; it makes economic sense &mdash; are tending to buy from outside the country.  We need to look at how the smaller person can be helped in the production and manufacture of small niche products.</P>
    <P>When one talks of food, it tends to be confined to inland food producers of milk, beef, poultry and pig products. Senator Gallagher said this morning that we have, over the generations neglected one of our biggest assets, the multitudinous seas around Ireland and the fish contained therein.  Fish is caught off the shores of Castletownbere and loaded on trucks which then go to Rosslare.  The products are then sold without any Irish hand being put on them until they arrive in Spain.  It is a shame that so much of our fish produce, and our quality fish produce such as lobster and crayfish, are lifted from the sea and sold without an Irish hand being laid upon it and with no added value accruing to Ireland.  It is an area that must be examined more closely and developed as much as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am pleased that this motion is before the House because great value can come out of this area.  It is an area where much work needs to be undertaken and where there is great scope for carrying out such work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy proposals of the expert group on the food industry go in the right direction.  They are based on a clear appreciation of the current state of the Irish food industry and an assessment of its needs and prospects.  One of the most striking aspects of the report is its justifiable realism regarding job prospects. For once there is a realistic presentation which does not make extravagant forecasts of substantial extra employment. The truth is that an industry characterised by rapid developments in technology can <Col N="792" /> grow substantially without expanding employment.  Another fact of this situation is that significant amounts of investment in production capacity is required to maintain output, and a substantial investment in research and development can be required to maintain market share.</P>
    <P>Policies designed to expand production and market share, as contained in the proposals of the expert group on the food industry, require further increases in investment.  As far as the further development of Irish branded food products are concerned, the group has, if anything, underestimated the investment required. There is no doubt, however, that this avenue of development must be rigorously pursued.</P>
    <P>The development proposals made by the group deserve support.  The Government must ensure that the policies and resources identified are rapidly put in place, especially in the context of decisions made regarding EU Structural Funds.  If spent in this area, these funds will be fruitful in the long term.</P>
    <P>Bureaucratic wrangles over which Government Department should have responsibility for An Bord Bia will only hinder development.  The nucleus for a successful body to develop, promote and market Irish food now exists with CBF, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and An Bord Glas.  The Minister for Agriculture should stop dithering, seize the initiative and get on with the job.  Above all, he must not let this proposed new initiative be swallowed up in the appalling bureaucratic system established by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>Having closely examined the recommendations by the expert group on the food industry, there is one serious criticism to be made in the area of the membership of the group.  Having examined the names of those in the group, and taking into consideration that the three farming organisations &mdash; the IFA, ICMSA and Macra na Feirme &mdash; have their general secretaries on the group, the absence of any working farmers must <Col N="793" /> be questioned.  Whether we like it or not, the raw material is very important to the processing side in the food industry and the absence of any working farmers on the group is a great mistake.</P>
    <P>Taking existing policy approaches into consideration and in the light of the Single Market, the GATT and CAP reforms, there is a great need for change and for research and development at the farm gate level.  Irrespective of the processing side of the industry, policy is important. It is important that we get high quality produce as the entire industry depends greatly on this.  I must advise the Minister that there is a huge vacuum between processors and producers, a vacuum heretofore filled by the existence of county committees of agriculture.  The disbanding of these committees was a great mistake.</P>
    <P>When the present return from the food industry, as stated in the recommendations, is considered, a sum of £6 billion to £7 billion emerges.  The cost of the county committees of agriculture, in comparison to the return from the agriculture industry, would be very small and the re-establishment of the committees of agriculture in each county is essential in order to fill the vacuum between processors and producers.</P>
    <P>The overall objectives should be to continue to encourage competitiveness, innovation and added value.  However, there should also be greater selectivity in the areas to be supported.  The areas which have not been identified in these recommendations should be closely examined.  The mushroom industry, which has been very successful and can compete with any in Europe, has further room for development and growth.  In addition, the grass based industries, such as milk, beef and mutton, should be well supported at the farm gate level because it is proven beyond any doubt that in these industries we can compete not alone in the European but in world markets.</P>
    <P>These are the areas which should be targeted for future development.  It cannot be said that they have potential for growth because the beef, milk and <Col N="794" /> sheep industries have been capped by EU regulations.  However, there is ample room to increase market share, especially in Europe.</P>
    <P>The record of Fianna Fáil Governments on the food industry has been dismal down through the years.  The House will recall announcements by the former Fianna Fáil Party Taoiseach regarding great plans for the food industry, especially in the west of Ireland and involving Mr. Larry Goodman.  These announcements indicated that one man, and one man alone, would operate and expand the entire food industry.  They created a situation where all other parties shelved their plans for research, development and investment, losing valuable time in respect of equipping and modernising in preparation for Europe.</P>
    <P>I recall the time helicopters flew over my own County Mayo, where there were two bacon factories, one in Castlebar and the other in Claremorris.  The then Fianna Fáil Government closed these factories. It was a disaster for Castlebar as the factory was one of its biggest industries.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of Leader programmes, and a new programme is about to commence, these should be contrasted with county development teams or the new county enterprise boards.  For example, a small butcher who needs to expand his business in processing, whether it be beef, pigs, sheep or whatever, will get grant aid up to £50,000 and will be able to take on extra staff under the Leader programme.  Under the criteria laid down by the county enterprise boards he is not eligible for any grant aid.</P>
    <P>This is an issue which the Government should examine because there is a great need for small industries to expand as they will be the lifeline to areas such as the west of Ireland, areas which could be depending completely on small industries. It is unfair that a person can be grant aided under one scheme but not another.  The Minister will be aware that the county enterprise boards are made up of elected representative while there are no such representatives on the Leader programmes, which can provide money. <Col N="795" /> Politicians are answerable because they are answerable to the public.  I request the Minister of State to ask the Minister to look at this seriously.  This area has great scope for expansion.  I will judge the progress of the Government on its commitment to and implementation of this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by the Labour Party.  I congratulate Senator Calnan and my colleague from west Limerick, Senator Kelly, who seconded the motion.  The Expert Group on the Food Industry, which included representatives from all levels of the industry, was established by the Minister in April 1992 and was charged with the task of drawing up an action programme.  Since agriculture is Ireland's main industry and produces the country's food, we should exploit every opportunity to promote the food industry and market our food in other countries. The report emphasises the need to increase employment in this sector.</P>
      <P>I remember when there were food processing plants, especially creameries, in every parish.  Since we joined the EU rationalisation has changed the scene dramatically.  There are no longer creameries in many parishes.  In my own small parish a creamery employed ten or 12 people.  However, it was closed as were creameries in other parishes.  Limerick, which is a great dairy producing county, has no meat processing industry.  Golden Vale in Charleville, is very near Limerick and provides a great deal of employment. There is a chicken processing plant in Castlemahon.  Local people who rear and breed chickens create employment. Chicken processing is a great source of employment not just in Castlemahon and west Limerick but throughout the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report referred to the need to reduce the seasonality factor in beef, cattle and milk production and the group suggested a number of policy changes to assist this.  It is cheaper to produce milk in the summer when grass is available. Now that we have an increased urban <Col N="796" /> population, there is a greater demand for liquid milk.  People may say that milk is liquid but milk powder is produced for the manufacture of cheese and other products.  Milk for consumers is essential and must be produced every day.  Dairy farmers who produce liquid milk must be encouraged to ensure this continuity of supply.  Reducing the seasonality factor will result in more employment in the winter months.  Statistics prove a great deal more milk is produced during the summer when the cattle can enjoy the natural green grass we are priviliged to have in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the membership of the expert group; I share his disappointment that nobody with practical experience of farming was a member of it.  It is very important to avail of the advice of such people because they could explain the problems in the food industry, especially at producer level.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly mentioned the co-operative movement which was set up years ago by Horace Plunkett.  This has been responsible for the development of agriculture to its present level.  I live only five miles from Drumcollogher, where the first creamery was set up by Horace Plunkett. It is now preserved as a heritage centre.  If the Minister or any Members are ever in the area they should visit it. It shows how cows were milked and how the people brought it to the creameries. Milking did not involve the pressing of a button; it was done the hard way.  People used donkeys and carts to bring milk to the creameries.  Big lorries did not collect milk from their doors.  Today these lorries are blamed for the poor state of roads.  Progress and our membership of the EU are probably the reasons for the present situation.</P>
    <P>We should be proud of the success of our mushroom industry.  Senator Burke argued that previous Governments, and one in particular, failed the horticulture industry.  Fianna Fáil Governments have achieved great progress and made positive decisions in the promotion of the food industry, especially horticulture. Climatic conditions have a great impact on agriculture and people engaged in this <Col N="797" /> industry are at the mercy of the weather, which was particularly bad this year.  The sowing of crops, including cereals, is late this year and this will have an adverse effect on production.  I would like to ask Senator Quinn if it is easy for him to get Irish horticultural produce to sell in his supermarkets.  Many imported horticultural products are on supermarket shelves.  As we have a natural horticultural industry we should sell our own produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I have much pleasure in supporting this motion in general terms and in particular insofar as it refers to increased funding for food research.  The point I want to make about the research funding will come as no surprise to anybody who has read my almost notorious one page minority report from the expert group.</P>
      <P>Research is the seed corn for all our future industry and the oxygen we need if we are to survive.  How that research is directed is at least as important as producing the money for it.  The funding will be largely wasted if it is not driven by the marketplace itself.  In other words, the research must focus on existing or potential customer needs as its starting point.  Everything else is secondary. Quality is essential, of course, as is safety, nutritional value and the environmental dimension.  However, unless that research and the actions flowing from it are customer driven all the rest is a waste of time.</P>
      <P>It is hardly surprising in view of the noise I have been making about this issue for over a year that the press release announcing the increased funding contains many mentions of the marketplace, customer focus and so on.  However, in all honesty I am less than totally convinced that this need to be customer driven has been taken fully on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My doubt has been reinforced by the composition of the research committee which is going to drive the funding and set priorities for it.  I welcome the setting up of the committee and wish it well in its work.  However, I notice that of the ten members announced so far, only one <Col N="798" /> is from the market end of the food business. It was interesting to hear Senator Rory Kiely making a plea for representation of farmers.  I suppose everyone will want to be represented.  I am convinced that unless that committee is driven by people who are close the marketplace and customers, it will end up being production driven rather than market driven.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely also asked me if we had difficulty getting horticultural products in my stores.  I would not say it was difficult but we had to work very hard to do so.  We have had to establish long-term relationships and develop suppliers.  I am delighted to say that what used to be only a three or four month season for many horticultural products has now been stretched to seven, eight and nine months.  This means that the length of time when we must import has been greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>However, only one of the ten members of the research committee is from the marketplace; the rest are producers or representatives of Government agencies. With all due respect, this is not good enough.  Only two members of the export group were from the marketplace, of whom I was one.  We were two lonely voices crying in the wilderness, very much in minority of 14 or 15 people.  It was only by making a constant nuisance of ourselves at meetings that I managed to ensure that the perspective of the marketplace was heard and responded to.</P>
    <P>I am, however, encouraged to see that two further places on the research committee remain to be filled.  I urge the Minister to ensure that both of those places are filled by people who represent the marketplace and can, together with the one member already appointed, ensure that the issue of focusing on customer needs is always effectively addressed in the deliberations of that committee.  I hasten to add that I am not seeking a place on the board, I have more than enough on my plate at the moment. Anyway, I probably dirtied my bib after my minority report to the expert group.</P>
    <P>The issue in that minority report becomes immediately relevant as soon as <Col N="799" /> we move on from research funding to the wider area mentioned in this motion.  We have yet to see the full legislation setting up An Bord Bia, although I understand it is at an advanced stage.  It will put An Bord Bia under the control of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I have been very gratified by the widespread support I received in the past year for my argument that An Bord Bia should be anywhere but under the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to rehash the argument in detail tonight but my central point has always been that if the development of our food industry is left in the hands of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry it will always be restricted by the horizons of the producers of agricultural products instead of being driven by the needs of those who consume food products in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>For example, if the steel industry decided to make golf clubs to sell in the marketplace, I suggest that they would have great difficulty competing with golf clubs designed by Christy O'Connor.  If the steel industry decided to design stethoscopes for doctors in the Mater Hospital, they would have very little chance of designing the stethoscopes which the doctors would design themselves. In other words, if it is coming from the steel producers rather than from the marketplace, it has much less chance of succeeding.  The same applies to agricultural products.  Let us make sure that agricultural production is driven by the consumers rather than the producers.</P>
    <P>That is the fundamental issue facing An Bord Bia and the way it is addressed will dog that organisation throughout its life.  My position remains: tying it in any form to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is sending it into battle with one hand tied behind its back.  While I welcome what the Government has been doing and is about to do in relation to the report of the expert group, our national approach to food is not enough customer driven.  Until it becomes fully customer driven we will never realise the <Col N="800" /> potential to create wealth and, through that, jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion, I agree with what has been said by previous Senators, particularly the point Senator Quinn just made that we need to reverse the direction of our thoughts; start with the market and work backwards to production instead of the other way around.  However, that point is also supported by the expert group, the Culliton report and many other recent reports.  Senator Quinn's points are being taken on board now and that is also the emphasis of the Minister and the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>The Senator said that there are still places to be allocated so we will hold our breath.  It is essential that we look at this from that perspective.</P>
      <P>I do my shopping once a week and I assume many other Members go into a supermarket from time to time and are aware of what is on the shelves.  There have been many changes in that area, particularly in the amount of space given to different products.  A large amount of space is taken up by frozen and processed foods rather than primary foods in their raw state.  That is also true of many other European countries and the US.  We must respond to that change.</P>
      <P>Many other Senators made the point that we need to produce value added products.  The section on the food industry in the NESC report of November 1993 entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for Competitiveness, Growth and Employment&rdquo; stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the scale of Ireland's agricultural exports is such that commodities will continue to be a significant share of exports for the foreseeable future, it is only by pursuing a clear strategy of moving up the value chain that the contribution of the agri-food sector to the national economy <Col N="801" /> can be maximised and additional employment generated.</P>
    <P>That is basically what we all want.  It is only by pursuing a clear strategy of moving up the value chain that the contribution of the agri-food sector to the national economy can be maximised and additional employment generated.</P>
    <P>We all want to generate additional wealth and employment from the food sector.  In doing that we have to build on our strengths.  Our most obvious strength is the image of Ireland as a beautiful green country that produces food in a relatively undamaged and untarnished atmosphere.  We must build on that image and emphasise it when we market our products in this country and in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>We need to understand the difficulties in marketing.  My experience when shopping in supermarkets and small shops while on holidays is that one sees very few Irish products on the shelves in other countries.  There is a big market out there which we must tap into.  We represent a very small percentage of the European population and we must get into those markets and develop marketing strategies outside this country.  In doing that we need to understand how the marketing systems work in other countries and get into linkages and programmes to enable us to find a place to sell our products.  That is crucial.</P>
    <P>There are a number of value added products available in this country at present.  This area is developing nicely but we still have a long way to go.  Senator Kelly referred to the food centre outside Limerick in Raheen which is a good example of an emphasis on value added produce and processing.  One has products such as mustards, sauces, garlic butter, smoked salmon and others which take a basic ingredient and make something of it.  In the process jobs are created.  Sauces in particular seem to have mushroomed &mdash; that is probably a mixed metaphor.  I have certainly noticed an increase in the range of sauces available whether they are in jars or packets. <Col N="802" /> It is certainly an area of the market where there is much room for development.</P>
    <P>We have very fine products.  I was watching a food and drink programme on BBC recently which tested 23 different brands of rashers.  The brand which came out on top is made in Limerick.  We need to emphasise and develop our strengths.</P>
    <P>Beef export figures show that in 1973, 39 per cent of beef was exported on the hoof whereas in 1991 it was only 8 per cent.  This shows an improvement in processing and a reduction in live exports which obviously has a small spin off in terms of jobs.  It is much better to export food which is at least frozen or processed in some way and which creates jobs in this country.</P>
    <P>I noted a comparison with Denmark, where they have similar basic productivity. They have developed the value added side of the industry more than we have.  Perhaps we can learn from our fellow European countries, particularly as we produce the same kind of products as they do.</P>
    <P>The expert group to which we are referring in the motion recommended a number of specific ways forward.  Senator Calnan has gone into some of those in detail but the two important areas are the development of new products and training in the food industry.  Training is important because it is essential that people are up to date with developments. The food processing industry is one area that is always changing and there is a constant need to update people's knowledge and information.</P>
    <P>Other Senators, particularly Senator Kiely, referred to the problem of seasonality. It has also been emphasised by the expert group.  We need to focus on the problem of seasonality and supplying markets in accordance with that in Ireland and also lowering the cost of off season production.  Product development is an essential aspect of this.  It is also important that producers are paid for quality rather than quantity as this is an area where we fall down.  We tend to pay according to the number of cattle or sheep or the weight rather than the quality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> There is one other point in relation to the organic sector which has much potential.  The results of interesting study conducted in northern Europe were published today.  Admittedly it concerned a small sample but it suggested that the sperm count of men who ate organic food was twice that of those who did not.  That may be an indication that the organic food sector is on the way up, particularly for one half of the population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, which compliments the Government for the implementation of a number of the recommendations of the expert group on the food industry, particularly the announcement that £7 million is to provided for food research in 1994.  With all due respect, not much else has been done in this area.</P>
      <P>There are many recommendations. Today the legislation to set up An Bord Bia was introduced in the other House. It is interesting to note that when it was proposed that this new board would take over the running of the food industry, the information supplied and the Bill itself indicate that many aspects of the proposal, in so far as the recommendations are concerned, are being left outside the group and there will be a number of tiers.  CBF is being dismantled and a new livestock committee is to be established. The pros and cons of the operation of that committee remain to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear how this new organisation, which will be given powers by the Oireachtas, will work in reality.  We may find a similar situation to that of the National Roads Authority, which affects all local authorities in the allocation of grants for major road works in national primary and secondary roads.  We find information arriving on our desks at county <Col N="804" /> council level which states many of the ways in which funding was previously made available for staffing and projects no longer exist.  Our county council will be £0.5 million short.  A similar situation will arise when this new group is established. The present system, in so far as staffing is concerned, will be dismantled and many people will be left in a position where they can no longer be employed under the system.  I hope the Government will make a real effort to implement the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The beef sector is the second largest after the dairy industry.  Seasonality was pinpointed as being a real problem in this sector.  Factories do not have a continuous supply on a yearly basis to keep staff working.  To date there is no proposal to deal with that problem.  The group recommended that we should try to achieve 20 per cent of slaughtering in each of the first three quarters of the year.  It is far from the truth and it is not happening.  There is nothing in any of the proposals the Government have produced to date confront this issue.  At present, the price of steers in factories is running at £1.21 or £1.22 per pound.  If there was seasonality and an evenness of supply, the price would probably be in the region of £1.12 or £1.14.</P>
    <P>The other aspect which has added to the confusion is the retention period which the Department of Agriculture and Food still insists on for farmers who apply for animals under the beef premium. This has collected a problem which is now far worse than it was heretofore. Major work is needed if something positive is to be achieved in this area.</P>
    <P>The group highlighted the imbalances in the beef, milk production and other areas.  I consider £7 million a small amount if one considers that approximately £50 million has been made available through grant aid from Europe; 85 per cent of that £50 million has been invested in fixed assets in the last 12-18 months.  A substantial amount of money must be provided for the development of markets.  Research and development is a major part of ensuring that improved <Col N="805" /> products continue to come onto the market for ever more demanding consumers.</P>
    <P>Many people mentioned their areas and the excellent centres that are available around the country, although few remain.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the excellent work in beef research and production in Grange, County Meath.  It was almost an eleventh hour decision on the proposal to close that important venue.  God be with the man who decided, while on his way to his office, that the farm should be bought and an agricultural research centre provided. That is how the purchase came about, when an elegant gentleman was the Minister for Agriculture a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>I hope the developments which have commenced will go from strength to strength.  However, not enough has been done to deal with the recommendations in the expert group's report on the agriculture and food industry.  There is no point in experts producing such reports if years are spent implementing their recommendations.  If we spend years implementing the recommendations of this report, the markets will have changed dramatically and we will still be behind.  However, we have excellent brands and superb work is being done.  I hope merger negotiations, that are due to take place across the country, are the way forward for the protection of many jobs and the improvement of products so that we can take advantage of the many extra markets that will be available throughout Europe and further afield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I agree with other Senators that this is a useful motion which gives us an opportunity to express our views regarding the food industry, past, present and future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of County Donegal depend to a large extent on the food industry. Given our environment, we pride ourselves on our potential to increase the number of jobs across the board.  We <Col N="806" /> have one of the highest levels of lamb production in the country.  There is room for vast improvement in the beef, pork, poultry and mushroom areas, as has been mentioned.  We had a niche in the market with Donegal Catch as a brand name for fish and we are doing reasonably well. The people of County Donegal have a particular interest in this motion and the provision that has been made for the food industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £7 million for research.  However, I am concerned about how it will be allocated and spent because it is easy to waste expenditure in this area.  Many of the organisations that carried out research work in the past did not provide good value for money.  I hope the money that is being provided for research will be carefully monitored by the Minister and the Department and that interim reports can be expected.  I hope the House will have an opportunity at a further date to express its views and comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>County Donegal has one of the highest number of salmon farming businesses in the country.  They make a significant contribution to jobs and to the wealth of the county.  The sector has major potential and will benefit from market research, sales promotion and the general development of the food industry.  I could list many other areas.</P>
    <P>We have problems at present in so far as we are finding it difficult to satisfy the Germans that our beef is healthy and clean.  However, this is more of a political problem.  I listened to a programme recently and a senior veterinary inspector in Germany said that he had no difficulty with the health of Irish beef, rather that it was a matter for the Government and Cabinet Ministers to make a decision.  I sense that there are political implications, in addition to the regulations, and this is important.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke criticised the record of Fianna Fáil in Government regarding its support for the food industry.  Everybody realises that Fianna Fáil in Government has no need to defend its stance in this regard.  It supported the building up of co-operatives in this country to the point <Col N="807" /> where we are second to none and major players.  I am pleased that the co-operatives are among the best in the world. They are already taking business interests in other countries, such as the United States of America.  The Fianna Fáil Party in Government has played a major role.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the criticism levelled at Larry Goodman.  He has been worth his weight in gold to this country.  He was a risk taker, although he did not always succeed or win.  He was a salesman and one of the best people we had in marketing Irish products since we started to export food.  I do not take kindly to those who make cheap jibes at Larry Goodman. He had financial difficulties. However, if he had not been a risk taker, he would not have experienced those difficulties. He could have sat back and been complacent but he was a major player on the world scene and did well.  We should not criticise him.  It is very easy to be a knocker.</P>
    <P>Somebody said we are not doing enough for our fishing industry.  The best example of what we are doing for this industry is Joey Murrin, the senior spokesman for the fishermen in Killybegs. He had been consistently critical of the fact that not enough was being done and most of his criticism was valid. Recently, however, he complimented the Minister, Deputy Andrews, on his support for the fishing industry.  For the record, he is out campaigning for the Minister of State, Deputy Pat &ldquo;The Cope&rdquo; Gallagher because of the commitment and support Deputy Gallagher gave to the fishing industry in Donegal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator Quinn says he had to work hard to get Irish food products on <Col N="808" /> the shelves I have no difficulty in accepting his sincerity because he is committed to selling Irish products as far as he can. I would ask him, however, to work a bit harder because he is a major player in the retail food business.  I compliment him on his success, his contribution, the quality of his shops and their presentation. The contribution he is making to the food industry is invaluable.  He is one of the best people in the business but how can we justify importing Danish jam, Dutch potatoes and cheese, English apples, etc., when the Irish product can be bought at competitive prices?</P>
    <P>The small producer must get help.  I am not referring to Senator Feargal Quinn or his company but &mdash; and maybe I should not say this &mdash; the small producers are finding it difficult to get paid by major chain stores.  Thirty days' credit is reasonable for a small producer but major players in the food industry were taking 60 days and more to pay.  It came to point where the small producer could not compete unless he was paid within a reasonable time.  Hopefully that situation has been rectified.  I am not referring to Senator Quinn because he was not on the list to which I referred.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of work still to be done. We are talking about one of our major industries.  If we are to provide jobs for our young people we must have a professional approach to the food industry. There are many jobs with far better opportunities.  We have an environment and a climate going for us.  We want to educate our young people that an inferior product will not be accepted anywhere, but we can compete with the best.  The provision of funding for research and the promotion of the food industry is very welcome.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith ar ais sa Seanad chun labhairt ar an rún tábhachtach seo.  Fáiltím roimh an rún agus tugaim lán-tacaíocht dó.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome and support this motion. There is no doubt but that the food industry is one of the most important sectors <Col N="809" /> of Irish industry.  It accounts for 22 per cent of total exports and about 20 per cent of all manufacturing jobs and consistently generates a positive trade balance. Output from the industry, which in 1992 was estimated at £7.6 billion, is based almost entirely on indigenous raw materials.  The employment which it provides is relatively more important in Ireland than in any other EU member state.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group on the food industry is perhaps the most comprehensive review ever undertaken of the Irish food industry.  The expert group was established in response to a recommendation in the Culliton report that such a group be set up to prepare a national food industry development plan.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the Government's confidence in the potential and ability of the food industry to create additional national wealth and employment that even before the expert group had submitted its recommendations a commitment was given, in the Programme for a Partnership Government, to implement a development programme for the food industry following consideration of these recommendations. That commitment was honoured less than six months later when, following consideration of the expert group's report, the Government accepted the broad thrust of its recommendations and gave approval for the preparation of a new national programme for the industry as well as legislation to set up a new food promotion and marketing development agency.  A reaffirmation of that commitment was subsequently enshrined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the expert group's report constitutes the most wide ranging and comprehensive study ever undertaken of the food industry.  The group itself was representative of all sectors of the industry and in the course of its deliberations it examined all aspects of the food industry.  These included the problem of seasonality of raw material supplies, over-reliance on intervention and commodity markets, investment aid <Col N="810" /> policy, the institutional framework within which the industry operates and the issue of research and technology as well as the external and domestic factors likely to influence the industry's future development.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of its examination the group made a substantial number of recommendations all of which had the same basic objective, that is, to promote within the food industry a sustained switch to a consumer oriented policy. The group also set targets against which progress in the achievement of that objective could be measured and it further recommended a more integrated approach towards the provision of development aid and other supports for the industry.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Government's response to the expert group's report was to authorise the drawing up of a new national programme for the food industry based on the group's recommendations.  I am happy to be able to tell this House that work on the preparation of that programme which has been undertaken under my supervision over the past few months is now complete.</P>
    <P>The new programme which will cover the period up to 1999 will take the form of a special sub-programme in the next round of Structural Funds.  The £7 million funding which I announced last week for institutional research and development, and which relates to one year only, represents but a small element of the total amount to be provided under the sub-programme. Pending finalisation of the negotiations with the EU Commission I am not in a position to say precisely what that total amount will be but I can assure the House that it will be substantial.</P>
    <P>As recommended by the expert group, the food sub-programme will cover four main areas &mdash; capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion and human resources. The capital investment measure will assist food companies to invest in new facilities for more diversified production and will enable them to expand, modernise and upgrade their existing facilities. <Col N="811" /> In any industry research is the key to successful development but in the food industry this is an area which in the past has not had sufficient emphasis nor a sufficiently focused approach.  The food sub-programme has at its core a much greater commitment to research both in terms of public and private resources.</P>
    <P>Two separate research and development measures are being provided for, one covering institutional research and development and the other in-company research and development.  As is evident from the committee which I named last week, the sub-programme also aims to give the industry the predominant say in how public research resources are to be used.  This is essential to ensure that while public food research is adequately catered for, its direction is clearly influenced by market requirement and consumer preferences.</P>
    <P>Apart from the food sub-programme, the other main recommendation made by the expert group was that a new food promotion agency be established and that its activities be part funded by the Structural Funds.  On that score, I have good news.  First, the legislation to establish the new agency, An Bord Bia, was introduced in the Dáil yesterday.  Secondly, provision is made in the sub-programme for the allocation of a significant level of funding to it.</P>
    <P>The final element in the sub-programme is human resources and here the bulk of the expenditure will be on in-service training.  As I said earlier, the legislation to set up An Bord Bia has been introduced in the Dáil.  I hope it will not be too long before it arrives to this House.  In line with the recommendations of the expert group the new agency will be formed by amalgamating CBF, the food marketing and promotion functions of ABT and the export market development functions of An Bord Glas in so far as these relate to edible horticultural produce.  As the review of BIM's activities is currently taking place it has not been possible to reach a conclusion on the transfer of its export market development and promotion functions to the new <Col N="812" /> board.  However, the Bill contains an enabling provision which will facilitate such transfer at a later date if this should be deemed appropriate.</P>
    <P>The expert group recommended that funding for An Bord Bia should be provided through a combination of Structural Funds, State grant-in-aid, industry levies and client fees.  Structural Funds money will be provided via the food sub-programme. Provision for the other funding elements is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, the other significant feature of the Bill is that it provides for the establishment of subsidiary boards to deal with the main product sectors, including a subsidiary board specially designed to maintain the product focus and the linkages with producers and consumers in the meat and livestock sector that have worked well in CBF.</P>
    <P>Apart from the food sub-programme and An Bord Bia, there are a number of other less obvious but nonetheless important recommendations in the expert group's report which are being implemented by my Department on an ongoing basis.  I have established a group within the Department to monitor progress on the implementation of the report, liaison arrangements have been established with a number of other Departments and I hope to be in a position very shortly to announce the establishment of new working groups to deal specifically with the areas of food ingredients and prepared consumer foods.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that the actions which I have just described represent not only satisfactory progress in the implementation of the expert group's recommendations but a very long term commitment indeed to the food industry. The Government is firmly set on maintaining that commitment to a sector which has already achieved a striking degree of development in recent years and which, provided it continues to develop its consumer orientation, has the potential to contribute greatly to the national economy in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus roimh an rún.  I welcome the <Col N="813" /> motion.  My only quibble with it is that it does not go far enough.  It talks about maintaining commitment to the food industry and to research in the food industry.  We need intensified or enhanced commitment over the five or six year period.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the £7 million funding for this year represents a small element of the total amount to be provided. I hope that will be the case.  Even with £7 million, the level of investment in research in the food industry falls far below levels in comparable countries.  It also falls below what its target figure ought to be in the context of the importance of the food industry in the industrial sector.  In view of those criteria and in view of the relative backwardness of research, there is much ground to be recovered.  I hope the opportunity to expand that funding programme will arise in due course.</P>
      <P>It is true that Irish firms in the food industry are large by our standards. However, they are modest by international standards.  Research funding within firms is also very low by international standards.  While I accept the importance of the food industry in this country, there is much scope to improve its potential performance.  In that context Appendix 3 of the report by the expert group on the food industry, which refers to research in agriculture and food, is excellent.  It has not received much publicity but it is an admirable summary of the principles that ought to guide the deliberations of the group set up by the Minister.  I hope that group will take cognisance of the criteria and principles articulated there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some disturbing points are made.  The quality of research may be declining despite the undoubted quality of many of the individuals in the area.  The decline may be due in part to the embargo on recruitment and the difficulty in getting gifted young people into that sector.  I am told that the restrictions on recruitment &mdash; which are rigidly applied &mdash; have prevented Moorepark from undertaking contracts for which it was commissioned because it did not have the staff.  If one <Col N="814" /> talks about this scale of investment in research one ought to ensure that the research institutions can recruit the best possible staff and that they can counter the ageing of research workers.  Shortages of funding for recruitment is a problem for research in general.  It also affects Teagasc and, to some extent, the universities. I hope that problem can be confronted and that the urgent need for the recruitment of relevant first class people will not be obstructed by general guidelines about recruitment to the public service.</P>
    <P>It is also important, as Senator McGowan rightly stressed, that the allocation of the funding be rigorously controlled. It should be decided on the best possible criteria which are to be established by the research committee.  In particular, the fragmentation which characterises so much research effort &mdash; not only in the food sector but in every other sector &mdash; in this country must, as far as possible, be minimised and overcome. There are references in the report to existing linkages &mdash; I am familiar with the Teagasc/UCC link &mdash; which are striving to do this.  Progress is being made in that regard.</P>
    <P>This work, in which barriers are broken down between institutions with different cultures and different &ldquo;turfs&rdquo; to protect, is unspectacular but very important. We are far too small to fritter away the research resources at our disposal on turf wars.  I am not referring to the bureaucratic brawling at governmental level, which is an independent turf war. There is also research brawling and academic brawling at research level.  I am told that is being overcome and that distinct progress is being made.  That would be very important to the effective implementation of this programme.  It is possible for substantial moneys to be frittered away on duplication or on people pursuing hobby horses which do not have the market impact about which Senator Quinn spoke so eloquently.</P>
    <P>I hope those points are taken on board by the expert committee.  I hope the Department &mdash; I have heard good reports of its commitment in this area &mdash; will be <Col N="815" /> involved actively with the research group and that co-operation, which is crucial, will be fostered and sustained.</P>
    <P>The appendix to the report states that research gaps should be identified in priority areas and that we should build on existing strengths by using interdisciplinary teams to achieve critical mass in selected sectors of the research effort. The language is rather abstract but it refers to something crucial: that the most substantial value possible be secured for the research effort and it should not be once again frittered away.</P>
    <P>That will involve turning down applications. We are reluctant to say no as a result of our historical experience, original sin, our genes or something of that order.  However, we must learn to say no, as must this committee.  It cannot dole out money for ideas, however intrinsically interesting they may appear to their proposers around the country.  The committee must focus on research projects which will succeed in the marketplace within a reasonable length of time.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Quinn's remarks on this subject.  He said we must cater for existing and potential market needs, but I would lay more stress on anticipating market needs.  One possible strength we have not fully exploited is to anticipate market needs.  We should allow some funding for this purpose so that we are not lagging behind and imitating others but are sometimes pioneering.</P>
    <P>I wish the project well.  It has had a good beginning.  The members of the research committee are well chosen and I look forward with a great deal of optimism to the committee producing effective results in the medium term future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago we discussed a report on small businesses. Reports are well and good but funding must be allocated and they must be expeditiously implemented.  From this point of view, £7 million for research is a modest sum when one considers the overall context of agriculture and its contribution <Col N="816" /> to the economy; but it constitutes an acknowledgement and a start.</P>
      <P>For far too long we have concentrated on marketing, which is important, but one can only rely on it to a certain extent. We need new products and we need to be innovative, to anticipate markets and look for potential markets.  We have been falling behind in this work.  We have successfully marketed products but they have had a short shelf life, in that a market changes just as we achieve maximum market potential.  I welcome the setting up of the expert group and their recommendations.</P>
      <P>Agriculture has contributed a great deal to the Irish economy.  The Minister said it accounted for 20 per cent of our exports, but we must also look on it from the point of view of net value.  Agricultural products contribute a large amount as raw natural materials mainly produced within the state.  This is an important factor which is sometimes overlooked.</P>
      <P>We can market and research as much as we like but we must face other vital issues.  Germany is currently contemplating banning British beef from its market.  If this happens it will be a sad day for the EU.  However, should it happen, Ireland should also put up its barriers to safeguard its disease-free status.  If the Germans breach regulations, we should defend our natural resources.  Our present disease-free status is important to the country.  Live exports have made a large contribution towards building up markets and breaking into markets in vacuum packed meats, etc.</P>

      <P>It has been said that this Government and previous Governments have not contributed to agriculture, which is a farcical suggestion.  CAP reform and the GATT deal have been <Col N="817" /> successfully negotiated by Ireland.  Farmers and people involved in food processing will agree that the <i>status quo</i> could not have continued and changes had to happen.  It must be stressed that this year and the previous year have been successful for dairy and beef farmers, and for tillage farmers to a lesser extent.</P>
      <P>Apart from peat, Ireland's only natural resources are our population, agriculture, and our ability to adapt.  If we research and adapt, agriculture and food processing will have an important part to play in our economy in the future and will make a great contribution to employment. Agriculture has been seen for too long as a poor relation in terms of providing employment.  Multinationals were brought in but ultimately small producers and small holdings contribute more.  As with small businesses, we are getting back to basics in this area.</P>
      <P>When the senior Minister, Deputy Walsh, goes to Cabinet before the next budget, I hope this allocation is greatly increased, because this is one area where Ireland can be extremely successful in international markets.</P>

      <P>Guím fáilte chuig an Aire. This debate gives us a useful opportunity and I welcome the motion.  I am not fully informed on all the terms of the motion and I noticed the Minister said the £7 million was available for institutional research.  I assume this means the official State institutions will receive this funding, or can the Minister say if this is also available to the private sector?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">

      <P>I thank the Minister.  I assumed that was the position but I wanted to have it verified and I am glad that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator Lee was speaking I was reminded of his book, <i>Ireland: 1912-1985,</i> which I had the pleasure of reading. <Col N="818" /> In the book he made strong points in his analysis of the development of the Irish economy from the early days of the State and criticised the lack of research carried out by institutions at a critical time in our history.  This evening he said the amount of money given towards research in Ireland today is minimal compared to the amount given in countries against which we are competing.  It is good that institutions are now beginning to develop that strength.</P>
    <P>We were slow to join the food processing industry.  We were amateurs in the mid-1970s and it is only in recent years that we have developed expertise in this area.  Twenty years ago we were happy to produce food in commodity form for the world markets.  One reason for that is the structure of our population &mdash; the home market is so small it is difficult to raise money in Ireland to increase our sophistication.  I am glad to see this injection of funds into our institutions so we can get programmes running.</P>
    <P>My county is much involved in the food industry, particularly in poultry, mushrooms and dairying.  It has always been my fear that medium sized Irish companies were not willing to invest in people with an expertise in research.  For too long they were content to take the amateur approach.  Since we were so late into the field, our competitors, such as Denmark, had come up with sophisticated developments 30 years before we started thinking about this area and companies who delayed suffered as a result.</P>
    <P>We need to put a lot of money into the development of sophisticated products and we need to push hard in the area of research, development and marketing of goods.  A sum of £7 million is a small amount of money in the context of the food industry.  We are not talking about using a large percentage of the industry's gross product in research and development. I agree with Senator Lee that we are not putting enough money into this area.  In addition, our marketing strength has not been supported by sufficient cash. We do not make serious efforts in this regard.  I do not know what the problems <Col N="819" /> are but our priorities are blurred.  We lag behind other countries which use their resources in this area.  We have aspirations but they are never backed up by serious efforts.  This money will have a substantial input and the Minister wants this to continue.</P>
    <P>We have many worries at present.  The poultry, bacon and pork industries have been under stress for a long time.  The pork and bacon industries are experiencing difficulties because there is oversupply in Europe and the structure of Irish industry makes this more difficult. The smaller producers are finding it difficult to survive because there is a lack of economies of scale.  Many people will leave this industry and it would be no harm to establish economies of scale. Because I live in an area where many producers are suffering, I cannot forget the human element.</P>
    <P>The poultry sector is experiencing the same problem.  There is a war going on between the processor and the producer. Processors are trying to reduce the amount they pay to the primary producers. The cost of feed is a problem for them.  Perhaps the Minister could examine this area in detail and introduce a subsidy because we are paying £20 a tonne more for feed than our competitors. This is an enormous disadvantage and there is a danger that if we cannot supply the home market with our chickens, they will be imported from England and Northern Ireland.  Our difficulties should not be understated.  I ask the Minister to consider introducing a subsidy.  I am sure the officials in Brussels would not object to an examination of this area because it involves cost penalties.</P>
    <P>We are small exporters of chicken.  I know of one company which exports heavier chickens to England but this is uneconomical. No other company will do this because there is little profit to be made. If these industries were damaged, my constituency would suffer greatly because many people are involved in the poultry, pork and bacon sectors.  We would welcome a subsidy which would <Col N="820" /> allow the poultry industry to continue at its current level of production.  It would also give us a breathing space because restructuring must take place.  We must continue to improve efficiency and costs and we must restructure the industry.  I hope the Minister will consider this issue.</P>
    <P>There are duck and quail industries in County Monaghan.  Perhaps the Minister would also consider the possibility of designating some part of the county as a food park because of our success in this area.  We should play to our strengths and a food park around Lough Egish would be an excellent and wise development.</P>
    <P>I am sure we will have other opportunities to debate this issue.  Many good ideas have been put forward and I hope our efforts will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is great to debate a motion on which we all agree.  It would be impossible to be against food research. I welcome the Minister's statement and his commitment to research in the food industry and I support what Senator Lee said.  We must be careful, as I said in relation to medical research, not to apply the sprinkler approach, to think that if we sprinkle money around different areas we will get something out of it.  The products and methods of production must be carefully considered and we must back possible winners.  Some people must accept the fact that their pet projects will not get backing while others will.  This is an expensive area to get into and products which might be successful must be supported.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's comments about the consumer and his needs.  This is very important when it comes to food research.  It is ridiculous to have a product if you cannot sell it.  I urge the Minister to involve more consumers in what he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talked about producing for the export market.  We have had import substitution, but has anyone considered how we can change the market in a way which would not only help the food industry but may also improve the health of the population?  Yesterday I received a copy <Col N="821" /> of the &ldquo;Happy Heart National Survey&rdquo;. This survey looked at men and women between 30 and 70 years of age and at the important areas which cause heart disease.  As I said before, we have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than other countries, apart from Scotland and Finland, and we would like to change this statistic.</P>
    <P>While our eating habits have improved, this improvement has taken place in areas where effort has been made in educating people about healthier products and in making these products more readily available.  Until recently it was difficult to get good vegetables in many towns.  I know that sounds ridiculous but I was told it was more simple to get first class products in Dublin than in the smaller towns.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem with the way we cook our food.  People often cook food to make it more tasty.  Under EU food regulations, flavour is No. 8 on the list, while the shelf life is No. 1.  Surely the flavour is the most important?  For example, 60 per cent of people eat boiled or baked potatoes, which are better for them; however, 35 per cent eat chips or roast potatoes.  One does not need good quality potatoes for chips or roasting, but they do for boiling or baking.  Those who have boiled or baked potatoes know what I mean.  It is sad that 46 per cent of the people surveyed do not eat salads.  These must be readily available and of good quality before one will eat them.  A half dead lettuce is not appetising.  It is a question of making these goods available.</P>
    <P>Home grown vegetables have undergone a dramatic change and we should praise An Bord Glas in this regard.  We should be able to manage without imported vegetables at any time of the year.  Senator Quinn spoke about seasons being extended from three to four months to seven months.  Excellent vegetables produced in this country are now available.</P>
    <P>Another area mentioned this evening was the meat industry.  I do not want Senator McGowan's friend, Mr. Larry Goodman, coming after me.  However, a <Col N="822" /> change to chicken and fish would be useful.  Some 25 per cent of the population do not eat fish.  An improvement in this area would not only benefit the fishing industry, which was discussed this evening, but also our general health.  If more people ate chicken, it would improve the home market because at present a lot of chicken is imported from Northern Ireland.  Many chicken products which I have bought have come from there.  We should encourage this area.</P>
    <P>When improving the home market, we should also take note of another report on food supplements and health foods which was sent to the Minister's Department and the Department of Health. Senator O'Sullivan spoke about organic foods, which are normal health foods. However, we should be careful about some foods described as health products which are not regulated.  Some of these foods contain vitamins and minerals which exceed the recommended daily dose of what is considered suitable. There is little legislation covering this area and this should be looked at.  Some of these vitamins and minerals may be toxic if too high a dosage is taken.  The labelling and packaging requirements of these products are vague and are not regulated by anyone.</P>
    <P>A section of the report discusses dietary fads and extravagant claims of a medicinal nature made by health foods.  The report contains a long list, including bee pollen, which is a source of youth and health and is an energy pill for athletes. Does anyone really know what bee pollen does?  It lists germanium as an essential nutrition, while alfalfa tablets are used for the treatment of arthritis.  These products are listed as medicinal; yet if medicinal recommendations are given, should these products not be looked at by the National Drugs Advisory Board, because some may have toxic effects? Herbal tea is also mentioned.</P>
    <P>Many of these products have been withdrawn in America because some have carcinogenic effects if taken in large enough amounts.  When research is being done, I hope regulations will be considered in regard to the extravagant <Col N="823" /> claims of these products and the possibility of toxicity.  Various South American teas sold here are described as being good for candida, yet there is no anti-candidal activity in them and they are highly cytotoxic.  I suggest the research team could look at exotic products being offered, while at the same time encourage the consumption of our organic products which Senator O'Sullivan discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to sum up this motion.  The Minister mentioned points made at the outset and he dealt with them comprehensively.  Everyone in the House appreciates the importance of the food industry in regard to farming, horticulture, the glasshouse sector, poultry production and fishing.  These indigenous industries are important and everyone welcomes research in this area.</P>
      <P>Work done by the expert group was welcomed by Senators and its recommendations have been taken seriously by Government, the Department of Agriculture and the Minister with responsibility for food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of jobs has been stressed. Because of set-aside and other quota regulations, jobs may be lost in the primary sector.  These jobs must be substituted with others in the manufacturing sector.  The importance of added value has also been stressed.  In the past it was sufficient for the agricultural industry to export the side of beef and the lump of butter, but that is no longer the case.  We need to properly market, package and <Col N="824" /> promote our produce.  I glad the Minister said these matters will be considered.</P>
    <P>I refer to the county enterprise partnership boards and their role in job creation.  Many small enterprises may be assisted as they are not primary producers. Because they play a secondary role, moneys and assistance may be provided by the county enterprise partnership boards to help them develop.  I hope the county enterprise partnership boards are doing this work throughout the country.  I know this happening in my area.</P>
    <P>We will be able to discuss other matters relating to this motion when legislation regarding An Bord Bia comes before the House in the near future.  An important point made related to seasonality.  Many industries are geared towards a certain time of the year.  It is important that these industries become perennial rather than seasonal because they then would provide continuity of work and those laid off would not need to depend on social welfare schemes to survive.  If the seasonality factor was removed and year round jobs were provided, it would be better for the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House.</P>
