      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to extend throughout the State the facility whereby telephone calls to all Government offices, regardless of location, are charged at local call rates.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to give the up to date position on Phase 2 of the Mayo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule Senator Burke's matter out of order as it is repetitious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1.  It is hoped to conclude all Stages.  There will also be a two hour debate on Item 2.  I suggest 20 minutes <Col N="646" /> for spokespersons and ten minutes thereafter.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House wishes to extend its good wishes for a speedy recovery to our former colleague, Deputy Michael Ferris.  I understand he has undergone surgery in the past two days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, we join with the good wishes for a speedy recovery to Deputy Ferris in South Africa.</P>
      <P>The matter of South Africa was raised yesterday.  It was proposed to debate it as soon as possible, particularly to learn from the experiences of our colleagues who had the honour of helping with the election there.  If this is to be of value, it should be done soon.  I formally suggest that it is debated.</P>
      <P>I also raise the matter of the defamation Bill.  Unusually, it was published by the National Newspapers Association of Ireland this week and presented to the Taoiseach.  We had a debate on this some time ago and the Minister, Deputy Taylor, said at that stage that, while he felt the subject was worthy of consideration, it was very far down the list of his priorities and his Department was not in a position to publish a Bill on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Newspapers Association has gone to the trouble of having a Bill published by Mr. Marcus Burke, a former parliamentary draftsman.  It would be highly unusual for a Bill published by an outside group to be taken as a Bill either by the Government or the Opposition as their own Bill.  I would certainly not propose that, but since the NNAI has gone to the trouble and expense of having a Bill prepared on a matter which is certainly of interest to all Members and is of public importance, I would ask the Leader if we could provide two hours over the coming weeks to debate the main issues in this Bill and to see if there is some way, if the House thought it proper, that this matter could be progressed further.  It is unusual to have a Bill published by an outside group and I am not sure what procedure we would follow.  Perhaps we could have a <Col N="647" /> debate to discuss the issues in the Bill and if it is thought appropriate we could take it further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was concerned yesterday by the very short notice we were given in regard to Government amendments.  I have given a lot of thought to it and it seems to me that this House has not been earning the respect of those who are responsible in various areas.  I am actually placing the blame on ourselves. I propose that the Leader takes into account that part of our duty and responsibility is to earn the right to play a role in our primary function of legislation. We have a different role to play than the Lower House.  Therefore, while our primary role is that of legislation, in order to earn that, we should find time in the next few weeks to debate some items that are not urgent.  This is exactly the role that this House can play if we are to earn the regard, respect and therefore the responsibility of that primary function in the future.</P>
      <P>Let me take three items that come to mind which are not urgent.  One is the enlargement of the European Union. That was passed by the European Parliament yesterday, will now be the subject of referenda in each of the four states and will come back to us to be ratified before the end of the year.  We should be debating that question this month for two reasons.  First, it would be away from the immediacy of the moment when enlargement occurs later in the year, and, secondly, to send out a welcoming hand to those four new member states who are due to hold referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could also discuss the role of the United Nations.  Now is the time for us to debate that role, so I would urge the Leader to find time for such a debate this month.  The role of the UN has changed from peace-keeping to peace-making.  A third point &mdash; though it is almost too late now to avoid the immediacy of it &mdash; would be a debate on the banking requirements for this nation.  I am not saying that we should do it together with the debate that is going on at the <Col N="648" /> moment.  It would have been much better to have done this earlier.  The world of banking is changing and we in this House need to play a role and recognise how credit unions, building societies and banks are changing.  It too late to do that when a sudden crisis occurs and we may well find ourselves debating one particular aspect of that.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Leader to find time this month to debate items such as the United Nations, the enlargement of the European Union and the banking system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the absolute necessity of putting as much pressure as we can on the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity to deal with the major problem that has emerged in Rwanda. Over 500,000 people are in one camp on the Rwandan border and the figure is growing every day.  It is a major crisis, but the United Nations has not done its job in protecting the people.  We will not have done our job either unless we put pressure on to ensure that the UN and African countries deal with this major problem.  The African continent is blowing up around us and we are doing nothing about it.  Unless we put pressure on, nobody else will.  I would ask the Leader either to have an emergency debate on that matter or at least to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to put as much pressure as he can on anybody who can deal with that problem.</P>
      <P>It would be appropriate on the day after the signing of the peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians to send our congratulations to both nations for getting this matter to the beginning of peace in that area.  In a sense it is a great achievement for the Palestinians that at last they have part of a state.  I hope that in future they will together bring peace to that whole area.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to send our good wishes for a speedy recovery to Deputy Michael Ferris.  As regards Item <Col N="649" /> 2, I think that ten minutes is very little time, particularly for Senator Sherlock and myself, to debate the health strategy. I would ask the Leader if we could have 15 minutes.  I support Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on Rwanda, where the situation is urgent.  As a nation we should be seen to do something, because nobody seems to be doing anything about the crisis.  If the United Nations is to be seen as an effective body, some action must be taken in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a totally unrelated matter, as the House will be aware, the Leader paid tribute to RTE's technical brilliance last Saturday in the Eurovision Song Contest, which I enthusiastically support.  Although I was present, I would also like, in the context of remarks made in the Lower House by the party leaders, to ask the Leader to convey our congratulations and pay tribute to Charlie McGettigan and Paul Harrington on their outstanding achievement.  As the House will be aware, Charlie McGettigan is an adopted son of Drumshanbo in Leitrim, thousands of whose people turned out on Monday last to give him a traditional Irish welcome.  It is an outstanding achievement for somebody from a small rural area.  The pride that was manifested by the people of the region and of Ireland generally should be recognised and recorded in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if it would be possible to initiate a debate on the drugs situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We had it yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a debate I have called for on a number of occasions.  It is not a city problem, but one that is relevant to every small town in the country. People who start off with soft drugs end up with hard drugs.  We should have a debate on this before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise three things. First, I want to support the proposal made by Senator Manning that we should discuss the whole issue of defamation, <Col N="650" /> press freedom and civil liberty.  It is an issue which is raised by the Bill and the submission from the NNAI.  The debate should be initiated in this House.</P>
      <P>Second, Senator Lanigan raised an issue that I have also raised, that of Rwanda and Burundi.  It is quite horrific that a quarter of a million people have had to flee their homes and upwards of 200,000 people have been slaughtered. The world has done nothing.  That is an extraordinary indictment of the so-called civilised world as well as being an indication of the impotency of the United Nations.  Something has to be done.  This would be a good place to have a debate to highlight the Irish people's concern about these horrors.</P>
      <P>The third issue is that of the CFSP, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, which has been raised by the issue of Maastricht and the enlargement process. There is no debate in this country at this time on the issue, though it is the most fundamental and important one we will face in 1996.  In the contextual debate on enlargement we should have statements from the Government on the implications for this nation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  We should have a full day's debate on this.  We would be serving the people well if we initiated the debate because it touches on neutrality and a series of other things.  It is of fundamental importance to the future of Europe and to statehood itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Senators in sending good wishes to Deputy Michael Ferris, our former colleague.  If one looks at the health profile of Members of the Oireachtas, there is a high risk of heart disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator can make an extensive contribution on Item 2.  I am sure the Minister will be anxious to hear the Senator's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been rather pusillanimous.  It has spent a large amount of money redecorating Government Buildings but it lost courage at the <Col N="651" /> last minute and left out the most important element for the health of Members and staff of the Oireachtas &mdash; the gymnasium. Why do we not have the courage to spend money wisely by looking after the health of Members and staff?  We could do with a gym because we lead stressful lives.  A gym might prevent other people from suffering heart attacks.</P>
    <P>I was not surprised to hear Drumshanbo praised, although I was surprised that it did not happen yesterday.  The comment was well merited.  Watching the Eurovision Song Contest I was very proud of this small country with its small broadcasting station and its small towns such as Drumshanbo which produced such wonderful talent.  We can be very proud.</P>
    <P>I do not agree entirely with Senator Quinn's comments.  We have not lost the respect of Government &mdash; we never had it.  That is not our fault.  I am not one of these masochistic, self-punishing people and I did not think Senator Quinn was either.  The loss of respect has arisen for a variety of reasons with which I will not burden the House.  We have played our role and Senator Quinn demonstrated that wonderfully when, during his first couple of weeks in the House, he succeeded in amending Government legislation. That was quite an achievement. That is the role of this House.  I have seen it work previously in circumstances where it was allowed to work.  However, it is important that we discuss general issues in this House in addition to amending legislation.</P>
    <P>We should have regular monthly debates on foreign affairs.  It is a subject of obvious concern to all Members of the House and it would be useful to have monthly debates on it.  We should also have regular debates on Northern Ireland.  Perhaps the Leader of the House would consider my suggestion.  The question of a common foreign security policy is being discussed in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs at present.  A group of us had a meeting with the President of Austria this morning and that was one of the questions we discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators in extending good wishes to Deputy Michael Ferris.  I did not know until today that he had undergone a heart bypass operation.  The situation in South Africa has been mentioned and I support wholeheartedly the sentiments expressed.  The development of democracy in South Africa is one of the great occurrences of recent times.</P>
      <P>Another momentous occurrence is the signing of the peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians.  I visited the West Bank and Gaza with a delegation some years ago and I did not think a treaty could be negotiated such was the fierce hostility in the area at the time.  Yet the treaty has been signed.</P>
      <P>The situation in Northern Ireland is out of control.  It must be admitted that it is out of control when people are being gunned down on the street as they travel to and from work.  It is about time that the authorities did something about controlling paramilitaries in the North of Ireland.</P>
      <P>When is it proposed to introduce a statement or policy on the signing of the Charter for Self Local Government?  It is part of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Until the charter is signed, local government will not have the meaningful role it should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whip has started to make arrangements for a debate on South Africa and on the enlargement of the EU.  We hope those matters will be discussed in the next couple of weeks.  I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss the defamation Bill.  If I remember correctly, it was discussed in the context of a Fianna Fáil motion during Private Members' Business last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject Senator Quinn's views.  The Minister told the House yesterday that there were certain difficulties in bringing forward amendments.  She recognised those difficulties by ensuring that the amendments were not be dealt with until Report Stage.  The Seanad has been to the fore in its debates during recent months.  The Senator mentioned some topics and I can assure him that we are <Col N="653" /> keen to discuss them as soon as possible. We have debated at length East Timor, the small business sector, Developing the West Together and other issues.  The House has done itself proud in that regard.  The Seanad dealt with 36 amendments to the road traffic legislation and that demonstrates the relevance of this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the health of Members, I support Senator Norris's sentiments. We will encourage the Minister to include gym facilities under Members' facilities as they are outlined in the brochure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to introduce the Health (Amendment) Bill to the Seanad today.  The Bill is part of the legislative Programme for a Partnership Government and is an integral component of a comprehensive plan to develop the dental services in the country.  In this context the Government has agreed to proposals submitted by me as the basis for the development of an integrated and co-ordinated dental plan which would be implemented over the next four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that this area of the health services requires investment to enable it to respond to the dental health needs of the population.  Progress has been made over recent years in developing the services but it is clear that a further impetus needs to be provided so that progress made to date can be accelerated <Col N="654" /> in a way that the dental services are provided in an equitable, consistent and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1993, is to amend the Health Act, 1970, to enable the health boards to make dental services available without charge to children who have attended national or certain other schools.  The Bill is a short one.  Section 1 contains the necessary provision to enable the health boards to provide the services.  Section 1 also contains a provision to enable the Minister for Health to specify the nature of the service to be made available and the age of the children to be provided with the service.  This will enable me to extend services to children under 16 years of age on a phased basis in accordance with the provisions contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government. Senators will be aware that services are currently available to children aged 12 years.</P>
    <P>The extension of children's entitlement to dental services to under 16 years of age will be a significant new development. The Health Act, 1970, currently provides that health boards shall provide a dental examination and treatment service for pupils attending national school or certain other schools as may be specified by order under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Health Act, 1970, states that health boards shall provide a dental examination and treatment service for pupils attending national school or certain other schools as may be specified by order under the Act.  In providing this service, health boards have been progressively adopting a systematic, targeted approach to the delivery of services with an emphasis on prevention.  This includes the provision of fissure sealants and oral health education.</P>
    <P>Currently, where resources permit, two or three classes in national school &mdash; usually second, fourth and sixth classes &mdash; are screened annually by health board dental teams, normally on the school premises.  Where a further more detailed examination or treatment is required the pupils are given follow-up appointments <Col N="655" /> at health board clinics.  The targeted approach to the provision of dental care ensures a cost-effective use of resources and also ensures resources are directed at those most in need.</P>
    <P>Despite deficiencies in the treatment services, particularly in the adult services, there have been significant improvements in the oral health levels of the population.  This is largely due to the preventive strategy adopted in the delivery of dental services.  The national fluoridation programme which commenced 30 years ago this year is a major contributor to the lowering of oral health disease levels in the younger population.</P>
    <P>At present, eligibility for dental care ceases when a child leaves national school and this means many children lose eligibility for health board dental services before all their permanent teeth have erupted.  It is important to ensure continuity of eligibility in order that children should continue to benefit from the health board preventive dental programme at an important stage of their dental development.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the citation and collective action.  With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I will outline my plans for the dental services which I mentioned at the outset.  In doing so, I will elaborate on the framework for the developments set out in the national health strategy and place the extension of eligibility proposed in the Bill in the overall context of the development plan for the services which I will implement on a phased basis over the next four years.</P>
    <P>I propose to initiate the first phase of a major development of the dental services this year.  My Department is advanced in its discussions with the relevant parties, including the health boards and the Irish Dental Association, towards achieving this objective.  Consistent with my policy on health promotion, the dental plan recognises the importance of health promotion, preventive measures and education programmes as a means of improving oral health levels in the community.  My <Col N="656" /> Department's health promotion unit works closely with the Irish Dental Health Foundation and through the health board dental service personnel to promote the oral health message at local level through the various elements of the plan.</P>
    <P>At this point it is appropriate to mention the current oral health status of the population.  As outlined in the four year action plan for the dental services associated with the national health strategy, the key aims of the public dental services are to reduce the level of dental disease in children; to improve the level of oral health in the population overall; and to provide adequate treatment services to all eligible persons.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in achieving these aims and previous oral health goals have already been realised. For instance, the most recently available epidemiological information indicates that in an optimally fluoridated area, up to 80 per cent of five year old children are free from dental decay in their baby teeth and for 12 year old children the average number of decayed, missing or filled teeth has declined from 2.5 teeth to 1.5 teeth in the last decade.</P>
    <P>A recent report on the oral health status of Irish adults showed evidence of a major improvement in oral health in the past ten to 15 years.  There has been a considerable increase in the number of natural teeth being retained by adults in all age groups.  While significant improvements in the oral health of the Irish population have been achieved to date, especially in children, the challenge now is to sustain the momentum of this improving oral health pattern on a national basis through the appropriate use of preventive and treatment services.</P>
    <P>The dental plan will be developed and implemented in an integrated and structured manner under the headings of primary prevention, including fluoridation and health education; primary care for children; services for the handicapped and persons in institutions; secondary care orthodontic services; oral surgery services and a service for eligible adults. I am developing the health board dental <Col N="657" /> services as a response to the need for increased investment in this area of health care.  This should ensure a comprehensive and integrated dental service is available to eligible persons nationally and that those requiring dental services have equity of access to those services.</P>
    <P>A fundamental objective of the development plan is the achievement of health gain by the promotion of oral health and the prevention of disease through preventive and screening programmes. The development and implementation of the plan will be conducted through the health boards.  My Department, together with the boards, is currently assessing their individual resource requirements necessary to commence the implementation of the plan this year.</P>
    <P>The development plan for the dental services will require each health board to have mechanisms in place to monitor the service on an ongoing basis.  Services will be developed within set national guidelines. In order to ensure adequate control, accountability and cost-effectiveness, it will be necessary to review and revise existing services and structures to meet the needs of an improved service.  Such revision should take account of the need for development and quality assurance.  The concepts of control, accountability and cost-effectiveness will re-emerge in our discussions on the national health strategy.</P>
    <P>The dental services have traditionally been prioritised to provide preventive treatment services for children, special needs groups and emergency treatments for adult medical card holders.  It would not be possible to provide the services to all those eligible within existing health board dental resources and structures. Accordingly the plan provides for the existing health board permanent dental staff to concentrate on children in addition to special needs groups, together with fluoridation and the provision of orthodontics and oral surgery. A new structured arrangement for the treatment of adult medical card holders will also be introduced involving both <Col N="658" /> private dental practitioners and health board personnel.</P>
    <P>The differences in methodology as outlined between the children's and adults' services is necessary in order to provide a balanced, structured approach to the dental services generally, thus assuring optimum levels of dental care are available to all persons eligible for dental services. To achieve the objectives of equity of access, cost effectiveness and comprehensiveness which underlie the health services and are embodied in the national health strategy, it is intended that resources will be made available equitably between and within health boards in respect of the dental services.</P>
    <P>The use of fluoride in water supplies has been a key influence on the reduction in dental caries in the population since it was introduced in 1964.  Overall, 74 per cent of the population is currently serviced by fluoridated water supplies.  This coverage varies between health boards however, and a considerable amount of the fluoridation plant is now 20 years old and needs to be upgraded or replaced.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to address the objectives of wider coverage of the population and the upgrading of existing plant during the course of the plan.  In addition the use of fluoride rinses will continue to be promoted as part of the promotional and preventive elements of the plan.  The delivery of primary dental care services for children will be improved.  Eligibility for the provision of primary care treatment to children under 16 years of age, after they leave national school, will be phased in over the period of the development plan.  This is the subject of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1993, before the House today.</P>
    <P>The primary dental care services will continue to be provided and, as I mentioned earlier, will be developed with a strong emphasis on preventive measures and oral health education.  The resource requirements for the consolidation and the further development of the primary care children's services are being assessed by the Department with the individual health boards.  With the objective of developing an equitable primary dental <Col N="659" /> care system throughout the country, cognisance will have to be taken of the particular requirements of individual health boards.</P>
    <P>The range of dental services provided at primary care level will include preventive primary care dental services, such as dental health education, examination, scaling and polishing and preventive treatments such as fissure sealing and topical applications.  Basic treatments, such as fillings and extractions, will also be provided.</P>
    <P>Eligibility for the primary dental care services to persons under 16 years of age will be introduced to provide continuity of dental care for children after they leave national school.  In this regard, children often experience an increase in dental decay after they leave national school. The presence of untreated decay in the teeth of these children often causes further complications and problems which extend into adulthood and can make treatment in adulthood more difficult and expensive.  By providing a primary dental care service for such children, we will prevent the development of dental problems at an early stage thus minimising the impact of dental problems in the adult population.</P>
    <P>Additional dental personnel will be required to provide for the extension of eligibility and to allow for the phased improvement in primary dental care for eligible children.  As I mentioned, the purpose of this extension is to achieve continuity of dental health care by bridging the gap between national school primary care dental services and the provision of adult services.  Accordingly, emphasis will be placed on those adolescents who had a previous involvement in the national school dental service.</P>
    <P>The provision of dental health care for medically, mentally or physically compromised children and adults is one of the most important elements of the dental plan.  These persons are in need of special attention as dental disease can be a major problem for them in the context of their overall health.  Initially, it is essential to ensure that emergency treatment <Col N="660" /> is available to all persons in this category, that regular screenings are available, and that all necessary treatments under sedation should be made available and accessible as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I envisage that the primary care dental services will be developed over the next four years to ensure that efficient, equitable and comprehensive services are available to eligible children, with the emphasis being placed on oral health promotion and disease prevention through systematic screening and appropriate treatment interventions.</P>
    <P>We are also taking action to provide the dental services required at secondary care level.  Arguably, the most visible of these services are the secondary care orthodontic services, but no less important are our requirements relating to secondary care oral surgery.  As regards secondary care orthodontics, there have been considerable developments over the past ten years to provide an appropriate response to the orthodontic needs of the population.  Guidelines in this area were introduced in 1985 which set out the priority ordering for persons requiring treatment.</P>
    <P>In order to implement the guidelines the Department provided the resources to the health boards to recruit the relevant expertise and this has resulted, so far, in a total of six consultant orthodontists being recruited to serve the Eastern, Southern, Mid-Western, Western, North-Western and South-Eastern Health Boards.  The remaining health boards have not, as yet, found it possible to recruit consultant orthodontists but have made local arrangements to provide the services.</P>
    <P>The availability of consultant expertise has facilitated the provision of secondary care orthodontic services in a more systematic way than before.  The consultants assessed existing waiting lists for secondary care orthodontic services and rationalised the list to reflect as accurately as possible the priority guidelines of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Health board secondary care orthodontic services will be developed further <Col N="661" /> over the period of the plan.  My Department is at present in consultation with the individual health boards as to their requirements having regard to my policy of a consultant-led secondary care orthodontic service.  A major aspect to the consultant's responsibilities, in addition to his or her own direct clinical involvement, will continue to be to organise and co-ordinate training for health board dentists so that ultimately a framework of orthodontic expertise is available to meet the needs of this area of the dental services.</P>
    <P>Secondary care oral surgery services are an integral element of the dental services. At present, such services are provided from the dental hospitals and St. James's Hospital, Dublin.  It is envisaged that a number of consultant posts in oral surgery will be created during the course of the plan.  The number and location of these posts are being assessed by my Department in consultation with the health boards.  This assessment relates to maxillofacial and oral surgery services.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 915,000 adult persons eligible for dental services by the health boards but, regrettably, the services available to such persons have declined in recent years to the point where, in many health board areas, only an accident and emergency dental service is being provided through the health board dental personnel.  My Department has almost completed discussions with the Irish Dental Association about the introduction, on a phased basis, of a new dental treatment scheme for eligible adults.  One of the frustrations in trying to improve a wide range of services was the need for improving the dental services for eligible adults.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that this new scheme will involve dentists in private practice working in the scheme under new, restructured arrangements.  The services to be provided will include routine items of treatment, an emergency service and the provision of dentures.  Against the background of the current limited and unsatisfactory dental service arrangements for eligible adults, a dental scheme along the lines of that currently being <Col N="662" /> discussed with the Irish Dental Association would be a major public health benefit to this group of the population.  In fact, a satisfactory adults dental scheme is central to the successful provision of dental services to other groups so that services to those groups are delivered by dental personnel designated to individual areas of the dental services.  In this regard, the overlap between the children's and adults' services has restricted the development of both services.</P>
    <P>I am happy to inform the Seanad that considerable progress has been made to date in the discussions with the Irish Dental Association, which have been constructive and positive.  I take this opportunity to thank the Irish Dental Association for its commitment and support.</P>
    <P>Under the development plan, emergency treatment will be available to all adults from the outset and routine treatment will be phased in for particular groups within the eligible population over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>As I intimated at the outset, it is fair to say that this area of health care requires investment to enable it to respond to the dental needs of the population and towards that end, I propose to allocate an additional £4.4 million to the dental services during 1994.  It is clear that this further impetus is necessary so that the progress to date can be accelerated in a way to ensure that the dental services throughout the country are provided in an equitable, efficient and consistent manner and that variations between health boards, which can adversely affect the access to and the quality of the services, are removed.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the provisions contained in the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1993, and the reasoning behind my proposals to maintain the continuty of dental care to children under 16 years of age.  I propose to develop the health board dental services over the next four years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the interest Senators have expressed in this area over the past 16 months.  There are several clients in the Public Gallery who will benefit from the <Col N="663" /> provisions of this Bill when it is enacted and the dental plan which will be implemented over the next four years.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for publishing the document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>.  The document states the objectives and targets, particularly in the area of health promotion and prevention over a four year period.  When reading the document, I was surprised to learn that the health services cost £2.5 billion each year.  I concur with the Minister that there is a need to demonstrate that the services are effective and provide value for money for the taxpayer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this only a passing reference.</P>
      <P>The chapter in the document which is most relevant to this debate concerns dental services.  While acknowledging that substantial progress has been made since oral health goals were set in 1984, the remaining deficiencies in the public dental services will be tackled over the next few years under the following headings: dental care for children, secondary care orthodontics, oral surgery services and service for eligible adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1993, is to extend dental eligibility to children up to the age of 16 years. While the Bill enables services to be provided, it will also have the effect of providing continued dental care by bridging the gap between national school primary dental care services and the provision of adult dental care services.  The services will put an emphasis on dental health education and prevention and will enable the systematic screening and treatment of children up to 16 years.  The measure will have the effect of ensuring that children are dentally fit before reaching 16 years.  The Health (Amendment) Bill, 1993, when passed will extend eligibility to an additional 190,000 children for dental services over the next four years. <Col N="664" /> I am a member of the Eastern Health Board and 51,000 children will benefit in that health authority.</P>
    <P>The only reservation I have about the measure proposed by the Minister is that the £4.4 million being provided might not be sufficient.  However, I take what the Minister has said as an indication of his seriousness in providing a proper dental service for children and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, thousands of children are on health board waiting lists awaiting orthodontal treatment.  If a child is not in category one, he has little or no chance of receiving treatment.  In a strange way we have become victims of our success in this area.  As the Minister said, since fluoridation was put in water, dental care in children has become a thing of the past.  This has resulted in healthier teeth and children rarely have teeth extracted.  However, this has caused crowding in the mouth &mdash; I do not know what the medical term is &mdash; and teeth become impacted.  Children with that problem require orthodontic treatment. Orthodontic treatment in the private sector is costly and it is well beyond the reach of parents on low incomes and, especially, the employed.  I hope this extra fund will help reduce the list of those awaiting orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way in our health treatment and dental care.  I have just returned from South Africa.  I was disturbed by the lack of facilities for a large section of the population, including housing and water facilities and medical and dental care.  I was most struck by the fact that many people had not received dental care for years.  Many adults now have serious orthodontic problems.  While I hope the new democracy will bring in measures which will alleviate the situation, large sections of the community are past the age of getting orthodontic treatment and that is sad.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to those, particularly dental surgeons, who operate in our health board areas.  They operate under restricted conditions and they must deal with long waiting lists.  Nevertheless, they are dedicated and they provide a wonderful service.  Some go beyond the call <Col N="665" /> of duty in the primary care for children and provide free toothpaste and toothbrushes. I congratulate the companies which make this facility available to the dental service.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the Dublin Dental Hospital, which is a stone's throw away from this House.  I was a member of the public expenditure committee in that hospital between 1982 and 1987.  A report was put before that committee which stated that a proposed new dental hospital at St. James' Hospital was not necessary.  I vigorously opposed that because, as a Dubliner, I was aware of the contribution the Dublin Dental Hospital had made to this city at little or no cost. At that time the provision of a new dental hospital was under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education.  I am glad that has been rectified and it is now under the control of the Minister for Health.  I am satisfied that the Minister has made £8 million available for the refurbishment and extension of the Dublin Dental Hospital.  In hindsight it was a good decision to leave the hospital where it was.  I know the director of the hospital is satisfied with that progress.</P>
    <P>I welcome this is important Bill and I thank the Minister for introducing it.  I wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on his positive approach.  Those who work or are involved in the health boards are aware that the age cut off is too early.  Many children had only one examination in national school because they left at 12 and problems only developed when they reached 14, 15 or 16 years of age.  Health boards are always passing resolutions and if the Minister looks at his files he will see many resolutions from my health board which sought to extend the age limit to 16 years.  I am pleased that this is now being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased by the positive approach taken by the Minister.  He is providing almost £4.5 million to implement this scheme in this year alone.  People may say £4.5 million is not enough, but we <Col N="666" /> never have enough money.  When one considers that it is only 727,810 days since Our Lord was born &mdash; it is not yet a million days, only 0.75 million &mdash; it gives one an idea of what £1 million is and what £4.5 million is for six months.  That is a huge investment into dental care for our young population and our children and it should solve all our problems.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Minister has come to an agreement with the Irish Dental Health Association.  This is very important because we need the cooperation of all those involved to work out a satisfactory system and the Minister started at the right end by having discussions with them.  I know the Association of Health Boards, of which I am a member, is very pleased that the problem is solved, because for a while there was edginess and disagreement.</P>
    <P>We are particularly pleased at primary prevention, including fluoridation and health education.  This is very important and I will have a little more to say about this later on today.  I am pleased that the Minister has homed in on services for handicapped persons in institutions, because physically or mentally handicapped people find having dental work done much harder than ordinary people. For that reason we must ensure that proper care is taken of the health of people with any physical or mental problems because it is more important for them to have good dental care than it is for ordinary people.  I am very pleased that since he took office the Minister is paying particular attention to the physically and mentally handicapped.  That is a great move.  We in the health boards have been advocating this and I know that the North Western Health Board has a very proud record in that regard.  This may have been to our disadvantage in some ways &mdash; we did not get as much money as we should because our services were so good.  However, I was pleased that it was because our services were so good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as badly as we have it.  The fluoridation of water is very important.  Most county councils have done a good job.  However, as the Minister said, the equipment is getting old in some cases, while in other cases it has not yet been installed.  I hope that, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Health, a strategic plan will be drawn up to bring all our water fluoridation services up to standard and to get fluoridation implemented where it does not exist.</P>
      <P>I welcome that the age limit has been extended to 16 years of age.  I have no doubt that when this full plan is implemented we will have a dental health service in this country comparable with any in Europe.  When this Minister and this Government leave office that will be a reality; it will be something we will be very proud of.  I will be speaking later today on the health strategy, which is a great step forward.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward this Bill.  I welcome it as a great step forward.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  I wish him well in bringing about its full implementation.  This Bill on its own will not be sufficient to deal with the problems that the Minister has outlined.  As in everything, we need money.  The people will agree with me when I say that the history of dental care provision in this country is littered with many Bills and regulations which have given entitlements to people.  Unfortunately, the funding has not been forthcoming and the facilities were not available to people when they needed them.  Obviously, the main difficulty in implementing many Bills that come before us in this House is finding the funding necessary to do so.  For this reason I welcome the Minister's announcement that he will be allocating £4.4 million for the purpose of implementing this Bill this year.  It shows that he is serious in his commitment to the provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> Many thousands of children are on waiting lists for dental treatment, particularly orthodontic treatment, and many of them have been on these waiting lists for quite a long time.  All of us have experience of parents contacting us about their children who have not been on the top priority waiting list and have not been able to receive the treatment that the provisions have said they would be entitled to.  Many of the dental services have been inadequate and poorly funded. All of us agree that prevention is better than cure, and it is much cheaper in the long run.  Therefore, I welcome the provisions that the Minister has outlined, both in this Bill and in the strategy for health under the dental services, for preventative measures.  It is much cheaper in the long run.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for any Minister to provide funding for everything that is required but, as I said, many of the provisions that were introduced were limited to the extent of the funding provided. I hope this does not happen in this case, and I accept the Minister's commitment to ensuring that it does not.  At the moment there are various categories of children in relation to orthodontic care, varying from category one down to category four; but the reality up to now is that many patients in category three and four have no hope of ever receiving treatment. They might as well really have not been on the waiting list at all.</P>
    <P>We have seen a concentration of treatment rather than prevention due to the lack of resources.  I believe that this will change with the introduction of this Bill. The cost of orthodontic treatment for many people in this country in the private sector has been prohibitive and under the present system a lot of pressure has been put on parents to provide orthodontic treatment for their children, treatment which they cannot afford and which in many cases was not really necessary.  In many cases people who are good at demanding services have got them, whereas the poorer sections of the population and those who are not aware of the necessity of dental care did not avail of these services.  I hope this will change <Col N="669" /> under the provisions of this Bill.  I believe that people who are most in need should get the treatment that they require.</P>
    <P>We all agree that school children should be annually screened and treated, and again prevention is the key area here. The 1988 Department of Health report stated that health boards were failing in their statutory obligations to provide dental treatment for all the people they were required to provide it for, but it was due to the lack of funding.  Now the Minister has outlined his intention to change that.  We could examine the feasibility of the introduction of paramedics such as dental hygienists.  Much work could be done by them, particularly in relation to education and oral health. Employing paramedics would not be as costly as employing dental surgeons.</P>
    <P>We must try at all times to encourage prevention as it is much cheaper than cure.  Research, as the Minister has stated, has shown that there has been an improvement in the level of oral health among Irish adults.  However, the less well off members of society, and particularly women, have a much lower level of oral health and this must be improved on.  The recent survey on health produced by the Irish Heart Foundation made interesting reading in relation to our teeth and the percentages of people who visited their dentist regularly.  It showed that 45 per cent of people had visited their dentist in the year preceding the taking of the survey; 19 per cent had dental treatment one to three years earlier; but 36 per cent had not visited their dentist for three years or more.  Women and men were equally likely to have visited their dentist in the previous year.  I am glad of that.  Sometimes women neglect their own health and teeth because they are much more aware of looking after everybody else in the family and they tend to put their own needs at the bottom of the pile.</P>
    <P>The Minister's plan for the dental service is part of the health strategy document he introduced.  He acknowledges the deficiency in the public health dental services and says they will be tackled over the next four years.  He has produced a <Col N="670" /> plan of the aims of the public dental service, including the reduction of the level of dental disease in children, the improvement of oral health and adequate treatment services to children and to all medical card holders.  All of us welcome that.  It will take four years to implement but he has outlined the headings.  They are: primary prevention, including fluoridation; primary care for children; services for the handicapped; secondary care, orthodontic services, oral surgery services and a service for eligible adults.</P>
    <P>This strategy will take longer than a year to implement, but the Minister also has set targets.  I am glad of that, because we need something to measure what we are doing against.  If we set targets today we need to be able to measure in four years' time how successful we have been in achieving these targets.  I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on introducing it.  It will pass speedily through the House as all parties have welcomed it.  I look forward to its full implementation.  I wish the Minister well in his negotiations with the Irish Dental Association because it implements many of the Bill's provisions.  In the past many entitlements were given but were not delivered on.  I acknowledge the Minister's commitment and I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to provide services to people up to the age of 16 years.  A major concern for anybody, especially those in the PAYE sector, is the cost of dental bills if they do not have a medical card.  It was always a hair raising experience to have to go to the dentist.  One thinks back on old treatments; I remember many years ago that my father used to give me a taste of whiskey as it was the cheapest way of killing the pain.  Hopefully, with the treatments now available to schoolchildren and the extension of the free service under this Bill, there will be no need for those old treatments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of dental treatment to parents can be great.  I welcome the plan which the Minister has outlined for the next four years; it is along the lines of what the Minister has been doing since he took <Col N="671" /> office and major strides have been made. This represents another £4.4 million and every health board in the country will welcome more money coming into the health service.  Every health board has problems not only in relation to dental care but to all forms of health care. Therefore, when £4.4 million becomes available it is welcome.</P>
    <P>The area I come from is serviced by the North Western Health Board and it has major problems in relation to Letterkenny. I recently visited the dental surgery in Letterkenny which has problems with the building and the service. The staff are in an impossible situation. There are plans to move the service out of the general hospital building to the old psychiatric hospital building in St. Conal's.  I am not looking for all of the £4.4 million, but perhaps the Minister would consider giving some of it to enable the staff in the dental unit to provide Donegal with the service it deserves. Some of the staff are working in prefab buildings.  There are long waiting lists.  I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the case put by the North Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>Not everybody goes on to second level education and people can get lost in the system.  When people go over the age of 16 or 17 it can become costly to go to the dentist.  If we can include the people between the ages of 12 and 16 we will save money not only for the people themselves but also for the Department.  I welcome the talks going on between the health boards and the Irish Dental Association. It is the proper way to conduct the business of health promotion.</P>
    <P>The dental plan which the Minister outlined includes services for the handicapped and persons in institutions.  This is an area in which I have many years of experience and I know the problems associated with people in institutions.  A tooth extraction for somebody who is mentally handicapped can cause major problems for the person and for the staff who are bringing them for treatment.  It can impose a great strain on the person involved and on the staff.  I am happy <Col N="672" /> that under the dental plan structures will be put in place whereby many of these problems can be avoided, because the handicapped need extra care and attention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome this Bill.  I have had experience over many years as a member of the Southern Health Board until 1991 and I do not think the situation has changed since then.  At present only pupils up to fourth or fifth class in primary school are being examined and in some cases no services are being provided.  I am aware of cases where children have left national school without getting the service and, consequently, parents have had major problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal to extend the service to children up to 16 years of age is commendable.  However, is the Minister providing an adequate service at present for those up to 12 years of age?  If the children are being examined at school is the service being provided?  I was a member of the Southern Health Board until recently and I have no reason to believe that the situation has changed, although I will stand to be corrected on the point.  I can only gauge the system by the representations I am asked to make on behalf of others.  While we welcome the Bill, we want an assurance that the necessary finances are being provided specifically for dental care.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's statement he referred to secondary care orthodontic services and he mentioned the guidelines of 1985 &mdash; one of the most contentious documents which ever issued from any Government Department.  Parents saw that their children required orthodontic treatment and might have been so advised by their GP; but the orthodontist and the health board invariably refused, saying that they had to abide by the guidelines issued to them by the Department and that the treatment being sought was cosmetic.  There is a vast difference between providing what is deemed to be a cosmetic or an orthodontic treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> I had experience recently of a family who were so desperate that they raised £1,500 &mdash; a sum they could ill afford &mdash; because neither the orthodontist nor the officials of the health board would relent, although it was more a matter for the orthodontist.  The child was conscious of her own condition and in the interests of the child the parents decided to pay the money.  I ask the Minister if those strict guidelines still apply and if there is any intention of changing them.  They were strict because they used the concept of cosmetic and there is a need to change that.</P>
    <P>One welcomes any improvement in the services but I hope that the services which it is proposed to improve will be matched by financing.  Do the guidelines relating to orthodontic treatment still exist and is there any intention of changing them?  I am sure that as a public representative the Minister has been aware of the issue I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators for their contributions. I also thank each of the Senators for the broad welcome they gave to this important legislation.  The Bill comprises only two short sections, but its impact will be major.  We have talked for a long time about the gap between the eligibility given to children for dental services in national school and their new eligibility when they become medical card holders.  This Bill aims to bridge that gap to allow a continuum of treatment up to the age of 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was concerned that, in doing something as important as this, it would not be merely cosmetic and that I would not be extending eligibility to a category for which I could not provide.  I clearly stated in my Second Stage speech that the dental services have been looked at root and branch as part of the overall examination of the health service over the last 16 months in advance of publishing the national health strategy.  What I am announcing today is not merely a legislative change, although that is the essence of the Bill, but a four year development plan for dental services in parallel to that, <Col N="674" /> which would be of huge benefit not only to all of our children but to any eligible adults as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle welcomed the Bill and gave special mention to the Dublin Dental Hospital.  I am pleased that we have resolved the difficulty which has been constantly referred to for many years, concerning the location and funding of this hospital and who should be responsible.  Should it be in the capital programme for Education or Health?  A commonsense approach was taken on that matter.  A committee was chaired by the late Assistant Secretary of my Department, Gerry McCarthy.  Senior officials of the Departments of Finance and Education also served on that committee. They concluded that the optimum solution was to leave it in the heart of Dublin city to serve its traditional population base.  In conjunction with the Minister for Education, I was able to get an allocation of £8 million to build it.  That is a commonsense and no-nonsense approach to solving a problem that has been around for some time and I look forward to that facility being put in place.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell also strongly welcomed the Bill and mentioned his regards for the mentally handicapped.  I would share his sentiments in that regard.  He was concerned that the investment in new resources for mental handicap services did not flow as generously to the North-Western Health Board as other health boards because the services there were so well developed.  When he talks to his colleagues in the North-Western Health Board &mdash; I met a deputation from it yesterday &mdash; he will understand the reasoning behind that.  Underlying the strategy of resource allocation is identifying and researching need, which will be welcomed and applauded by all sides.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan also welcomed the Bill on behalf of the Progressive Democrats. She talked at some length about funding and the need for resourcing any proposal such as this.  I sincerely hope that Senator Honan and her colleagues will be enthusiastic supporters of my increased Estimate when I look for the money and will not be tempted to accuse me of being a <Col N="675" /> spendthrift because I have sought considerable extra resources to improve health services in the last 16 months.  I do not shy from being labelled a spendthrift and do not apologise to anybody for seeking resources for the type of improvements people are entitled to and have sought for some time.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan and a number of other Senators, most notably Senator Sherlock, talked about orthodontics.  This area is not only a problem for our health services, but across the world.  It is a relatively new demand.  When we were growing up &mdash; I am not tens of decades out of primary school &mdash; it would have been unusual for people to have orthodontic treatment.  There is now a huge insatiable demand for orthodontic treatment and it is extremely expensive. Experience in other countries has shown that a considerable portion of orthodontic treatment has no real benefit to the patients concerned.  We must be discerning in terms of a scarce resources and an expensive procedure.  We should target it to those who it can benefit most in either health or social gain.  It is my objective and that of the plan to increase orthodontic provision in a line consistent with the European norm over the four years of the plan.  That is as ambitious as we can be.  Six orthodontic consultants have already been provided for the health boards.  The resourcing and new facilities in the new Dublin Dental Hospital will also augment this provision.</P>
    <P>The other point made by Senator Honan concerns the use of paramedics.  I have indicated my willingness and enthusiasm for the employment of paramedics in the dental services.  I also intend to have dental hygienists involved in the public dental service as soon as possible.  Senator Maloney welcomed the Bill and talked, as is his wont, about his own area of expertise.  I understand his keen interest in the health situation in County Donegal and know again, from the twice daily approaches I have got from Senator Maloney over the last 16 months, that he is most anxious to have the optimum health service available to <Col N="676" /> those in his home county.  I am aware of the difficulties in Letterkenny, and the capital requirements of Letterkenny are currently under consideration between my Department and the health board.  I hope we can be of assistance to him in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock spoke in terms of the deficiencies in the dental services.  In my contribution I made no secret of the fact &mdash; some Senators who are members of health boards will recall my first visit to the Association of Health Boards last year shortly after I become Minister &mdash; that I was unhappy with the provision of dental services, especially to eligible adults.  I have outlined my response today.  It is easy to identify the problem but a little more difficult to identify the solutions.  I have proposed and outlined a four year development plan to the House which will address the problems that, as public representatives, we all know about.  This will bring about a dramatic improvement over the next four years in the quality, efficiency, effectiveness and thoroughness of dental services in this country.</P>
    <P>I again thank all Senators who supported this Bill and appreciate their contributions and comments.  I am glad it has been given such a speedy passage through Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he sought funding, but he has been successful in obtaining it and I compliment him and his Department for that.  This section will put an increased burden on the health boards.  For instance, the Eastern Health Board currently has 4,000 people on its orthodontic waiting list, which does not include other dental service waiting lists.  This Bill, when <Col N="677" /> enacted, will make additional eligibility for some 190,000 people in the country and 51,000 in the Eastern Health Board area.  Is the Minister satisfied that the £4.4 million provided in the Bill will cover this extra increase?  I am sure the Minister would not want to give false hope to people in the area of dental care.  I would like to have the Minister's views on that matter.  If that funding is only for a half year, what will the extra funding be for a full year?</P>

      <P>There is a tendency to boil everything down to money, but everything cannot necessarily be addressed in this manner. The trust I wish to bring to the health services &mdash; and I speak in global terms &mdash; is, first, that the focus of the dental teams currently employed in the public service through the health boards will be on children to ensure that a good service is available to children.  This can only be achieved if we take the pressure of the adult eligible people off these services and I have been working on a mechanism to do that.  That is why I have been involved in discussions with the Irish Dental Association.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that, in increments over the next three years, the adult eligible community will be treated by private dentists so that the health board dentists will focus exclusively, or largely, on children in due course.  I intend to resource this measure.  I have announced the initial allocation for 1994, and we are already five months into this year.  I make no secret that there are considerable financial implications in this plan and it is my intention to resource it with the help of my colleagues in Government, who are enthusiastic in their support for improvements in dental health over the four years.</P>
      <P>It is important to make the point that I do not wish to raise people's hopes. This is an incremental plan.  It will not solve all the problems of 20 years in one year, but at the end of four years we will have a service for children and adults which will be of pride to us all.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes <i>Shaping a healthier future &mdash; A strategy for effective healthcare in the 1990s.&rdquo;</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity today to address Seanad Éireann on the subject of the national health strategy and to await the response of Senators to what I consider to be the most important document that I have been involved with since I became Minister for Health.  I welcome the recognition of its importance which is implicit in the decision of the House to have this debate today.</P>
      <P>I believe that the health strategy has the potential to transform the health services of this country.  For the first time there is a clear statement of the underlying principles, the key objectives and the strategic direction of the health services. It is clear from the general reaction in the last two weeks since the strategy was launched that there is a widespread recognition, both within the services and without, that a blueprint now exist for a more effective, equitable and accountable health care system.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister for Health I was determined that I would build on the existing strengths of the services and implement the reforms needed to overcome the weaknesses.  Just over a year ago I announced that, with the assistance of my Department, I would draw up a comprehensive health strategy.  In developing the strategy I carried out a comprehensive examination of both the strengths and the weaknesses of the health system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> Foremost among its strengths is the quality and commitment of its staff.  Another important asset, the extent of which is perhaps unique in Ireland, is the involvement of the voluntary sector as a substantial and integral part of the public services.  I was also conscious of a real enthusiasm within the services for development and change.</P>
    <P>The principle weakness in the services is a lack of clarity about the overall focus or direction of the services.  In the absence of specific goals or targets, it is very difficult to assess real effectiveness. This situation is unsustainable in a service which is spending over two and a quarter billion pounds of taxpayer's money each year and which could spend much more on undoubtedly worthwhile developments if resources were available.</P>
    <P>A second weakness, and one which has long been recognised, is the inadequacy of community services and of appropriate linkages between community and hospital services.  This works against the objective of providing appropriate care in the appropriate setting.  Finally, it is clear that the organisational and management structures of the health services need to be significantly updated if real progress is to be made in tackling the other weaknesses.</P>
    <P>The health strategy addresses all of these weaknesses in a clear and cohesive manner.  Its title, <i>Shaping a healthier future &mdash; A Strategy for effective healthcare in the 1990s</i>, conveys its main theme, the reshaping of the health services in terms of a clear strategic direction so that improving people's health and qualify of life becomes the primary and unifying focus of all our efforts.</P>
    <P>There are three important principles which underpin the entire strategy &mdash; equity, quality of service and accountability. The Government's commitment to social justice has been seen in a wide range of policies since we took office, but there are few areas of Government policy which can have a greater impact on social justice than health policy.  I am especially pleased that in endorsing the health strategy my colleagues in Government have <Col N="680" /> agreed to the clearest statement yet that our health services should help first and foremost those whose health needs are greatest.</P>
    <P>It is now an established fact that factors such as unemployment and poverty are linked with poor health status.  We also know, and have known for some time, that certain groups, such as travellers, have a health status far below that of the population as a whole.  The health strategy contains a number of measures which will address this inequality, the most innovative of which is the creation of health development sectors.  This means that each health board will be required to identify within their region those sectors which need special attention in terms of targeting health services. These sectors may be geographic areas, or they may be specific population groups such as travellers.  The strategy explains how the health services will focus especially on improving the health status and quality of life of those sectors.</P>
    <P>The second principle is the measurement of quality.  This has several dimensions. The formal measurement of the technical quality of the services will become an essential, integral part of their provision, and all health care professionals will be expected to become involved in ongoing clinical audits of their own areas.</P>
    <P>However, there are other aspects of quality which can have a marked effect on the patient's satisfaction or otherwise with the services provided, aspects such as dealing efficiently and courteously with patients and showing a sensitivity to their requirements.  These aspects will also be evaluated through regular surveys.</P>
    <P>The third principle is accountability. The health strategy sets out new arrangements for improved legal and financial accountability, but it also goes beyond that.  It sets out a new approach to the provision of health care under which everyone providing a service knows what is required of them and accepts responsibility for the achievement of agreed objectives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> The health strategy sets out the decisions which the Government has made regarding organisational structures and will be followed by the necessary legislation.  The principal decisions are as follows.  The Eastern Health Board will be replaced by a new authority which will have comprehensive responsibility for all health and personal social services in its region.  The remaining seven health boards will also have full responsibility for all services within their regions.  There will be a much clearer distinction between the responsibilities of the board and the management in each health board and to emphasise this they will be renamed as health authorities.  The Department of Health will no longer be involved in the detailed management or direct funding of individual services.  The independent identity of the voluntary agencies will be fully respected and they will benefit from formal agreements with the health authorities which clearly set out their service requirements and the associated funding.</P>
    <P>I believe that the basic concept of the regional health board is fundamentally sound &mdash; I informed the members of the Association of Health Boards of this when I spoke to them last weekend &mdash; and has served the country well since its introduction in 1971.  The division of administration into eight regions has provided a strong element of local democracy in the health services.  The local populations now identify with the boards for their regions and the planning and delivery of services has evolved effectively in that context over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>However, it would now be widely accepted that the roles and responsibilities of the boards, their managements, and the various agencies with which they interact, all need to be clarified and placed within a stronger framework of accountability.  The detailed measures which are necessary to bring this about will, of course, be debated when the necessary legislation is put before the House.</P>
    <P>The strategy document is in two parts, as Members will have seen.  The first part, <Col N="682" /> printed on white paper, is the strategy proper &mdash; five chapters explain how the system will be reshaped to bring about the necessary transformation, in accordance with the principles I have described. The second part, printed on blue paper, is a four year action plan which itemises the detail of what is to be achieved in each individual service.  A good example is the dental services, on which we have had a debate for the last two hours.  The outlining of what is to be achieved in dentistry is clearly set out.  The Health (Amendment) Bill, which has just been passed by the House, is an important element in the strategy on dental services. The first part of the strategy document outlines a clear overview and strategic direction and the second part outlines a developmental strategy, consisting of a four year action plan, for every sector in the services.</P>
    <P>The objectives and the targets set out in the strategy and the action plan do not just deal with service developments. They also deal with the importance of focusing our health promotion policies on tackling the main causes of illness and premature death.  I was intrigued by the debate on the Order of Business, which showed Senators want to be involved in the enhancement of their own health.  I applaud and support this.  There are very significant potential reductions in the extent of illness and premature mortality if we can, as a community, adopt the appropriate preventive measures.  A cohesive programme to bring this about is included in the strategy.</P>
    <P>When I launched the strategy, I said that the most important message I wanted to convey was that the strategy is neither designed nor intended for the library shelf.  Our actions today show this is the case.  I intended it to be the working agenda for everyone in the health services from now on.  The transformation which is required affects everybody &mdash; their way of thinking, their approach to the patients or clients for whom they are responsible and the basis on which they take everyday decisions.  Their participation in the implementation of the strategy is so crucial that I have arranged <Col N="683" /> for a short summary of the document to be distributed to every single person working in the health services.</P>
    <P>I am also arranging that the full document will be widely available and accessible, and that meetings and briefing sessions will be held throughout the services to help explain the new approach. It might be of interest to Senators that the initial print of 10,000 copies of the document has already been distributed. There is huge demand for it, not only from health services workers but from the general population.  Some 80,000 copies of the summary have also been distributed.  People are concerned about health and are engaged by a new strategy. I am heartened by the responses we have had to date.</P>
    <P>I have also made it clear that the implementation of the strategy will take account of the views and ideas which emerge in response to it.  It contains an explicit invitation to all interested parties to consider and debate the strategy and its implications.  I will read with interest the comments of Members today about it.  The strategy sets out broad principles and objectives, but these will have to be translated into detailed plans at national and local level.  I want to see the widest possible participation in this process.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to have been the Minister responsible for this landmark document, but I am also conscious that the expectations which it will raise must be delivered on.  I know that this strategic plan, framing objectives for the health services to achieve, structures to achieve them and mechanisms to measure progress, will be welcomed by all who work in and depend on the health services.</P>
    <P>I am very encouraged by the initial reactions which I have received since the launch.  While various individual proposals have been welcomed by the sectors concerned, I am particularly pleased with the general recognition that, above all else, the document provides a clear strategic direction for the services as a whole and that it will enable everyone involved to work together more effectively on &ldquo;shaping a healthier future&rdquo;.</P>
    <Col N="684" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on drawing up a comprehensive health strategy programme.  It is a blueprint for the health services until the end of the century.  The first part of the document sets out the principal purpose of shaping a healthier future, so as to give a clear sense of direction to the health services in the way they are planned and delivered. The second part sets out a four year action plan for the implementation of the strategy during the period 1994-97.</P>
      <P>The key aspect of the strategy is to redirect the health services towards a health promotion approach, based on encouraging people to take responsibility for their own health and providing the environment and support necessary to achieve this.  It sets out a number of targets and outlines how they are to be achieved.  I was relieved to note that the recommended sensible limit of alcohol consumption for males is 21 units a week. This is equivalent to 10.5 pints of beer. It is unlikely that I will exceed this limit but I fall short of another of the document's targets, which encourages light physical exercise most days of the week. The action plan also deals with the dental services, which we dealt with this morning, and the health of women, children and travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A chapter deals with drug abuse and I welcome the measures proposed by the Minister to deal with the problem, which include primary prevention programmes in schools, dissemination of information through a public health campaign and the provision of at least four additional primary care clinics to service catchment areas of Dublin.  I welcome the involvement of general practitioners in the implementation of the methadone Protocol. I am pleased that the Department of Health will implement a four strand strategy based on surveillance, prevention, care, management and anti-discrimination. Prevention should be given priority and I am glad that the programme will enhance the existing primary education on HIV and AIDS.  I welcome the provision of additional satellite clinics for drug abusers.  There are <Col N="685" /> drug problems in my area.  I appreciate that additional finance is being made available to the Eastern Health Board to create these clinics.  If drug addicts are to be treated properly with methadone, there should be no more than 30 or 40 people attending a clinic on any one day.</P>
    <P>One of the most extraordinary aspects of the document is the reference to the rapid rise in the number of people in the older age group.  This poses a special challenge for the health services over the next four years.  The programme states that over this period priority will be given to the strengthening of home, community and hospital services to provide much needed support to elderly people who are ill or dependent and assist those who care for them.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that substantial progress has been made in recent years in reorganising the mental health services and that this will continue, that people with psychiatric problems will be admitted to general hospitals rather than psychiatric hospitals and that the number of people in psychiatric hospitals will be phased out to live in the community.  I compliment the Minister on the money he has made available to the health boards to enable them to carry out this proposal.</P>
    <P>The four year action plan is a very challenging one and I wish it every success. However, today I want to address the role of the health authorities.  Legislation will be introduced to provide for a new authority in the eastern region. Under what is proposed, the Department of Health will be freed of its involvement in the management of individual services and will be able to concentrate on setting overall health objectives, negotiating health estimates, determining the financial allocation of the new authority and evaluating services and financial performance against the national objective. In other words, it will alleviate the burden of the day to day running of these authorities.</P>
    <P>In order for the new authority in the eastern health region to fulfil its role, it is important that the necessary powers and functions are delegated to it by the <Col N="686" /> Minister.  It follows that the new authority would allocate a total budget for the region over the total administrative areas envisaged, taking account of the population needs resulting in the provision of an identified range and level of services in each area.</P>
    <P>I understand that the new authority will ensure that health services in the region are delivered in an integrated and co-ordinated way.  This new integrated approach to health care delivery is very important having regard to the existence of separate large hospitals, the number of isolated smaller specialist hospitals in Dublin and the stand alone maternity and paediatric hospitals which has led to a degree of fragmentation of specialised services on separate geographical sites.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Eastern Health Board I am very conscious of the significant role and the high level of services provided by the voluntary hospitals in the Dublin area, both for patients from its own area and from other health board areas.  I fully accept that their integration into the wider health and social services is necessary for the planning and delivery of a co-ordinated and effective service.  I am pleased to note that the Minister has stated that the board of the new authority will be responsible for articulating community views and will have an input into policy formation.  I recognise the importance of ensuring that the views of consumers of the service are fully reflected in their organisation and delivery.</P>
    <P>The document states that the legislation will be general in nature and will supply the framework within which the statutory and voluntary agencies will operate.  As the Eastern Health Board recognises, given the role of the new authority and the wide range of interests which exist in the health and social services field, the composition of the board of the new authority will not in practical terms be totally representative.  The board should, however, be broadly representative and its size and composition should be in line with the proposed role which is strategic rather than operational.</P>
    <P>The health board is of the view that at least 51 per cent of the members of the <Col N="687" /> board of the new authority should be locally elected representatives nominated by the local authorities in the region.  The remainder of the members should include persons nominated from the voluntary sector or appointed by the Minister for Health and professionals with appropriate expertise elected by the members of their professions.  The mix of local elected public representatives and practising health professionals as members of the Eastern Health Board since 1971 has worked well and I would like to see a continuation of this type of representation on the board of the new authority.  This would not preclude development and professional input as part of the normal management process.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would take these views into consideration when he is bringing in the legislation for the new health authority in the Dublin region.  I thank the Minister for this blueprint for our health services over the next years.  It is a very challenging document and I congratulate him on producing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his very positive approach.  This document is concerned with health promotion, general practitioner services, dental services, women's health, family planning, children's health, child care and family support services, travellers' health, addressing drug misuse, food and medicine control, acute hospital services, HIV and AIDS patients, ill and dependent elderly, palliative care and people with mental illnesses, mental handicap and physical or sensory handicap.  That is a very comprehensive list.  It shows the determination of the Minister and the Government to ensure that our health services are on a par with those worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that some of these services have already been implemented by <Col N="688" /> my own health board.  We had a public briefing on it the other day and we were very pleased to see that much of what was in the document had already been implemented.  I am delighted that voluntary organisations are now playing a greater role and that there is greater communication and co-operation between the voluntary organisations and the health board personnel.  When we started to develop community care and putting psychiatric patients into high support hostels there was resistance in the community. We often asked if the community wanted community care.  Thank God that has changed.  We have now proved and the community has accepted that the community approach is the best one.</P>
    <P>It is sad that in this day and age we need to have services to promote health and to explain to people how to take care of their health.  Many people are abusing their health by the misuse of various substances, such as alcohol, drugs, overindulgence in smoking and so on.  This all costs the country millions of pounds because many of the problems we face today are avoidable.  Many accidents are avoidable and should never have happened.</P>
    <P>The booklet which accompanies the Shaping a Healthier Future document should be sent to every school.  I appeal to every teacher to spend an hour with their students discussing this booklet.  I believe that would do a great deal of good.  Students are brought to this House &mdash; and we are delighted to see them &mdash; to the museum, and so on.  However, I have been advocating for years that we should bring them to some of our high support hostels, accident units, alcohol units and jails to let them see the other side of life.  We show our children all the good things in life but there is, unfortunately, another side which is sold very cleverly and efficiently.  Advertisements show the glamour of teenagers drinking but not the abuse.  We do not see young people in cardboard boxes or lying along the streets as a result of alcohol abuse. This side is not shown on television.</P>
    <P>The two biggest problems in society today are the abuse of drugs and alcohol. <Col N="689" /> For the first time ever a strategy is to be put in place dealing specifically with drugs and alcohol.  This is very important. I believe that 60 per cent of our social problems do not result from a lack of money but from the misuse of money. People receive quite a lot of money in social welfare payments and if it was spent in the right way their standard of living could be much higher.  Unfortunately, the drug barons are out there and some people are addicted to alcohol. These abuses cause an enormous drain on the health services.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has adopted a four year plan; this is a very positive approach.  The Minister will go down in history as the person who took decisive and positive action to improve the health services.  I was pleased last year when extra money was provided to deal with waiting lists.  The money did not get lost, as happened so often in the past.  Services can be provided in Northern Ireland at a much lower cost than they can be provided here.  That should not be the case.  I have repeatedly said at estimates meetings of the county council and the health board that we should not ask for more money.  Instead, we should be specific and precise regarding how the money will be used.  Are we using the money to the best advantage and are we getting value for money?  We have lost too much money.  We do not know the cost of operations or any unit of health. The strategy will focus on this area.</P>
    <P>If one employs somebody to paint one's house, one knows how much it will cost.  However, if one goes into hospital, one does not know how much it will cost. It is not good enough nowadays to say that an operation in one hospital will cost £1,700 while the same operation will cost £2,400 in another hospital and £3,500 in another hospital.  This type of variation arises in the orthopaedic area.  We must get to the fundamentals of getting value for money.  I am delighted that this will now happen.</P>
    <P>I welcome this strategy.  I would have liked to have said more but I wish to share my time with Senator Roche.  The Minister will go down in history as the <Col N="690" /> man who played a leading role in improving the health services.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister appreciates and values the work of health boards.  I have repeatedly made this point.  Over the years, many journalists said that one single board, Sláinte na hÉireann, could do the work of health boards.  However, they were not in the services and when one asked them questions they could not answer.  I am delighted that the Minister realises this point.  I assure him that he has the full support and co-operation of every health board in Ireland in the large task facing him.  We will ensure that the strategy will be a great success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Farrell for sharing his time.  He is most generous. However, 11 hours would be insufficient to deal comprehensively with the health service.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I heartily commend him for this document.  It is almost 25 years since the new health service structures were put in place.  In that time, there have been vast changes in society.  The technology of health services has changed dramatically and incomprehensibly.  There are daily changes in the way services are delivered and in what they cost.  The entire ethos of the health service has changed from an institution basis to more community based care.  The cost of health services has grown dramatically and out of all expectations.  In 1970, if one had told former Minister Childers, when he enunciated the new principles for health administration, the type of costs that would be involved, he would have looked at one as if one had lost any sense of reason or rationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a good health service and I was very pleased when Minister, Deputy Howlin, made that point at the weekend. We do not need to apologise.  We need to ensure that our health services are improved.  I commend the Minister and his Department and we must ensure that <Col N="691" /> every punt spent on the health services delivers a punt.  There has been confusion in the structures and one of the great benefits of this document is that it will put in place a more clear cut set of structures. However, before I deal with the framework, I wish to deal with a number of specific points in the document.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's undertaking that there will be better identification of the needs to be addressed.  We need to make our health services continuously client oriented.  We must recognise that they exist to serve that patient, not to serve the professionals, the consultants or occasional political ambitions.  They are there for the people and that message has come across repeatedly in pronouncements from the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  He should be commended for this.  It is made very clear in the strategy document.  The document also calls on the need for more clear cut evaluation. Unless we have research, we will not have development, rather confusion and muddle.  The necessity for evaluation, monitoring and establishing objective systems of monitoring is very clear in the strategy document.  It is to be commended and we all welcome it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's strategy document, as Senator Farrell said, focuses on 16 separate areas of service development.  We could spend an hour on each of those areas and I wish to touch on four or five. The general practitioners service is the backbone of the medical services.  The Minister correctly recognises this and he undertakes in the document that there will be better organisational support.  In the Eastern Health Board area in recent times, for example, we have made additional back up services available to GPs.  It is entirely welcome, as Senator Doyle who also serves on that board knows well.  By making the laboratory services at Loughlinstown Hospital available to north Wicklow GPs, we have created a situation whereby a much better service is delivered to patients under the GMS and to paying patients of the GP service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> There is a great deal to be commended in the GP services but there are occasional lapses.  There is a need for some form of ethical scrutiny of the way some GPs operate.  I mention in particular the politicisation of the GP services of the GMS in 1992.  I realise that the medical practitioners have an absolute right to lobby for every penny to which they believe they are entitled. However, there was a particularly high profile GP service in Bray and it terrified members.  People know of this.  There was one unfortunate occasion when a man who suffered a serious nervous breakdown came to my house in such a state of distress that he had to be taken by car to his home.  His wife had to be called from her workplace to calm him down.  That is unethical and unacceptable. People who operate on that basis do not have a place in the GMS. Sadly, in that case, having beaten the big political drum, that particular GP service did not take the trouble when the dispute was settled to go back to all the patients and say that their medical cards would not be removed as of 17 December 1992. I wish I had more time to deal with this matter but, unfortunately, I do not.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentions the public dental service.  There has been a tremendous amount of improvement in this area.  We should commend the Minister, the Department and the health boards for what has been done.  However, there is still a huge amount to be achieved.  In his introduction, the Minister says that neither geographical location nor one's relative wealth should determine the services one receives.  We must all accept, particularly in the area of orthodontic care, that wealth and one's geographical location determine the quality of service. This document, the Government, the Minister and all Members of the Oireachtas are determined that this should no longer be the case.  I welcome that commitment.  There is still a huge amount to be done regarding that service. I call on the dental association to assist the Minister and the health boards in a partnership to resolve the remaining problems.  A huge amount has been <Col N="693" /> achieved in the dental services but the task is not endless.  If there was a comprehensive partnership approach, the remaining problems could be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicates that a comprehensive plan for women's health will be published.  It is astonishing at this stage that we are still talking about a comprehensive women's health service.  We talk about services for minorities and correctly so.  However, we are dealing here with 51 per cent of the population.  As far as I am aware, only one health board has so far adopted a women's health policy. That document, adopted recently by the Eastern Health Board, was marred by a mischievous debate as to the degree of support for Well Woman centres.  The practice I mentioned in the case of the GMS played an interesting role in that but less they appear illiberal, they kept their hands well disguised while they did their mischief.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned specifically care in the community for elderly people. The age profile is changing dramatically in this country.  We will all be old some day, if we have the sense to get out of politics and last that long.  It is a privilege to service the elderly's needs yet we are not doing it in a comprehensive way at the moment and we will not until we make this a clear strategy objective.  This is done in this document.  I welcome the commitment to improve services for the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>I want to address the issue of the framework for the services.  In 1970-1971, when we established the health boards, we put in place a new health framework.  I was pleased when at the weekend Minister Howlin identified the health boards as having served this nation well.  No human organisation is perfect, but the regional health boards have done a good job.  I was particularly pleased when the Minister gave commitments regarding the ongoing composition of those boards.  I want to say something about the boards themselves and the proposition that all health care services and personal social services are to be brought under the single new unified health authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> That is a very important step.  Its importance can be illustrated by reference to the Eastern Health Board.  In the EHB area at the moment approximately £600 million per year is spent on personal social services and on health services.  Less than half of that is actually controlled by the Eastern Health Board. The balance is doled out in a variety of forms through the Department of Health and the huge amount of voluntary organisations that do such an extraordinary job in this area.  It is a fact that the Eastern Health Board &mdash; the country's biggest, which deals with one third of the population &mdash; does not have any of the major hospitals in its area under its direct control. We have the three hospitals at Blanchardstown, Naas, and St. Columcilles at Loughlinstown, but they are not major hospitals.  The major hospitals are voluntary ones and in the development of their services their relationship is not with the body that should co-ordinate their services but is on an individual basis with the Department of Health.  Equally, all the voluntary organisations, including the Autism Society and many others, must individually take their supplicant's cup to the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>When the new health structures were created under the 1970 Act the belief was put firmly in the minds of most people that we were creating a dichotomy between the person responsible for policy, the Minister, and the administration of policy, which would be at health board level.  But because that was never successfully achieved there has been a degree of unnecessary overlap and areas of controversy.  I can think of one controversy &mdash; though I am tempted to mention it by name, I will not do so &mdash; where, because the health board was dealing with a voluntary body at one level and the Department of Health at another, unnecessary controversy prohibited a voluntary organisation from coming on stream for some time.  By bringing the voluntary organisations and the health authorities clearly together in a partnership we should avoid that in future.</P>
    <P>At the weekend conference in Wexford the Minister mentioned the composition <Col N="695" /> of the health boards.  I know it has become fashionable to be cynical in the extreme about the role of elected representatives.  For some reason we can all celebrate the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the spread of democracy in Eastern Europe and what has happened over the last ten days in South Africa.  However, when it comes to our own nation we continuously undermine, with cynical and frequently ill-supported comment and rhetoric, the role of democratically elected personnel.  I make no apology for saying that every single councillor, town commissioner and representative &mdash; no matter how lowly or exalted &mdash; has something unique that does not exist in any other area &mdash; the <i>imprimatur</i> of the people.</P>
    <P>I was delighted when the Minister make it absolutely clear that he is not going to dilute the democratic element in the health boards.  That is a most important principle which was established by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the original Health Bill in 1970 that principle was not clear cut.  But both Houses of the Oireachtas insisted and the Minister of the day, Deputy Childers, accepted that principle.  Minister Howlin is now enshrining it for the future.</P>
    <P>I would wish that there was more time because there are many good things that deserve to be said about this strategy document.  There are some questions I would wish to ask but I can do that in correspondence.  I compliment the Minister and his Department for a very good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Before I start I should declare an interest because I am an employee of the Minister's and so, naturally, I will be looking at the question from this point of view as well as being a Senator.  I can tell the Minister from my heart that those working in the health service have been greatly cheered by the interest he has taken in the health service since he took up his appointment.  This ministry is probably one of the most difficult in the Government because it affects everybody. <Col N="696" /> One does not have to be sick to be affected by the health service; all you need is for a friend or relation to be sick to be affected.  So it is a difficult area which the entire population has its eye on, and the Minister is handling it very well.</P>
      <P>The strategy document is to be welcomed. It is nice to see the word &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; being used and social gain being mentioned as well as health gain.  Far too often we go from one small objective to another, but an overall look at policy like this is well worthwhile.  One could look at this document in two parts, the first being the wood and the second the trees. There will be a lot of sprightly conversation going on when we discuss the legislation for the wood, so I will leave that until we get into it during the year. Senator Roche in particular brought up some tingling subjects, including the control of the voluntary hospitals, which I can see will lead to an electrifying autumn.</P>
      <P>When we are looking at other health services it is important to look at other small countries &mdash; I get the feeling the Minister has done this &mdash; and not constantly look at the United Kingdom or the United States just because they are English-speaking.  It is interesting to see how often the figures for places like Denmark come up much the same as our own.  We are a small country so let us try to compare like with like rather than looking at Britain's national health service, where things are not going at all well.  I have an article here entitled &ldquo;Could our service go the way of the NHS?&rdquo;  I do not think so, and certainly not in the Minister's hands.  We have the bones of a good health service although we naturally have many things we can improve on, but every health service has that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also that money is not stressed the whole time in this document. Spending more money is not always the best thing to do.  We must put thought into things.  Thought, education and promotion of good lifestyles are often far more difficult than spending more money to placate people and get them to go <Col N="697" /> away.  The Minister must be congratulated on avoiding the latter course.</P>
    <P>We have to keep a close eye on some of our own health problems because they are not the major health problems in the European Union.  The only one I am going to pick out here is cardio-vascular disease which, along with Finland and Scotland, we have an appalling incidence of.  I was horrified recently, on reading a document about medical research in the European Union, to find that cardio-vascular disease was not in the top five but was an also ran.  If we do not put effort and energy into researching this disease here we can certainly forget about the Italians or Greeks doing it for us.  We have to watch priorities like this and not rely on other areas to do work that we need to do ourselves.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for having given more money to medical research last year but it was at a pitiful level and we are still at a pitiful level.  While I do not think, as I said at a meeting in the College of Physicians, that we can have a sprinkler system and fire money out in all directions to try and advance research on everything, the Minister and his Department would be well advised to try to put as much money as possible into those areas of research at which we are very good and where we have a high incidence of the problem.  Examples include fibro-cystic disease among children, cardiovascular disease and schizophrenia in the mental health area.  I realise that the Minister cannot give money for everything and that occasionally a tough line will have to be taken with the medical profession.  We are inclined to simply expect the Minister to forward money.  This is not, perhaps, the most desirable approach.  The Minister should seek explanations for the requests for money.</P>

      <P>There are important areas, particularly cardiovascular disease, where we must make an independent <Col N="698" /> effort because nobody else will do it for us.</P>
      <P>I also liked this document because it supported the World Health Organisation's philosophy of health for all by the year 2000.  It looks on health as being not simply an absence of disease but the presence of physical, mental and social wellbeing.  I commend the document in that regard.  This is a four year plan.  It would probably be a good idea to have progress reports.</P>
      <P>Women's health &mdash; they constitute 51 per cent of the population &mdash; has been regularly discussed.  I visited the National Institute for Health and the Health and Human Services Departments in America recently.  Both have programmes on this issue, although I do not know why two programmes are necessary.  The programmes are monitored, which is a good idea.  Perhaps the Minister would have &mdash; since half term reviews are &ldquo;in&rdquo; at present &mdash; a half term review of the strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some issues mentioned in the document require urgent action.  The first is the question of North-South co-operation. This is very important and the more the Minister can achieve in that area the better.  The IRA has not been of help in this regard.  An example of such co-operation would be the appointment of, for example, an orthopaedic consultant to cover Letterkenny and Altnagelvin hospitals.  The hospitals are only a short distance &mdash; I think it is only 16 miles &mdash; apart.  Such co-operation would result in great savings on manpower and expertise would be shared by both hospitals. However, the situation on the Border has deterred such co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should, in consultation with the Northern authorities, consider not only the possibility of joint purchase of hi-tech machinery but also sharing the use of such machinery.  I am told that the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which is one of the most advanced hospitals in America, has more magnetic resonance imaging machines than there <Col N="699" /> are in all of Canada.  The average use of the machines is two per day.  The ownership of the machine is not what matters, the expertise in its use does.  We, too, want state of the art machinery.  It would be an extremely good idea if we could, as the Minister suggests, share such machinery with hospitals in Northern Ireland through an arrangement whereby machinery is bought in alternate years by hospitals in the North and the South.  I hope the Minister makes progress in that area.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the Minister's strategy for encouraging people to take better care of their health.  The section on reducing the incidence of mental and physical handicap in the newborn is extremely important.  We did an enormous amount of work on neural tube defects in this country.  We had the highest incidence of anencephaly and spina bifida in the world.  It is now proven that such defects are associated with folic acid deficiency and it is good that the Minister is promoting awareness of the importance of adequate folic acid content in the diet of women of childbearing age.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that in 1994 we are still getting ready to establish a national database on physical and mental handicap. This issue has been neglected for a long time and I am glad to see that the Minister will address it.  I compliment my retired colleague, Dr. Victoria Coffey, who years ago, and with great difficulty, started a register on congenital defects.</P>
    <P>According to the section on mental handicap, databases will be introduced. This is important because not all mental handicap cases are the same.  The separation of mental handicap and mental illness in this document is of extreme importance and must be commended. People with mental illness have been somewhat neglected.  What has happened to the Green Paper on Mental Illness?</P>

      <P>I am delighted because parts of it are particularly important. Legislation on that issue is urgently <Col N="700" /> needed.  We have a high level of committals to mental hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted.  We have a high level of involuntary admissions to mental hospitals and that problem must be tackled.  I will not discuss alcoholism and drug abuse, because Senator Farrell discussed them earlier.  Suicide is not a problem for the Department of Health alone.  Other elements are involved in suicide and, while mental illness is important, it is a more extensive problem which must be carefully examined.</P>
      <P>In the area of palliative care it is good that the hospice service will be given more support.  The personnel in that area of health care are incredible.  It is extremely important that people are given the opportunity and the right to die at home.  None of us can ever be sufficiently grateful to the nursing service that operates in association with the hospices. I strongly commend the proposals regarding the elderly and dependent and their carers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has, rightly, taken the issue of HIV and AIDS very seriously in this document.  I am confused by articles in the press which claim that there is little likelihood of spreading AIDS through heterosexual sex.  That is not true.  A letter from a colleague of mine who is an expert in that area stated that she did not know where this notion had come from. I have seen such articles in British newspapers and I would not like to see the idea being circulated in this country.  In Africa, where AIDS is prevalent, the disease is spread through heterosexual sex. I do not know what we can do to disabuse those who write in this way about the disease.  It is a cause for alarm.  It appears to single out minority groups such as drug abusers and the gay community.  We must keep a close eye on that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also must realise that AIDS and HIV infection are closely associated with drug abuse.  Drug abuse, unfortunately, has become more serious in this community. There are differences within the <Col N="701" /> medical professional on the best way to deal with the problem.  Some practitioners favour methadone programmes and others do not.  However, the clean needle exchange programme which the Minister has promoted has been of great value, because it is bad enough that a person is a drug addict without also being infected with the HIV virus.  The Minister should ensure that clinics are available for women who are involved in what is described as &ldquo;sex work&rdquo;.  These women have been very good in their attendance at the clinic in Baggot Street and I hope the number of services available there will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Cost effectiveness in the health service is very important.  Throwing money at a problem does not necessarily solve it. However, it is most important that the Minister convey to the acute hospital services that while he expects great care to be taken in the area of cost, he also expects great care in the area of quality. The number of operations carried out on a day care basis has greatly increased.  We must ensure that such cases are carefully selected, that they are absolutely suitable, that there is ease of access for the patient to return to the hospital if there should be a problem and that there is good out-patient back-up for such patients.  That area of medical care is of great value.  It is a great improvement in comparison with the length of time people spent in hospital for minor operations 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that there has been a great improvement in socio-economic conditions; people who could not have been discharged in the past now can.  In the Minister's message to the acute hospitals I hope he stresses that, while he wants them to watch costs, he also is concerned with quality.  &ldquo;Clinical audit&rdquo; has become a buzzword and the Minister will be looking at that factor as well as the amount of money spent by hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to introduce further legislation on pharmacy and medicines controls.  One area not mentioned in the report is the sale of drugs over the <Col N="702" /> counter.  The Department should devote some thought to this area because it can produce savings.  However there can also be greater expense involved.  If people are prescribed over the counter drugs, they may be given a dearer product because it is covered by their insurance scheme.  We must consider not alone the safety of these drugs but also whether people are being given more complicated drugs to save them money, although they might be better off without them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also looked at health remedies.  A report was recently published on food and health products and the issue requires careful monitoring. Sometimes there is not enough control over the advertising of these products; the claims being made for some items have not been examined.  Perhaps a good deal of legislation would be necessary in this area.  Everyone can make herbal tea from ingredients available in the garden but if it is being sold in a shop it should be controlled.  This does not come under the Minister's jurisdiction at present but undoubtedly he and his Department will tackle the problem.  I would not decry such remedies because some of them may be extremely useful and most of our pharmacological products derive from a natural ingredient.  However, they should be analysed because some of these remedies can have serious effects if one takes an overdose; one can even have problems if one overdoses on vitamins.  Legislation is certainly necessary in this area and we can rely on the Minister to introduce it.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on traveller health services is welcome.  They have a much shorter life span and many more illnesses than the settled community.  While we say they must be allowed to follow their own lifestyle, it is important to remember that it reduces their life span.</P>
    <P>One area where action could be taken soon is adoption.  There is only a small paragraph on adoption in the strategy, and it could go further.  The Adoption Board has been in contact with the child care unit in the Department within the last few months.  The board is anxious to introduce an active list, which would be easier to compile than a stillbirths register. <Col N="703" /> The present list is a passive list which contains women who have given children up for adoption, adoptive children and possibly natural fathers.  The people involved put their names on the list themselves and others can seek the name.</P>
    <P>An active list contains all names, both mothers and children.  If someone decides to look for his or her mother, the name can be found on the list and the woman involved can be contacted to ask whether she wants to make contact with the child.  The Minister should introduce an active list which should be kept under the control of the Department.  Such sensitive information should not be taken outside a statutory body.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the section of the report on health care.  It would be marvellous if the Minister achieved his intentions with regard to breast feeding.  The immunisation programme is also good and I spoke to the Minister for Education about this matter.  It should be considered desirable that children be immunised before they start going to school, although it should not be made compulsory as in America.  One hopes that would not delay attendance at school.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's strategy and I look forward to his energetic efforts in the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for this excellent document.  <i>Shaping a healthier future</i> is undoubtedly a strategy for effective healthcare in the 1990s. By the year 2000 this package will undoubtedly be seen to have been useful in getting the health services into proper shape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most discussion on health in Ireland centres on financial structures and the amounts of money received by doctors and consultants.  I sometimes believe we have lost a feel for the people who should be our real concern.  I am glad the Minister has decided to leave the health boards as they are currently structured. They were set up in 1970 and are still basically solid.  The Minister has only changed the Eastern Health Board and should be complimented for maintaining <Col N="704" /> the others because they perform excellently.</P>
    <P>Health boards usually consist of local representatives, local authority members and representatives of the professions who provide the services.  The boards are based on service in local communities and members on the boards are the best able to provide the service because they understand problems in the community.</P>
    <P>My health board has suffered in the last number of years because it has streamlined its budget to clear its debts. They missed out on the money given to other health boards that had not behaved themselves.  The North-Western Health Board is probably the best run in the country.  I have not always been complimentary to them and I have pointed out their mistakes in the interests of getting a better health service for the people I represent.</P>
    <P>The document says the health boards will now manage and implement the services and provide a budget to be agreed annually with the Minister.  This should bring more accountability and provide a higher quality of service, which can only be better for the public.  All health boards are under pressure, especially in relation to the staffing of services.  Consideration should be given by both the Minister and the Department to the life of the people working in the health services, specifically in nursing.</P>
    <P>I worked in nursing for 26 years.  We should examine general nursing, psychiatric nursing, mental handicap nursing and public health nursing.  People in these areas provide the hands on services and perform admirably within the health sector.  They do not receive the consideration or the praise they deserve, although I do not suggest that such consideration is not given by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A nurse should not have to work until he or she is 60 or 65 before being allowed retire on a pension.  It is a demanding and trying job.  One cannot simply come in at 8 a.m. and leave at 5 p.m., or at 1 p.m. and leave at 9 p.m.  In general hospitals, if there is an emergency or work is not completed, a nurse simply cannot leave. In a factory one might be able to go home <Col N="705" /> at the end of a shift but in nursing a patient's life is at risk.  The demands on nurses mean they have to stay to help and do their duty.</P>
    <P>At times nurses receive nothing in return.  In some circumstances no consideration is given by way of time off for people who work extra hours.  They do not receive extra money.  Nursing is their vocation, it is said to be their hard luck if they are in the wrong place at the wrong time.</P>
    <P>General nurses should be allowed to retire at 55 years of age.  This would be in line with the conditions which apply to psychiatric nurses.  Psychiatric nursing is a trying job because they work under stress from early morning until they leave in the evening.  These nurses may retire at 55 years of age because of the stress and strain of the job.  It is only right that they should be allowed to leave at 55 years of age when one considers the amount of time they must give to the people with whom they work and the amount of listening they must do.  I ask the Minister and the Department to consider reducing the age of retirement to 55 for the other nursing professions.</P>
    <P>I also ask him to bring the nurses' pay review on stream as soon as possible.  This has been talked about for many years.  I ask the Minister and the Department, in conjunction with the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and the unions involved in nursing to bring this situation to an end.  These people make a tremendous commitment to the health services but they do not get the same consideration as others.</P>
    <P>More funding should be made available to the community services in the psychiatric area.  During my time in the trade unions I felt that the document, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> tried to clear the hospitals of people who, it thought, would survive in the community.  I worked with these people and I saw those who moved to the community, but no money was provided for backup services. I seek the Minister's support on this issue. I welcome the commitment given by the Minister over the last number of weeks that this issue is being addressed.  I have <Col N="706" /> no doubt this will happen given the Minister's commitment to the health services. I will follow this to the bitter end to ensure that money is provided for the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for his commitment to provide an extra £25 million for the mentally handicapped.  This is a welcome development.  I condemn the reports that enough has been done for the mentally handicapped because they will never have enough money.  I would like another £25 million added to the money the Minister is providing.  We should never forget these people.  The cost of such a service is great, but the Minister can deliver it, if anyone can.  I have no doubt the cost will be high, but he will be remembered for his contribution to humanity.</P>
    <P>There is a four strand strategy in relation to AIDS &mdash; surveillance, prevention, care and management.  This is important.  The nursing unions recently held a one day seminar on AIDS in Letterkenny, County Donegal, and one amazing fact which emerged was that a 64 year old lady had contracted AIDS. This proves how easy it is to contract the disease and we are at a loss to do anything about it.  Senator Henry mentioned North-South co-operation.  At present, there is excellent co-operation between Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, Letterkenny General Hospital and Sligo General Hospital in relation to cat scans, AIDS procedures, etc.  This is welcome and I am delighted to see it addressed in this document.</P>
    <P>I commend the decision to give all staff an introduction to the health strategy. Staff in the health services have told me this is the most forward-looking document in years.  They can get their teeth into it and it has been welcomed on the ground.  We must support and educate these people because they work with the patients and they will pass on the information to the public.  This will provide a better service in future.  I have no doubt that managers in the health services will meet their staff to discuss this document <Col N="707" /> which contains a lot of information and the need for a health strategy.</P>
    <P>Throughout the years various reports on health have been issued.  People have little concern for their diets and many health problems, such as cancer, smoking and heart disease are caused by inadequate education.  The same is true of alcohol-related accidents and teenage drinking, which seems to be the norm. The people are either not properly informed about the dangers or they are choosing to ignore them.  This document will make it easier for health managers to identify the problems and to talk to their staff.  It is important they should be involved in educating the public.</P>
    <P>Public health nurses are in constant contact with the community.  They can educate the people and the feedback will be important for the formulation of future health care.  Information about the public's needs must be updated.  We must strive to provide a quality health service for everyone, regardless of age, class or creed.  We must address the problems and try to improve them.</P>
    <P>People may ask what is so radical about this document.  There is a new focus on improving the health and quality of life of the people.  What will the changes mean for health service personnel?  It will increase responsibility and give them greater management powers and more opportunity for training and development. This is welcome and I notice it in the nursing area, in particular.  What will the health strategy do for the patient who is the number one priority?  It will mean a better and longer life expectancy, better health for everyone, support for those depending on care in the community and an opportunity to express their views. The health services should help in this regard, but continuous education is important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the document.  It will be a tremendous achievement if, by the year 2000, its contents are carried out in the manner outlined by the Minister because it will provide a better health service.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important document and to congratulate the Minister for producing this health strategy.  It is the first time such a strategy has been presented to us and it is almost 25 years since the health boards were introduced.  It is time to rethink the way we are providing our health care services.  The Progressive Democrats welcome the publication of this strategy which we see as a blueprint for major and much needed structural reform of the health services.</P>
      <P>Annual expenditure on health care in Ireland has grown to £2.25 billion which, in anyone's terms, is a sizeable sum of money.  We must get the best value for money while providing the highest standard of care.  In the report the Minister emphasised his priorities in three areas &mdash; equity, quality of service and improved legal and financial accountability.  By equity he means helping those whose needs are greatest and everyone supports this aspiration.</P>
      <P>By European standards we have a good health service, but as in any area there is room for improvement and the Minister has outlined many areas of improvement in his strategy.  The Minister has set targets which must be achieved and which must be worked on by those involved in the health services.  We must focus our energies on certain aims and ensure that they are reached by the end of this plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the key objectives in the health strategy.  Nobody could argue about stricter financial control over the new health authorities and a more focused health promotion policy which <Col N="709" /> would reduce avoidable deaths.  The more significant role for general practitioners and the special health initiative for deprived areas and for groups such as travellers and the mentally handicapped are also welcome.  I welcome the fact that more attention is being paid to the user of the service &mdash; the patient.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact also that the Minister has acknowledged that we do not need any more hospitals after Tallaght has been built and that better and more organised community care and general practice is what is needed.  The Progressive Democrats encourage and welcome this redirection of resources to enhance primary care.  We will support the Minister's efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>The problem many people have with this strategy is the cost.  We spend huge sums of money on the health services and a lot of these aspirations will be costly to implement.  If one looks at health promotion, which is desirable, it takes a long time to see its effects; and this may be difficult because people want to see results quickly.  Strengthening the role of general practice and community care and providing extra services, including those we spoke about this morning in the dental area concerning private dentists, will be costly.  People want action quickly and they want to be able to measure the results.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the main theme is the reorientation or reshaping of our health services so that improving people's health and quality of life becomes a primary and unifying focus of all our efforts. That is commendable.  We spoke about the huge cost of the health services and the Minister said my party may not support him when he looks for additional funding in the Estimates next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that if he can demonstrate effectiveness and value for money, we will support him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the acknowledgement in the plan that not everything depends on medicine and curing diseases.  Preventative medicine is important and it <Col N="710" /> involves a lot of changes in our habits &mdash; for example, our smoking, drinking and eating habits and the amount of exercise we take.  Many illnesses are not caused by outside factors, they are self-induced. Although we spend a lot of money on the health services, statistics show that Ireland is close to the bottom of the table when it comes to life expectancy.  We must find out why that is the case and try to change it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's promise to publish a plan later this year for women's health, which will be implemented over the next four years.  I am glad the Minister has said that this plan will take account of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women of which I was a member.  For too long women's health has been under-funded and neglected.  A strategy which has targets must be put in place.  For generations women have cared for everyone else except themselves.  They now need to be cared for.</P>
    <P>My party welcomes the commitment for a national policy to provide refuge accommodation for women and children who are victims of domestics violence. Recently Members saw a video produced by the Adapt refuge in Limerick.  It was frightening and it made us realise that we are not providing adequate funding for this service.  It has been acknowledged that health boards should provide this service.  This is necessary because many areas do not have such facilities.  When we discuss incidents such as the Kilkenny incest case, many people will ask how can women stay in these situations of violence.  Until now, these women had nowhere to go.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister's commitment to many other areas relating to women's health is welcome &mdash; for example, genetic counselling. There has been a lot of discussion about breast screening programmes for women and this has been debated in this and the other House.  While everyone appreciates the cost of providing mammography services, we acknowledge that this might not be the most effective way to provide screening for women under 50 <Col N="711" /> years.  Perhaps we should consider self-examination or breast examination by GPs which would cost less than mammography services, which may not be effective.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to look at the national screening programme after the results of the Eccles Street programme are finalised.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about counselling and information for women who must deal with crisis pregnancies.  This was addressed in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which recommended that legislation be implemented after the amendment was passed in November 1992.  While I understand that legislation is in the pipeline, I would like to know when it will be introduced.</P>
    <P>When Senator Henry and I spoke about the breast screening programme on the Adjournment last week, the Acting Chairman inadvertently said we were looking for a breast feeding programme. I am glad the Minister mentioned this in his report.  He wants 30 per cent of all four month old babies to be breast fed by the year 2000.  I am glad to say that I breast fed my three children at four months.  The hepatitis C incident highlighted the importance and the different problems women have in the health services. I welcome this proposed plan and look forward to its publication.  Provisions for family planning are also welcome. Sterilisation services for men and women are badly needed throughout the country.  Certain urban areas have this service, but many areas do not.</P>
    <P>If all the plans outlined in the strategy are brought to fruition, it will mean a better standard of medical care for everyone and will ensure that the vast amount of money we are spending will be spent more efficiently.  Nothing is perfect, but this document goes a long way toward addressing the needs of health services in terms of efficiency and accountability and it is the best way to deliver health care to the patient.  If at the end of the four year period the action plan is in place, we will have a healthier nation and we will get a better return for the millions of pounds <Col N="712" /> we are investing.  We have seen a lot of short term fixes in this area and, therefore, the provision of a plan and a strategy is welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Honan for sharing her time.  A national health strategy must target those most in need in order to achieve overall improvements in health standards in an appropriate way.  I refer to the GMS.  Until 1991 a fee per item system of payment to doctors and pharmacists was in operation.  At the time we were told by the programme manager and the executive of the Southern Health Board that if we changed that to a capitation grant there would be great improvements, because we would know what we had to pay and, therefore, savings would be made which could be injected into the health services. However, that did not happen.  At that time 39 per cent of the people were eligible, but that figure has been reduced to 33 or 34 per cent.  The Minister is being praised for his concern for people. However, women raising children in my area, which is no different to any other, cannot afford to go to the doctor and pay £15.  If they go to the Doctor, they cannot afford to go the chemist.  That is not an exaggeration, it is a fact.  I wonder if the change from the fee per item system to the capitation system was in the interest of the patient.  Senator Roche mentioned people coming from a GP's practice when they threatened to withdraw, but that did not apply only to Bray.  I hope Senator Roche is listening.  It applied to many other areas of this country as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about the health boards, about linking the general practitioners to the hospital, setting up hospital boards of management and bringing general practitioners on to the boards of management.  I refer to Mallow general hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not refer to community care but I make one strong request to the Minister. In 1988, because of the policy of fiscal rectitude adopted by the Government of the day, health advisory committees were withdrawn.  There is provision in the 1970 Health Act for <Col N="713" /> health advisory committees and I appeal to the Minister to set these up, even if he limits their meetings to even one every few months.  The health advisory committee would provide a forum for the whole spectrum of people involved in health services.  The regional health board is too far removed from the people in that regard.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to advise the executive officers of the health board to increase the income limit for full eligibility and make tax paid deductible.  I am not exaggerating when I say that this is a serious problem.  People cannot afford to pay for health care because the income limit for full eligibility is too low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on bringing forward this very important document.  It is very thought provoking document which was well researched by his officials and by himself.  The Minister then allowed all concerned the opportunity to make a response to it.  That is a good basis for any document.</P>
      <P>The principles of the document are very important and equity for health care is of vital importance.  He has set that as the first priority.  The second priority is the quality of service.  Accountability is also very important in the provision of a proper health care system in this country. I wish to speak about a number of headings but I will not be able to cover them all.</P>
      <P>Accountability comes into the area of budgets.  The budget of a health board, indeed the budget of any public body, is of importance.  We all have problems with budgets which are structured on a yearly basis.  That applies to county councils, health boards and Government. Decisions are often made at the very end of the year which are not part of the proper strategy of the institution.  Annual budgets in themselves are not in the best interests of a health care service.  This is a four year programme.  It is a pity we could not have a four year budget as well so that the strategy would be maintained in planning the annual budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> In regard to the development of the health services, over the last number of years some very important Bills were put through both Houses of the Oireachtas. In 1992 we had the Child Care Bill, now the Child Care Act, and the Nursing Homes Homes Bill, now the Nursing Homes Act.  Those Acts are now in place and funding is being found for them.  They are an important step in the development of our health services.</P>
    <P>I have a complaint about the Nursing Homes Act.  It is important that we have a subvention system for people who want to go into nursing homes, but we should always be conscious of the fact that some people want to end their days in their own home or with their family.  I am not convinced that we are supporting that concept.  At present it is not in the financial interest of people to stay at home and be cared for there.  We have the carer's allowance, which is administered by the Department of Social Welfare but which impinges on the health and health care of people, and we have the subvention to nursing homes.  If we had a subvention to the family that would care for their elderly parent or relative, more people would stay at home and be cared for there.</P>
    <P>I also wish to comment on the psychiatric services.  The community approach to psychiatric services was welcome and an important step in the breaking down of the large psychiatric hospitals; but I am perturbed that the community approach does not receive adequate financial backup, as is the case from the information that was made available to me. The discharge of people from psychiatric hospitals into hostels and houses in the community is not an end in itself.  Back-up and a follow-up service is necessary and the health boards and the Department must take on this responsibility. The responsibility cannot be undertaken by untrained people as is sometimes the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>Professional back-up must be provided. The professionals are not being provided.  How many health boards are providing training facilities for psychiatric nurses?  The Western Health Board <Col N="715" /> from which I come, although I have not been a member for many years, has not trained a psychiatric nurses in ten years. Who is carrying out the psychiatric nursing? I am of the opinion that many untrained people are now carrying out the functions of professionals in the best psychiatric services.  That is not in the best interests of provision of psychiatric care in this country and we will pay the price for that in the future.  That matter should be addressed.  The provision of professional services for the care of the mentally ill is of paramount importance.  I would like to see the Minister allow the training of psychiatric nurses in the Western Health Board area this year.  I understand that An Bord Altranais, the Nursing Board, have already cleared the way there and the Department should allow the provision of nurse training facilities for the intake of students in 1994.</P>
    <P>The other area of vital importance in my own county is the decision by Government recently to locate a high detention prison in Castlerea.  That will have an effect on the psychiatric services there. The Western Health Board last week decided to maintain the services for the mentally ill for that area of the county in Castlerea.  I call on the Minister to endorse that decision and provide finance for the provision of those services there. We owe this to the mentally ill people in that half of the county and to the staff who have been providing that service there for many years.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the development of services for the mentally handicapped.  This is a welcome development and it is important that there is now a realisation that it is not appropriate to place mentally handicapped adults in psychiatric hospitals, which was the case down through the years.  The Minister has provided residential places for the mentally handicapped and that is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>There has been to some extent a geographical rat race between the health boards as regards the provision of acute services, among others.  While I agree <Col N="716" /> with the principle of health boards, there must also be a balance in the provision of services on a county basis.  The recent decision of the Western Health Board to seek the extension of the acute services in the county hospital in Roscommon is an important policy step.  I ask the Department and the Minister to support this by putting in place a second anaesthetist and a second surgeon in the county hospital in Roscommon.  This is necessary to relieve the pressure in Galway and Castlebar.  It is not now appropriate to have a single anaesthetist and a single surgeon working in a hospital and I hope that in the near future the Department and the Minister can see fit to support the Western Health Board in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for sharing his time with me and I compliment the Minister and his Department for bringing forward this thought provoking document.  Five minutes will not do it justice, but I will highlight some of its aspects.  The last review of the child health services was made in 1967.  It is an oversight that no attention has been paid to child health services since then, and I am glad that the Minister has undertaken to review the services.  If we have healthy children they will grow up to be healthy adults.  Many problems which would require more expensive treatment in later life can be sorted out in childhood.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the document focuses not on buildings and fancy, shiny equipment, but on the services we can provide for everyone.  The emphasis on primary health care is important and I hope that in all aspects of the health services &mdash; GPs, public health nurses and hospital staff &mdash; the public is given the best possible treatment and gets the best possible value out of the 8 or 9 per cent of GNP spent on health care each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with other speakers in paying tribute to the Minister for his dedication to the mentally handicapped.  I would remind people in the Mid-Western Health Board area that there has been an increase of funds from the Government to the mentally handicapped. Despite newspaper editorials to the contrary, <Col N="717" /> this Government is committed to helping the mentally handicapped, particularly in the mid west area.  Scare-mongering by individuals telling people that money is not being made available is little short of lying.</P>
    <P>The strategy includes a section on travellers' health.  As a member of the task force on the travelling community, I appreciate that the Minister has undertaken a joint study with the task force on the general health of travellers and how it can be improved.  A health service can only be judged on how effectively it delivers to every section of society.  One section which seems to suffer from a greater degree of ill health is the travelling community and any study which will help improve its general health is to be welcomed.  Travellers present greater problems for the delivery of health services than the settled community, as they are highly mobile, live in poor sanitary conditions and, by virtue of intermarriage, are at higher risk of hereditary diseases than others.  I welcome the emphasis on the care that must be delivered to travellers.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the emphasis on palliative care.  We have not been as diligent about it as we might have been and those who are terminally ill should get the best possible care in the last years of their lives.  I hope that when the Minister, Deputy Howlin, leaves office he will be known not as the Minister for sickness but for health.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the programme published by the Minister for Health and to compliment him and his Department for putting together such a fine programme in a short time covering the many aspects of the health service.  We recognise that it is one of the most expansive Government Departments, <Col N="718" /> which affects everybody directly or indirectly.  This plan puts matters into focus.  I am glad the Minister has set a target date for implementation, because if time targets are put in place an effort will be made to reach them.  That is important if something effective is to be done.</P>
      <P>This document is the starting point of an action plan and further development plans in different areas will have to be put in place subsequent to it.  One of these is the dental development plan. Although I did not have an opportunity to speak on this matter this morning, it is one which must be addressed.  It is important to recognise that there is a cost factor involved and a plan cannot be put in place without financial support.  In order to widen its remit and extend the numbers catered for by the dental service, there will be a cost involved.  The dentists who will implement this plan must be provided with the necessary resources.</P>
      <P>This programme also includes the presentation of a plan for women's health.  A serious issue which has arisen in recent times is that the incidence of breast cancer in women in Ireland has increased rapidly.  There must be a reason for this and there is a need for research in this matter to find the cause.  It must be addressed urgently and I hope that when the Minister is considering this matter he will give it priority.  It is unacceptable that the rate of breast cancer among women in Ireland should increase so rapidly compared to other member states of the European Union.</P>
      <P>This programme also suggests there should be a special health programme for the cares and needs of travellers.  Other Senators have spoken about this important issue.  Travellers have not been given any special consideration in the health care area up to now, although they have been given special treatment by local government and local authorities in regard to housing.  There has not been a specific and conscious follow up on this issue and their case warrants special attention.  It is good that it has been recognised by the Minister in this plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> The role of acute hospitals in the health service has also been addressed here.  I am interested to see how its role will emerge within the various communities. As somebody who comes from a peripheral area, I would be concerned that the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the acute hospital may take priority over the health requirements and needs of those working on the ground.  Accessibility of health service is also important.</P>
    <P>In the County Clare area, the Limerick and Galway Regional Hospitals are now becoming the focus of attention and the role of the local county hospital is diminishing. This is unacceptable.  Accessibility of the health care service on a geographic basis will have to be examined. There must be a balance between cost effectiveness and accessibility.  This applies especially to rural and isolated area and should not be lost sight of in the restructuring of the health service as proposed in this document.</P>
    <P>The Minister's three underlying principles are equity, quality of service and accountability.  He refers to the participants and says that greater recognition will be given to the key role of these who provide the service and the importance of enabling them to do their fullest potential.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise an issue relating to the district nurses who provide these services on the ground.  Last night the district nurses in Kilrush voted to take strike action in County Clare because of an unsatisfactory situation that has developed with the Mid-Western Health Board.  What the Minister has said here is fundamental.  The role of the professional health care person of the ground should be given key priority and their voices should be heard and recognised.  There has been a tendency for the administrator and the bureaucracy to supersede the voice of the professional.  It is not good that the opinions of the person on the ground are not deeded.  I ask the Minister to contact the Mid-Western Health Board this afternoon and find out why such a situation was allowed to develop. It is incredible that such action should <Col N="720" /> have come about.  These nurses are professionals who have been providing an excellent service across the county for many years.  They have always given not only what is required by the board but a service to the local community.  They are forced to take strike action because of bureaucracy not facilitating or recognising their specific needs.  I ask the Minister to address this matter directly with the Mid-Western Health Board this evening to ensure that this strike does not go ahead.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion of the mental handicap services.  A group of parents in Kilrush raised over £70,000 to build a workshop there and were assured by the Mid-Western Health Board that the necessary money would be provided if they provided a certain amount themselves. However, they have been told by the board that the additional money provided by the Minister this year for the mentally handicapped can only go towards existing services and not to a new facility.  The people propose to provide a service that is required in an isolated area.  They were initially given assurances from the board that money would be provided, now they have been told it is not available.  I ask the Minister to address this matter.</P>
    <P>I would love to address many other issues in this document but I do not have the time because I agreed to share the remainder of my time with Senator O'Kennedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for sharing her time. Obviously, the Senator had more to contribute to the debate.</P>
      <P>The AIDS epidemic is the single greatest problem of our period.  I want to read a letter, which is of great significance to this debate, from a distinguished public servant who was a county physician in north Tipperary for many years.  Having retired from service he went to work in Zambia on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greetings from Zambia. ... this is not the main purpose of this letter, which is to give you a personal experience <Col N="721" /> of the AIDS epidemic today.  The reality of this disease and the destruction and suffering it is bringing to the people here is far worse than anything I had imagined...</P>
    <P>If your patient is in the age group 15-45, weighs under 40 kg., has a history of chronic diarrhoea and oral monilia, there is not much doubt about the diagnosis. I believe that a survey in Lusaka, the capital, reveals that one in three adults test HIV positive, and most of these will be dead in five years.  Infants with AIDS are quite common and pathetic and most of them will die before the age of three.  Of those who survive, many are AIDS orphans where both parents have died....  It does not need much imagination to see the personal and social tragedy that this involves &mdash; what kind of adults will these children grow up to be?</P>
    <P>My colleague, Dr. John Hartley, an Englishman and Medical Director of the hospital, has supplied me with some statistics of this hospital which bear on all of this.</P>
    <P>(1)  65% of persons admitted to the hospital for various complaints in the 25 to 40 year old age group tested positive for HIV in 1991.</P>
    <P>(2)  80% of all TB cases test positive for HIV.</P>
    <P>(3)  18.2% of 900 fit blood donors tested positive for HIV in 1993.</P>
    <P>This means that almost 20% of apparently healthy adults in this area are carrying the HIV virus and will come down with the disease AIDS within the next five years.</P>
    <P>Dr. Hartley, in his report for 1993, states &ldquo;Work as a physician is dominated by HIV related disease and it leads to a strain and a sense of helplessness induced by the unrelenting nature of the epidemic and the pitiful state of many of the sufferers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Proof of the escalating figures for AIDS in this hospital may be given by the fact that in 1992, we had 500 patients with TB, whereas last year, <Col N="722" /> 1993, the number had risen to 800, and most of these were HIV related.</P>
    <P>His conclusions were as follows:</P>
    <P>To what may one attribute this modern epidemic?  It is generally accepted that &ldquo;sleeping around&rdquo; is the main cause, and this applies both to teenagers and to young adults.  Now it is widespread &mdash; it was not always thus, but seems to have come about in the past thirty years or so.  Traditional Zambian marriage was monogamous and for life, e.g., the Bemba tribe. True, the Tonga tribe, which whom I work, are polygamous, but there is a whale of a difference between polygamy and promiscuity as we have now.</P>
    <P>The health authorities in Zambia seem to be overwhelmed by the problem. For some time, they may have failed to realise the extent of the disaster. However, there has been an extensive publicity campaign to inform people of the risks of casual sex and condoms have been freely available from 1985.  If you are driving to Lusaka today you will see big placards warning people of the dangers of casual sex, both as to STDs in general and to AIDS in particular.  Information is there in plenty, but neither this nor the fear of contracting AIDS, nor the availability of condoms has succeeded in stemming the tide.  It's realised here now that awareness of facts alone does not alter behaviour.  Dr. Hartley says &ldquo;A condom is better than no condom&rdquo; but I wonder if even this is true.</P>
    <P>However, in the Ireland in which I grew up, the example of home, school and society in general helped me and my generation to acquire control in matters sexual &mdash; a necessary step on the road to development of the human person.</P>
    <P>He goes on:</P>
    <P>Now, if you offer the youth of today mere information and freely available condoms, are you helping him to gain that control of his sexuality.  I think <Col N="723" /> not, and suggest the Zambian experience supports this contention.</P>
    <P>You may say to me that Zambian and Ireland are very different countries. Maybe so, but I see a lot of similarity between the Zambian and Irish characters. Both are bright and basically happy people.  They both like company and are good talkers, both have a good sense of humour, both are easy going but both can be fiery or even violent if aroused.  If what has happened here in Zambia with AIDS should be replicated, even in a small way in Ireland, we would have on our hands a major disaster that would make the Famine of '47 or the present unemployment crisis seem small beer.  Furthermore, as is happening here, the resources for medical care are being gobbled up by AIDS patients, and we are short of almost everything that would be taken for granted in the First World, drugs, needles, syringes, gloves etc.  Sophisticated medical techniques like heart surgery, kidney transplant or joint replacement surgery simply do not exist here.  Thus, the good health service built up over several years in Ireland could, itself, be put at risk if AIDS got a hold on our people, as it has got a hold on the people in Zambia.</P>
    <P>Dr. Hartley comments further: &ldquo;If you have a society which has a `natural' system which gives protection against spread of HIV it is an enviable situation, and to erode it by promotion of condoms and liberalisation of sexual morals would be a backward step.&rdquo; My plea, therefore, is that the greatest bulwark we have against AIDS is traditional sexual morality.  The State must do all it can to support this, not to undermine it.</P>
    <P>This letter was written by Dr. Brian Lemass of Nenagh, retired county physician who gave a lifetime of service to the people of north County Tipperary. He wrote the letter to a senior figure in the Department of Health to indicate, from the experience he had, the need to <Col N="724" /> have responsibility in sexual matters as the first priority, and not the programme of &ldquo;If you must have sex have a condom&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I put extracts from this letter on the record of the House because I hope that in all things we do we will learn that if we follow that latter road, &ldquo;have a condom, use a condom&rdquo;, we may face the consequences that the poor people of Zambia are facing now where normal health care is impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending the House and taking this Adjournment Matter.  It is an accepted principle of natural justice that every citizen should have ready and reasonable access to all State services.  The Government's commitment to this principle is indicated by its decision to give everybody living in the 01 area local telephone call access to all the decentralised Government offices throughout the country.  However, the Government has failed to give this to all the citizens of rural Ireland.  It has created a two-tier society regarding this issue, with everybody living outside the 01 area as second class citizens and heavily penalised for living outside the Pale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With increasing contact being necessary with Government Departments, all such Departments should be accessible at a local charge.  Already, any Dublin phone subscriber cannot alone phone Dublin-based Government offices at a local charge but can now also contact all decentralised Government offices at the same charge.  For example, anybody in Dublin can call the Revenue Commissioners in Limerick for the cost of a local call but somebody in Rathkeale or <Col N="725" /> Newcastle West, just 18 to 20 miles form Limerick is charged at a trunk call rate if the caller phones the same office in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies to an old age pensioner wanting to contact the Department of Social Welfare in Sligo or Letterkenny, or a student wanting to contact the Department of Education in Athlone.  Why should a pensioner, student or taxpayer outside Dublin pay up to seven times as much as a person in Dublin to contact Government Departments? It is totally unjust and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>On 28 November 1991, Mr. Andrew D. Conlon, Market Development Manager, Telecom Éireann said:</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann's national responsibility and the social demands on it to apply a rule which offers greatest equity to all must be remembered. On issues of such importance as pricing, we must take a national view so as no one area in the country is treated in any way more favourably than any other area.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister how it is possible to have the rural telephone anomaly if this is Telecom Éireann policy?</P>
    <P>A number of years ago, Telecom Éireann was directed by the then Minister for Communication, Deputy Séamus Brennan, to reorganise its telephone charge areas to ensure the greatest equity.  However, this has not been undertaken and the rural telephone anomaly still exists.  In this respect, the report of the Telephone Users' Advisory Group urges that all Government Departments, health boards, local authorities, hospitals and schools in receipt of heavy telephone traffic from the public should be charged as local calls.  That recommendation was made in January 1994.  To date no action has been taken on it and I ask the Minister to implement it.</P>
    <P>This situation also applies to other services. The total population of Dublin can contact all their services, hospitals, councils, all Government offices for a local charge, yet the people in county areas have to contact their council, central <Col N="726" /> hospital and any other similar offices with a trunk call charge.  For example, people in Foynes, Shanagolden, Rathkeale, Ardagh, Newcastle West, Templeglantine, Tournafulla and Ballingarry, which is only 18 miles from Limerick, must all pay trunk call charges to contact the council offices, the Mid-Western Health Board or Government offices in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Why should people in these areas pay three times the charges as their Dublin counterparts in similar circumstances? With increasing contact being necessary with Government offices, local government offices and health board offices these services should be available at a local call charge.  In view of this I ask the Minister to act on this issue as matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Neville for raising this matter. The possibility of introducing such a system was adverted to by the Telephone Users' Advisory Group in its first report to me in January 1994 and I understand the reasoning behind it.</P>
      <P>The technical means of providing the service referred to by the Senator is through the &ldquo;1850&rdquo; service provided by Telecom Éireann.  This is a premium rate service available throughout the State. As a premium rate service the charge to the customer using the service, in this case the recipient of the call, is substantially higher than the normal cost of an equivalent call.</P>
      <P>It is essentially a matter for each Government Department to decide, as a customer of Telecom Éireann, whether or not it wishes to provide this service to the public and whether or not they can, within the confines of their administrative budgets, bear the additional costs involved.</P>
      <P>I advised the Dáil, and I quote from the Official Report, 18 May 1993, Vol. 430, col. 2062, that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...the Government has decided that all Government Departments and State agencies and local authorities will <Col N="727" /> be obliged to facilitate a fast and efficient service to their callers involving the maximisation of the freefone service and a call-back service where queries cannot be answered speedily.</P>
    <P>This decision was notified to all Government Departments with an instruction that it be copied to bodies under their aegis.  My own Department found that, due to cost considerations, it was not possible to provide freefone or &ldquo;1850&rdquo; facilities.  All staff were, however, instructed that, where telephone callers could not be dealt with promptly, contact numbers should be taken in order that the call could be returned by departmental staff.</P>
    <P>My Department will be installing new automated telephone facilities whereby callers who know the extension they require can dial direct to that extension or be put through a voice mail service when the person they wish to contact is not available.  I am also having the &ldquo;1850&rdquo; services, to at least those areas of the Department which deal to a significant extent with the public, considered in the context of the provision of these new facilities.  These facilities will minimise the cost to members of the public endevouring <Col N="728" /> to transact business by telephone with my Department.</P>
    <P>I know from my follow up inquiries that some other Departments which examined the possibility of introducing the 1850 service also concluded, on cost grounds, that they could not justify making it generally available.  My understanding is that most, if not all, Departments have streamlined their handling of telephone contact with the general public.</P>
    <P>I understand why these suggestions are being made.  However, it is not reasonable to expect the Government to carry significant additional costs which would arise through the general application of 1850 facilities for Departments.  I remind the House that this country, through the free telephone rental allowance scheme operated by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, already provides a social facility which is unequalled in telephony terms.</P>
