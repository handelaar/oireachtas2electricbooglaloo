      <P>Before calling the Leader of the House, I am sure that Members would like to join with me in welcoming a Parliamentary Delegation from the Republic of Poland who are present.  They are led by Senator Adam Struzik, who is the Marshall or Speaker of the Senate.  Having had a discussion with him he informed me that he is known as a Marshall with a stick and he has produced a photograph.  I am considering asking the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to do something similar for me.  I hope they enjoy their stay here in Ireland and that their visit is very successful.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave and Senator Ross that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, they propose to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to call for an emergency session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to take immediate action on the genocide in Rwanda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to introduce a suicide prevention programme.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I understand that Senator Ross and Senator Cosgrave will share their time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by Senator Manning, Senator O'Toole and others for a list of the legislative programme between now and the summer recess.  I will circulate this after we have dealt with the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>It is intended to deal with the Landlord and Tenant Bill, the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, the Trade and Marketing Promotion (Amendment) Bill, the Consumer Credit Bill, the Irish Horse Racing Industry Bill, the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, the Family Law Bill, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, An Bord Bia, the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill, the Investments and Partnerships Bill, the National Heritage Council Bill and the Casual Trading Bill. One or two other Bills may be initiated between now and the summer as well so, as the House will realise, we have a very busy session ahead of us between now and the summer recess.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, Report and Final Stages, between now and 6 p.m., and Item 41 between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>My party and I are very happy that there is a delegation of colleagues from the Parliament of Poland. They are very welcome.  On the question of the stick, a Chathaoirligh, you are more used to leading with a carrot.  That works well here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the House is very clever. He pre-empted a lot of the flak that would <Col N="1171" /> have fallen on his head today by producing that long overdue list.  It also draws attention to the extremely bad way in which the Government is organising its business at present in this House.</P>
    <P>Every year we have weeks in the middle of the session with very little happening, such as this week; we are not sitting tomorrow.  Then we have a rush of Bills at the end of the session.  While I appreciate the number of Bills which the Leader of the House has read out to us today, Senator O'Toole, myself and others have also been asking for some sort of timetable.  We now know what Bills are to be taken, we will have time to prepare for them.  For his next piece of homework the Leader might indicate dates when he intends to bring in these Bills.  Perhaps he would give us a work schedule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the question of a debate on Northern Ireland on many occasions in the past, and it was not on the list of topics to which the Leader of the House referred.  There is an enormous sense of urgency and desperation about things at present and Members on all sides have asked that we have a debate here as soon as possible.  I know the Leader is trying to organise that and I ask him to convey to the Tánaiste the very strong feeling from all sides of the House that such a debate is necessary.</P>
      <P>It would also be very helpful if we could get clarification from the Minister for Justice on the current security situation. There is genuine concern about this, not least of which derives from some of the incidents yesterday.  I do not intend to say any more about that but all Members of the House, certainly those on this side, would welcome a debate on the current security situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the delegation from Poland.  Many years ago when I was a member of the Irish Solidarnosc Society we drew the attention <Col N="1172" /> of some of the security forces in this State who kept an eye on our business.  Poland has moved on a long way since then.  The delegation is very welcome.</P>
      <P>In the context of the European elections it would be wise to have a debate on developments in the European Union before the election to allow a focused debate take place that will also lead to a greater awareness of the need to keep an eye on things in Europe.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise two issues of concern. Since the Finance Bill was passed here last week, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment raised a proposal about the Government guaranteeing venture capital being supplied by the banks.  I am confused about that and I would like clarification from the Leader of the House.  Up to about three years ago venture capital invested by ordinary punters through BES schemes which was guaranteed by the banks was ruled out of order by the Government as not coming under the terms of the scheme.  At that stage the banks were guaranteeing it and I had no difficulty with the banks taking the risk.  The banks are now refusing to take the risk and the Government is going to underwrite the investments.  I would have thought the previous arrangement was better.  Perhaps I do not understand it but it needs to be spelled out in some detail to us.</P>
      <P>I recently raised with the Leader of the House the need to have a debate on the input of elected public representatives to the development of an education policy. It is important that such a debate takes place before that Minister brings forward proposals on the regional education council, for example, and Members say they never had an input.  Such a debate would be useful and should take place in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senators are aware that there is a problem with regard to the staffing of the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda Hospital.  As one of those involved in setting up this unit I ask the Leader of the House to express our concern not just to the Minister for Health but also to the Minister for Justice.  While <Col N="1173" /> the unit has been important for the treatment of women and young male children, it has also been particularly important in getting the good forensic evidence necessary for the Garda to get convictions. Many people will be extremely sorry to see any diminution in the good service given by the unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to add to the long list he has outlined the new Local Government (Planning) Regulations, 1994.  It would be appropriate for this House to debate those regulations brought in recently by the Minister &mdash; they are welcome changes as far as I am concerned &mdash; because our electorate is, by and large, comprised of local authority members.  Direct contact with the local authority system by Members of this House is an ongoing process.  As the local authorities will be implementing the regulations nationally a should debate them.  If we are to implement those regulations nationally a proper public debate should take place about them so that there is no confusion. Such a debate would be in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not normally comment publicly when there is loss of life in Ireland.  That is not to suggest that I do not care and that I do not feel diminished by every death.  I want to refer to a killing in Dublin in recent days; there is no such thing as just another killing.  Life is precious no matter whose life it may be and whatever family may be left to grieve.</P>
      <P>We are at a T-junction where we either turn left and start a civil war, or we turn right and try to encourage Sinn Féin to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to peace and we support Jim Molyneaux as he encourages the loyalist paramilitaries to also say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  We are at a crisis.  I support Senator Manning's call that this House should discuss Northern Ireland very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed to discover that the House will sit only one day this week.  It seems the Government has no legislation for this House but that is no reason for us to shut up shop.  Only a <Col N="1174" /> few weeks ago, I spoke about the value of this House in handling debates on topics that were not of immediate urgency.  The three examples to which I referred were the peace-keeping versus the peacemaking role of the United Nations, the enlargement of the European Union and the possibility of debating what we wanted from our banks.  The reason I asked for a debate on those issues at that stage was to ensure they would not be debated in the heat of a crisis.</P>
      <P>If the Leader of the House is looking for a suggestion of other topics the currency situation could be debated at this stage.  It is causing some concern but is not yet a crisis.  We could decide what we want our currency to do and at what level we wish it to be.  This House is not being used as it should.  The Irish punt is causing some concern to our exporters, but we should decide what we want it to do by having a debate.  Should it be perched at 3 per cent above the Deutsche Mark rate on the EMS grid?  I am not sure, but that is the sort of work this House could debate.  I urge the Leader to use these occasions when no work is forthcoming to find time to debate long term subjects away from the heat of the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the call by Senator O'Toole for a debate on the education process.  It is obviously a historic time for Irish education and momentum for change is gaining strength every day.  The publication of the White Paper is coming closer and there should be a discussion in this Chamber on the issue.  Many issues still have to be clarified and much more talking still needs to be done.  Senators should get the chance to discuss the education process and the changes that are likely to ensue.  I hope such a debate will take place in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wilson's comment on the need for a continuing debate on Northern Ireland.  I am glad he referred to this recent death.  This House, and especially persons like myself who have condemned atrocities committed by the Provisional IRA in the <Col N="1175" /> North, should have the opportunity to strongly condemn the murder of this young man.  I pay tribute to him for his courage and bravery in saving the lives of several hundred people, although it transpired he was a member of the IRA. If the rest of that organisation would follow his example and save lives instead of killing, this country would be a great deal better off.  I could not help experiencing a sense of irony when I saw photographs of a demonstration outside that public house.  People there were holding placards saying &ldquo;Another Victim of Britain's Dirty War&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was not here, a Chathaoirligh, for the first part of the Order of Business.  I assume some of my colleagues referred to the regrettable situation in the sexual assault unit of the Rotunda Hospital.  I hope that will be a matter of concern to this House.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange for a debate at some stage on that subject?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I add my welcome to the Polish delegation.  They have been in this country since last Monday and I hope they will enjoy the rest of their stay.</P>
      <P>We will try to put a time frame on the forthcoming legislative programme.  We have given a commitment to have a debate as soon as possible on several of the issues raised today, such as Northern Ireland, education and the enlargement of the EU.  Senator Quinn added another issue which ties in with Senator O'Toole's issue of loan currency and small businesses. Hopefully, the Minister for Finance or another Minister will come to the House to discuss this most important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> It is not healthy to have the Order Paper full one week and a lack of Bills the next.  This may be due to the new committee system, although I understood that under this system matters would be different.  I have also noticed over the years that once the Finance Bill is introduced into the Dáil other matters appear to dry up; until this Bill has been enacted the remainder of the Government's legislative programme appears to come to a halt.  Perhaps the powers that be should consider this.</P>
    <P>Regarding the lack of staff at the Rotunda Hospital sexual assault unit, I assure Senator Henry and Senator Norris that I will pass on the concerns of the House on the matter.  I assure Senator Finneran that the Whip is making every effort to have the new local planning regulations debated in the House as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I must remind the House that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except in the case of the proposer of an amendment who may reply to discussion on the amendment. In addition, each amendment must be seconded on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 10 form a composite proposal and both may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`Combat Drugs Fund' means a fund established under the terms of this Act for the allocation of certain monies raised under the Act to organisations or groups working to combat the medical or social effects of drugs abuse;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to establish a Combat Drugs Fund, the objective of <Col N="1177" /> which is to allocate moneys to organisations which assist those affected by drugs, those involved in the rehabilitation of drug users and those involved in dealing with the effects on society from the use of illegal drugs.  Its objective is also to allocate moneys allowing the victims, and their families, of the users of drugs to be compensated for the effects of the drug users and the outflow of their activities on them.</P>
    <P>Many of the drug barons have lavish lifestyles.  They also have back up people who suffer much and too often die at a young age as a result of drugs abuse. This follows from the objective of these barons to involve people at a very young age in the use of drugs to finance their lifestyles.</P>
    <P>There should be programmes developed to counteract the evil these people have perpetrated, including programmes which advise people on the necessity to avoid involvement in illegal drugs at a very young age and educational programmes to commence at an early age.  These programmes should be financed from money obtained from the confiscation of the assets arising from the illegal sale, peddling and importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>These moneys should also fund research undertaken by the State, including the establishment of a research department to ascertain why there has been a massive and spiralling increase in the use of drugs in society and what programmes can be developed to counteract this.  In this respect there is a need to introduce programmes to counteract this development and it is important for society that this issue be addressed in this way: what will society be like over the next five, ten or 15 years if the present growth in the drug culture develops?</P>
    <P>The money could also assist the victims of crimes related to drugs and the families of those affected by drugs.  Often the victims, families of victims and so on are in court merely as witnesses.  They are not regarded as victims.  Some funding should be available to assist those who have been negatively impacted by the <Col N="1178" /> drug culture and the use of drugs in society.  This money could be used to extend the role of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  This has been discussed over a period of six months.  A great deal of concern has been expressed about the limitations of this tribunal.  Its role should be extended to compensate for more than loss of property, to which it is mainly confined at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the Bill, which is welcome and for which we have asked for a long time, will produce large amounts of money from the proceeds of criminal activities, especially drug abuse and trafficking.  This money should be used on programmes to counteract the effects of such activities.  The Minister said her Department has financial difficulties in relation to this proposal but they should be overcome.  The Minister and the Minister for Health should break through the bureaucracy in this area and agree on programmes to be funded by the confiscation of the proceeds from drug trafficking.  The argument speaks for itself and I will welcome the Minister's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the thrust of the proposal of how the money from the proceeds of crime should be spent, I am concerned about how it is administered.  Expenses will be incurred if we set up another committee to administer the amount collected from drug barons.  I would prefer to see this money distributed to Departments.  I welcome the concept that money should be used for preventive programmes, rehabilitation centres and counselling and therapy services.  However, the establishment of another committee will require staff to administer it.  There should be a streamlining of the bureaucracy involved in the use of this money.  It should go to the Exchequer and a certain amount of it should be allocated to the Department of Education for counselling, rehabilitation and education programmes.  Some of it should be allocated to the Department of Health for liaison with communities.  I do <Col N="1179" /> not welcome the idea of a special fund. It would be far better to integrate the money into the expenditure of various Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of the Bill has a twin approach.  It seeks to deal with those who undermine society, such as drug barons, as we euphemistically call them, and money launderers, who live off the misery of others.  I have no doubt that when the Bill is fully and vigorously enforced, this will be the central thrust of what the Minister and the Government want to achieve.  I have some sympathy with the idea proposed by Senator Neville.  Senator Ormonde does not oppose its purpose as distinct from how it will be achieved.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there are two different sides to this.  Those who abuse and undermine society are not addicts, but drug barons and money launderers. Throughout the world such people are undermining societies and economies. We see the consequences of this almost every day in the heinous crimes being committed and we all wonder what is happening to society.  What is happening is that addicts have to feed their addiction and the only way in which they can do that is through the criminal channels which control supply.  I would like to see the rehabilitation element being encouraged. I look on addicts as victims but they are also, unfortunately, potential violent instigators of crime.</P>
      <P>The more that the State can take a hand in reintegrating addicts and giving them the benefit of whatever therapy is available through withdrawal programmes and so on &mdash; I am not an expert in the area &mdash; the better the basis of society.  I would like to see that twin approach being pursued.  It will not be enough to impose what I hope will be very significant penalties on those who have so greatly benefited from this awful trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a major challenge ahead of us to try to help the many families, particularly in deprived areas of our cities, who <Col N="1180" /> have, unfortunately, been caught up in this awful addiction.  For that reason, I hope this effective legislation will be married to actions to try to wean these people away from drugs.  This will not be achieved in a short time but will involve a continuous and very determined programme to try to limit the impact on both families and society at large.</P>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy for what Senator Neville is saying but I see problems, as Senator Ormonde said, with its administration.  From what I know of the Government's intention, I imagine it will continue to promote the programme to rehabilitate addicts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator has already seconded the amendment and could have commented at that stage but I will give him the benefit of the doubt.  However, for future information, when a Senator seconds an amendment he should speak at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the duty of all elected representatives in this and the other House to do all in their power and to offer whatever assistance they see fit to deter this creeping curse which has developed and is on the rampage.  Statistics prove beyond all doubt that much of the crime here is drug related.</P>
      <P>Houses are broken into and ransacked daily and people's privacy is interfered with.  I recently met people whose houses were broken into and their personal belongings thrown around.  They did not want to return to or live in those houses again.  While that crime is just another statistic in our escalating crime figures, the mental torture and incursion on private individuals in their own homes has added another dimension to the crime which has hit society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything which can add to the resources of the State to combat and bring to justice people who are engaged in drug trafficking is to be welcomed.  The onus is on the Minister and the Government to see that the money is spent in a manner which deals with the ongoing <Col N="1181" /> curse that has brought so much damage, crime and suffering to people across all strands of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the intent behind this amendment.  However, when dealing with a Bill such as this, the issue is not one of partisan politics but which system works most efficiently.  This amendment involves the establishment of another committee and approaches the drug problem as if it is a singular issue which stands alone, unaffected by other aspects of society.  As we know that is not the case.  There is a clear link between social deprivation, unemployment, bad housing, hopelessness, sickness and mental health.  In other words, it affects every Department.  At present money raised in this fashion presumably goes to the Exchequer and is allocated in accordance with the demand from each Department.</P>
      <P>I noted the Minister's response to Opposition questions in the Dáil yesterday. She made the point that any resources required to deal with law breaking, terrorism and so on will be made available to her by the Exchequer. That is the way Government should work.  On the basis that drug abuse and associated crime is a multi-faceted problem, it is simply not practical to start a separate account.  The same thing could be suggested for joyriding for instance.  I would oppose the amendment for those reasons.</P>
      <P>At this time it behoves us not to use extravagant language.  In these difficult times, the Minister can be assured that she has the support of the Members of both Houses in the tasks and responsibilities she carries out so well and efficiently.  I oppose the amendment on the basis that it is not the most efficient way of using the money taken from the people targeted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>We had a lengthy discussion about these amendments on Committee Stage.  When this suggestion was made during Committee Stage in the other House, I was quite attracted by it and like Senator Ormonde, Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Magner believed it had much merit.</P>
      <P>I specifically raised with the Minister for Finance the question of applying the proceeds of confiscation orders directly for drug related projects.  He informed me that he would be opposed to any such proposal.  His view was not that he believed it lacked merit; it was similar to that of the three Government Senators. He said that, as a matter of general policy, he could not support any proposal to create a fund or other mechanism where money which accrues to the State could be expended in a way other than through the Estimates which are approved by Dáil Éireann every year.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that it could create difficulties from the point of view of accountability and that questions would be raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General about a departure from the Estimates' procedure.  While I sympathise with the points put forward, the reality is that, in the light of the comments and views expressed by the Minister for Finance, I cannot accept them.</P>

    <P>Part of amendment No. 10 raises a separate issue in relation to a court directing that money paid under a confiscation order be paid into court in connection with legal proceedings which a victim may have initiated and the use of such moneys to satisfy such judgment or order as the victim may obtain.  That is an issue I dealt with in some detail on Committee Stage.  Having considered the matter again, as I promised Senator Neville I would do, I am still firmly of the view that it is already covered in so far as it <Col N="1183" /> would be practicable to do so under the existing provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, a court on conviction of any person of an offence may make an order requiring that person to pay compensation to any person who has suffered such injury or loss as a result of the offence.  One of the particular purposes of making such a provision in the 1993 Act was to remove the need for victims to have to take civil proceedings in order to secure compensation from an offender.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 (3) (b) of this Bill, it is provided that before a court makes a confiscation order, it has to take into account any order, including a court order, involving any payment by the defendant.  This means that in assessing the amount of realisable property of a defendant, a deduction would be made in respect of a compensation order payable to a victim which had been made under the 1993 Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to pending civil actions for compensation, section 10 (1) of the Bill provides that when considering whether to make a confiscation order, the court may take into account any information which is placed before it showing that a victim of an offence, to which the proceedings relate, has initiated or intends to institute civil proceedings against the defendant in respect of loss, injury or damages sustained in connection with the offence.  That provision will ensure that the interests of parties who initiate civil proceedings against offenders are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>In his amendment, Senator Neville proposes that we should allow the proceeds of confiscation orders to be available for the satisfaction of civil judgments obtained at any stage by victims.  This would, in effect, mean that the confiscation proceeds could be tied up indefinitely because of the possibility that a claim might be made in relation to a civil action taken against the offender.  In my view, this would not be a realistic course to follow and I could not accept it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> Section 10 of the present Bill already provides substantial protection from the effects of a confiscation order for compensation payments which may be due to victims of crime, whether they arise under compensation orders under the 1993 Act or from civil proceedings initiated by the victim.  I consider that the provisions made in this Bill and in this particular area of the Bill go as far as is practicable.  For all those reasons, I regret I am unable to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendments. While the Opposition spokespersons agree on the sentiments and approach we wish to take, from previous experience I doubt that the Minister and the Minister for Health will have the success they may wish to achieve in allocating funds to the areas we suggest.  It is important to have proper counselling, rehabilitation and education on drugs, drug trafficking and the need to avoid being involved in drugs.  There should be drug centres throughout the country but the money is not available to establish those treatment centres.  The proper compensation of victims would be a way to deal with this.</P>
      <P>Despite the goodwill of the Ministers for Justice and Health, the Department of Finance will allocate the money to where the biggest pressures exist.  It is unlikely that the money will find its way back to the places we suggest.  The bureaucracy surrounding this area can be overcome.  Under this Bill the money will be there to overcome that bureaucracy and to pay for whatever number of people are required to administer such an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last day we debated this Bill I gave the example of the roads.  One of the greatest contributors to the Exchequer, after VAT and income tax, is road tax, vehicle registration and petrol tax, yet that money is not finding its way back to the people who pay it, the motorists.  This is not the place to debate this issue as we have debated it already.  However, I just wanted to make a comparison between money paid by motorists and the condition <Col N="1185" /> of roads.  One would expect that adequate moneys, paid by the motorist in taxation, would find its way back to ensure that we have proper county roads.</P>
    <P>The same thing is going to happen in this case.  The goodwill is there that money confiscated from the proceeds of drug trafficking should make its way back into counselling, rehabilitating and assisting victims and their families.  However, that is not going to happen unless we, the <Col N="1186" /> legislators, enshrine it in legislation.  This is why we moved the amendment.  It is not that the Minister does not wish to do this, but when the proposal goes back to Finance the pressures will come on and the area we are discussing will be way down the line.  When the time comes the money will go into the Exchequer for general distribution.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to supplement and strengthen the confiscation provisions of the Bill in so far as they apply to drug trafficking.  The main amendments are amendments Nos. 3 and 4 and the other amendments deal with various matters which follow on from those. Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 comprise two new sections which will be included in the Bill in relation to the making of confiscation orders against persons convicted of drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these proposed sections, section 7, provides a procedure whereby the DPP can request a court, which has previously determined that a person who was convicted of drug trafficking but who has not benefited from trafficking, to reassess that determination where the DPP provides new evidence which was not considered by the court when it made its original determination.  If the court is satisfied on the basis of the new evidence submitted by the DPP that the defendant did benefit from drug trafficking, it will be required to assess that benefit and to make a confiscation order for the appropriate amount.  It should be noted that payments received by the defendant after <Col N="1188" /> the date on which the court originally concluded that he or she had received no drugs benefit can be taken into account by the court under the section, but the DPP will not be entitled to rely on the assumptions provided for in section 5 in relation to such payments.</P>
    <P>The second of the new sections is provided for in amendment No. 4.  It enables the DPP to apply to a court, which has made a confiscation order against a person convicted of drug trafficking on the basis that that person received a certain amount of benefit from trafficking, to revise the confiscation order by reference to additional information provided by the DPP, which satisfies the court that the person's benefit from drug trafficking was under-estimated when the confiscation order was made.  As in the case of proposed section 7, the court will be entitled to have regard to payments received by the defendant since the earlier determination of his or her proceeds was made, but the section 5 assumptions will not apply in that regard.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, official amendments Nos. 2, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 12 are consequential on amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  They are concerned with changes which are required in the light of the insertion of proposed new sections 7 and 8 in the Bill.  Senator Neville has proposed amendments to official amendments Nos. 3 and 4 to extend from six to ten years a period within which it would be open to the DPP to ask a court under proposed section 7 to reassess an earlier decision not to make a confiscation order or to increase the amount of an existing confiscation order under proposed section 8.  I appreciate the thinking behind these amendments and I share Senator Neville's concern that persons who engage in drug trafficking should be deprived of the profits of their deadly business.  If I had my way, there would be no time limit on the operation of proposed new sections 7 and 8.  However, I have been advised that it is necessary to do this in the context of any constitutional challenge which might be made against the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> The net question which must be determined is what limitation period should be provided in relation to proposed new sections 7 and 8.  In that regard, I should mention that the period of six years, which I have proposed, was decided on after extensive consultation and with particular reference to the possibility that the constitutionality of those provisions might be an issue after the Bill for example, in relation to the period for which it will be presumed that all income was the proceeds of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>I have consulted the Attorney General on the amendments put forward by Senator Neville.  He has informed me that in terms of protecting proposed sections 7 and 8 from being held to be repugnant to the Constitution, it would be prudent not to go beyond six years in allowing the DPP to make an application under those provisions.  In the light of the advice I received from the Attorney General in this matter, I regret I cannot accept the amendments proposed by Senator Neville.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendments because they will strengthen the confiscation provisions of the Bill in relation to drug trafficking.  The related amendments facilitate the DPP to reopen a case where further evidence suggests that proceeds were not identified by previous calculations of the amount accrued or where moneys came into the ownership of the convicted person after the determination of the amount which should have been confiscated.  Everything possible must be done to stop the drug barons benefiting from their illegal gains.  Such people are experienced in concealing moneys obtained through illegal trafficking and money laundering. It is important that the court has powers to reassess the benefits of drug dealing when new evidence is produced.  I welcome the Bill.  I tabled these amendments to further strengthen the Bill by giving more time to the authorities, the Department and the DPP to deprive drug traffickers <Col N="1190" /> of the money from their illegal dealings.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's comments about six or ten years.  As the Minister said, and I agree with her, everyone would like the State to have the power to confiscate moneys which come into the possession of drug traffickers. Not only would this deprive them of their ill-gotten gains, but it would also be a deterrent to drug trafficking.  The more effectively this is applied, the less attractive it will be for people to become involved in this area.</P>
      <P>The period should be extended to ten years.  I will not discuss the difficulties which the DPP has experienced in relation to the Constitution and the constitutionality of other Bills.  Ten years is an appropriate time and it strengthens the Bill.  It would not be unconstitutional to go beyond six years.  We could choose any number of years, but I believe ten years is reasonable to prevent people from benefiting from their illegal gains. One is likely to obtain more information and a higher level of assets will be confiscated in the early, rather than the later, years after a conviction.  Drug traffickers can hide or launder money and if they are sentenced to ten or 15 years, they may wait until the end of their sentencing period to repossess their money.  We should have a maximum amount of time to confiscate these gains and ten years is a reasonable period.  Originally, no time was allowed, but we would now like an indefinite time limit.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister. I listened to her report and I am satisfied she has studied this matter in great depth and that she is aware of the loopholes.  She has consulted with the Attorney General about the six year period and she knows it is an acceptable time limit.  I accept that she knows what is involved.  I am also happy there is a reassessment procedure in relation to payments.  I accept the Government amendment and the six year time span.</P>

      <P>The Minister's proposal is new in criminal law.  If such a <Col N="1191" /> proposal was made in respect of any other type of offence &mdash; I doubt the Minister would make such a proposal &mdash; we would be concerned that it could breach the bounds of liberty in that there must finality to prosecution, which is normally determined by conviction.  Once conviction is registered, it is the end of the process.  Given the Minister's approach here, I understand that remains her position. I support &mdash; as I am sure all sides of the House do &mdash; this exceptional position, which is, one might say, a breach with established procedures in criminal law.</P>
      <P>If after a conviction, evidence becomes available to the DPP through the Garda Síochána or otherwise and it emerges that the level of criminal benefit to the drug trafficker, drug baron or money launderer is more than was presented to the court at the time of the original order, then it is right that the court, on application, should be able to make a fresh determination as to whether the defendant benefited from drug trafficking &mdash; that is important because it may have concluded originally that he or she did not &mdash; and under section 4 to determine the amount to be recovered from him or her in the light of the new evidence.</P>
      <P>Because this is targeted to deal with this virulent form of contagion in our society, namely, drug trafficking or elicit trading in drugs, I enthusiastically support this proposal.  Having said that, I know I will not be called on to support such proposals where one determines that a conviction or otherwise is not the end of the story because that is the case in normal law.  The Minister was right to point this out in regard to Senator Neville's proposal which stated that there should be a ten year period within which to review by way of an additional confiscation order or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given Senator Neville's reaction, he accepts there is a risk - even in offences of this kind &mdash; that those involved in this illicit trafficking could say, there must be some degree of finality.  I am not aware of a situation where ten years is included as a reasonable limit for any type criminal <Col N="1192" /> proceedings.  The Minister rightly pointed out that, on the advice of the Attorney General, ten years would stretch it too far.  It would not be the job of the court to say the Minister should have said three or six years if it was struck down.  If this happened, it would all be struck down and we would have no provision to deal with offences of this kind. I support the Minister's reasons for not accepting Senator Neville's otherwise worthy idea.</P>

    <P>(9)  In considering any evidence under this section which relates to any payment or reward to which subsection (8) of this section applies, the court shall not make the assumptions which would otherwise be required by section 5 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(10)  If, as a result of making the fresh determination required by subsection (4) of this section, the amount to be recovered exceeds the amount set by the current determination, the court may substitute for the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order which was made by reference to the current determination such greater amount as it thinks just in all circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable the defendant or the DPP to apply to the High Court to vary a confiscation order made against an absconder by virtue of section 11 (4) where the absconder has returned and the court is satisfied that the amount of his or her benefit was overestimated when the confiscation order was made or that his or her assets are not sufficient to satisfy the order.  A similar provision for the variation of confiscation orders is already included in the Bill in section 13 in relation to confiscation orders where an absconder is not involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the other House, amendments were made to the Bill to tighten up on the position in relation to those who abscond and in the context of reviewing the overall <Col N="1199" /> effect of these changes, I believe a separate provision along these lines in relation to the cases of those who abscond is warranted.  In this context, provision is also being made for the payment of compensation where the High Court varies a confiscation order made by virtue of section 11 (4).  Compensation will be payable to a person who suffered loss as a result of the making of the order.</P>
    <P>The amendment in the name of Senator Neville proposes to amend my amendment to provide that the period within which it would be open to the defendant or the DPP to seek a variation in the amount of a confiscation order made by virtue of section 11 (4) should be increased from six to ten years from the date of the making of the confiscation order.  I considered this additional amendment and I cannot accept it.</P>
    <P>The main difficulty I have with that amendment relates to the fact that what is at issue here is the reduction in the amount an absconder could be required to pay in respect of a confiscation order. In that context, it must be borne in mind that the effect of my amendment would be to enable the High Court to reduce, but not to increase, the financial liability of a person who has attempted to frustrate the interest of justice by absconding before their trial is completed.  The question of increasing the amount of a confiscation order is a completely separate issue which is dealt with under other provisions of the Bill and in other amendments I have proposed to it.</P>
    <P>For my part, I believe that a period of six years is sufficient to allow a defendant against whom a confiscation order has been made under section 11 (4) to return to this country and to apply in an appropriate case for a variation downwards of the confiscation order.  In the circumstances I regret that I cannot accept the proposed amendment to my amendment.</P>

      <P>I was introducing the amendment to amendment No. 8 on the basis of consistency.  If we were to increase the length of a confiscation order, it would be consistent that a confiscation order could also be reduced on the basis of the previous amendments. As the previous amendments fell, it would not be consistent to specify a period of ten years in one area and six in another.  I agree with the Minister in this regard; to be fair there should be a period of time after which a confiscation order could be reviewed downwards.  I was increasing the amount of time to complement the other amendments I proposed. This was not my highest priority; the Minister will appreciate that the other two amendments would be much higher on my list of priorities.  I welcome the Minister's amendments on the basis that they strengthen the Bill with regard to those who abscond, to ensure that the spirit and detail of the Bill apply consistently in this area.</P>

      <P>I welcome these amendments on the basis of what the Minister has outlined to us.  I have only one query and the answer may be in the Bill, although I have not been able to identify it.  What precisely is the definition of an &ldquo;absconder&rdquo; in the circumstances? The term is not in the definition section; perhaps the terms &ldquo;absconder&rdquo; and &ldquo;to abscond&rdquo; are known to the law.  I am anxious to ensure that there is no doubt whatsoever in the purpose and effect of the legislation.  The new section &mdash; and that is effectively what it is &mdash; applies where the High Court has made a confiscation order and the defendant has ceased to be an absconder. I want to be sure that its meaning and purpose will be absolutely clear.</P>

It is referred to in section 11 (4) where it says &ldquo;the High Court may exercise the powers of a court <Col N="1201" /> under this Act to make a confiscation order against the defendant if satisfied that the defendant has absconded&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I also understand from my advisers that &ldquo;absconder&rdquo; is a word that would be known to the courts under other legal proceedings that are already part of our legislation.  As to an exact legal definition of &ldquo;absconder&rdquo;, we do not have one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of these amendments is to make provision for the seizure of cash related to drug trafficking which is being imported into or exported from the State.  As Senators will be aware, large amounts of cash are generated by drug trafficking and supplies of illegal drugs are frequently purchased in cash.  As a result, consignments of money which are derived from or intended for use in trafficking are moved across international borders and with the removal of exchange controls in this country, our authorities are not in a position to seize those consignments where they are detected.  I believe that this is a situation that needs to be addressed, and that is what is proposed in the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments comprise eight sections, proposed new sections 34 to 41 which will form a new Part VI of the Bill. Proposed new section 34 provides for the detention and seizure by a garda or customs officer of cash which is being imported into or exported from the State <Col N="1206" /> provided the amount is not less than a certain amount to be prescribed under proposed section 40, and the garda or customs officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is derived from or intended for use in drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>An order from the District Court will be required to enable the cash to be detained beyond 48 hours.  An order for continued detention of the cash may be made by that court for a period of up to three months and further such orders may be made for a total period of two years.  A person from whom the cash was seized will be entitled to apply for its release to a District Judge.  The cash will not be released if its forfeiture is being sought under section 35 or proceedings are being taken against a person for an offence connected with the cash.</P>
    <P>Proposed new section 35 allows a Circuit Court Judge to order the forfeiture of cash held under section 34 if satisfied on an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions while the cash is still detained that it represents drug trafficking proceeds or was intended for use in trafficking.  The civil standard of proof will apply in respect of an application under this section.</P>
    <P>Proposed section 36 provides for appeals to the High Court against forfeiture orders made under section 35. The civil standard of proof will also apply in respect of these appeals.  Proposed section 37 requires cash detained for more than 48 hours to be placed in an interest bearing account, and the interest will be added to the cash upon its forfeiture or release.</P>
    <P>Proposed section 38 provides for the giving of notice of orders made by a District Judge authorising the continuing detention of cash under section 34 (2) and for procedural matters.  Proposed section 39 contains definitions for the purposes of the new Part VI.  Proposed section 40 sets out a procedure for prescribing the amount of cash in relation to which the power of seizure under section 34 will apply.  Proposed section 41 provides in standard form for the disposal of money for forfeited under section 35.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> As I have indicated, there is a need to ensure that appropriate action can be taken to deal with the importation or exportation of cash which is connected with drug trafficking.  I believe that the measures which are provided for in these amendments can play a very important part in enabling the garda and the customs officer to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this aspect of the Bill.  The whole area of money laundering has been discussed at length here over the years, as have the difficulties that arise as a result of the opening of the borders in Europe and the likelihood that drug trafficking would become more prevalent throughout the European Union.  We expressed our concern here prior to the opening of the borders that Ireland might become the drug trafficking centre.  Having seen what happened off the coast of Cork, one would begin to worry about that situation developing.</P>
      <P>The drug traffickers target the countries with the most liberal laws on money laundering, drug trafficking and the transportation of money.  Anything we can do to close those loopholes and make it more difficult for the drug trafficker to move cash and drugs will make Ireland less attractive to the drug traffickers as a base for their work throughout Europe and beyond.</P>
      <P>I note that the money, if confiscated, will be disposed of to the Minister for Finance.  We discussed that point earlier and I will not go into it again except to say that the Minister for Finance is doing quite well out of this Bill.  We had hoped the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health would do better.  Anything that closes the door on drug traffickers using this country as a base is to be welcomed. Since these provisions will do that and will make it less attractive to use this country as a medium to purchase drugs or to launder money, they are to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of that, Sir and I wish to address that point. On Committee Stage we dealt with powers of this nature and I expressed support for new concepts, such as a civil standard of proof for the first time in criminal prosecutions because of the particularly unacceptable nature of drug trafficking and money laundering.  I have no reservation in reiterating my support for such provisions and, based on what the Minister has said, I have no reservation in supporting the general purpose of what is intended in this legislation.</P>
      <P>However, I have to express reservations with the manner &mdash; not on the part of the Minister &mdash; in which these amendments are being proposed to the House.  We are entitled to better from the parliamentary draftsman, or whoever advises on amendments, than this corpus of amendments.  There are seven sections here which introduce significant and appropriate amendments to our law but we are expected to adopt these seven sections holus-bolus in one corpus on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>We are all conscious that we have a role as legislators.  However, when we are discussing a major group of amendments I would like to be assured by the Minister that they do not fundamentally change the legislation.  It is important that nothing we adopt on Report Stage will radically change what has already been adopted on Second and Committee Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my period as Minister I had experience of occasions when civil servants would propose this or that quick change.  We all have our separate functions; Government has its function but we, as legislators, have another.  One of our obligations is to consider in detail the elements of any legislative proposals and, particularly, any amendments.  We have here a major bloc of amendments.  I have no problem in principle with the forfeiture under the Circuit Court, the civil <Col N="1209" /> standard of proof or the provisions in relation to interest payments on illicit trafficking of drugs nor do I have a problem with regard to the control on the importation or exportation of money which is being laundered for illicit drug trafficking.  However, I am anxious to know&mdash;I hope the Minister will be able to inform me &mdash; where these amendments fit into what we have agreed on other Stages.  I admit that I did not have the opportunity of taking it all on board. Where do all the provisions on international co-operation, etc. fit in?  Will what we are discussing now change in one fell swoop what we agreed on Committee Stage, albeit with our then current state of knowledge which may have been incomplete or imperfect?  I know that from time to time amendments have to be introduced for urgent reasons, but I would caution the parliamentary draftsman that this should be done on a limited basis.  Otherwise our function is not being properly recognised.</P>

      <P>As Senators will recall, these amendments were proposed on Committee Stage in the Seanad. As they were introduced at a late stage on Committee Stage, I was anxious to give an opportunity to Senators, particularly to Senator Neville and to the other Opposition spokespersons, to have their advisers look at them and make sure they <Col N="1210" /> were happy with the proposed amendments.</P>
      <P>They come about directly as a result of a visit I made early last year to the southwest coast in relation to complaints that were made publicly by a number of individuals of high standing in the area which related specifically to a lack of co-operation and a lack of strong laws to deal with what was perceived as drug trafficking in our waters.</P>
      <P>As a result I asked an assistant secretary in my Department to carry out a report on the approach we take to drug abuse and the way in which we enforce the laws in relation to drug trafficking. That report &mdash; known as the O'Donnell report &mdash; only came to my attention just before the final stages of Committee Stage.  Some of the recommendations in it included what is now amendments Nos. 13 to 20.  It is from there that they arose.</P>
      <P>Rather than wait for the report to be published and for me to go to Government with a report on the report and recommendations, I am taking the opportunity presented in this legislation to incorporate several of the recommendations in that report.  Otherwise recommendations would have to be made to Government and would have to be agreed, and we would have to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas again&mdash; and several months might have elapsed at that stage &mdash; to incorporate these provisions into separate legislation.</P>
      <P>They do not interfere with the provisions of the Bill as we have discussed them.  They are an addition and a strengthening, as Senator Neville said, of the Bill's existing provisions.  The Garda seizes the money and the courts decide what to do with it.</P>

    <P>I thank Senator Neville, who has been present at all Stages of the debate, and the Opposition spokespersons who were present on Committee Stage.  I also thank Senator Ormonde, Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Magner for their support and co-operation.  This legislation is complex and technical and all sides of the House wanted to support the toughest possible measures to deal with what all agree is the top priority in my Department.  I will be happy to get the Dáil to accept these <Col N="1215" /> amendments, which have been proposed and accepted in this House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the passing of this Bill through the House.  It is important legislation which covers areas that have been discussed over many years&mdash; since 1989 at least &mdash; in this House, by way of Private Members' motions, during the course of other legislation going through the House or at various other times.  Hopefully, the Bill will become law as soon as the amendments pass through the other House.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Senator O'Kennedy's point regarding the delay in issuing the amendments.  Difficulties did arise with them.  We did not have an opportunity to look at them on the last day.  I thank the Minister for giving us the opportunity to do so.  We consulted with our opposite numbers in the other House.  We looked at these amendments and felt they covered areas raised and discussed in the other House.  We cannot deal with amendments if we get them only five to ten minutes before we discuss them.  The Minister understood our predicament and I thank her for her co-operation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and hope it will have the desired effect.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister for bringing this legislation through the House at a time when she has other major responsibilities to attend to.  I was in Government for some time but I did not volunteer for that Department; I never would have.  It is a Department where the Minister is constantly on the stage and not always with an enthusiastic or appreciative audience.  That the Minister, in the midst of her other pressing functions, would devote time to steer this Bill through the House is a measure of her commitment, which we all greatly appreciate.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has satisfactorily clarified my reservation in principle to taking so many amendments together on Report Stage.  I might have uttered my reservations to you, Sir, rather than the Minister, had I been aware that you were the one who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope the next time anyone furnishes a report to the Minister, it will arrive before we start a debate and not when we are halfway through; that would enable us to do a better job in examining such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure will go a long way towards dealing with those who have almost undermined the base of our society.  However, there is another job to be done.  We cannot leave this in the hands of the criminals who want to keep it outside the law.  The more I see the State becoming involved in trying to rehabilitate drug addicts and ensure <Col N="1217" /> criminals will not benefit from being in control of this illegal empire, the more convinced I am that the purpose of this legislation will be fully realised.</P>

      <P>It is right and proper that any legislation which impinges on people's rights and liberties should be subject to the most minute scrutiny.  I want to pay tribute to Senator Neville for the way he, with the Minister, has nurtured this Bill from its inception.  As I said in an earlier contribution these are not partisan and political statements; we might differ on methodology as to how best to do the job, but the objectives are the same.</P>
      <P>The House is fortunate to have somebody of the calibre of the Minister who is capable of implementing the measures contained in the Bill and wise enough to know and accept that a rapport with the public is required in dealing with crime. Such rapport is achieved by demonstrating that, as the House is aware, the job is in hand and matters are under control.</P>
      <P>This legislation will be of immense assistance to the Minister in ensuring that crime in Ireland does not pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the potential of the new Science, Technology and Innovation Council set up by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, but urges him to:</P>
      <P>(1)  ensure that environmental, educational, medical and agricultural aspects, as well as industrial, are considered by the council;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  immediately initiate taxation relief to encourage research and development in both indigenous <Col N="1218" /> companies and divisions of international companies here;</P>
    <P>(3)  ensure that any project in the Leader Schemes or the County Enterprise Boards have technological and scientific advice made easily available;</P>
    <P>(4)  encourage basic as well as applied research in our third level institutions; and</P>
    <P>(5)  introduce pilot schemes in introductory science at primary school level.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and am delighted to see my friends from Fianna Fáil who are interested in science here to support me.  The establishment of the Science, Technology and Innovation Council is welcome and it has great potential.  I have the privilege of knowing the chairman and several members of the council.  A more distinguished and hard working group could not have been assembled.  However, since the establishment of the council I have a distinct impression that the Government feels it has dealt with all scientific and technological matters and that we can sit back and rest until the council reports.  Also, any pronouncements by the Minister seem focused on the use that science will be to industry, which is a most narrow view.  Industrial application of science on its own is unsustainable.  I tabled this motion because the April issue of the scientific journal <i>Nature,</i> which many Members may not read, states:</P>
    <P>The prospects for science in the Republic of Ireland took a turn for the better last week when the government announced that it is planning to resume funding for a strategic research programme which it abandoned last year. This year, the government will make available £1 million (US$1.42 million) for research grants in eight technological areas, including biotechnology, advanced manufacturing techology and advanced materials.  In addition, it is making available £850,000 in basic research grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> Scientists have cautiously welcomed the move as a possible signal of a change in attitude towards science, whose fortunes sank to an all-time low last year when the government made available only £150,000 in non-medical grant money.  Ireland has one of the lowest investments in research in Europe, and no real science policy. But a year-long campaign by university scientists has made funding a hot political issue.  (See <i>Nature</i> 367, 586, 1994)</P>
    <P>The Senators who know it is a hot political issue at the moment are here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotation continues:</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds, admitted last week that the government had been slow to recognise the importance of science and technology.  But he said that this &ldquo;relative neglect&rdquo; is now coming to an end.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation international report on the funding of science and research and development seems much nearer the truth.  The findings of the World Science Report for 1993 showed Ireland lagging far behind the rest of Europe in investment and research and development and that almost no Government resources are being provided for basic research.  I have tried to find out where the £850,000 in basic research grants has gone but have been unable to do so.</P>
      <P>The most successful economies in the developed world are those which spend the most on research and development. Ireland spends less than 1 per cent of its gross domestic product on this area.  This includes both Government funding and money spent by industry on its own research and development.  We have 6.6 people per thousand in the labour force working in research and development and Germany has 14.2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> It is not just the council but also the rest of us who must get moving.  Unless firms are encouraged to release more workers into the field of research and technology, it will be impossible for us ever to improve our industrial position. One never stands still, regression will supersede progress.  I could add the tremendous scientific phrase that nature abhors a vacuum and we will end up with nothing.</P>
    <P>Legislation introduced last year, which I welcome, permits the regional technical colleges to become involved in research. This could open up an ideal partnership between local Leader projects and county enterprise partnership boards. Has any thought been put into this?  It is always much easier for small projects to become involved in something local rather than having the expense of being involved in something distant.  The Leader projects and county enterprise initiatives cannot wait for the council to report because they have already started. Sometimes small projects, especially in the food industry, run into difficulties, whereas a little technological help would solve their problems easily.  I heard a report from one woman, who now has a very successful mayonnaise factory in production, about the help her husband, who was a medical laboratory technologist, was able to give her, but not everyone who enters the food industry is married to someone with a knowledge of bacteriology.  It would be a great help if small enterprises had facilities near them. Not everyone has Moorepark Research and Development Division at their doors.  The new Food Safety Advisory Board will monitor these enterprises when they get going but who will help them to become established in the first place?</P>
    <P>Access to new knowledge and the ability to apply it confers major strategic benefits on any nation.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, spoke last year at the Conference of European University Rectors and said that universities do not have a neutral role in society but need to be among the principal generators of ideas and promoters <Col N="1221" /> of debate.  That is a very important statement and applies to science and technology. The brief of the council seems to be very much leaning towards regarding the university science departments as existing solely to be consulted by industry and as having a minor innovative role.  If we want them to act as a science park to which industry can apply for help and not to have any innovative ideas, we should say so.</P>
    <P>While the immediate needs of industry are and must be met, this cannot be at the expense of involvement in leading edge research in science.  If we are not involved in basic research, we will be unable to keep up with developments in these areas from the United States, Scandinavia etc. and will not even understand what they are doing.  There is a synergestic relationship between basic and applied research, especially in biotechnology, which we ignore at our peril.</P>
    <P>Many campus companies earn money for universities and many university departments do contract work for various industries but they are developing ideas and products which are already recognised as valuable to industry.  What about all those developments which occur fortuitously and of which we do not recognise the potential at the moment but will do so at a later stage.  For example, in the Physics Department of Trinity College, Professor McBrierty has a section which deals with polymers in physics &mdash; plastics to you and me.  This section did basic research on the action of light on polymers. It made a major breakthrough in dealing with plastic for contact lenses.</P>
    <P>Sunray lamps were used in the past to change the plastic for contact lenses and this was extremely inefficient.  However, Professor McBrierty's section were doing work on the use of lasers in plastics and found that these were much more controllable and efficient.  Naturally, Bausch and Lomb in Waterford heard about this idea, made contact &mdash; a bad pun &mdash; and now 1,200 are employed in the factory in Waterford as opposed to 400 previously. If those developments had happened in Maryland or Ohio, the improvement in employment which occurred in Waterford <Col N="1222" /> would almost certainly have occurred in one of their American branches. We have gained spectacularly from something which happened in very basic plastics research in this country.</P>
    <P>During the Minister's speech at the council's first meeting he made a statement, which I found very depressing:</P>
    <P>There is one natural constraint which you many come up against and one man-made one which you cannot ignore.  The former is the threshold of human imagination and the latter is the inability to endlessly fund what might turn out to be impossible dreams.</P>
    <P>I have great difficulty with that approach. There is no known threshold to the human imagination and if we do not have impossible dreams we might as well give up right now.  We are shackled by our own inferiority complexes.  We must employ those of our graduates who always had to emigrate in the past in order to become involved in research.  No one will give us back their valuable ideas.</P>
    <P>I will end by reminding Senators of Captain Boyle, who asked Joxer &ldquo;What is the stars?&rdquo;.  The stars are probably much nearer to us than we realise and we must reach for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the opportunity to second this motion as it is important that we deal with those issues. To continue the Boyle connection, it would be appropriate to mention Sir Robert Boyle, a famous Corkman, who made a huge contribution to the development of science many centuries ago and left us Boyle's Law.  I will not attempt to quote Boyle's Law as I am not sure whether it is the temperature or pressure that is constant.  I could eventually work it out if I had enough time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I like as many variables as possible.  Innovation and development are crucial to the competitiveness of our economy.  The latest figures which I saw for investment in <Col N="1223" /> research and development in the European Union frightened me.  These figures are about two years out of date and could have been somewhat improved on since then.  However, at that time we had the worst record in Europe in terms of the amount of money which industry was ploughing into research and development. The next worst was Belgium but, to put that in context, we were twice as bad as Belgium.  That puts us in a very weak position.</P>
      <P>I want to relate that to primary level education.  Science was on the curriculum at primary level in this country 80 years ago but is no longer there.  We have asked for it to be put on the curriculum.  There are moves afoot to have that done and it should be done very quickly.  I hope that I make a valid case for so doing here.</P>
      <P>In the awards ceremony at Dublin City University last year, the president, Dr. Daniel O'Hare, made the point that he hoped that graduates leaving his college would be able to &ldquo;turn on the innovation tap&rdquo; into further research and development. I liked his optimism but, as I told him, I completely disagreed with the basic theory of what he was saying.  I have made the case often enough in this House that what makes a researcher great is the fusing of creativity, imagination and artistry.  Such qualities are not quite indefinable but they are certainly not quantifiable.</P>
      <P>Somebody who has attained great academic success at primary, post primary, third and post graduate level and finally achieves a doctorate in, for example, the fluidity of liquids will have developed confidence, certainty, information and all that is required in that particular area.  However, they may never have learned throughout the whole system how to move beyond that point and push back the boundaries of knowledge in that area.  Too often the experts of today become the academic hermits of tomorrow because they are not able to cope and move with the changes taking place in society around them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People such as Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin tried things and had <Col N="1224" /> ideas which they followed through.  A child of four, five or six years of age must learn that he or she can stand up and suggest something to a group of colleagues, lead them in something, put forward an idea on what needs to be done, develop some creative instincts in art, PE or drama, become articulate and a motivator or learn on the sports field to take calculated risks, make a judgment and move forward.  It is those qualities combined with academic success which lead to movement and the development of new ideas and invention.</P>
    <P>Nobody can develop or create an inventor.  The school system cannot make people more imaginative than they innately are.  However, it can either kill or grow and develop imagination.  If children of seven or eight years can connect two pieces of wire to two ends of a battery and light a light bulb or work out how long it takes heat to move down a metal or wooden bar, they can learn about science at a very basic level and develop an interest in it.  At the same time they can develop creativity and innovation in other areas, knowing that they are being encouraged.  If the child with an innovative idea is ridiculed, given no attention or not allowed to develop at an early age then, as I said to Dr O'Hare, the innovation tap will never be turned on for a 22 year old graduate who never experienced success in that area at a younger age.  That is the only significant point which I wish to make in that general area.</P>
    <P>Whenever I am discussing that area I always ask people how many 22 year olds they know who would fill a blank sheet of paper with art and stand up and show it to 50 colleagues of the same age.  There are very few adults who will do that. However, if they do it as four, six and ten year olds or take various risks and learn confidence in those areas, then those talents will emerge and develop.  It is not possible to suppress them for 20 years and then expect innovation to flow. It will never happen that way.</P>
    <P>We have an extraordinary opportunity at this stage in terms of our development. Last night, I listened to a Conservative <Col N="1225" /> Party broadcast on BBC &mdash; I listened to the Labour Party one at 1 p.m. today in this country as I am pretty catholic about these things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Tory voice announced all the improvements in terms of interest rates, inflation rates and so on and said &mdash; which I brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance of this State today &mdash; that they in Britain have the fastest growing economy in Europe, which is of course untrue because this State has the fastest growing economy in Europe.  Knowing that the Minister for Finance is chairing a major session of the OECD next week, I asked him if he would include a little correction in his speech for the benefit of our neighbours across the water.</P>
      <P>There is now an opportunity to develop our industry.  It needs innovation and skill.  My plea is to look at those talents in very young people.  Many of them gain success in leadership, articulation, communication, motivation, creation and imagination.  Merging this with development in the area of science will lead to scientific progress in the area of research and development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seldom at a loss for words and it is even more seldom that I admit it.  Much of what I wanted to say has been said.  I commend the Senators who proposed this motion.  It is an important motion and one on which we should have a longer debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a sentence in Senator Henry's excellent contribution which I have said and thought myself on many occasions.  We really are shackled by an inferiority complex.  There is an extraordinary amount of ingenuity, inventiveness, creativity and vigour in this nation.  All we need to do is shake off that shackle and it will be released.  For some strange reason &mdash; perhaps it is the <Col N="1226" /> post colonial experience &mdash; we are consistently fearful of doing that.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry also illustrated by reference to a specific event &mdash; the Bausch &amp; Lomb case &mdash; the importance of the issues we are discussing.  There are several other cases to which she could have referred.  The growth and development of the economy of southern California has been entirely science based.</P>
    <P>The cutting edge of industry, where one finds the important and long term jobs, is always closest to the innovation centre.  That is the reality and the reason why everybody should have a real and vigorous interest, not just in science and technology in the sense of important research and development for industry, but in basic fundamental research.  It exists but has been underfunded in this country.</P>
    <P>Each of the five elements in the motion deserves specific attention.  The first part urges the Minister &ldquo;to ensure that environmental, educational, medical and agricultural aspects, as well as industrial, are considered by the council&rdquo;.  That is an important proposition because science must be more than science for industry's sake.  If we are not involved at the cutting edge we will be left behind.  Senator Henry is absolutely correct.  In this race one either makes progress or goes backwards. The basic and fundamental research which goes on in universities, and sometimes looks as if it has no relevance to reality, is very important.  If we consider science in the wider sense of creativity, the contribution this small nation has made has been significant.  It is something of which we should be proud and it is worth building on.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion refers to the need to &ldquo;initiate taxation relief to encourage research and development in both indigenous and divisions of international companies here&rdquo;.  This is also valid.  We know from the experience of attracting foreign investment that unless there is a strong research element, we are simply a dispensable element of the <Col N="1227" /> production chain.  The reality is that modern industry grows and develops and then out sources its production.  We have always been positioned somewhere along that leg of the chain rather than being close to the growth and development.  It is important that our taxation policies reflect or encourage creativity.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago in Bray I was taken to task by some members of the local chamber of commerce for pointing out how dangerous it was for the town to depend on the company, Nixdorf.  It was an excellent company, but what happened there illustrates the importance of this point.  The company had no research and development in this country.  It had no roots at all.  The company sourced everything from Germany.  The real irony was that some of the material originated in Bray.  It was exported to Germany and reimported.  Unlike Wang for example, the company did not establish any roots in the community and the economy.  As soon as that company hit a bad patch, it pulled out of the places where its roots were most shallow.  If there is not a research and development element, the commitment of international industries to this country is a shallow rooted tree ready to be tossed over in the first storm.</P>
    <P>The reference to the need for links with the Leader schemes and the county enterprise boards is also valid.  Before Deputy Brennan made it impossible for Oireachtas Members to serve on the board of a regional technical college, I had the pleasure of serving on the board of the Regional Technical College in Carlow.  It gladdened my heart that they continuously related research to the local economy.  Some of the research was very advanced and they were working with minuscule facilities.  The research was innovative and creative.  Projects being developed on the campus one day were married into local industry the next. There is a role for the county development boards.  It will be necessary that the county enterprise boards become conscious <Col N="1228" /> of what is available throughout Ireland, particularly at regional technical college level.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of basic as well as applied research at third level institutions is critically important.  A number of other Senators have addressed this over the last few months.  Basic research is very expensive.  It is also imprudent to think that we can dispense with it.  It is critically important.  It is an area where we are weak and one which we must develop. With the available resources, we are producing young scientists right across the board.  The tragedy is that many of those young scientists are being exported. When this happens we do not only lose their vigour but also their potential.</P>
    <P>The introduction of pilot schemes in introductory science at primary school level was touched on by Senator O'Toole.  It is self evidently a sensible starting point.  He illustrated the point well by holding up a blank sheet of paper and asking how many of us, when we reach adulthood, have the creativity, courage and imagination of a young child.  He was generous in recognising that the school system can either destroy or grow, cultivate or discourage.  This is where the process starts.</P>
    <P>We should use the motion to consider what is being done.  The motion itself is generous and recognises what the Minister is doing.  I want to refer to two specific statements the Minister made.  One is the statement he made at the launch of the Science, Technology and Innovation Council and his commitment to the production of a White Paper on this area.  It is worth reminding ourselves of the terms of reference of the council.  The first is to determine whether current policies, objectives, structures and components of science and technology systems are the right ones for achieving economic development through research, technology and innovation.  That is a very wide introductory term of reference.  It covers many of the points made.  Terms of reference are simply terms of reference <Col N="1229" /> and what is important is how they are interpreted.  In this regard I would endorse the encouragement and exhortations made to the council.</P>
    <P>The second term of reference is to determine what mechanisms should be employed to achieve the desired science and technology pools in the light of the above.  The third is to provide a report on the findings, with recommendations about change.  The Minister did something which I thought was very innovative. When he went to the first meeting of the council, he set out 20 questions. They are worth examining because they go to the core of the issue we are discussing.</P>
    <P>The first point the Minister made was that the total spending on science and technology in this country is about £650 million.  That could be disputed, as it is possible to do all sorts of things with statistics, but I am not going to go down that road.  Taxation is also mentioned in relation to the £650 million.  Senator Henry touched on the impact of the taxation code, and in particular the VAT code, on science research and the funding of research in some of the universities. This area needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to discuss the 20 questions the Minister asked but I commend them to the House.  I also commend the excellent motion because it provides an opportunity in a non-political way to touch on something which is more important to us all than we often recognise.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Fine Gael supports the motion and commends Senator Henry and her colleagues for putting it down.  It serves a useful purpose in that it gives us an opportunity, as Senator Roche said, to discuss various matters in a non-political and fruitful manner.  We hope the council will listen to various opinions, bring forward certain recommendations and explore many areas.  Its scope should not be limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> The motion is broad, as it should be. Points were made about the aspects of the various areas which must be examined. We are living in vastly changing times, particularly with regard to the education system, what are we educating people for and where the workforce can secure jobs in the future.  We should not overlook this point.  Times are changing faster than many of us realise.  It is only when we deal with young pupils, school leavers and graduates that we wonder where they will go.  It can only be beneficial to listen to them.  Those of us with young children who will be coming on the employment market in the not too distant future must be concerned about what we are doing and where we are going.  There should be no limit on the work of the council.  Things have moved on at pace with regard to science and technology and we should not limit ourselves.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State, who has been to the forefront in launching pilot schemes, programmes and experiments, will have something to contribute with regard to various environmental matters that could be explored and future developments in his area of responsibility. We took much for granted in the past but things have changed.  There are many potential developments and a great deal of potential in how certain areas could be protected.  These matters should be examined and we would like the Minister of State to tell us what he and his colleagues have in mind regarding future developments.</P>
    <P>Agriculture and related matters must also be seriously considered.  Ireland is an agricultural base and it affects everyone, even those of us with only a partial involvement in it.  The basis of agricultural research in terms of what we can get from it must be examined.  Agriculture has changed and the potential of agricultural areas must be considered. We have ignored areas outside traditional agriculture in the past and other areas, particularly traditional, may not <Col N="1231" /> be as open in the future.  We must move with the times, consider all aspects and see what changes can be brought about so that we can benefit from them.</P>
    <P>Reliefs should be given to various bodies, individuals and groups if their research is beneficial or provides work. Perhaps companies could receive reliefs in addition to their normal business relief if they plough some of their profits back into further development.  Senator Roche mentioned the difficulties of a large company with a major foothold in a certain area which perhaps was taken for granted or there was no communication between the local area and the company.  When difficulties arose, the plug was pulled and the people in the area suffered.  These issues must be examined.</P>
    <P>I understand there are proposals for the development at an early date of a science and technology park in the Dublin area.  What discussions have taken place with the newly established authorities or the Department in relation to identifying a site?  Those of us on the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have a suitable area in mind and we would be glad to show it to the Minister of State and his officials at some stage.  It is close to a proposed motorway and with good sense and money from the Department, those plans could be near to completion.  However, many questions must be asked and answered.  Could the Minister of State give the up to date position on what progress has been made and what research has been conducted into the possible location of such a park?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support and commend Senator Henry and her colleagues for this motion.  I welcome the appointment of the Science, Technology and Innovation Council.  In doing so, I note that the gender balance is quite good, although it includes marginally more men than women.  I also note that it is made up mainly of people involved in business, technological business in particular, and those involved in research at third level institutions or elsewhere.  It is a well chosen council and has the practical experience and knowledge to deal with questions posed to it.  Senator Roche began to examine the questions that were put at the first meeting but he ran out of time.  I intend to concentrate some of my time on those points.</P>
      <P>It is important that the council is focused.  Some people would argue that insufficient money is thrown in this direction but it is not just a case of providing money to the council and hoping that it will be appropriately and usefully spent. It is most important in this area that the funding and direction of what is done is focused and co-ordinated.</P>
      <P>There is no point reinventing the wheel with different groups here and abroad overlapping their research and discoveries. Such co-ordination of effort must be envisaged not just nationally but internationally.  Question ten, relating to international collaborative programmes, stresses the importance of not repeating R and D work that is being done elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole rightly said that inventive and creative people cannot be <Col N="1233" /> put into a box and turned out the other end.  Nevertheless, as the motion points out, a focus in the education system is needed to encourage that kind of thinking. Education should be about research, about people learning to discover information for themselves, using their imagination and intelligence rather than simply absorbing knowledge to regurgitate it at examinations.  While the focus of our educational thinking may not have been so directed in the past, it certainly will be in future.  It follows that science should be studied at as early an age as possible &mdash; in my view the sooner the better.  Even before primary school, children have an inventive attitude to life and the entire educational system is becoming more geared to that kind of approach.</P>
    <P>The question of taxation is addressed in question 15 which asks: &ldquo;How can the Irish tax system encourage the development of independent R and D facilities or R and D expenditure by firms in Ireland?&rdquo;  That aspect is envisaged in the approach of the council.  Many other questions are both direct and pertinent so that what is being planned will be geared in a positive and useful direction rather than in a general one.</P>
    <P>If I can return to Senator Henry's metaphor of reaching for the stars; there are an awful lot of stars up there and there is no point reaching out hoping to catch a few.  You have to aim for particular stars that might be within your grasp.  The kind of focus that is required will be brought about by having a council that will report and make recommendations, as envisaged in the guidelines, with a view to the publication of a White Paper.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to agriculture. Earlier today I was watching part of the Dáil debate on the An Bord Bia Bill which proposes quite a strong emphasis on research and development.  We have had many discussions in this House on small industry and, in fact, some 90 per cent of our industries would be categorised as small.  It is unlikely, therefore, <Col N="1234" /> that that sector would have the resources to undertake their own R and D, particularly if it was costly.  Support from Eolas, under the Forbairt umbrella, is needed; in other words, help and backup from State research.</P>
    <P>The concept of clustering, where industries of a like nature can be brought together, is also useful.  Some Senators mentioned technology parks.  We, in Limerick, already have the Plassey Technology Park which is close to the university and has been successful in gathering together the necessary backup for industries, particularly high-tech industries.  The managing directors of a number of companies recently starting up in Limerick said that the Plassey Technology Park was a major factor in their decision to locate there.  That indicates the importance of having the right kind of support available in such an area for high-tech industries, a growing number of which carry out their own R and D in this country.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges have a strong role to play in this area, as well as the universities, and some of them are doing contract research specifically for industry.  New campus companies are being developed throughout the country, both in universities and regional technical colleges, by people coming out of the third level system with basic applied research skills.  This is a positive development providing jobs which would not otherwise have been developed.</P>
    <P>The motion also covers environmental protection, an area where there is room for development and improvement.  It is also an area which, up to now, has not been as strongly emphasised here as in other European countries.  The overall importance of this council is to channel an unfocused area of research into what will be a more positively co-ordinated one in future.  The intention is that there will be a White Paper at the end of this and submissions were sought, the closing date for which was the end of April. The public debate on the whole area of <Col N="1235" /> research, of which this debate is a part, will result in more positive and focused development of research in future.  I agree with other Members who have said that this is crucial to the provision of new jobs in the rapidly changing world of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment Senator Henry and her co-sponsors of this timely and important motion.  They should be congratulated on bringing it before the House.  A new advisory committee has just been established by the Minister with a clear mandate to look at this area and come up with proposals in the form of a White Paper which, at this time in the development of our economy, will chart the course of future developments in this key area.  Science and technology are key components of economic development.  Those involved in this area face the challenge of keeping abreast of changes in technology which are taking place at a rapid pace.  They must also retain skilled personnel to harness technological changes to the best advantage for the economy.  Science and technology stimulate the economy through investment in high technology sectors, such as the agri-food business, the marine industry and many others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have preferred if the recent reorganisation of Eolas and the IDA had been delayed pending the report of the review body.  Eolas was established under the relatively recent 1987 Act.  It was a merger of the IIRS and the Board for Science and Technology.  Within a short space of time &mdash; on 1 January this year &mdash; there was another re-organisation.  It is difficult to measure the effect of these re-organisations although repeated reorganisations and changes to establish new structures can disrupt business and be counter productive.  The achievement of policies can be delayed.  However, different Ministers have different views on what administrative practices should be established.  It is important to decide <Col N="1236" /> on the character of those structures and adhere to that decision.  If a review is necessary it should be done prior to re-organisation.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to support what is proposed and I compliment the chairman of the review body, Dan Tierney.  I wish him and the members of the review body every success in their work.  The members of the review body are a combination of professionals and practitioners in the science and technology sphere.  They will produce a full report and I hope we will have the opportunity to discuss it in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The involvement of industry is of paramount importance.  If we are to successfully harness our science and technology budget and manage our human resources there must be a full partnership between those involved in industry and members of colleges and research institutes.  That partnership should receive financial backing and support from the European Union.  There has been sustained criticism of the inadequate level of funding.  I was involved in the drafting of Fianna Fáil policy prior to the establishment of Roinn na Mara and we suggested that a marine research institute be established.  However, despite talk about the necessity for research, and particularly maritime research, we found it almost impossible to secure funding to keep the <i>Lough Beltra</i>, which was the marine research vessel, in operation.  At times the vessel was tied up in harbour because there was inadequate funding to provide it with a full annual programme.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Marine Institute has finally been established and is operating. I hope it enjoys success in its endeavours. It is ten years since the initial policy document proposing a marine research institute for this island nation was first proposed.  It is many years since the Department of the Marine was established. Thankfully, the institute is operational. I note that Professor Maura Mulcahy of the Marine Institute is a <Col N="1237" /> member of the review body.  It was wise of the Minister to include personnel from other institutes on the review body so that the report can offer a good indication of what is being done in areas such as marine research.</P>
    <P>I welcome the more vocal attitude and greater lobbying in this area of the Irish Science Researchers' Association.  I offer my good wishes to that association and I hope they will continue to highlight the needs in this area.  We need people such as these professionals to lobby for further investment and work in this sector.  IBEC has also been paying welcome attention to this area.  One of today's national newspapers reported that IBEC has undertaken interviews of young graduates who it hopes to place in companies in the UK and the EU during the next year.  This is a desirable initiative.</P>
    <P>Eolas runs a successful scheme called Techstart for young science and technology graduates.  More attention and funding should be given to this welcome scheme.  The Minister, while he awaits the review, should look carefully at such initiatives and provide additional funding for them if it is necessary.  It is important to have young graduates placed with companies, particularly small companies which cannot afford to employ these graduates.  The companies involved in the scheme I mentioned have less than 50 employees and would not have the financial resources to employ graduates and professionals in this area.  However, the grant of about £5,000 and additional funds which make this scheme possible is welcome funding.  About 700 young graduates have been placed in companies since the scheme started and 80 per cent of those graduates have been given permanent employment in the same companies following participation in the scheme.  This demonstrates the success of the scheme and the willingness of small industry to get involved.  They are of benefit to the company and to the graduates.</P>
    <P>There is a large demand for the scheme.  Interviews were held by Eolas <Col N="1238" /> and Forbairt for placement of personnel in the scheme.  About 500 graduates in one location were competing for between 20 and 30 jobs.  There have been complaints that many of our graduates are leaving Ireland while there is an adequate number of jobs for them here.  There may be an element of truth in that.  However, 500 young graduates were competing for between 20 and 30 jobs.  That indicates the necessity for more attention to be given to this scheme.  I compliment Eolas on organising that and other schemes in the advanced technology sector.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the work being done in the regional industrial technological park in Limerick.  We may not always praise what happens in Limerick and Clare.  This park, however, has been an outstanding success and we hope to see it expand further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, some of the companies which are established there vanish quickly.  We must maintain close contact with developments in these places, particularly small companies, which for some reason do not last long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work carried out in institutions such as DCU, University of Limerick, Trinity College and the universities in Cork and Galway is very important for our small indigenous industry.  We must develop technology which can be used to develop our natural resources.  In the aquaculture business, for example, the main technology used in fish farming is imported from Sweden, Japan and Norway.  Surely it is within the capabilities of our technological engineers to develop an indigenous industry to exploit our conditions and resources.  There is no comparison between tidal conditions here and Norway &mdash; there is little tidal movement there &mdash; and the use of Norwegian technology designed for Norwegian conditions has led to many of the difficulties in the fish farming business. <Col N="1239" /> There is a challenge here for our institutions such as the University of Limerick, UCC and UCG to look carefully at this area in order to explore the possibilities and produce jobs by developing Irish technology to exploit our natural resources.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Eolas report, which produced a plan for 1994 to 1996.  It estimates it will be necessary to spend three times the money we currently spend in this area; the increase would be from £50 million to £150 million.  Costs are involved in all these sectors.  When I was in the other House I spoke about marine research and the need to develop our natural resources and technology, but we cannot continue to make such speeches unless we are prepared to put our money where our mouths are.</P>
    <P>Let us hope the council is not an exercise to postpone the day when we will have to invest.  We must continue to put money into this key component in our drive for economic development.  I encourage the Minister to continue his work to date but he must be prepared to pay the costs involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  I welcome the establishment of the Science, Technology and Innovation Council and wish it well in its deliberations. It has an important role to play in the development of industry.  The various organisations which wish to have an input into the council's work should be encouraged to do so.  The Science Researchers Association should be allowed to make submissions to this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of this organisation is important for our industrial development. Manufacturing is a fast moving area and matters do not stay still for long because innovations are produced.  We are in a global market and the days when we serviced our protected, indigenous markets are over.  We are now open to Europe and further afield, both as a market for our goods and from manufactures <Col N="1240" /> from abroad.  Protectionist days are over and we must be innovative and stay ahead of our competitors to ensure our level of employment is maintained. It will be difficult to protect job levels because of the need to maintain efficiency.  Fewer people are employed in industry, but one hopes more will be employed in commerce and services. However, for industry to survive it needs innovation, the development of new products, the identification of products required for a given market and the prediction of future requirements.  For these reasons the establishment of the new council is most welcome.</P>
    <P>The motion asks for the council's brief to be extended to cover the environment, which is an area of growing concern for everyone.  People will ask more questions about the impact on the environment of industrial and other commercial development. As Senator O'Sullivan knows, waste disposal is currently a big issue in our area.  We need to be educated as to what is and is not acceptable.  There is much scaremongering about the environment and the reason for that is lack of knowledge.  This organisation should home in on that area, as Senator Henry has proposed, so that it can advise and educate us to ensure we do not throw out the baby with the bath, or whatever the expression is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried that we will reject any industry coming to Ireland because it may deal with an area such as pharmaceuticals.  That would be wrong. There are bad and good industries and a factory will not affect the environment simply because it has a bad name.  This council should educate us and identify what is and is not acceptable in environmental protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council should also advise local authorities.  A new method of waste disposal was mentioned on the radio recently.  It involves heating the waste at a temperature which destroys all toxins <Col N="1241" /> and other elements within the waste.  It is apparently highly effective and environmentally friendly, but it would probably be rejected in Ireland because of fear about what might happen.  It is important to tackle ignorance.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about education. We are not educated in Ireland to deal with life; we are educated to work and survive.  During the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill debate earlier we spoke about the drug culture.  It was clear there also that we do not educate our children to deal with what they are exposed to in society today.  As the motion says, educational development should be examined.  In civics, do we prepare our people to handle the democracy for which our forefathers fought so hard?  Is the apathy about politics and the democratic system a result of ignorance? Should this be developed in the schools?</P>
    <P>Medical matters are also crucial. Ireland should participate more in cancer research and other areas.  There have been marvellous international developments in investigations into cystic fibrosis in the last two years.  Ireland played a small part in that and we should be more involved in developing better health facilities through medical research.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is one sector where we can provide jobs, as can be seen in the milk production industry.  By contrast the meat industry has been deficient in job creation, but there is potential to develop jobs in that area and other parts of the food and agriculture sector.  Because of the present international economic position there are huge exports of live cattle. If we exported those cattle as tinned meat we would have much more employment. If everything was produced at the level of cooked food, 10,000 extra jobs would be provided in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We cannot deny the farmer the right to sell his produce, whether it is live cattle or otherwise, where he gets the best price.  We must try to make it more economical and attractive from a financial point of view to sell a developed added value product.  The only way to do this is to develop innovative products on the world stage which people will buy. <Col N="1242" /> For example, whiskey salami was developed by Duffys in Hackettstown, County Carlow, and it was sold throughout the world.  The development of cream liqueurs is another example of what can be done in that area.</P>
    <P>The motion urges the Minister to &ldquo;immediately initiate the taxation relief to encourage research and development in both indigenous companies and divisions of international companies here&rdquo;. One can only establish a permanent industry in a country if people develop home products.  One can only have a hold on a local or an international company if it is developing, producing and marketing its own products.  It is important to encourage our organisations to develop new products and to improve the existing product base.  International companies should look towards developments of their subsidiaries in the country and they should stand alone with their product range and their product developments and improvements.</P>
    <P>Scientific and technological advice should be available through Leader schemes and county enterprise partnership boards.  This is available in the Limerick area, through the University of Limerick and other establishments which are only too happy to help industries and the county enterprise partnership boards. They are new, but they should experiment and ask the scientific and technological institutions for assistance.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry, Senator O'Toole and other Senators who sponsored this motion.  I thank them for the opportunity to say a few words on this subject.  I express my gratitude to the Members who have spoken and I have carefully noted their concerns.  I regard this evening's debate as a most helpful and constructive input into a process which I want to ensure is successful.  I will pass a copy of the debate to the Science, Technology and Innovation Council for their consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;review&rdquo; can often be misinterpreted in Government circles. <Col N="1243" /> Sometimes it is misconstrued &mdash; or even construed &mdash; as a reason for defending current policy or for postponing action.  I saw this happening in various Governments over the years.  The question arises why we need a Science, Technology and Innovation Council.  There are two main reasons in my opinion.  When I launched the review on 18 February I indicated that the State was making an annual investment of £650 million in scientific research and technical activities.  This is an astonishing figure.  It covers virtually the entire range of Departments and agencies from, for example, the Central Statistics Office, the Meteorological Service and the bigger spending Departments such as Education, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Enterprise and Employment.  My first directive to the council was to examine that figure, to introduce more transparency and understanding of where the money goes and for what it is intended and, more importantly, to ensure that we are getting value for money and that there is a coherent strategy behind the annual investment.</P>
    <P>On the day we launched the council, I had a discussion with the members and it was mentioned that some of this money should be invested in bricks and mortar &mdash; in buildings &mdash; as opposed to programmes and projects which might create results.  This example shows the type of emotion which can become part of this debate.  People have said to me that many of our great inventions and scientific breakthroughs did not take place in glamorous buildings, but in attics and other such places.  Now it seems we cannot make any progress in science and technology unless a gleaming building is built, which is a couple of storeys high, with many rooms, a ministerial opening and a lavish annual report.  This is an example of the type of dilemma which the council must consider.</P>
    <P>The second reason we established the council concerned the debate and followup which is needed to ensure we give more prominence and attention to the subject matter.  The council will lay the foundation for a clear strategy to drive <Col N="1244" /> Government spending in this area.  In my view, there is no clear understanding or consensus among policy makers, the public and the providers and users of science and technology as to how science, research, technical development and innovation can best contribute to national development in its broadest sense.  My expectation, therefore, is that the council will address this key issue and thus establish a platform for all future policies, mechanisms and schemes through which the Government will support science and technology development.</P>
    <P>I have asked the council to try to establish what the Government strategy and policy should be in the area of science and technology in the short, medium and long term.  This is desperately required because a coherent and focused national science and technology policy is at the centre of our economic development and we ignore it at our peril.</P>
    <P>My first reaction when I accepted this post and looked at the science and technology area was that it needed to be pulled together.  We need priorities and a sense of order.  A small country like ours can only drive its economy if it has adequate investment in science and technology because that helps the industrial development we require.  The reason the council was established was not to postpone anything, but to decide as a nation how to target an investment of £650 million.</P>
    <P>Two developments have been responsible for bringing the debate from the realm of theory to the practical over the years, that is, the establishment of the Office of Science and Technology which was established in 1987, and the substantial increase in funding through the EC Structural Funds programme since 1989.  The question is not if we should invest in science and technology, but are we investing in it to the maximum advantage and on what strategy are we investing it.</P>
    <P>This year sees the beginning of the second tranche of Structural Funds, which will bring us from 1994 to 1999, including substantial expenditure in <Col N="1245" /> relation to science and technology.  The policies and instruments which flow from the council report and from its implementation, together with this investment of funds over the next six years, will significantly influence the future shape of our economy.</P>
    <P>I presume Senators have all seen and read the terms of reference for the council, which are essentially about achieving economic development through research, technology and innovation.  I want to emphasise, as I did when I launched the council, that as a country we must seek to embrace all that is good and possible in science and technology and apply that to the best national advantage in the long term and the short term. We must aim to secure the highest possible standard of living, health, education and general well being for our people. That is the purpose of applying science and technology.</P>
    <P>I have set the council a demanding task, given the breadth of the review and the target of concluding a report by the end of the year.  The council will, of necessity, be concerned in the first instance with strategic issues, which serve us in the long term.  That does not exclude any specific operational topic which the council might deem important or on which I might seek its advice in the course of the review.  It is against that background that the Cabinet appointed 18 independent minded people to the council who, I trust, will bring a range of expertise and skills to the examination of this complex and important area.  In passing, I would also mention that the members have been appointed in their personal capacity and are not there to represent any institution, issue or interest.  It is important that the final report of the council reflects this principle and I pointed this out to them.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the House that we are not alone in trying to establish a real contribution of science and technology or in reviewing whether we are giving it sufficient importance or in establishing priorities.  To name but a few, the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Portugal, New Zealand and <Col N="1246" /> Holland have carried out reviews of their science and technology systems and others are in the process of doing so. There are two obvious forces driving this general trend in reviewing how to maximise science, research, technology and innovation.  On the one hand, with the ending of the Cold War, countries which previously invested heavily in defence research will obviously want to refocus some of this spending towards civil and commercial uses; in fact there seems to be a trend of diverting funding away from defence research to civil research.  I welcome and support that trend.</P>
    <P>At the same time we are witnessing a massive opening of national markets and the establishment of global markets. These are influenced by the dismantling of barriers to trade following the GATT and by the increase in international collaboration in science and technology. There is a clear link between technical development and growth in trade and we must, at a minimum, keep up with developments, particularly in areas where we have a competitive advantage, which we must hold on to.</P>
    <P>The debate on science and technology over the past couple of years has led us to think about the need to focus on the targeting and application of research to improve our industrial competitiveness. The National Economic and Social Council report of 1993, <i>A Strategy for Competitiveness, Growth and Employment</i>, spoke at length about this and pointed out the importance of investment in science and technology and in management skills.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report was emphatic in saying that technological competence was one of the main keys to competitive advantage and that it was not an optional extra in the search for industrial output and employment growth.  As Minister with responsibility for commerce and technology, it is my intention to ensure that a focus on the development of science and technology is maintained by the agencies, that its contribution to industrial development and the competitiveness of industry continues to be highlighted and that activities are geared <Col N="1247" /> to meet current and future industry needs.</P>
    <P>It is important to highlight that the current <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> abounds with references to the need for innovation and technology upgrading.  The programme underlines the need to move in this direction as a key to competitiveness and employment growth.  It is important that this direction and focus are accepted by all of the partners to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>However, the fact remains that business expenditure on research and development in this country is still too low.  Latest available statistics for 1991 show that business expenditure on research and development in Ireland amounted to 0.65 per cent of GDP compared to the European average of 1.25 per cent.  I believe that in addressing the many issues which the council has before it, this will become in time one of the key indicators of success or failure.  I believe the recommendations which the council come up with should be primarily aimed at increasing business investment in research and development.</P>
    <P>These figures do not reflect the impact of the major grant scheme for research and development which was introduced at the end of 1992 and has now become known as &ldquo;Measure 6&rdquo;.  In 1993 the Government made available a sum of £23 million towards this scheme and the same amount again was provided in matching funds by the successful applicant companies. Of far greater significance is the fact that the scheme generated applications to the value of £280 million, which demonstrates clearly the latent capacity of Irish industry to carry on research and development.  Applications totalling £280 million were made for £23 million of funding, which was ultimately awarded. That indicates the interest of Irish companies in research and development.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House specifically mentions taxation relief to encourage research and development in both indigenous and international companies in Ireland.  I already asked the council to <Col N="1248" /> prepare a specific report on the impact of corporate taxation on the level of research and development carried out in Ireland and I expect to have a report from them within two months.  Depending on my examination of their conclusions and recommendations, I hope to be able to make proposals to the Minister for Finance for incorporation in the next budget and Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the complications in this area is the fact that the 10 per cent rate of corporation profits tax, while strong in attracting foreign direct investment, has the indirect effect of retaining research and development activities in countries where they can be offset against the higher tax rate.  This question of taxation leads indirectly to the question of how to encourage multinationals to carry on more research and development in Ireland.  The key here is to find a way to encourage activities without creating impediments which would lessen Ireland's attractiveness as a location for mobile investment.  That is one of the ironies of the taxation system and the method of attracting research and development expenditure.</P>
    <P>International companies are not really interested in investing in research and development because they only get relief at 10 per cent.  While the 10 per cent rate is a major attraction for them to establish here, ironically, it is more beneficial for them to write off their expenditure in areas with higher corporation taxes &mdash; some of our competitors have rates of 30 or 40 per cent.  Our low corporation tax rate is a disincentive to investment by companies in research and development. I asked the council to advise me on that urgently because we cannot afford to be behind our competitors in that area.</P>
    <P>Specific areas of industry which we need to address are small and medium sized industries &mdash; SMEs &mdash; which do not carry on any form of technology upgrading activities and the encouragement of greater numbers of technology based start up companies.  Schemes like Tech-start have an invaluable role to play in this area and they have my full support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> From my participation in the Task Force on Small Business, I know research and development is not high up on the priorities of small companies which face many short term complications in their attempt to survive and prosper &mdash; usually how to get enough cash to pay the wage bill on a Friday or a meeting with the bank manager.  It is not easy for them to focus on the importance of science and technology and research.  I am convinced that in the medium term, innovation will be the key to continued growth of small business into the medium and large sized companies with expanding markets.  I am doing everything possible to bring that message to small companies.</P>
    <P>The motion urges that any project under the Leader schemes or the county enterprise partnership boards should have technological and scientific advice made available to it.  I agree with this and given my previous comments I would like to see a certain priority given to projects coming before these schemes which are based on technological and scientific advances.  I am assured by the operating authorities of these schemes that the necessary expertise and guidance is available through the relevant agencies which are represented.  I will ensure that the requirement in the motion is brought to the attention of these agencies so that they are aware of Senators' concerns about this matter.</P>
    <P>The motion urges me to ensure that environmental, educational, medical and agricultural aspects, as well as industrial, are considered by the council.  I explained the broad terms of reference and the broad definition of economic development, including socio-economic aspects, which have been given to the council.  I assure Senators that none of these important elements will be overlooked.  I regard all of them as being inextricably linked with industrial development and thus contributing to economic growth.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the educational aspects later.  Otherwise, suffice to say that it is hard to think of industrial development without thinking of the relationship with agriculture and the food industry and equally, it is clear that companies marketing <Col N="1250" /> policies are increasingly influenced by environmental issues and consumer preferences.  The medical, educational and environmental aspects of research and development all address society's needs in different ways and these cannot be left out.</P>
    <P>I accept what the motion states and I will ensure that the council deals with environmental, educational, medical and agricultural aspects as part of its brief. This was, in any case, my intention because they are all inextricably linked. I thank Senators for reminding me to remind the council to do just that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the education system, there is no question in my mind that the teaching of science subjects and the training of graduates in research disciplines is vital to the general economic development of this country, to encouraging and supporting research and development by industry and to fostering an innovative culture.</P>
    <P>Members would think from reading some newspaper articles over the past 12 months that the only issue as regards third level education was the amount of funding for basic research, but the third level system is much wider than that. It is essentially about providing skilled manpower, about matching the supply of these skills and research activities to current and future needs and about improving the linkage between higher education and industry research activities.</P>
    <P>First let me expand a little on the Government approach as regards basic research.  I would like to make it clear, because this debate has been raging in research circles for some time, that I fully appreciate the importance of basic science as one of the essential ingredients in the interactive model of innovation.  It is unfortunate that public debate on this issue quickly seems to become polarised into whether one is in favour of basic science or applied technology.  It is not a matter of one or the other but of one as well as the other.  The challenge is where to strike the right balance, how to order priorities and how to extract maximum <Col N="1251" /> benefit from the State's already considerable investment in this area.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see greater effort to convert scientific and technological achievements into products and competitiveness and more attention being paid to harnessing the results of basic research.  At the same time I want to make it clear that I greatly understand and support the requirement for basic research, for research which does not always have a commercial or industrial or, indeed, any specific objective.</P>
    <P>I have become increasingly aware over the months in this post that many of our great technological and scientific breakthroughs have come not so much from planned organised bureaucratic programmes but from the inquiring mind of the scientist, the probing of the professional technologist and I am very anxious, having responsibility for science and technology, to ensure that that element is maintained and nurtured.  The disorganised side of science and technology is important and we have to acknowledge its existence, not interfere with it too much and support it financially.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is a balance.  We cannot invest all our funds in that side because we have a requirement to produce new products and technological breakthroughs for the economy.  Ireland is known as a creative place, our people are known to be creative and it is very important to encourage that creativity and not put it into a straitjacket, as it were, trying to have State ordered science and technology programmes.  That is not the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>The motion proposed specifically that there should be a pilot scheme in introductory science at primary school level. Given my experience as Minister for Education and now as Minister for Commerce and Technology, I support this.  I strongly believe that the education curriculum must begin at an early stage to encourage innovation, curiosity, technical skills, call it what you like.</P>
    <P>I recall as Minister for Education being heavily criticised about my decision to <Col N="1252" /> put the phrase &ldquo;enterprise culture&rdquo; into the Green Paper on Education.  I stand over that because my definition of enterprise is not just that you start a business. My definition of enterprise is of being creative, innovative, and enterprising.  A philosophy teacher can be enterprising, those who provide services can be enterprising. Deputies and Senators can be enterprising.  I have tried to explain, particularly to the teaching profession, that my reference to an enterprise culture in the Green Paper meant trying to convey to children the importance of being innovative and enterprising in whatever aspect of life they find themselves. Some quarters chose to interpret that as my trying to turn the schools of Ireland into some kind of industrial factories. I am glad of the opportunity to reject that again today.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  As I said, we have just come through the first phase of Structural Funds support for science and technology and we are entering the second phase.  There have been many significant adaptations to the programme, the most significant of which is the move from the initial position of supporting infrastructural development to a position of direct support for research and development in industry.  I spoke about the buildings example earlier. At the same time we have entered a period of intense debate on the role and contribution of science and technology to economic development, with a clear eye on the appropriate strategies and support for science and technology to bring us into the next century.</P>
    <P>While the comparative international figures tend to show us in the bottom half of the table when it comes to science and technology related expenditure, it is inadequate simply to aim for a more respectable place on the league table.  Far more fundamental questions have to be addressed against a background where resources will always be inadequate to meet all demands in this exciting area.  Do we have a proper system for prioritising areas for support?  Do we have a system for targeting and measuring the impact of these supports?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> The investment in science and technology and the success of that investment will determine what kind of economy we develop &mdash; high value market leader or low cost price taker.  It is important to appreciate that success in this field is a long term objective and it is vital, therefore, that we prioritise and match the skills, the investment and the programmes with the needs.  Most countries are now doing this and Ireland cannot be left behind.  By definition science, research, technology and innovation are risk activity, long term in their nature but highly rewarding if successful.  My thanks to the Senators who tabled this motion. It gives us an opportunity to stand back and see where we are going in this critical area and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>In company with others I thank Senator Henry and her colleagues for putting down this motion this evening.  The debate since 6 p.m. has been very interesting.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to the House.  The qualities he displayed as general secretary of Fíanna Fáil &mdash; toughness, tenacity and above all patience &mdash; are required even more in his present job because whether we like it or not, our society, our political parties and our electorate demand instant results from our Ministers.  A public representative is as good as the last school or factory.  In science and technology this approach is not possible; research is not an instant process.  Since it is slow and expensive it does not immediately grab the headlines.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not get any kudos for establishing this council which is to focus in on possibly one of the most important aspects of our endeavours as a Government because he is not going to announce any new products tomorrow.  The process he has started will lead to new products, however, and that is what it is all about. This is vitally important to the welfare of the country.  The Minister will need an abundance of the tenacity he has always displayed to insist that research and development grow and develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> I found the Minister's comments on buildings very interesting.  There is always a rush to put up flashy buildings, as if Pavarotti could not sing as well in a shed as an opera house.  It is an Irish thing.  We love it, all the chrome and glass technology centres.  We might not actually produce much in them but they look good and they photograph well. There are fancy parks in the United States in places like Carolina but I am never sure what they produce.  It struck me as ironic that in a country that has produced such creative people as Beckett and Shaw, if we had inventors of the same calibre we would be importing labour not dealing with emigration.  The cost of not encouraging research and development is very evident in that we have lost huge industries.  The computer industry was essentially a Meccano-like operation; it was the assembly of components and had no other function.  It was, therefore, extremely mobile and that has been evident over the years.</P>
    <P>There is an evident lack of research and development in the fashion industry. We had a footwear industry second to none, but because no money was put into research and development the industry sagged and collapsed.  The same happened with the knitwear industry.  The Italians experimented with colours, dyes and fabrics and they thrived; we did nothing but ship out the same old stuff because of a culture which says &ldquo;We want to see the money today&rdquo;.  As the Minister said, there is a great deal of interest in that with regard to paying wages and dealing with the banks.</P>
    <P>The banks have rightly been the target of ire of late.  If someone went to the banks with a plan to invest money in a long term research project they would be thrown out the door.  They are not backers of research and development; they want their payments up front and on time.  That is part of this &ldquo;instant&rdquo; culture referred to.  There are no kudos for putting in the foundation and getting the planning and structures right.  Unless there is a change of attitude we will not go anywhere in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> As legend tells us, immediately after the war the Japanese had the means of acquiring science and technology by, for example, simply establishing a place called Sheffield and then stamping &ldquo;Made in Sheffield&rdquo; on their cutlery. That is one way of acquiring it.  They became serious about it, however, and became the world leaders in micro-technology.</P>
    <P>This country spends a substantial amount of money on research and development, and has a tax regime.  That has to be made attractive.  Research and development is itself an industry &mdash; it is not a by-product of the inventors &mdash; which could create many jobs for our highly educated graduates.  It is worth bringing in on its own whatever the end product may be, and anything that can be done to encourage that should be done.  The Minister referred to the tax regime in so far as it is attractive at one end of the scale and unattractive at the other, and that has to be addressed.  This is an ideal country for such facilities; it has everything necesary, including the infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The innovation shown by a former Taoiseach in relation to tax for writers, poets and artists has worked.  Perhaps we should look at research and development in the same mode.  Ireland is a far more attractive location than it was 20 years ago.  We now have the telecommunications, the infrastructure and renowned third level institutions; we have all of the ingredients necessary to bring such industry here.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for what he has done.  It is a long, hard haul but eventually it will be recognised as being an important part of the putting together of the modern Ireland if we can get it going in such a way as to produce results for us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely motion and I congratulate the Minister on setting up the new independent council. I agreed with him when he included enterprise in the schools' curricula because for too long we educated people <Col N="1256" /> to look for jobs that were &ldquo;SPP&rdquo;&mdash; secure, permanent and pensionable.  We forgot about developing enterprise. Unfortunately, anyone who was enterprising, made money and tried to develop was tagged a &ldquo;speculator&rdquo; and was considered undesirable.  That attitude went too far and is largely responsible for there being so much unemployment today.</P>
      <P>As Senator Magner said, we had some of the finest tanneries in the world 40 years ago, and 25 or 30 years later we ended up exporting hides and importing leather.  That would not be the case if we had had proper research and development. Even at this stage the council should target tanneries; leather is a big seller and we should not have to import it.</P>
      <P>If one set up a tannery now there might be a problem with environmentalists; they might say it was a dirty trade which harms the environment.  We must have research and development to prove that industries can be creative and at the same time not destructive.  In many cases the environmentalists are going over the top and many of them are in the SPP category &mdash; they have secure, permanent and pensionable jobs.  They do not think of the children leaving school and coming into the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All our development and research must be geared toward employment because we have to create more jobs.  A lot of research and development so far has been directed toward producing robots.  Robots do the job, but they do not rear a family or create homes.  If we do not have homes we will not have people, and without people we will not have communities.  We must ensure that we develop technology to create jobs. There is no reason why our country, with its population of 3.5 million, should not be producing and selling to the larger European population.  We will have to be a sales country.  We should concentrate research on marketing and we are not doing that.  Many young people are doing marketing in college, but what are they marketing?  What are they selling at the end of the day?  I made my living selling for over 20 years out of necessity because <Col N="1257" /> it was the only job I could get and I know that sales are all important.  We are not developing a sales strategy to produce goods and sell them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Magner when he talks about banks &mdash; they are conservative. I hope a third banking force will be set up and I hope the Government takes a major share in it.  If it is privatised it will be the same as the banks we have already; after a short while the three would be linked together in a cartel and it would make no difference which bank one went into.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of research and development is that the computer has destroyed banking.  I went to pay my car insurance the other day.  I have been with the same insurance company for 40 years. I was amazed that they could not take the money from me until I gave them my policy number.  Years ago they used just pull out the drawer of the filing cabinet, take out my file and tell me how much I had to pay.  I had to go home and get my policy number.</P>

      <P>In some ways technology has made business impersonal.  Technology may be to blame for some of our criticism of the banks.  Nowadays one's account is a figure on a computer and if that figure is exceeded the computer automatically bounces the cheque, for example, and the bank manager does not even know about it.  Years ago I had sometimes to go to one bank to get money to pay another, but in those days the bank manager would ring and say &ldquo;There is a cheque of yours here, will you for heaven's sake lodge some money before tomorrow.&rdquo;  Technology has made it impersonal and this is why the banks come in for so much criticism.  The bank manager who knows everybody is no longer there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would want to do some research and development as to how we can avail of technology.  I am not saying that we can do without technology, but one does not want to completely do away with the personal touch.  In the final analysis, that <Col N="1258" /> is what matters.  One of the great technological advances &mdash; the fax machine &mdash; has brought a new way of life to business. One can send off a drawing, for example, on the fax to a manufacturer, who can make the product to its exact specifications.</P>
    <P>I was amazed when Senator O'Toole said that the expert of today is often the educator of tomorrow.  I do not have a high regard for experts.  In my time I have seen them make many mistakes. For example, experts in my county put down a foundation for a waterworks in a lake.  When they came back to work on it the following Monday morning, it had disappeared under the lake.  I could cite other cases where experts have cost a lot of money to our country.  I am not in favour of them, but I would be totally abhorred if an expert ended up as an educator.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his work.  The Minister will not get much praise or kudos for it, but it is still an important job.  One is living in a technological and scientific age and we must try to make science pay.</P>
      <P>Some people claim there are no resources for science and technology. The experts, whether they are in health, education or the Garda, often call for more resources, which means more money.  This is the new jargon being used.  However, no one has said what they have done with the money they already received.  I am glad the Minister said that there must be some accountability. Some £650 million has been spent on science and technology, yet we are told that not enough money is being put into research.  It is not a million years since the birth of Our Lord.  This gives one an idea of the magnitude of that number.</P>

When people get more resources, they must be asked what they are doing with them.  I appeal to the Minister and to those working with him on this project to spend time into how the research that is developed will be transformed into jobs. Jobs mean people, people mean families and families mean communities.  The Minister should not spend too much on robots.</P>

      <P>Senator Farrell commented on the spending of £650 on science and technology. I am dying to see where that money has been allocated because I wonder how much of it is going to research.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Magner's point. One will not get a great deal of kudos on this matter; it is a slow process.  I am concerned that time is going by while we wait for the report from this council.  We may be endangering existing projects by not examining them more carefully.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville raised a point regarding the pharmaceutical industry; Senator Magner touched on it as well.  There are often objections to the setting up of good industries because of a lack of understanding of what they mean and their environmental impact.  Our laws are extremely strict in this regard.  One must ensure they are enforced.  Just because industries are brought in does not mean these guidelines are not enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Daly said that a lot of research in this country may be specific to ourselves. <Col N="1260" /> The Senator has a long interest in fish farms and sea trout.  The fact that much of the research in this area was done in the Norwegian fjords, which are totally different climatically to the bays of the west, may have been extraordinarily important in these problems.</P>
    <P>Many speakers said that many small firms get bogged down collecting money or have trouble with financing.  They will stay small unless we can ensure they have access to a bank who will back their research and development.</P>
    <P>One never really knows where one is in the area of research.  A joint collaboration has been undertaken between the physics and mathematics departments in Trinity College.  Many projects are done between university departments nowadays.  The bubble is the greatest volume one can have for the smallest surface area.  However, the cube is much better for packaging.  Lord Kelvin worked on this subject approximately 80 years ago and his conclusions have stood until recently.  A study was done in Dublin on developing a module which was halfway between a cube and bubble for packaging purposes.  I am sure no one in this House has heard about this project.  When those involved presented their paper they received a letter from Princeton College in America, asking them to work on packaging there.  Have we missed out again on another tremendous innovation?  Ideas are terribly hard to come by and any ideas we have should be seized upon and worked upon in this country.  As Senator Farrell said, all of these innovations eventually lead &mdash; maybe not in the short term &mdash; to further employment and to industrial, agricultural and environmental progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Senator Ross.</P>
      <P>I, for one, was disappointed to hear what was announced by the Government yesterday on the Minister of State's proposed visit to east Africa.  While well meaning, it is a slightly cosmetic exercise and utterly futile.  The Minister is aware of the facts.  He has seen the television images and the pictures in the papers.  He is well intentioned and will do anything he can, but his journey to the region will not meet the requirements of the situation.  The UN debated this matter in Geneva today and attempted to decide if there had been genocide in the region in recent times.  In this respect I quote from an article in <i>The Independent</i> newspaper of 24 May 1994:</P>
      <P>The killing goes on.  It could get worse.  For seven weeks now, the massacres have continued.  Who knows how many have died.  No one has counted, no one could.  Thousands of bodies, bleached and bloated, are turning up in Lake Victoria, washed down by the river Kagera from the killing grounds 150 miles away.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands have died in recent months, both in Rwanda and in neighbouring Burundi, and the UN, related bodies and other countries have been found wanting.</P>
      <P>While a visit such as that proposed by the Minister is well intentioned, it will be no more than a cosmetic exercise.  The Government must raise the matter at other levels.  There was a protest today outside the House by Amnesty International which called for specific measures, such as the appointment of a Special Rapporteur, obtaining further and full reports, increasing the number of police monitors and establishing an international court to deal with these horrific crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People must be brought to book.  It has been often said that after the last war if <Col N="1262" /> people had known how bad matters were perhaps certain things would not have happened.  The pictures illustrate, and the Minister must be aware of, the hundreds of thousands of bodies being washed up, the genocide, the mass killings and the mass graves.</P>
    <P>There is little point in diplomacy, in the holding of various kinds of discussion and in attempting to find the wording for various motions to ascertain if there has been genocide, as reported on news programmes this evening.  Are those engaged in such activities for real?  Are they dealing with the situation?  Do they know what they are about?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to act at his own level, and with his colleagues, both within the EU and the UN, to put this matter on a different plane.  The Minister should give serious consideration to the measures proposed by Amnesty International to endeavour to resolve this very difficult situation.  Nobody has said it is easy, but there is no point in the UN discussing the technical possibility that genocide has taken place in the region. Are those participating in that exercise living in the real world?</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to raise this matter and I ask the Minister to respond to the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's gesture, while well intentioned, is indicative of the impotence of Irish foreign policy at present.  The Irish contribution to the problem of Bosnia Herzegovina has been pitiful and pathetic, representing a deliberate effort to jump on the UN and EU bandwagon, the lowest common denominator, and not to take any decision.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by this Adjournment Matter is one of life and death.  The Minister announced yesterday that he will visit east Africa.  The House is not yet aware of his itinerary, whether he will visit Rwanda and, if so, whether he will get into Rwanda or Burundi.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the Minister's advice on this.  However, his visit is unnecessary because the Minister advises that it is a fact finding tour.  Everybody is aware of the facts regarding the situation in Rwanda and Burundi.  The Minister is aware that up to 500,000 people have been slaughtered and massacred by genocide in Rwanda alone, that 100,000 people were killed in Burundi between October and December 1993, that 700,000 people fled to neighbouring countries from Burundi and that 250,000 were displaced during that period.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not have to visit the region to ascertain these facts.  They are published by reputable organisations, including Amnesty International.  They are known in the EU, the UN and all over the world.  The Minister is visiting the region because of a feeling of utter helplessness about what the Government can do, because this situation has been ongoing, on a massive scale at least since October 1993, and much longer before that.</P>
      <P>Given this, the international community has been hopeless and pitiful in its response.  Gestures are not required, such as the Minister visiting the region to display what he terms the concern of the Irish people.  I do not doubt his good intentions.  The House is aware that in the past he is a man who has shown good intentions and sympathy for underdeveloped nations.  However, I do not like the sight of Ministers from this country visiting places where poverty, starvation and murder is taking place and then flying home to report on something which we all know is happening anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were to promise action to the House tonight I would be relieved. If he promises that some of the demands for action which Amnesty International listed today in their protest outside the House will be addressed, then perhaps some progress would be made.  If he promised an Irish initiative which disassociates itself from the utter Pontius Pilate attitude of the multinational organisations such as the UN and the EU, I would respect him for it.  However, unless the Minister convinces me otherwise, his <Col N="1264" /> trip abroad will not solve any problems or save any lives.</P>
    <P>I make one or two suggestions, taken from the document circulated today by Amnesty International.  The document asks why Burundi was excluded from consideration by the UN Commission on Human Rights at its meeting in Geneva today?  The problems of Burundi and Rwanda are similar as they have a similar tribal mix.  The document asks why the Government did not insist that Burundi be included?  Is there only worry about Rwanda because it happens to be high profile today?  Burundi will be high profile tomorrow, as it was last year.</P>
    <P>The document sets out demands, some of which the Minister might give a commitment to:</P>
    <P>1.  to appoint a Special Rapporteur on Burundi and Rwanda and the resources available to the Special Rapporteur should include the Commission's own experts.</P>
    <P>2.  to ensure the rapid return of the 52 UN civilian police monitors (CIVPOLS) to Rwanda.  They should have an expanded mandate to report and take-up human rights abuses committed by all parties and should be increased to the 90 suggested by the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>3.  to ensure that UNAMIR troops do not remain silent witnesses but report what they see and what is reported to them in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>4.  as soon as feasible a more comprehensive civilian rights monitoring mission should be established in both Burundi and Rwanda with participation by the Organisation for African Unity.</P>
    <P>5.  to strengthen and implement human rights guarantees in the Arusha Peace Accords.</P>
    <P>6.  to ensure that individuals who have committed gross human rights violations are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> 7.  to establish an independent international criminal court to try those responsible for war crimes.</P>
    <P>8.  to establish an independent and impartial commission of enquiry consistent with international standards.</P>
    <P>Those are the minimum concrete measures which are necessary for the Minister to insist upon.  The Minister should not advise the House that he is visiting the region to express the concern of the Irish people, because their concern is useless, but he should give concrete proposals and advise that he will return to the House after his trip to detail his achievements, not his concern.</P>

      <P>The appalling genocide that has been taking place in Rwanda since early April 1994 is a tragedy of unprecedented proportions. In its intensity and savagery, the butchery and slaughter of the people of Rwanda has no parallels in recent history.  It is difficult to believe that such horrors could take place in our time.  What is happening in Rwanda before our eyes is another shameful chapter of man's inhumanity to man.</P>
      <P>The Government has already forcefully condemned the fighting and the slaughter as an affront to everything we stand for and to the international system of order and justice for which we work. The Government is taking the most serious view of what is happening in Rwanda.  In the face of such horror, we believe that the highest level of co-ordinated response is called for by the international community.  Indeed, we have actively sought to bring about such action within the United Nations and the European Union.</P>
      <P>As an instance of the Government's deep concern, Senators are aware that I intend to lead what Senator Ross calls a fact finding mission to the East African region this coming weekend to assess at first hand the political situation and the urgent humanitarian needs which have arisen as a result of the terrible events in Rwanda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> I plan to travel to Tanzania on Saturday. On Sunday, I will visit the refugee camp at Ngara which is just inside Tanzania's border with Rwanda.  Over 280,000 Rwandans have fled across the border from the terror in their own country and have found refuge in the camp at Ngara.  On Monday I will visit another refugee camp, this time at Karagwe, which is being run by Concern and Goal. There are over 50,000 refugees in this camp.</P>
    <P>I will have talks with the Tanzanian Government and with representatives of the United Nations.  My aim in our talks will be to convey my support for the peace efforts of the Tanzanian Government, the United Nations and the Irish aid effort.  Having made an assessment of the situation on the ground, I will, on my return, urge my European Union colleagues to intensify their efforts at the political and humanitarian level to bring about an end to this terrible conflict and to ease the suffering of the people of Rwanda.  This is not unusual for a Minister for Overseas Development Assistance and I have done so in the case of Sudan, which I visited to see the situation on the ground.  This visit helped me convince my colleagues at a meeting of the EU Council of Development Ministers of the need for greater action.  Some of the other Ministers also spoke of this need.  I remember in particular the contribution of Mr. Pronk, the Minister from Holland.</P>
    <P>As Senators will know, Tanzania is playing a crucial role in receiving the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled from Rwanda.  President Mwinyi of Tanzania is playing an important mediating role in seeking to bring about a ceasefire between the warring parties in Rwanda and to end the terrible slaughter there.  Tanzania is one of our priority bilateral countries.  I met the Prime Minister, Mr. Malacela in the past and will meet him on this occasion if I get the opportunity to do so, but I will be meeting representatives of his Government. It is important to point out that at this level I, on behalf of the Government, hope to advance the whole process <Col N="1267" /> because Tanzania has a crucial role to play.  I know from the number of people who have contacted me that there is public support for such a visit.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I met with the major NGOs from this country and they would certainly support this visit.  There are specific things I will do.  The information I obtain from this visit &mdash; I am aware of the situation on the ground from reports &mdash; will give me added strength, especially at EU level.  I outlined in the Dáil last evening the key points of Ireland's policy in the international arena towards Rwanda. Our focus has been for action at the United Nations and at European Union level.</P>
    <P>At the United Nations we have supported a review by the UN Security Council of the size and mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR).  This has now been carried out.  We have supported a mission to Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  We have also supported a UN Security Council arms embargo on Rwanda which has now been implemented by a Security Council resolution.</P>
    <P>At European Union level we have supported an emergency meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  This emergency meeting began yesterday and is expected to conclude late this evening.  While we are not currently a member of the commission, we are attending the meeting as an observer. Our delegation has played a very active part in the European Union's contribution to the debate in Geneva today.</P>
    <P>Some 55 delegations and NGOs have asked to speak at the emergency meeting of the commission.  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights both addressed the commission.  This is the first occasion that both High Commissioners appeared together at a session of the commission.  The Director General of the World Health Organisation also addressed the commission.  This is a clear <Col N="1268" /> indicator of global concern at what is happening in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>It is likely that the commission will this evening adopt by consensus a strongly worded and comprehensive resolution on the situation of human rights in Rwanda. Ireland is co-sponsoring this resolution. This resolution will state that the killing of members of an ethnic group, with the intention of destroying such a group in whole or in part, constitutes the crime of genocide.  The resolution will also state that it believes that acts of genocide may have occurred in Rwanda.  It will strongly urge all parties to cease immediately any incitement to violence or ethnic hatred.</P>
    <P>The resolution will appoint a Special Rapporteur with a broad mandate to investigate human rights abuses and breaches of international humanitarian law in Rwanda, including acts of genocide. It will also call for those responsible to be brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The resolution will express its grave concern at the failure to date of the Rwandan authorities to condemn the ongoing massacres in the country.  It will call on the Government of Rwanda to condemn publicly and take measures to put an end to all violations of human rights and international law within its jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It will also condemn in the strongest terms all breaches of international humanitarian law and all violations and abuses of human rights in Rwanda.  It will call on parties to the conflict to ensure safe passage for those fleeing from the conflict areas, including, where necessary, to asylum countries, and to ensure the right of return under safe conditions.</P>
    <P>I believe this resolution, when adopted this evening, will send a clear message that the world wants an end to the conflict and slaughter in Rwanda.  For its part, the Government will continue to use every avenue open to it to bring an end to the conflict and to the nightmare of the people of Rwanda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister but am disappointed the Minister for Health did not see fit to take this matter because it is a very important issue of health.  During the many years of debates in this House on the decriminalising of suicide, I constantly laboured the point that suicide is a public health issue and not a crime.  In most European countries it ranks among the ten most frequent causes of death.  In 1992 there were 354 official deaths from suicide in Ireland, the highest ever recorded.  The suicide rate has increased dramatically since the early 1960s, particularly among the young.  The purpose of raising this matter on the Adjournment is to call on the Minister for Health and the Government to identify suicide as a public health issue and to introduce suicide preventive programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government in its <i>Health of the Nation</i> paper has set two targets on suicide prevention &mdash; to reduce the suicide rate by 15 per cent among the general population and by 33 per cent among severely mentally ill people by the year 2000.  The World Health Organisation has set the target of reversing by the year 2000 the current rising trend in <Col N="1270" /> suicide and attempted suicide in Europe. The WHO has called on all member states to take steps to develop national programmes for the prevention of suicide, establish national co-ordinating committees, promote the co-ordination of current research and stimulate further research.  I call on the Government to respond to the WHO request.</P>
    <P>Two approaches to preventive programmes are suggested by international experts.  The first of these is the population approach whereby an attempt is made to reduce the prevalence of a risk factor for suicide for the whole population. The second approach is to concentrate primarily on high risk individuals.  The difficulty with the second approach is the identification of such individuals.  Also, the factors which prevent suicide in high risk individuals must be understood before they can be used to combat such risk.  Suicide preventive programmes should be directed at the general population and individuals thought to be at high risk of suicide.</P>
    <P>The most strongly associated risk factor for suicide is a diagnosis of psychiatric illness, as more than 90 per cent of suicides have suffered from mental illness at some time.  The most common illnesses appear to be depression, alcoholism and schizophrenia.  Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder.  Thus, an important aspect of a suicide prevention programme is the recognition, prevention and treatment of depression.</P>
    <P>It is well known that socio-demographic factors such as age, sex, marital status, employment status, living alone and social and cultural attitudes influence suicide rates.  Employment opportunity has a considerable effect.  Those most at risk are those whose employment has become insecure, with a real threat of redundancy, and those recently experiencing unemployment.</P>
    <P>Access to means of suicide is regarded as a risk factor.  In the UK, between the late 1950s and early 1970s, the incidence of suicide by domestic gas poisoning declined rapidly following the reduction in the carbon monoxide content of domestic gas.  The availability of firearms is <Col N="1271" /> another factor which may influence suicide levels.  Some studies have found that a reduction in availability has reduced the incidence of suicide.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that I have ten minutes in which to make my contribution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been pointed out that the prescription of drugs such as tricyclic anti-depressants, which are toxic in overdose, may possibly increase the incidence of suicide by being readily available to potentially suicidal patients. Tricyclic anti-depressants are regularly prescribed to depressed and potentially suicidal patients, which is an area of great concern.  There is an onus on doctors to exercise caution in the prescription of those potentially toxic drugs to potentially suicidal patients and consideration should be given to the newer generation of anti-depressants, such as SSRIs, which are thought to be not toxic in overdose and can be equally effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well recognised that following parasuicide there is a significant risk of eventual suicide, with 1 per cent of adults who die by suicide doing so within a year of a suicide attempt.  Thus the parasuicide group is a high risk group for suicide. Despite these theories, as yet there is no clear evidence of the best way of preventing <Col N="1272" /> repetition of the parasuicidal act or suicide among this group.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of a suicide prevention programme, its targets or objectives must be formulated and clearly stated.  These should be formulated by a multi-disciplinary working party and must be realistic.  A second prerequisite is funding.  Adequate funding should be provided to establish and maintain a programme.</P>
    <P>Education has a vital role in suicide prevention and educational programmes must be directed at both the general public and health professionals.  In Ireland particularly there remains a stigma associated with suicide which can only be reduced by freely providing information and discussing the topic.  The recent decriminalising of suicide will contribute greatly to reducing the stigma. AWARE, the voluntary organisation operating in Ireland since the mid 1980s, has made a major contribution in educating the general public in the area.</P>
    <P>If a national suicide prevention programme is to be established, contributions will be required from a wide range of disciplines, including the medical, social, legal and political ones.  Good communications and pooling of information and resources will be vital.  The collection of accurate suicide mortality statistics and ongoing research into suicide will provide the way forward in suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>To deal with the problem of suicide the Government must acknowledge that a major problem exists which requires urgent attention.  We must identify those at risk.  The Samaritans have provided a valuable list of suicide risks, signs to look out for and action which could help to save lives.  Those most at risk are those recently bereaved or experiencing the trauma of the break-up of a relationship or violence in the home.  At risk are those who are suffering from a downturn in health, employment or finances; those who have a painful or disabling illness or dependency on drugs or alcohol and also those who have experienced a suicide in their family or by a friend.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> The signs which can identify that a person is suicidal include being withdrawn and finding it difficult to relate to others, talking about suicide or death, putting affairs in order or giving away valued possessions, experiencing feelings of failure or lack of self-esteem, dwelling on problems which may have no solution and attempting suicide or self injury, however tentatively.</P>
    <P>My objective is to initiate and call on the Government to commence a suicide prevention programme and I hope that I have made my case.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Health is not here to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt) Tom Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's contribution to this matter.  Around the world many thousands of people end their lives through suicide and thousands more make nonfatal suicide attempts, that is, perform parasuicidal acts.  Suicide is probably the most personal act anyone can perform. Few acts have such deep roots in social and human conditions or such far reaching consequences.  Suicide not only affects the person's immediate social circle but also the local and wider community in which the individual lives. The Green Paper on Mental Health, which was launched in June 1992, discussed the challenge of promoting mental health and the prevention of suicide.  The Green Paper outlines the role which mental health personnel can play in the prevention of suicide and emphasises the important contribution of voluntary bodies.</P>
      <P>The number of reported suicides and parasuicides in Ireland has increased over the past 20 years and the number of reported deaths for 1992 was 354.  The factors giving rise to suicide in society have been the subject of debate for many years.  Changes in the fabric of society, depression and social isolation are factors which can contribute to individual distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investigation and detailed research into the causes of suicide has not been easy at national and international level. <Col N="1274" /> In the past there has been an understandable reluctance to complete accurate data on the frequency and pattern of suicide.  It is clear, however, that reliable information on the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is essential if help is to be made available to those considered to be at risk of suicide.</P>
    <P>I believe that the traditional public custom of regarding suicide as a taboo subject can be altered.  In recognition of the need for future research and development on the factors which lead people to take their own lives and into the most effective way of intervening to prevent premature loss of life, the Department of Health is contributing towards the costs of a pilot project on attempted suicide in Cork to be carried out by the staff of the Southern Health Board.  The aim of this project is to reduce the occurrence of parasuicide and to develop intervention skills which may be applied in this area.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health is also providing financial support towards the cost of the Fifth European Symposium on Suicide and Self-poisoning which will take place in University College, Cork, from 31 August to 3 September of this year. This symposium will involve the attendance of between 200 and 300 researchers from all over Europe &mdash; people working towards a better understanding of and the prevention of suicide and suicidal behaviour.</P>
    <P>Along with research and development, it is also important to look at the services which are already in place and at ways of improving and making services more accessible and user friendly.  I am glad to say that the development of psychiatric services in line with the aims of <i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; a service which is comprehensive, community oriented, sector based and integrated with other health services &mdash; has led in a short time span to a position where there is a greater level of understanding and public tolerance of psychiatric illness.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has recommended action to reverse the rising trend in suicide by the year 2000.  It highlights the importance of early detection and treatment of depression, alcoholism <Col N="1275" /> and schizophrenia.  It suggests the need for improvements in the underlying societal factors which put a strain on the individual, such as family stress, social isolation of elderly people living alone and failure at school.  It emphasises the need to develop the individual's ability to cope with events of life and provide a better network of social support.</P>
    <P>The ability of people to cope with life is a crucial factor in preventing and managing mental illness.  Health boards are already involved in a number of ways in promoting better coping skills through <Col N="1276" /> parenting programmes, pre-school play-groups, life skills education in schools, alcohol and drug awareness programmes and social support for elderly people living alone.  The health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, recognises the importance of health promotion, including the promotion of mental health.  Over the next four years the health services will continue to support and provide programmes to promote mental health and prevent suicide.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 1 June 1994.</P>
