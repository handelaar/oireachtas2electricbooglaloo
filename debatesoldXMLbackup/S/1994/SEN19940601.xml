      <P>I have notice from Senator Fahey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to include funding for the Kilbeg/Knockferry Bridge over the Corrib in the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay in making a decision on the appointment of a teacher and the upgrading of Scoil Gobnatan, Mallow, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to urgently provide a day care centre for the mentally handicapped in Kilrush, County Clare.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fahey's and Senator Sherlock's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Taylor-Quinn may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is all Stages of item 1, the Trade and Marketing (Promotion) Amendment Bill, 1994; item 2, Statements regarding Local Government Planning Regulations between now and 6 p.m.  I am suggesting 15 minutes for spokespersons and ten minutes thereafter on both items.  We will take item 42 between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the Order of Business.  Last Wednesday the Leader of the House gave us a list of Bills which it is planned to introduce between now and the summer recess.  We were very surprised and disappointed that the list did not include the refugee protection Bill; a similar Bill was introduced as a Private Members' Bill on 10 November 1993 and at that time we were promised the Bill by Christmas.  The Minister for Justice has said on many occasions that she intends to bring in this Bill but we do not see any evidence of it.  When is it intended to bring in this Bill because we are in breach of Article 14 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights by not having the necessary procedures in legislation to deal with political refugees.  When is it proposed to introduce this Bill?  I ask the Leader of the House to impress on the Minister that we want this Bill introduced before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Leader gave an undertaking to indicate when time would be made available for a debate on the involvement of elected public representatives in the determination of education policy.  I still want that dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In September 1990, the Irish Government, when they signed the Declaration of the Rights of the Child at the UN in New York, gave a commitment to bring forward proposals on how those rights would be implemented in this country as well as a progress report.  The progress report on the implementation of the rights of the child has never appeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this issue on a number of occasions.  As this is a developed country, <Col N="1279" /> the Government is required to do this.  I ask that this matter be raised with the appropriate Minister.  I do not know who is the appropriate Minister as it was the Taoiseach who signed the declaration.  I ask that a Minister come into the House to deal with this matter in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I was impressed by the list of legislation to be dealt with by this House over the next few months. However, I was not impressed that we met only one day last week and are planning to meet only one day this week.  I assume we are going to meet two or three days next week to make up for it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in not being aware of the political facts of life.  Although there is another election &mdash; I am sure the dual mandate is far from everybody's mind&mdash; I cannot understand why, with so much work to do, we are not competent and confident enough to undertake this work at this time.</P>
      <P>I recently suggested some topics we should be debating which are not related to the passage of legislation.  The first is the concept of peace-keeping versus peace making in the context of the United Nations.  The others include the enlargement of the European Union and banking and currency.  I ask the Leader to find time for these debates so they can be discussed when there is not a crisis.  I ask the Leader to take account of this in the immediate future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to believe that a man of such distinction as Senator Quinn would be so naive; we can only assume <Col N="1280" /> that he is being mischievous.  The reality is that three Members of the House across all parties are standing in the European elections.  The defence and progression of democracy is equally the business of this House and, like Senator Quinn, sometimes we have to prioritise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> With regard to Senator Neville's query on the refugee Bill, the Bills I announced last week were only part of the programme of legislation to be dealt with between now and the summer recess. There is always scope for the inclusion of other Bills and I am confident that the refugee Bill will be one of them.  I do not have the timeframe for Senator O'Toole but I will endeavour to get it.  Senator Magner answered Senator's Quinn's comments.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Opposition did not mention yesterday's announcement in Dublin north.  I have stood here when other issues of national importance concerning my constituency were raised.</P>

    <Title>Trade and Marketing Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1994    [Certified Money Bill]:    Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the statutory limit on the amount of grants that may be made to An Bord Tráchtála to enable that body to continue <Col N="1283" /> the work of promoting and developing the sale of Irish goods and services.</P>
      <P>The Trade and Marketing Promotion Act, 1991, under which ABT was established, fixed the total amount of grants which may be provided by the Oireachtas to the board at £400 million.  The Bill proposes to raise this amount to £650 million in order to cover expenditure by ABT over the next four to five years, including that incorporated in the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999.</i> It does not imply any long term commitment to provide funding at a particular level and does not bind either the Government or the Oireachtas to any financial commitments.  It should be seen, therefore, as essentially a technical measure.</P>
      <P>This ceiling has been raised every few years since the establishment of Córas Tráchtála, An Bord Tráchtála's predecessor, in 1959.  The idea of setting such limits is to give the Oireachtas a periodic opportunity to review the agency's operation.  However, I should point out that such opportunities also exist through the annual Estimates exercise and the various Oireachtas committees.</P>
      <P>The current aggregate or cumulative sum paid from the Exchequer to ABT and its predecessor CTT since 1959 is now in excess of £380 million and will reach the statutory limit of £400 million before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The focus of ABT's work is to enable Irish companies to overcome the disadvantages of peripherality by means of strengthening their marketing capability, identifying new markets, consolidating existing ones and by actively promoting Irish goods and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the key role of ABT in the promotion of Irish goods and services abroad and will appreciate its major contribution to the growth of Irish exports in the last number of years. Indeed, we must congratulate Irish exporters on their outstanding performance to date and especially in 1993 when most of our major markets were in recession and when the effects of the currency crisis made their task an <Col N="1284" /> extremely difficult one &mdash; for indigenous companies, in particular.  It was a demonstration of exceptional resilience and determination.</P>
    <P>Figures indicate that in 1993 world trade grew by only 2.6 per cent, less than half the growth of the previous year.  This meant that Irish companies had to significantly increase their market share at the expense of their international competitors. In 1993 our total exports rose by almost 9 per cent to an estimated £18.1 billion; this represents a cumulative increase of 23 per cent over the past five years.  Exports from the indigenous sector, where ABT concentrates its efforts, grew to an estimated £3.9 billion &mdash; an increase of 8 per cent in 1993 and a cumulative increase of 30 per cent over the past five years.  These excellent results are reflected in the remarkable trade surplus of 1993 estimated at £3.8 billion or 12.3 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>According to the latest information available from the Central Bank, the outlook for world output and trade has improved.  Indeed, the evidence from the early part of this year suggests that the US economy is experiencing significant growth and that the UK recovery, although more muted, is also well established. Economic activity in Germany and Japan has also shown signs of improvement.  Overall, it is expected that stronger international demand will assist export growth both from the foreign owned and indigenous sectors in 1994.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the ESRI medium term review for the period 1994-2000 forecasts average annual inflation to remain under 2.5 per cent.  This factor, combined with growing competitiveness within the Irish economy, should keep Irish firms well positioned to avail themselves of the ever increasing opportunities which will arise as a result of the completion of the Single Market and the conclusion of the GATT Uruguay Round.</P>
    <P>The achievements of Irish exporters in 1993 show that we have the capability to win more business in highly competitive markets and despite adverse conditions. With a brighter trade picture before us and opportunities multiplying, I am confident <Col N="1285" /> that ABT's 1994 forecast of further growth in total exports to £19.8 billion will be achieved and, more importantly still, their forecast that indigenous exports will grow to £4.3 billion, an increase of 10 per cent, will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that Irish companies must be suitably equipped to succeed in the highly competitive trade arena.  It is clear, for example, that the opening up of the public procurement market in Europe will provide tremendous opportunities for Irish companies. Put simply, public procurement means all purchasing done by public bodies and agencies of all sorts, from the largest commercial State company to the smallest local authority.</P>
    <P>In an Irish context alone, it amounts to a very large amount of business, over £4 billion a year.  However, it is when we translate it into EU terms that its magnitude becomes apparent.  It is estimated that throughout the EU spending by Central Government, State bodies, local authorities and other public sector purchasers amounts to the equivalent of over £400 billion a year.  Previously, only a small percentage of this business was placed with suppliers from outside the procuring State, although it must be said that the Irish market was open to the tune of about 50 per cent when the comparable figure for some other countries was as low as 2 per cent.  The liberalisation of public procurement policy creates a huge area of potential new business for Irish companies.  The time has now come for Irish companies to begin to take advantage of these new legislative developments.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that we incorporated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> a new ABT programme to assist Irish companies to compete for a greater level of sales to the public sector in Ireland, which will ultimately strengthen their ability to compete in the larger overseas public sector markets.  The immediate objective of this initiative is to increase Irish suppliers' sales to the local market by £100 million per annum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> The Government has set ABT a target of increasing the exports of indigenous industry to £5.5 billion by 1996.  One crucial element in achieving this target is the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to ensure that more Irish salespeople are located in overseas markets.  The EUROPLACE scheme, which I launched last year, aims to double the number of Irish salespeople in overseas markets by 1996.  I am glad to say we are on target to achieve this figure.</P>
    <P>Other valuable ABT programmes include the business leads campaign which generated sales leads worth over £200 million, while the targeted marketing consultancy scheme, which assists companies to undertake significant marketing investments, plays an important role in the success of indigenous industry. These successful measures will be further enhanced by a drive to diversify Irish exports and target new markets with high growth potential.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the importance the Government places on the development of indigenous industry. This is the overriding objective of the new market development programme.  This programme will be administered by ABT over the next six years and is assisted by EU Structural Funds.  It will promote and develop trade from the indigenous manufacturing and traded services sectors. Identifying and maximising outlets for these sectors is a key component in the Government's strategy for creating employment.</P>
    <P>The market development programme will use specific measures to address and correct the structural disadvantages experienced by indigenous exporters <i>visà-vis</i> their competitors in the rest of the EU.  Its target will be to achieve an annual increase of 9 per cent in our indigenous exports and to increase Ireland's share of other EU markets by 25 per cent over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>This Bill will ensure that the statutory framework to support and develop the Irish export sector into the 21st century is in place.  This will enable us to provide <Col N="1287" /> ABT with whatever level of finance is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I support the Bill.  As the Minister has indicated it proposes to increase the level of non-repayable grants to An Bord Tráchtála from £400 million to £650 million.  The role of ABT in helping Irish industry in the generation of profitable exports is supported by everyone. This role is essential to the economic development in the country and the prospects of job creation.</P>
      <P>The reports of ABT state that it supplies services to 2,500 companies in the State and point out the opportunities for increased exports.  On the basis of our industrial, manufacturing and exporting performance over the past two years, we are poised to avail of improvements and growth in overseas markets.  The work of ABT is vital, and I join with the Minister's praise of the body.  I have been unhappy with one or two decisions by ABT in recent times and I will refer to them in due course.</P>
      <P>I also join with the Minister in praising the excellent performance of Irish manufacturers, exporters and industry as a whole in the face of competition in overseas markets.  We must recognise our duty as Oireachtas Members to encourage expansion and progress.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the figure for exports in 1993 was over £18.1 billion. At the beginning of that year the ABT forecast for exports in 1993 was £1 billion less than that figure.  This indicates how successful our industry has been. The ABT forecast for the present year is just over £19 billion.  If last year's performance is repeated we will break the £20 billion barrier.  We can be proud of this.  The Oireachtas must always be willing to assist in such cases.  I commend the Minister for his interest in this area; he has left his mark on many aspects of his Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> We must recognise that while progress is being made, the Government seems to be leaving in place certain handicaps which militate against better performance. If these handicaps were removed, it would enhance a good performance. The handicap to which I am referring is the overwhelming burden of bureaucracy which many companies, particularly in the export field, are confronted with and which is a disincentive to many aspiring companies, especially the smaller ones.  I find a certain consistency there.  While the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is doing an excellent job&mdash;and I give him credit for that&mdash; obstacles are still in place, many of which come under the general heading of bureaucracy.  This causes unnecessary cost but equally disturbing is the unnecessary frustration for people who are attempting to break into export markets.</P>
    <P>Another obstacle is tax on working performance which confronts both individuals and companies and creates a disadvantage for manufacturers and exporters.  We must continue to mention this factor until effective measures are taken to deal with it, although it becomes tiresome after a while.  This tax burden militates against performance, especially when viewed against similar costs of competing companies in other countries.</P>
    <P>I recognise the progress which has been made in the indigenous industry sector. This is an important development.  The Minister mentioned a target of £5.5 billion by 1996.  Given our output and performance record in indigenous industry over the past couple of years, we should be able to meet this target.</P>
    <P>We cannot conclude this debate without referring to the situation which may develop, and is likely to develop, from the recently concluded GATT agreement. No doubt there will be opportunities for some sectors of Irish industry and these will be grasped but, we must also recognise the disadvantages &mdash; and there will be acute disadvantages in some cases&mdash;for some important export industries which have a good track record in winning markets overseas, often against <Col N="1289" /> stiff competition.  I am referring to the disadvantages for those involved in agriculture, food, textiles and clothing.  We should not allow this opportunity to pass without saying that difficulties will arise for those areas.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me what examinations and preparations the Government has undertaken to deal with these situations as they arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government recognises that Irish companies must be suitably equipped to succeed in the highly competitive trade arena.  Perhaps I am taking that sentence out of context because I am not following on from it, but I want to consider it on its own.  How does that stand with a decision taken by An Bord Tráchtála in the past year to dispense with a worthwhile scheme &mdash; the provision of management consultancy services to companies?  Companies could get a grant of £9,000 and avail of the services of a management consultant for up to 32 days per annum. Many companies found that to be a useful scheme.  In two cases, I was told it was the factor between success and failure.  I would like to know why it was considered desirable or necessary to remove what would appear to have been a good scheme.  Another reason it was a good scheme was that, unlike others, it was put in place to help industry, it had a built-in mechanism to measure its success or otherwise.  Because of this built-in mechanism I believe the decision to dispense with this scheme was hasty. However, reasons for this decision may be advanced later.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that An Bord Tráchtála has decided to leave in place another scheme, which was under examination, and that is the graduate placement scheme where the services of a full-time graduate are made available over a one year period.  It is a good scheme and I am glad it was not dispensed with because that would have been a mistake.</P>
    <P>My party and everyone in the House supports the work of An Bord Tráchtála, which was set up less than three years ago to take over the joint role of Córas <Col N="1290" /> Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council. It has built up a reputation of excellence over the past three years.  I wish it well and I hope that trend continues.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's comment that Irish companies must be suitably equipped to succeed, I was surprised to find that grant-in-aid to An Bord Tráchtála has been reduced by 8 per cent in the latest Estimates.  Perhaps if it had been the Minister's decision that would not have happened.  If, as the Minister said, the Government recognises that assistance should be provided&mdash;a theory I support &mdash; why has this happened?  Perhaps £3 million is not a significant figure but it represents a reduction of 8 per cent in grant-in-aid to An Bord Tráchtála at a time of growing opportunities for Irish exporters in foreign markets.  If there are growing opportunities, we should not curtail services.  We must avail of these opportunities and exploit them to the full.</P>
    <P>The stifling burden of bureaucracy and red tape, especially where indigenous industry and small operators are concerned, must be removed.  We must look at the burden of tax on work, production and incentive.  It has a double edged disadvantage in that it is oppressive where those in employment are concerned, but it also puts many companies operating in Ireland competing in international markets at a disadvantage in their cost structure in relation to other companies producing similar products in other countries. The Government needs to face up to big issues in this area, including the problems and the opportunities GATT will create.</P>
    <P>I have found another matter to be worrying.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 20 August 1993, Mr. Alan McCarthy of An Bord Tráchtála stated that following a survey carried out by An Bord Tráchtála, two out of every three Irish exporters were not properly prepared for the consequences of a floating pound.  We have been getting near this question of the pound at parity, and to me this rings alarm bells.  I do not know to what extent the situation may have changed since that statement was made <Col N="1291" /> last August, but if An Bord Tráchtála found that two out of every three exporters were not properly prepared for the consequences, then we have a serious problem, but perhaps this has been addressed in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is free to comment, but it is important to preserve the good standing of State boards.  There was an article in the newspapers just over a year ago about a sum of £128,000, building societies, non-existent companies and so on.  I do not know whether that matter has been fully resolved.  I am sure the Minister knows to what I am referring.  I do not know if he is free to comment on it, but for the sake of upholding the good name and standing of State companies and semi-State bodies, the matter should be disposed of in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>I wanted to comment on the spread of markets, the growth we have witnessed and the changing pattern of the markets, but since I cannot do that in half a minute, I will not mention it further.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his achievements to date in the Department of Tourism and Trade.  He has brought a new dynamic to that area.  It is very important that we have an energetic dynamic exports drive. I want to avail of this opportunity not only to congratulate the Minister and to wish him success but to express to the board and staff of An Bord Tráchtála our support and congratulations for the efforts they are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had dealings with them once or twice.  I stood in for the Minister's predecessor at a promotion drive in Brussels when we were endeavouring to open up markets in the Belgium/Luxembourg area.  I was fascinated to note even at that time, which was about two years ago, that exports to Belgium were in excess of £800 million.  It is a very important market.  I was impressed with the expertise of the professionals in An Bord Tráchtála who had made important economic contacts between the chambers <Col N="1292" /> of commerce and people involved in trade, industry and business there.  You will find the same kind of professionalism in An Bord Tráchtála in every country where they have offices.  They have offices in five or six locations worldwide as well as several offices in the UK and Europe.</P>
    <P>The reorganised board has combined the old Irish Goods Council and An Coras Tráchtála.  The figures highlighted here by the Minister speak for themselves. Senator Howard mentioned them when he spoke about the expansion in total trade in 1992 to £16.5 billion, an increase of over £1 billion from the previous year, and a further increase to £18 billion in 1993.  These are substantial increases in total export value and underpin job prospects here.  It is important that we provide the necessary finance to enable An Bord Tráchtála to carry out its important work.  It is a modest amount bearing in mind the impact this work has on employment generation.  As Senator Howard said, about 2,500 companies are serviced by An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>This will be especially important in the future with the completion of the GATT negotiations and development of trade in other areas, for example, the expansion of the EFTA countries into the European economic area, the development of the North American Free Trade Area and the development of the east African economic grouping which is developing rapidly, where the opportunities will be great, the stakes are high and we must ensure that we have the best possible team operating.  The combination of these elements &mdash; the GATT negotiations, the regrouping of trade in North America and Asia, and in Europe with the coming together of the EU and EFTA &mdash; will bring a situation which will be exciting and encouraging over the next five to ten years.</P>
    <P>It is important that we would have highly skilled professionals in the marketing and sales areas; and this goes beyond just marketing; it includes design, product quality, the time that services are delivered, etc.  All these elements combine to make up a total <Col N="1293" /> package.  I am encouraged by some of the work I see in many of the professional schools and colleges which are producing graduates of the highest calibre in marketing and design and in the promotion of business generally.  This is to be commended and welcomed.</P>
    <P>I would like to record appreciation for the work done by the professionals in this area, in paying more attention to the design of products, sales and marketing. It is essential that we continue to produce quality goods which can command premium prices on markets all over the world and it will be increasingly essential that the necessary funding is provided to An Bord Tráchtála and other agencies.</P>
    <P>There is a wide range of sectoral activities in which An Bord Tráchtála is involved and each provides new and exciting opportunities.  In the food and drink sector the focus on fish is important, the production of quality fish from fish farms and the development of a trade mark for Ireland, as has been done in Norway.  All these matters must be attended to if we want to make an impact on these important markets.</P>
    <P>In the international services sector the opportunities are great in aviation services, medical services, construction personnel, etc.  I notice from An Bord Tráchtála's report that quite an amount of work was done in Germany.  Although the German economy was sluggish, companies were still prepared to get involved in some of the contracts there, and this provided opportunities in the engineering, electronics and chemical sectors.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fundamental necessity for the provision of well qualified graduates, especially to assist small and medium sized industries.  When we discussed the reorganisation of EOLAS I mentioned that a number of graduates had succeeded in getting jobs in small companies under a scheme which EOLAS operated. About 80 per cent of participants were placed in permanent positions, having worked on a temporary basis on the funded EOLAS scheme.  The demand for those places far exceeded the opportunities available.  An Bord Tráchtála <Col N="1294" /> should consider setting up a grant scheme.  Perhaps it already has a scheme of this nature, but if it has, it is a minor one.  There is an opportunity for an extensive scheme of recruitment or the payment of grant aid through the board to companies hiring young professionals, especially in marketing, who would be involved with these companies, possibly on a shared basis but exploiting new opportunities.  They could avail of the expertise of many of our young professionals who are either unemployed or who are working overseas and would be glad to come home.  In nearly every country I have visited, I have found such people working in businesses overseas. They would be more than willing to come home and play a part in the revitalisation of our industry, provided they had stability of employment.  One could not expect them to come back otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine these areas and see whether it is now possible, with the availability of funding &mdash; possibly also European funding &mdash; to devise a scheme which would enhance the prospects of employment for many of our young graduates who are either unemployed or have to emigrate.  Such a scheme could also help our small and medium sized industries to exploit the world market.</P>
    <P>It has been shown that there are opportunities for our companies worldwide. The American and British markets are not being fully exploited and developed. I welcome the work done by the board in bringing to Ireland those involved in the promotions sector in the UK in an endeavour to sell more of our goods on the UK market.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister about International Development (Ireland); a combination of An Bord Tráchtála, Shannon Development, the IDA and others involved in the promotion of international services.  Is that company still in operation?  Is it successful?  Many companies, such as the international divisions of the ESB and Aer Rianta, have exploited opportunities in the professional management consultancy area. I presume this has been dealt with by a <Col N="1295" /> subsidiary company of the board.  Is it still in operation and, if so, can it be expanded?</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the Channel Tunnel has been completed; trade will soon be moving rapidly through it.  What effort is the board making to direct some of our traffic, especially to continental markets, towards the tunnel?  The Channel Tunnel will have a major impact on trade between the UK and the European continent and we need to become involved in that.</P>
    <P>I fully support this legislation.  Could the Minister tell the House how the marketing of our tourism is progressing?  Will it be a feature of the efforts of the Trade Board or has the Minister any plans to reorganise it?  Any money spent marketing Ireland abroad is money well spent.  There have been serious criticisms about the level of funding provided by Governments on the marketing of our tourism overseas.  This might not be relevant to the functions of An Bord Tráchtála but it has a lot to do with business, jobs and economic development.  There is a necessity at this stage to look at the marketing of Irish tourism and see whether now is the time to look at its organisation, especially when one considers that individual organisations are making their own marketing arrangements. In Shannon, for example, Aer Rianta, Shannon Development, Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus have separate overseas marketing arrangements.  It is important to bring these together and provide a central focus and direction, although perhaps it should not be done under the auspices of the An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and congratulate the staff of An Bord Tráchtála and those involved in this important work.  I also compliment the Minister for introducing the legislation and assure him of the support of this House in his endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Nobody grudges the money <Col N="1296" /> being provided for An Bord Tráchtála, but hopefully the board will be self-critical about how the money is spent.</P>
      <P>There was a trade fair in Chicago in 1993, which I understand the Minister attended.  It is important for An Bord Tráchtála to get non-Irish associated shops to attend fairs of this kind and in this instance heavy inducements were given to firms to attend, for example, a voucher valued at $200, or a contribution towards air fares was provided for those firms who pre-registered.  In view of the fact that there were approximately 600 pre-registrations at that fair, inducements of this kind would have amounted to £120,000, which is a lot of the tax-payer's money.  I hope all the people who were chosen were carefully vetted before being provided with such vouchers or free air tickets.</P>
      <P>I was told &mdash; I assure you it is only anecdotal, but I had to take notice of it seeing it came from a constituent &mdash; that one person who came to her stall owned a pet shop.  I know we are selling horse rugs, etc., but I do not have details of the volume of export of these products to North America.  I would be pleased if the volume of exports was increasing, but we should be careful in the way we select people to whom we are giving these promotion slips.</P>
      <P>In the past, Coras Tráchtála, now An Bord Tráchtála, appeared to advertise heavily at these shows.  I have noted that several pages in glossy magazines have been taken; this is very expensive.  For example, there was heavy advertising in the brochure accompanying the Birmingham Premier Collection recently. Does An Bord Tráchtála make any effort to ascertain how many people read such advertisements and how much business is generated from them?  Does the board ascertain how much benefit is derived, in terms of bringing further business to Irish firms, from its free promotions, such as distributing vouchers, air fares and so on?  What kind of surveys has the board undertaken to ascertain feed back from firms which receive follow up business from their advertising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> An Bord Tráchtála does not have agents abroad.  I am not aware if the board is able to spend money in this way, but I ask the Minister to ensure that consideration is given to this.  While it is important to have Irish people selling abroad, the board should be allowed to recruit agents abroad.  This is important on the continent because people can sometimes be reticent if they deal with people who are not at home in their own language or their currency.</P>
    <P>Perhaps An Bord Tráchtála could group five or six complementary small firms, find an agent for them in some of the bigger cities on the continent and have these agencies deal with local problems of currency, freight, etc.  Such problems may not be as serious as they used to, but this is an area where insufficient effort is being made, even excluding the language problem.  In my experience many North Americans find it impossible to deal abroad if they do not have access to a local facility.  It would be worthwhile if An Bord Tráchtála could put some effort into acquiring good, competent agents, be it on the continent or North America.  Perhaps the board could report to the House, through the Minister, in a few years' time on the cost effectiveness of undertaking this service for Irish exporters, rather than running expensive trips for buyers to shows or engaging in expensive, glossy advertising which perhaps many people do not require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  My contribution will follow on from what many other speakers have said.  It is a tough world and our population is small.  We are, therefore, highly dependent on our exports for jobs and economic prosperity.  It is important that we have a strong trade board and a well organised system of selling our products in the outside world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have considerable strengths and must use them.  These are evident in the figures given by the Minister.  We are in a healthy situation with regard to our exports, which have increased in recent years.  We are peripheral to Europe but we are also central to world markets <Col N="1298" /> beyond Europe.  To expand we need to look further than the EU to markets such as Australia, South America, Africa and parts of Asia, where we do not have a high level of exports at this stage.  We need to look further than the EU.  Our largest markets at the moment are in the EU.  Britain is our biggest market, Germany is our second biggest and the Beneleux countries are the next largest. The challenge in the future will be to go outside the EU and extend our markets to other parts of the world.  In a world context we are central rather than peripheral and need to build on this strength.</P>
    <P>We also need to build on the strength of our reputation, particularly as a green island which produces good quality food. Our reputation in fashion is growing strongly and An Bord Tráchtála looks to our own marketing strategy, which is mainly based on selling within Ireland but sales of Irish fashion are also increasing in other parts of the world.  Our natural fabrics and the high standard of our designers, who have won international awards, give us hope that we can extend this market.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly referred to the strengths of our young marketing graduates.  Language skills are improving greatly and this ties in with what Senator Henry said about the importance of being able to link in to problems in specific countries. Being able to speak the language of a country is one of the most important assets one could have.  Our young graduates are trained in foreign languages as well as in the skills of marketing; this is important.  We have a large number of young, well educated, talented people who already have the gregarious skills of the Irish personality and being able to speak foreign languages is an important asset.  I welcome the stronger emphasis now on young people learning to speak and use foreign languages and learning the technical language needed to use marketing skills.</P>
    <P>When we spoke about the problems of small firms, I mentioned the importance of support and this includes marketing support.  I support Senator Henry's point about clustering, where a number of <Col N="1299" /> small firms, which would not be large enough or have sufficient money to sell on the European or broader markets, are brought together and aided by agencies like An Bord Tráchtála.  Clustering arrangements are much more cost effective. The vast majority of Irish firms are small or medium in size and support is all the more needed for them.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on other occasions about the importance of becoming involved in networks such as transportation, which would get our products on to the shelves of shops in other countries.  It is difficult for a small entrepreneurial firm to know about these systems of which it is necessary to be a part if one wishes to sell outside of one's own country.  An Bord Tráchtála is crucial in this area.</P>
    <P>To ensure we come up to international standards, we have the ISO 9000 mark. It is important that Irish firms are aware of the necessity to achieve the necessary technical standards.  If they do not, they will not win tenders.  The Minister spoke about public procurement and the importance of Irish firms being able to tender competitively within and outside Ireland.  According to EU regulations, if public companies advertise something above a certain cost, they must advertise in European journals.  Irish firms must compete with outside companies.  They have difficulty in doing so and it is helpful if they can tender for big projects in Ireland.  Unfortunately, they sometimes cannot match the cost or the technical standards needed.  Whatever aid they can be given is welcome and I am glad the Minister emphasised this.  Until our companies can compete effectively in this country they will not be able to do so abroad.</P>
    <P>I refer to my experience in relation to An Bord Tráchtála at regional level.  I was recently involved in a promotion by the board's mid-west region, which matched Irish firms in this region with their buyers in the Beneleux countries.  These buyers were brought to the mid-west, a meal was organised for them and they were matched with individual small firms. Large contracts are agreed and business <Col N="1300" /> is promoted through such contacts.  This ties in with what Senator Henry said about the importance of direct contact with people who buy from our small producers. It is difficult for such producers to make these kinds of contacts themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new market development programme about which the Minister spoke.  We are successful at the moment in terms of exports but we need to continue to develop markets.  The establishment of this programme should put us in a good position to expand our markets.  Because of our small population and small home market, we are dependent on increasing our exports from year to year if we are to increase the number of jobs and significantly reduce unemployment. It is crucial that An Bord Tráchtála is well funded, monitored and run and this Bill is an important move in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Bill, however necessary it is to keep the wheels turning at An Bord Tráchtála, will strengthen further the impression that the State's main function is to stimulate marketing by giving grants to companies.  The board has, over the years, become a conduit for the disbursement of large amounts of Structural Funds.  As a result there is a perception that An Bord Tráchtála is in the grant giving business.  This is unfortunate because the central core activity of the organisation should be the disbursement of expertise and knowhow, not cash.  There is a need for the disbursement of the former, particularly among smaller and medium sized businesses and firms, which are the special focus of the board's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members are familiar with the phrase &ldquo;the grant mentality&rdquo;, which is the mindset that there should be a grant for everything and that the primary purpose of any Government agency is to hand out grants.  We need to lay this mentality to rest forever for two reasons.  First, while it exists State agencies are just seen as grant bestowing organisations.  A great deal of the energy of companies will be focused on the wrong activity.  A large number of companies spend their time <Col N="1301" /> trying to avoid tax, and now a large number will spend their time trying to get grants.  The target becomes getting grants rather than helping the business to grow.</P>
    <P>Second, the grant mentality takes attention away from the real role of State agencies, such as An Bord Tráchtála which is to help businesses to grow through supplying certain essential ingredients which they lack &mdash; not money for the most part but know how and expertise.  The real value of An Bord Tráchtála is that it can lengthen the reach of those medium sized and small companies which are in the global marketplace. It has resources for researching and identifying market opportunities which no smaller company could afford.</P>
    <P>It is an essential way of addressing the problems of Irish companies which have to learn to compete in export markets far earlier than their counterparts.  Our home market is so small that we have to move much earlier.  In Ireland, even quite small companies have to export.  The gap is in knowledge and expertise rather than money.  If money is needed it will not necessarily be supplied by the State. Where it is supplied by the State, we would be much happier if all grants came from a single source.  We should designate one agency &mdash; perhaps Forbairt &mdash; as the fountain of any grants which are to be had and make it very clear that all the other agencies are in the business of dispensing a different kind of help.</P>
    <P>The grant mentality is sapping at our potential growth.  The existence of a plethora of grant giving bodies strengthens the notion that grant giving is the central platform of State support for industry.  We want to get away from that grant mentality forever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Quinn said, although I did not take the Minister's speech as an indication that grant giving was to be directed to companies in precisely that way.</P>
      <P>I deplore the invocation of peripherality at the outset of the Minister's speech &mdash; that the focus is to enable Irish companies to overcome the disadvantage of peripherality.  It is not; it is to overcome the disadvantages of our small home market.  Even if we were in the centre of Europe we would still have the same problems.  Of course, peripherality affects products in some areas but it is not the main problem confronting us. Issues such as strengthening marketing capability, identifying new markets and so on, have nothing to do with peripherality as such.  I hope that will have a lower profile in future.</P>
      <P>What the Minister said about the public procurement market is very important.  One of our main problems, as we have said here before, is that our small companies do not have larger companies to sell to within Ireland itself, in other words, we do not have a major domestic market of large companies.  The procurement market in Ireland is the main substitute for it and the procurement market throughout Europe is an even better substitute.  I am concerned by the phrase that &ldquo;the Irish market was open to the tune of about 50 per cent when the comparable figure for some other countries was as low as 2 per cent&rdquo;.  We have not been effective at selling ourselves to our own State procurers.  That is a matter of ongoing concern which we must address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, I was glad to hear the positive references to the education system, and third level in particular, by Senator Daly and Senator O'Sullivan, which I think are well deserved.  There is scope for further improvement of co-ordination between the marketing sector and third level education. I hope that the perceived slightly adversarial attitude to third level in some <Col N="1303" /> sectors does not exist in the marketing sector.  If it does, I hope it can be overcome by co-operation between both sides.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions which were well researched and worthwhile.  The standard of debate in this House has always been very high. I also thank Senators for their timely adjournment.  Senator Lee is a fellow past pupil of Gormanston College and I thank him for raising the question of an adjournment with the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>The first occasion on which I had to answer questions in the Dáil as Minister for Social Welfare was in March 1992.  It was Gold Cup day and as I was answering questions in the Dáil at 3.30 p.m. the Gold Cup was being run.  This House is more civilised than the Lower House.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their good wishes for An Bord Tráchtála and the constructive manner in which each Member dealt with the Bill.  Senator Howard made a good point about bureaucracy with which I concur.  The small business task force examined this problem which is a continuing one for small and medium enterprises.</P>
      <P>My Department and An Bord Tráchtála try to keep paper work to a minimum. An Bord Tráchtála recently changed its financial scheme and it is now processed on foot of just one form.  They are trying to reduce bureaucracy.  If Members have worthwhile suggestions for a further reduction, I will take them on board.  However we must remember that a certain level of accountability requires a degree of bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators referred to the conclusion of the GATT Uruguay Round. <Col N="1304" /> Senator Howard asked what the Government and my Department propose to do for industries that may be in trouble. During the GATT negotiations I made it clear on a number of occasions that one cannot view the various issues in isolation. You do not have to be Einstein to figure out that, for a trading nation such as Ireland, the more liberal world trade is, the better Ireland will do.</P>
    <P>Various estimates have been made about the total growth in world trade as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round; it will be substantial.  A marketing country such as Ireland depends totally on selling abroad because our market demand, with a population of 3.5 million people, is too low.  I have always said that certain sectors will lose out.  The independent report commissioned by my Department also made this point but concluded that the overall benefit to Ireland will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised a question about the cut in grant-in-aid in 1994.  The 1993 grant-in-aid was exceptional because when the 1993 Estimates were being prepared in September or October of 1992 we were at the start of a currency crisis which did not end until 1993.  The 1993 grant-in-aid was exceptionally large.  In the last five years the grant-in-aid to An Bord Tráchtála has increased considerably. In 1994 there was a small cut but no one has complained about it.  The board is happy with the level of grant-in-aid and there have not been any complaints from exporters and people in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised some interesting questions about the currency exchange rate.  I answered this question in the Dáil recently; the matter of currency exchange rates is one for the Minister for Finance.  However, as Minister for Tourism and Trade I would also be alarmed if the punt went to an unsustainable level.</P>
    <P>The growth in exports in the past number of years is not the result of the weakness or strength of the Irish punt but because Irish exporters got a competitive advantage in markets which they did not have previously.  It is interesting to note <Col N="1305" /> that until 1992 when the world was in recession, Irish exporters increased their market shares in various European markets by being competitive.  The market was not growing but they acquired an increased market share.</P>
    <P>Low interest rates, low inflation and good competitive practices resulting from national agreements mean that Irish businesses will be able to compete.  If a business is totally dependent on a favourable exchange rate for its survival, it would be my view as a business person that those businesses will not survive for long.  I do not think the current currency level represents a danger for Irish exporters but it is something we will monitor closely.</P>
    <P>We are victims of our own economic success.  The strength of the Irish punt results from events in the past five to seven years.  Our currency also depends on the performance of the pound sterling. Its weakness is causing the increasing strength of the punt.  It is impossible to predict the future in this area but we will bear it in mind.</P>
    <P>The fraud in An Bord Tráchtála which came to light last year was also mentioned. It involved the marketing development fund the Government put in place during the currency difficulties; the sum involved was £128,000.  The net loss to the Exchequer will be small as most of that money has been recovered. Legal action is in train and Senators will appreciate that I cannot comment further on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised an interesting point and had some suggestions about the potential for development in certain sectors.  There is a grant scheme for graduates and An Bord Tráchtála runs schemes which take on graduates.  This was also mentioned by other Senators. The intention is to strengthen Irish firms and enable them to do business themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the grant giving mentality and the importance of providing expertise.  An Bord Tráchtála wants to develop to the stage where it will be able to place graduates with companies. Various schemes are in place <Col N="1306" /> which enable companies to take on graduates.</P>
    <P>Large Irish companies are very small in international terms.  When launching a scheme last year I was surprised to find that the number of Irish companies with sales people abroad was ridiculously small for an exporting country.  The target is to increase that number substantially over the coming years and we put a scheme in place last year to accomplish that.</P>
    <P>Most Irish companies tend to use agents abroad.  One can be very successful with agents abroad but one can also be singularly unsuccessful with them. It is not the agent's business just to look after one particular product.  He looks after a wide range of items.  However, it is very expensive for Irish companies to set up their own marketing operation in countries abroad.  An Bord Tráchtála is trying to do that for larger companies and is also trying to bring some companies together for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with the question of Irish tourism Senator Daly raised.  An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte co-operate abroad and when one can do something with the other, it is done.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned the Chicago fair which I attended last year.  The operation was jointly funded by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Development Board.  I am not aware of the operational details of the inducements offered to individual companies but I am sure some were offered to get people there.  It was a most successful operation.  Its format was most unusual in that it took over an entire hotel.  When one stepped out of one's room, one looked down and saw the foyer.  All the hotel floors were taken over for the week and it worked very well; thousands of operators attended.  Chicago was chosen because the concentration of Irish companies has always been on the east coast and Chicago was more central in the effort to branch out.  Senator Henry also raised the question of agents.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan made an interesting contribution regarding how standards could be raised and markets broadened. <Col N="1307" /> It is in companies' own interests to try to do this.  However, as I said earlier, the difficulty is that large Irish companies are small by international standards.  It is very expensive to market one's operation. However, we must try to do this. We must broaden, attack the markets and sell more goods.  We are competitive, and we must remain so.  We must broaden our vision in terms of how we do things, as suggested by Senator O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made an interesting suggestion about a single body providing grants.  He also mentioned the grant mentality. I do not know if what he suggests is feasible.  The idea of one agency dealing with grants of all types has not been considered by any Government; I presume the Senator means grants from every Department.  The administration of such a move would give rise to great difficulties. However, the Senator's idea is novel and could be explored at a future date.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator regarding the tendency towards a grant mentality.  This is stronger in certain parts of the country, in some Departments and among some civil servants.  I am on the same wavelength as Senator Quinn in that I am not of the grant mentality.  If a business idea works and can stand on its own, it will succeed and prosper.  The new operational programme for tourism and marketing will reflect my idea that grants should be used to prime an operation, to tip the balance when an entrepreneur is deciding whether to go ahead, rather than, as Senator Quinn outlined, people going ahead with ideas because a grant is available.  That tendency has existed since the foundation of the State.  Many people proceeded with ideas because grants were available, regardless of whether the ideas were good, bad or indifferent.  This is not the way.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee mentioned peripherality but said our problem is one of size.  He is correct but our problems are both peripherality and size.  We are a small market and that is why we must develop.  I thank the Senators for their contributions to this most worthwhile debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without recommendation, received for final consideration and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I am pleased to have this opportunity to inform Senators of the steps that have been taken, through the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, to streamline and update subordinate planning legislation. The various changes made and the new provisions introduced by these regulations are progressive in character. They will facilitate the more effective operation of the planning process while making it more open and understandable for people generally.</P>
      <P>The technical and administrative detail of our planning system is spelt out in regulations under the Planning Acts.  It is to the regulations that one must look, for example, to find out what the requirements are for making a planning application, the fee for an application, which development is exempt from planning permission requirements, and so on.  The basic regulations, before the 1994 regulations, dated from 1977 but have been amended on numerous occasions since then.  The result was that no fewer than 19 separate sets of regulations were in force.  It is unnecessary to say that this made matters very complicated and laborious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time had come to clarify and rationalise the position and the new regulations do so.  It was decided, however, that it would not be enough simply to draw the existing provisions together in a single document, however beneficial such an exercise would be.  Experience since 1977 had shown that there were <Col N="1309" /> quite a number of provisions requiring modification or improvement.  For this reason the new regulations contain the amendments that were considered appropriate in light of experience over the years.  They also cover some new areas as a follow-up to recent planning legislation.</P>
    <P>To put matters in perspective, all Parts of the regulations, except Parts X and XIII, correspond, with modifications and additions, to provisions of the previous regulations.  Parts X, dealing with development by local authorities, and XIII, dealing with development by Government Departments and the Office of Public Works, are new; the necessary enabling powers for these Parts were enacted in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The regulations are concerned in large part with minor or technical matters.  I will not, therefore, go through each article and give details of every change made.  However, I will highlight the more important issues, with particular reference to the new provisions relating to development by local authorities and State authorities, the new public notice arrangements and the alterations made in the categories of development which are exempted from planning permission requirements.</P>
    <P>Part X of the regulations is totally new and deals with development by local authorities.  This Part sets out a procedure of public notice and participation for proposed development, which leads to the preparation by officials of a report on the proposal for submission to the elected members of the local authority. Development that a local authority carries out in its own functional area does not require planning permission because it would be impractical to require an authority to apply to itself for permission. While some local authority development is subject to public notice and comment, through environmental impact assessment procedures, most local authority development proposals have not until now been governed by formal procedures for public information and participation.</P>
    <P>Part X of the new regulations effects a fundamental change on this front by <Col N="1310" /> applying a new procedure of notice and participation to a wide range of local authority development.  The procedure will apply, for example, to the construction of houses, waste water treatment works, burial grounds, landfill sites, fire stations, etc.  The new procedure requires an authority to publish newspaper notice of a development proposal and to give details of the proposal to specified bodies.  Documents and plans detailing the proposed development must be made available for public inspection and a period of at least a month will be allowed for the public and interested bodies to make submissions.</P>
    <P>When the period for making submissions is over, the officials of the local authority will prepare a report on the proposal.  This report will include a summary of the points made in submissions, give the local authority's response to the issues raised and indicate whether it is proposed to proceed with the development. The report will be submitted to the elected members of the local authority and it will be open to the members, if they consider it appropriate, to exercise their power under section 3 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, to direct the manager not to proceed with the proposal.</P>
    <P>The principal advantage of the new procedure is that it will lead to greater accountability in relation to local authority development.  We should not underestimate the significance of the change in terms of the increased public involvement that it will bring about.</P>
    <P>Part XIII of the regulations is also entirely new and is concerned with certain development by Government Departments and the Office of Public Works, to whom I will refer from now on as &ldquo;State authorities&rdquo;.  As Senators will recall, there was a general understanding before last year that development by State authorities did not need planning permission and was governed only by the consultation requirements of section 84 of the 1963 Planning Act.  Following the Supreme Court's ruling in the Mullaghmore and Luggala cases last year that development by State authorities needs <Col N="1311" /> planning permission, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993, regularised the position of development already carried out without planning permission by those bodies and established a framework for the future application of planning permission requirements to their development proposals. After the end of a transitional period which runs out on 15 June, development by these bodies will need planning permission unless it is exempted development or is covered by regulations under section 2 of the 1993 Act or is the subject of a ministerial order under that section declaring that it is necessary because of an accident or an emergency.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the 1993 Act allows the Minister for the Environment to provide, by regulations, that the planning Acts will not apply to proposed development by a State authority if the development has to be authorised under another enactment or if, in the Minister's opinion, it is in connection with or for the purposes of public safety or order, the administration of justice or national security or defence.</P>
    <P>The power under section 2 of the 1993 Act has been carried through under Part XIII of the regulations.  The only development that has been excluded from the scope of the planning Acts on the grounds that it has to be authorised under another statutory procedure is arterial drainage works by the Office of Public Works, which require the approval of the Minister for Finance under procedures in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The developments excluded from the remit of the planning Acts on national security or related grounds include courthouses, prisons, Army and Garda premises, office buildings and other premises used by the President of Ireland, Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann, certain Government Departments and the Offices of the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>It will be readily accepted by Senators that developments of the categories I have mentioned cannot be subjected to public disclosure of detailed plans and <Col N="1312" /> particulars.  For example, no one would suggest that detailed layout plans of a prison or an Army barracks should be available to the public generally.  This means, therefore, that such development has to stand outside the normal scope of the planning Acts.  Nevertheless, it has been ensured there will be as much public information about, and involvement with, the excluded development as is consistent with security considerations.  A lot of the excluded development will, in fact, be subject to alternative requirements of public notice and participation.</P>
    <P>The alternative requirements will oblige a State authority proposing an excluded development to give public notice of the proposal and to notify the relevant planning authority.  Outline plans and particulars of the proposal will be made available for inspection and there will be a period of six weeks for making submissions.  The State authority proposing a development will have an express legal duty to have regard to submissions received and must give public notice of its decision on whether it will proceed with the development.</P>
    <P>It was indicated at the time of enactment of the 1993 Act that development would be excluded from the scope of the planning Acts on security grounds only where this was unavoidable in the public interest.  The limited range of development to which Part XIII applies shows that this principle has been adhered to. We are now moving towards a situation in which, as and from 15 June, most development by Government Departments and the Office of Public Works will be subject to the full provisions of the planning Acts.</P>
    <P>Parts X and XIII of the regulations complete the movement towards greater openness for public development initiated by the 1993 Act and are ushering in an era of clearly established rights to know about and be involved with development by local and State authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the notice requirements for planning applications, Senators will be aware that, under the previous regulations, applicants generally had a choice <Col N="1313" /> between publishing notice of the application in a newspaper or erecting a notice on the site.  It has been suggested in the past that these arrangements did not necessarily ensure that people would learn of applications of relevance to them.  It was concluded, following careful consideration of the position and evaluation of various options, that applicants should be required both to publish newspaper notice and to erect a site notice. The choice between the two forms of notice has been removed, therefore, and both are required for any planning application that is received by a planning authority on or after 16 May.  These new requirements, taken together with the new provisions governing weekly lists, should ensure maximum public awareness of development proposals.  As a result interested persons and bodies will be able to fully utilise the extensive opportunities for participation in relation to development proposals which our planning system gives them.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities were already obliged, under the 1977 planning regulations, to produce a weekly list of planning applications received.  However, the 1994 regulations have extended this requirement and the list must now give details of applications decided, cases in which the planning authority receive further information and certain other information. This will make it considerably more informative and it will also be more widely available than hitherto, as it will have to be displayed in public libraries as well as in the planning authority's offices. In addition, copies have to be made available to interested persons and bodies, free of charge or for a reasonable fee. Apart from these mandatory requirements, it will also be open to an authority to put the list on display elsewhere or to publish it or make it available for publication in a newspaper.</P>
    <P>There is also a new requirement for An Bord Pleanála to publish a weekly list of planning appeals received and decided.  Like a planning authority's list of planning applications, the board's list will have to be available by the third working day following the week to which <Col N="1314" /> it relates.  The board's list will be displayed at its offices and copies will be made available to interested persons and bodies.</P>
    <P>A further change that has been made in the interests of openness and transparency is to require any submissions or observations made to a planning authority about a planning application to be made available for public inspection along with the other documents relating to the application.  There has been no legal obligation up to now to make these submissions or observations available and, in practice, only certain planning authorities have done so.  However, an applicant has a right to know of submissions made about his or her development proposals and the new provision will ensure that the applicant has access to them.</P>
    <P>The new measures are aimed at maximising public information about planning cases and reflect the principles of openness and transparency which form the foundations of many of the changes the new regulations introduce.  I hope that Senators will recognise that full account has been taken of the views on the public notice issue expressed in this House in recent years when planning Bills were under consideration.</P>
    <P>I will now discuss the provisions of the regulations dealing with exempted development.  Exempted development is development which does not need planning permission and is specified in section 4 of the 1963 Planning Act and in regulations made under that section.  The 1994 regulations update this area by ending some of the existing exemptions, placing restrictions on other exemptions and establishing some new categories of exempted development.</P>
    <P>The exemption for laying out and use of land as a golf course has been removed and any development of that nature commenced after 16 May will need planning permission.  This change has been made because the development of a golf course is significant in terms of the proper planning and development of the area concerned and should be subject to the full rigours of the planning process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> The regulations also establish a number of new restrictions on exemption which will be important from the conservation perspective.  Before the 1994 regulations, the demolition of any building other than a habitable house or a listed building could be carried out without planning permission.  There will no longer be an exemption, however, for demolition of a building which forms part of a terrace of buildings or which abuts another building in separate ownership. This will allow the development control process to pass judgment on the street-scape and other implications of demolition proposals affecting such buildings.</P>
    <P>A further restriction limits the exhibition of advertisements on listed buildings. Planning permission will be necessary for any advertisements, other than certain small signs, on these buildings. The planning process will adjudicate on the appropriateness of proposals to display advertisements on buildings which development plans have identified as being important for architectural or historical reasons.</P>
    <P>Among the other new restrictions is an overall limit of 25 square metres on the area of garages and sheds that can be built without planning permission in the curtilage of a house.  There were no limits on this exemption before the 1994 regulations. This sometimes caused problems because it was used to build large and obtrusive structures.  The regulations also put a height limit of 40 metres on navigational aids that may be built without planning permission.  This restriction was considered necessary because structures higher than this could have a significant impact on the landscape and should be subject to authorisation through the planning process.</P>
    <P>The new exemptions include the use of a house to accommodate up to six persons with a mental or physical disability and not more than two resident carers.  It was concluded that this use could not be regarded as significant in purely planning terms and should be possible without planning permission.  Among the other new exemptions are minor works by <Col N="1316" /> Government Departments and the Office of Public Works, such as provision of temporary structures in connection with visits of foreign dignitaries, maintenance of inland waterways, erection of certain minor structures, etc.  None of these forms of development is significant in terms of land use or proper planning and development.</P>
    <P>The regulations have also dealt with the position of television satellite dishes, which were not covered under the earlier regulations.  One satellite dish will be allowed on a house other than a listed building without planning permission. There will, however, be a size limit and restrictions as to where the dish may be placed, aimed at minimising visual obtrusiveness.  I am satisfied that the correct balance has been struck between visual amenity and the technical requirements for location of a dish.</P>
    <P>The new exemption which allows the use of up to four bedrooms in a house for bed and breakfast purposes without planning permission has attracted some attention.  I would like to take this opportunity to explain the background to the exemption and to respond to some of the unnecessary concerns that seem to have arisen.</P>
    <P>Until now, the planning code has not contained any provision in relation to bed and breakfast accommodation.  In practice, however, many such establishments have operated for long periods without planning permission.  Their planning status became an issue last year when An Bord Pleanála decided, as a result of a reference under section 5 of the Planning Act, 1963, that planning permission was required for the use of a particular house for bed and breakfast purposes.</P>
    <P>In legal terms this decision strictly related only to the particular case but in reality it created quite a degree of uncertainty about the planning status of bed and breakfast accommodation generally. For this reason, it was decided that a clarifying provision would have to be included in the new regulations which were then in preparation.  These allow the use of up to four bedrooms in a house <Col N="1317" /> for overnight guest accommodation as exempted development and planning permission will not be needed for such premises.</P>
    <P>However, the exemption will not apply if the bed and breakfast use would be contrary to a condition of the planning permission for the house, or be inconsistent with any use specified in the permission. Bed and breakfast operations of the scale covered will not have significant effects in terms of the proper planning and development of the areas in which they are located.  Moreover, the exemption will not change significantly the actual position which has obtained for many years.</P>
    <P>The exemption does not affect the application of other statutory requirements to bed and breakfast accommodation. For example, the fire safety and other requirements of the building control code will apply where there is a change of use of a house for bed and breakfast purposes.  In the same way, the application of the fire safety requirements of the Fire Services Act, 1981, to premises providing sleeping accommodation will not be affected.</P>
    <P>I am advised also that the requirements of the food hygiene regulations apply to any premises on which food is prepared for public consumption.  Bed arid breakfast operations, regardless of their planning status, will, therefore, have to observe proper hygiene standards.  In no way can it be said, therefore, that the new planning exemption means that there are no controls and standards for bed and breakfast premises.</P>
    <P>The changes affecting exemption from planning permission requirements are, in my view, a balanced and coherent set of measures.  They will facilitate the more effective operation of development controls, by concentrating on those developments which are of greatest consequence in land use terms.</P>
    <P>The new regulations are complemented by another initiative to improve openness and clarity in planning matters. This is a series of leaflets covering various aspects of the planning system.  The leaflets deal with a wide range of issues, <Col N="1318" /> such as completing an application form, the options available for commenting on planning issues, the planning requirements when building or extending a house and sectoral matters such as the planning requirements for farmers and business people.</P>
    <P>The series complements the leaflet on the new planning appeals process which was published following the Planning Act, 1992, and which helped to ensure the trouble-free changeover to the new appeal arrangements.  There was a great demand for that leaflet and this made clear the need for clear and readily available information on the planning process and its workings.</P>
    <P>The central objective in drawing up the new leaflets has been to set out the provisions of the planning code concisely and without any legal or technical jargon. The series is as complete as possible and deals with the questions most often asked by members of the public.  The leaflets will promote greater public understanding of the planning system, including the changes brought in by the 1994 regulations, and should help to ensure that there is nothing intimidating about the system.</P>
    <P>The demand for the leaflets since they were made available through planning authorities is a clear indication of people's interest in planning matters and underscores the importance of the many changes in the new regulations which are aimed at public information and participation.</P>
    <P>The 1994 regulations are a comprehensive response to the need to rationalise and modernise secondary planning legislation.  They will increase the effectiveness and transparency of the planning system.  Together with the new information leaflets, the regulations will make the system more understandable and accessible for those whom the system is intended to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am thankful for the opportunity to give my views on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994.  I approve of <Col N="1319" /> the vast majority of proposals enshrined in the document as I believe transparency should be the norm for public authorities. However I have reservations about certain aspects of the planning process as it stands.</P>
      <P>The public often believes local authorities alter development plans and rezone land for political or, it is implied, other reasons.  The plans are drawn up for a five year period initially and occasionally they run for 12 years.  Within that period towns tend to expand.  This must be taken into account in the plan. It is not written in stone and some flexibility for natural expansion must be allowed.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, in order to ensure the public does not misconstrue what happens, it is vital that there be utter transparency and that people are made fully aware of the process.  They must be given an opportunity to see the rezoning plan, which must be conveniently available. They should not have to seek it out concealed in corners of councils or corporations.</P>
      <P>With regard to exempted developments, it is commendable that there will be regulations for the accommodation visitors may expect.  Young people who arrive in this country, or from one part of Ireland to another, often cannot afford the expensive accommodation provided by the major outlets.  Perhaps there is a race meeting, a concert or a festival when they arrive.  It is only natural that people would open extra bedrooms to facilitate these people.  In this way they can earn badly needed money perhaps to keep their children in college or to pay medical expenses.  However anyone providing accommodation at any time should be subject to controls so that minimum standards of fire safety, hygiene and quality are maintained.  It must also be said that life in urban residential areas will radically alter when people go to bed and breakfast locations; there could be problems associated with traffic and with parking.  I welcome the Minister's statement about the regulations which will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> As a councillor I must refer to the use of section 4 motions with regard to planning.  The press has highlighted recent local government reform and it has created the impression that by leaving section 4 motions in operation, county councillors have been given great powers.  Section 4 motions are being looked upon as secret and powerful weapons. However, it is time the facts in relation to the section 4 motion and its application to planning were clearly identified and explained to the public.</P>
    <P>It is more difficult to put a section 4 motion on the agenda now because two thirds of the councillors from a specific area must sign it.  A section 4 motion now needs a two thirds plus one majority in order to be passed, while heretofore only three councillors needed to sign it and a simple majority was sufficient to pass it. Councillors are reluctant to introduce a section 4 motion to their respective councils and a decision is taken only after careful deliberation and consultation. When section 4 motions with regard to planning are passed by a county council, the decision taken by the councillors should be allowed to stand.  However, that is not the situation.  Despite the fact that councillors have the right to bring in a section 4 motion, and have voted for it and passed it, the county manager still has the final word.  After consultation with his legal experts, he does not need to implement a section 4 motion.</P>
    <P>The recent discussions and press headlines with regard to the great power which councillors have as a result of section 4 motions are grossly exaggerated.  As a councillor who has experience of the use of section 4 motions and their implementation and non-implementation, I hope my statements will dispel the belief which exists among many people that a section 4 motion is an almighty process.  That is not the case because the last word on all planning permissions, regardless of whether they go through the ordinary process or through a section 4 motion, is given to the county manager.</P>
    <P>Afforestation is an important area which must be brought within the scope of the planning regulations.  At present <Col N="1321" /> any individual can plant 200 hectares, which is the equivalent of 500 acres, without planning permission or the requirement to undertake an environmental impact study.  That is a substantial area of land and if this continues we will lose many of our beautiful scenic views because the trees will screen the horizon and cloud the sky.  One must apply for planning permission to erect a bed and breakfast sign and get a licence to operate that business, yet one can plant up to 500 acres of land without getting planning permission.  This imbalance is open to speculation.  Anyone from outside the country, whether he is a millionaire or not, can purchase thousands of acres of land and if they plant under 500 acres a year, they do not need planning permission. This means that in a ten year period anyone could plant upwards of 5,000 acres of trees without planning permission in a scenic area and this would block many scenic views.  This goes beyond all reasonable criteria.</P>
    <P>The IFA has expressed the view that planting over one acre should necessitate planning permission.  I suggest that planting over ten acres should require planning permission because this would give small planters an opportunity to work. However, the planting of trees should be confined to marginal land.  It is a pity to see productive agricultural land being planted with trees, although people are entitled to do as they wish with their land. Trees should only be planted in areas where there are good access roads because those trees will be brought from the plantation areas to the various depots.  There should be a firm obligation on people who bring trees in large quantities from plantation areas to repair the roads when they are finished their work. I hope the Minister will outline his Department's policy with regard to afforestation and planning permission.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell me &mdash; and this is of interest to many councillors around the country &mdash; if the final word on planning permissions, with regard to section 4 motions, will remain with county councillors.  At present the county manager still has the right to exercise his <Col N="1322" /> executive function.  I do not agree with that.</P>
    <P>Notice of planning applications, fógra atá curtha ar an áit ina bhfuil siad a chur anseo, seem popular and simple, but these cause many problems and could prove impossible to maintain, given the level of vandalism and possible deliberate damage which may take place.  It is proposed to put these notices on display for one month.  However, what happens if the notice disappears for a day or a week? Who will know it is constantly on display? These questions must be answered before proceeding with this proposal.  Given that the planning proposals can sometimes be difficult and sensitive, this requirement is bound to lead to complicated legal actions, with subsequent long delays involving increased public expenditure.</P>
    <P>People seeking planning permission should be treated fairly, particularly if, as a result of an error, they leave out information on their planning applications. The council does not seek this information or write to the applicant until a decision is due to be made about the planning application, approximately eight weeks after the application has been made.  Then it will write to the applicant and there will be another few weeks delay before the information is received.  This could continue for another eight weeks until a decision is made.  This is grossly unfair to the applicant who has paid his or her money to apply for planning permission. Sufficient staff should be made available to all the councils to immediately check applications.  If further information is required, the council should get in touch with the applicant within two weeks of lodging the application.  This would be a positive step and would be welcomed by many people who find themselves in this position.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will respond because this affects many people.  If one applies for planning permission and a query needs to be answered, the council does not seek the information until the decision is about to be made.  It then writes to the applicant who must spend a few more weeks trying to get someone, a planner or an engineer, to deal with the <Col N="1323" /> matter.  The applicant then sends it back again and it may take eight more weeks before a final decision is made.  This is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>It is also unfair from the point of view of councillors, who are entitled to submit prior notice of planning permission and who are given an idea of the decision before it is granted.  However, that decision may not be issued until a day or two before it is made.  This morning as I was about to leave for Dublin, I got a telephone call from my county council in regard to prior notice of planning permission which I submitted.  I was told that it was due to be decided today.  I was supposed to get in touch with the planning applicant &mdash; be a type of superman-and try to get him to go into the council to extend the time on the operation.  This is grossly unfair to councillors.</P>
    <P>Councillors should be given an answer to prior notice motions at least seven days before a decision is taken.  We are busy people involved in legislation and we should be given the opportunity to get in touch with the constituent to give them an opportunity to extend the time so that further discussion may take place in the planning process.  These are important issues, which are specific to councillors throughout the country.  Given that the Minister is fair-minded, I hope he will respond positively to representations I have made, not as a Senator but as a member of a county council where the planning process come up day in day out.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I am glad we are debating this today.  On the Order of Business last week, I posed a question to the Leader of the House requesting that the Local Government Planning and Development Regulations, 1994, be debated.  I appreciate that he has moved with haste and that we now have the opportunity to debate this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government Planning and Development Regulations, 1994, are an important initiative in the planning process. They bring planning legislation up to date and establish new procedures, <Col N="1324" /> particularly in regard to public notices and consultation.  In addition, there are new regulations for State or local authorities which wish to go ahead with construction work.  The regulations as presented have many advantages and, by and large, they are welcome.</P>
    <P>Some have said &mdash; this has been raised at local authority level &mdash; that they make the planning process more difficult as regards further information, notice and the extension of regulations to new areas. The public and local representatives are, by and large, tied up with regulation after regulation.  Some would say this country is over regulated in many areas. However, they are important for the protection of the environment.  The Minister and the Government have a responsibility to respond to the public's demand to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>As regards the implementation of the planning process and planning regulations, I question the personal point of view of planners.  It is inappropriate that someone's personal opinion, which is often petty, may be imposed on the public by certain &ldquo;copy book&rdquo; planners. Recently this has been taken to an extreme, something which did not happen before.  I do not believe that planners, those who come from planning schools or colleges, have the wealth of opinion they say they have.  In many cases local people have a better understanding of an area and how it should be developed than those who look at it from a &ldquo;copy book&rdquo; point of view.</P>
    <P>Some planners will try to impose their opinion on a planning application for a simple house in a remote area, despite the fact the applicant has in most cases given £200 or £330 to an architect, a surveyor or someone who draws plans to produce a set of plans which they have discussed with their family and are happy to put before the council as the type of building they wish to proceed with.  In most cases planners will not accept them. They will impose or attempt to impose changes, ranging from the size of a window to the capping on a chimney. Often these are petty reasons for excluding or altering a plan.  There should be a <Col N="1325" /> regulation from the Department of the Environment in regard to this activity. Planners from planning schools do not have a monopoly on opinion.  It is inappropriate for them to impose their opinions on the petty areas I spoke about. They should pay attention to matters of public importance.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McDonagh when he said that forestry should come under the planning process.  We could say &mdash; and the Minister probably will &mdash; it comes under the planning process, but we all know that is at a stage where it may impinge or have serious repercussion on the environment.  Some 500 acres of forest is too much without planning permission. It is inappropriate that anyone should be able to plant 500 acres without going through the planning process.  That matter should be looked at and changed. Regulations and planning law should be brought in to regulate forestry development.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern to many people, particularly to road users, is the new method of making and feeding silage.  It is time to look at this farm development.  In most cases the old system of making silage on a slab and feeding it off that slab or from a feeding bay came under the planning process. We now have the baled silage system and bales may be located in various places. That is not the main problem, although seepage may occur and wells and other water streams may be affected.  The main problem relates to the feeding of silage. Baled silage is brought along country roads on tractors.  In some cases it is fed on the side of the road to cattle who are on the other side of the wall in the field. Many of our country roads and lanes are now damaged to the extent that some of them are practically impassable.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that people must make a living and feed their stock, but it is inappropriate for us to spend massive amounts of money on a road and then to abuse that road.  In many cases farmers travel along the country lanes and roads when they could cross their land with the same tractors and silage.  If they did they <Col N="1326" /> would cut up the land so they move along the roads instead.  They leave trails of silage and trails of destruction in many cases along our country roads and lanes. That method of feeding baled silage should be examined.  Regulations should be brought in to protect the public in this matter.  We have a responsibility to the road using public to have that matter brought under some type of control.</P>
    <P>Another area where State bodies seem to be of the opinion that they can impose on the public is in regard to the construction of pylon lines by the ESB.  In the north east there is a major objection to that type of development at a time when it is nearly impossible to get a planning application in certain areas.  There is now a proposal to run a pylon which will impinge on the skyline of one third of the area.  That type of development is inappropriate.  It is not allowed in many other countries around the world.  It must also be examined in this country and should be regulated.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the National Roads Authority in regard to the construction of national primary and secondary routes?  In the past county councils decided where to build a road.  I am not sure what the regulations will be in the future.  I would like to see a situation where the local authorities involved still had a say in this matter because motorways and national primary and secondary routes can impinge on the lives of the public and can prove to be not environmentally friendly.  I would like the Minister to comment on that when he replies.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the regulations are welcome.  They are a necessary tidying up operation.  This is an ongoing process to try to bring unity and transparency to the whole system.  I am very pleased that documents are now to be made available to the public.  I am glad that this is clearly stated, because in some local authorities there has been confusion for years in this matter.  One county manager will object and not make documents available until the appeal stage when the matter had gone to An Bord Pleanála and a subsequent manager will say he has no problem <Col N="1327" /> at all with it and will make documents available to an applicant if there is an objection.  It is important that those matters are cleared up and that the public know where they stand.  The planning process is ongoing and there are a number of areas that still need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>There is public concern about everything that happens.  If we have a situation where people find that the environment is being damaged and that we as Members of the Oireachtas are not in a position to make decisions that protect the environment and the scenery, then we will not be doing our job and the public will say that we are not doing the work we were elected to do.</P>
    <P>An opportunity to debate these regulations is important.  It also gives us the opportunity of talking about the whole planning process.  We may find that there are some deficiencies.  As far as I am concerned, there are.  In a debate like this, where Members of the House have an opportunity to contribute, the Minister can get the views of this House, take them back to his officials and hopefully in the near future further regulations will be brought in to cover some of the areas that have been debated here today and that will be debated in other fora at local authority level and possibly in the other House over the coming weeks and months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning is a very thorny issue for many people.  I was the instigator of the first section 4 in our county after 16 years as a member of a local authority.  Many of my colleagues who were a lot older than myself, with a lot more experience, attempted or threatened to do so on a number of occasions, but they never carried it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few matters I wish to mention during this debate on planning.  A couple of things that have happened in the recent past are welcome.  One is that the Office of Public Works have to make applications to the planning authority for permission to build particular premises. If and when any Members have the <Col N="1328" /> opportunity to drive into Kells, County Meath, and look at where the Office of Public Works built a Garda station, beside the historic church of St. Colmcille in Kells, they will see that this was a situation where interference with an historic building was not taken into consideration. A number of other speakers have mentioned the way the planners would like to see Ireland developing. Many of them are of the opinion that rural Ireland should not be turned into a series of housing estates, with long rows of houses on every county road in the country.  We, as a county close to the city, have that problem.  But the other side of that story must be taken into consideration.  In cases where families have lived and grown up in an area and they want planning permission for their sons or daughters on the family land, it is most difficult for those applicants to be successful.  Many members of local authorities find it frustrating that these applicants are not dealt with more fairly. One of the reasons my colleagues ended up reviewing the county development plan two years before it was due to be reviewed was to give those people some favourable consideration within the planning laws and regulations.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Senator McDonagh in regard to the point he made about applications.  After eight weeks, on the second last day they can do this, planners send out notification for further information. This is extremely unfair to the applicant.  The problem exists because of the huge number of applications that come in on a daily basis to most of our local authorities.  A direction should come from the Department of the Environment that these applications should be vetted.  An engineer should take a quick look at them and if further information is required it should be sought long before the eight weeks are up.  I argue this all the time with our planners in County Meath and I am saying nothing here that I have not said to them.</P>
    <P>There is also a difference in the way rules and regulations are dealt with in different counties.  Some counties are accepting new septic tank systems and <Col N="1329" /> other counties are not.  The council officials or the planners will not accept them for individual applicants, yet if there are problems with county council housing schemes where septic tanks are not working this is the first solution suggested. This is where the problem of inconsistency arises.  The greatest argument I have had over the last few years with the former county manager and the planners was about the inconsistency of decisions.  If consistency applied to everyone in the county there would not be a great deal to complain about.</P>
    <P>When the inconsistency becomes more and more evident people approach their public representatives complaining that they are not getting planning permission while others are and there is no other solution but the section 4 motion.  Admittedly, the former Minister made it that little bit more difficult when the simple majority was deemed no longer sufficient. In respect of the last number of section 4 applications in County Meath &mdash; and they got fewer &mdash; as far as single developments are concerned, the majority of members vote in favour on the basis of the argument put forward. We cannot all be wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the light of these regulations the Minister and his Department will see there is consistency between counties so far as individuals are concerned for once-off housing.  I do not believe there is consistency.  Some planners take the view that a two storey house, for example, cannot be built because it might destroy the landscape and only a bungalow is allowed.  Such applications can be held up for months and planners are up to their eyes dealing with backlogs of applications because further information was required.</P>
    <P>There is a controversy in County Meath in respect of a forestry development of 600 or 700 acres.  I would not be totally in favour of allowing such a large development without planning permission. There are many areas of poor land in the country from which we may get a return with afforestation.  We must do something about afforestation and ensure that the timber can be processed <Col N="1330" /> here.  Afforestation should be allowed on a reasonable area of land &mdash; perhaps 50 or 60 or 100 acres depending on the land and its location &mdash; but planning permission should be required when an individual is looking to afforest a large area.</P>
    <P>There is no point going into the names of individuals involved in events, etc. because we may get tied up as they are in the other House.  We are above that in this House, as the Cathaoirleach told me on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Office of Public Works will have to make application for planning permission.  If an individual is refused permission for a two storey house which would be intrusive on the landscape and the scenery, why is the Office of Public Works given permission to put up a metal bridge to bring visitors across the Boyne?  The planners have agreed to that project in one of the most beautiful areas of the country.  It has now gone to An Bord Pleanála but I doubt if anyone will oppose it.  If an individual wanted to build a house in the same location which would be intrusive on the landscape they would be refused permission for the reasons I have given.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem with planning is inconsistency.  I would like the Minister's view on the way people look at applications differently, making section 4 applications necessary to ensure fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As a tidy up operation these regulations will be welcomed by all, in particular those involved in the planning process, whether public representatives or those making submissions or producing plans to put to county councils.  In this context a tidying up operation was much needed and I congratulate all involved.  I also welcome the series of leaflets produced by the Department, which we in Limerick received at the council meeting last Friday.  I have only perused two or three of them but they are useful to elected representatives because they answer every question that might be asked about the planning process.  Each county councillor and each Senator should be supplied with a quantity of these leaflets.  One may give such leaflets <Col N="1331" /> away not realising that one has none left; there should be a ready supply of them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of these regulations which is to ensure greater transparency in all aspects of planning.  Many will welcome that a local authority's works will be subject to a certain degree of scrutiny.  I understand that it would be illogical for a county council to apply to itself for planning permission.  However, this procedure should allow the public a greater role in voicing its opinions which will have to be taken on board by the management of the county council and passed to the members for their consideration.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter at a recent housing committee meeting of Limerick County Council and we discovered that it could lead to quite a delay in getting our housing programme off the ground. We first have to wait for the permission from the Department to plan for the houses; we then have to wait to see where those houses will be built and that has to be put to the council for approval.  Some of the proposals will involve a series of houses and that will have to involve a process of public consultation.  We will then have to wait for a period of a month while the public makes its comments.  The management has to have time to gather all the submissions and report to the council.  One can envisage months of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it necessary for management to report back to the council as a council or would it suffice for it to report back as a committee?  County councils have statutory monthly meetings while a committee meeting can be called at much shorter notice and the matter can then be dealt with more speedily.  If there is no objection to the proposal, one has to go to tender and then there are more delays; many housing schemes could be delayed until September.  Anyone with knowledge of the construction business knows that September is not the time to start building houses.  June or July is a better time to avoid the bad weather.  If construction work starts in September and it rains, the houses will not be completed <Col N="1332" /> before next May or June.  People on our housing lists are crying out for houses.  It is difficult to explain this delay when they are living in mobile homes and in damp and poor conditions.  Could the Minister highlight ways to get around these delays that will be built into the system?</P>
    <P>I welcome the insistence on site and newspaper notices.  I worked in a planning office for a while and it amused us if we saw newspaper notices coming in as Ghaeilge in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The <i>Irish Times</i> would not be as popular in certain parts of west Limerick as it would be in parts of Dublin &mdash; but we always knew there was something strange about planning applications that issued in this manner.  Someone was always trying to hide their true intentions in such applications. At least that practice will now be overcome.  There were many ruses used when displaying the notices on the site. These notices are supposed to be on the site and easy to read.  This may be the case if one is ten feet tall and can read microscopic print.  Some planning applications were displayed in awkward positions. The insistence on newspaper advertisements will overcome those trying to get around the system.</P>
    <P>I am a little worried with the wording &mdash; it may be phrased differently in the regulations &mdash;&ldquo;The applicant can now see submissions or observations that are made about planning applications.&rdquo; What is meant by &ldquo;observations&rdquo;?  Does it mean that if I, as a public representative, call the planning officer and inform him that a certain planning application is not a good idea, it will be noted, inserted in a file and used as evidence that I have objected to a planning application when all I have done is made a query?  People get upset if they think someone is objecting to, or even looking at, their planning application.  Although a person has the right to see who has been looking at their application, one should also have the right to get information on a certain application without exposing oneself to the ire of the applicant.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the exemptions in these regulations.  For example, anybody wishing <Col N="1333" /> to knock down a house adjoining a terrace or other house will now have to seek planning permission.  The practice of demolishing neighbouring houses often causes structural damage to adjoining houses and their owners have no means of redress.  Now those involved have the right to ensure an engineer's report is provided and the demolition is done to their satisfaction.  In older houses, since the masonry connected them to each other it is difficult to knock down one house without causing major damage to the adjoining one.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that major development works, like golf courses, will now need planning permission.  I have nothing against golf courses but they are a major development and ought to be subject to a planning authority.  I agree with the Senators that there is a need to subject large acreages of forestry to planning permission. Someone living on half an acre of land in the countryside could find themselves surrounded by trees &mdash; some of these species, especially spruce, can grow rapidly &mdash; and a person could be hemmed in by a forestry development.  If a landowner was to erect a wall ten foot high around the perimeter of a dwelling, one would have grounds for complaint and would be justified in demanding that the landowner seek planning permission. As matters stand at present, that landowner could plant trees that could grow up to 30 feet around a dwelling and there is nothing anybody could do about it. Major research has been done on the effect these large acreages of forestry have on a wide variety of environmental aspects.  They may not only affect the view but also the watercourses, wildlife and micro-climate of an area.  The development of any area over ten acres should require planning permission.  Any forestry in close proximity to a dwellinghouse not belonging to the owner of the forest should also be subject to planning scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I agree with the regulation stipulating that for retention of unauthorised development, a fee of 1.5 times the normal rate should be levied.  This device is used by some people building an extension, <Col N="1334" /> who then blithely ask for planning permission.  By doing that, they have short circuited much of the planning process. Few planning authorities would wish to create a major public fuss by demanding that the extension should be knocked down.  If it is an extension to a shop or a retail premises, it will then be in use.  Why should one person have to expose themselves to all manners of objections while another does not?  This fee is not excessive but will be enough of a sting to make people realise that it will not cost them as much if they do things the right way.</P>
    <P>This tidying up operation is long overdue. I welcome this move towards greater transparency and accountability in our planning authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome many of these improvements, especially where planning permission shall not be needed for use of a house as a residence for up to six people with mental or physical disabilities. This is a good regulation, because when the health board of which I was a member attempted to locate houses in the community and get people out of mental hospitals and other large institutions, it encountered considerable hassle in the early stages from objectors. I am pleased that in the interests of the disabled such activity no longer requires planning permission and that health boards and those involved in voluntary groups dealing with the physically and mentally handicapped can acquire or rent a suitable house.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that a similar regulation was not included regarding the housing of itinerants because this is another group which is difficult to house as there are always many objections.  This group should be included in our planning laws.  Perhaps there should be a regulation allowing for the housing of one or two itinerant families in an area without applying for planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transparency evident in the regulations is to be welcomed.  Such transparency is deemed to be in the public interest.  In this respect the local authorities represent local communities and <Col N="1335" /> they are elected by the people of a county, but unfortunately when they make a democratic decision any one person can object.  Given this, my own local authority in County Sligo has a good system to deal with section 4 applications and has had such a system for some years. It has a planning committee which examines the proposed site and evaluates the proposed development.  There must then be unanimous decision by the committee that planning permission be given. Following this, the section 4 application is then lodged and signed by all parties comprising the local authority.</P>
    <P>Recently I dealt with a case where a man with five or six sons had bought a good bit of land and wished to give a son a site to farm the land.  He was refused planning permission and the planning committee processed a section 4 application. Following this a gentleman from An Taisce objected.  Despite the fact that the land was in a country area on a holding of approximately 60 acres on the side of a mountain, An Bord Pleanála agreed with An Taisce that it was located in a scenic area and that the house for which planning permission was sought would spoil the scenery.  In response to this decision I ask: which is more important, fancy views or families?  There is nothing as nice as people in the countryside.</P>
    <P>There is some hypocrisy on this issue. There is criticism at the absence of people in rural Ireland and that people are leaving the west of Ireland.  Many people are leaving because they cannot get planning permission to build houses for their sons and daughters.  That is why transparency on this issue is required.</P>
    <P>I recall attending a large meeting regarding a development of four houses. A lawyer informed the meeting that it would not be possible to object to the development on legal grounds as it was within the planning regulations. However, he advised that those opposing the development could make it so expensive for the developers, simply by objecting through the legal process, that they would be obliged to pull out.  This is the attitude of people who object.  When <Col N="1336" /> a developer is within the law and they do not like the proposed development they take action of this kind.  This case was brought to the High Court and appealed to the Supreme Court.  The developers won the case in the end, but at enormous expense.</P>
    <P>There is little thought given to those who put down the money for developments. This is regrettable, because such people should have some rights.  The seven small industries in my village of Grange could not be built today, despite the fact that there are 200 people employed by them.  For example, a meat factory in the village which employs 30 people could not be built today because the cost of environmental impact studies and so on would make it too expensive. Yet this factory has been in existence for the past 30 years, has not caused any problems and all in the village are pleased with the employment it has provided.</P>
    <P>Requirements, such as an environmental impact study, are new whiz kid ideas and are putting planning permission out of the reach of people.  I met a young man who was interested in setting up a business.  He established a concern in the food business in a small town and endeavoured to open a shop.  He had to apply for planning permission for change of use in the shop premises he acquired.  In the process he was sent from Billy to Jack for licences and so on.  At the end of three months he advised me that he had terminated the venture as he had received no cooperation. He was fired with enthusiasm but, discouraged, he went on the dole. Why should he set up a venture, given all the hassle he was put to?</P>
    <P>There is much talk about unemployment and job creation.  However, as soon as somebody decides to create jobs, obstacles are put forward.  For example, someone objects that a proposed venture is part of a dirty industry.  When the objector is asked to advise on a clean industry he says he is not aware of any, but that they exist and they should be sought out.  This is a negative attitude.</P>
    <P>There should be planning regulations and planning laws, but there is a danger of going over the top on these matters. <Col N="1337" /> In this respect section 4 applications should be sacrosanct and there should be no going back on them.  If a county council decides that a developer may proceed that should be the end of the matter, but regrettably it is not.  Newspapers and others create a fuss around section 4. However, this means nothing, because any person can object to a planning application in Grange, County Sligo, which they need never have seen, heard or known of.  Such people will get all the publicity, their views will be taken into account and the process then goes to An Bord Pleanála and so on.</P>
    <P>This attitude is creating much unemployment and is killing the entrepreneurial spirit.  The House will shortly address the issue of community employment, but it is difficult for people to create community employment given the way they are hamstrung at present.  The Minister should seriously consider these difficulties.  In this respect, where section 4 applications are made they should proceed as intended.</P>
    <P>If there is belief in democracy and majority decision, the county councils in Ireland are the only bodies which are representative of all shades of opinion in their respective counties.  All those on these councils stood on a public platform and were elected by secret ballot.  They consist of unemployed, employed, teachers, lawyers and those from the entire spectrum of society.  If such a body makes an unanimous decision, where can a more democratic decision be made?  Dictatorship appears from some small groups which object to a planning application, with no rights only their own and no mandate from anybody but themselves.</P>
    <P>Planning is a difficult issue and it is very hard to satisfy everybody.  However, there must be rules and regulations which marry industry, environment and so on. It is an issue that must be viewed with an open mind.  Many environmentalists are good, sound people, but they are afflicted with tunnel vision.  They see the environment and nothing else.  However, there is much more than the environment involved.  There are many young people <Col N="1338" /> who must make a living and we must keep them at home.  One recently appointed county manager told his staff that within three weeks he wanted to know what was happening in relation to planning because the county council should be the development organisation for the county and planning applications should be decided on within a month.  As a number of speakers have said, planning officials have written to applicants for more information on the date by which decisions were due.  They also say they had to issue replies on certain dates because the time was up but we were not informed of this a week in advance.</P>
    <P>We must get our act together to ensure we do not adopt a negative attitude which inhibits or prevents progress and development.  We must promote development, industry and work.  My own village is a good example.  Not one of its factories would obtain planning permission today because the cost of planning applications and environmental impact studies would break their hearts. Some 25 years ago I could say to people who wanted to build sheds to do so and that I would get them planning permission. An engineer would be asked to look at where the sheds were being built and would give a verbal opinion that he saw no problems.  This is the way things were done 25, 30 and 40 years ago.  I challenge people to look at the industries in those towns and say what is wrong with them today.</P>
    <P>I have heard people say we have too many houses in north Sligo on the side of Benbulben.  These houses are nicely landscaped and are part of the environment. It is the only part of County Sligo which has increases in population and industry and no shortage of employment. If we did not allow building and development to take place, this area would be deserted, like many other parts of the country.  We must ensure planning regulations are adhered to but we must help those who are trying to develop the area and provide work.  I know of one man who threw in the towel and went on the dole.  We should not introduce regulations which discourage people to <Col N="1339" /> such an extent.  We must encourage an entrepreneurial, enterprising society; and we must get our planning system in order so that this can happen as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am optimistic. Despite the political divide in this House, it strikes me that the urban rural divide disappears when we discuss matters relating to local authorities.  All Members who are members of local authorities have experienced the most ridiculous degrees of frustration.  This applies whether one represents a rural or an urban area.  I particularly welcome the changes as they affect local authorities.  It is necessary and long overdue that a local authority should give notice of developments in its administrative area.  I also welcome the fact that officials have to prepare a report which they must submit to the elected members but I would have been happier if this report needed the sanction or consent of the elected members before its recommendations were implemented. The Minister may be able to tell me if this is possible; it is not included in the regulations.</P>
      <P>I am amused at the Minister's statement that a development carried out by a local authority in its own functional area does not require planning permission. There is a huge presumption here that if a local authority applied to itself for permission it would automatically get it.  There is a further presumption that a local authority's actions would always be in accordance with planning regulations and the proper planning and development of an area.  However, there is a huge inconsistency in what local authorities are doing throughout Ireland. There is an inconsistency in decisions.  I can cite numerous examples in my area of Dublin where applications for development by our adjoining local authority, Dublin Corporation, would have raised questions in my mind if they had been made by private developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 500 local authority houses in a small, slightly remote area of Blanchardstown which <Col N="1340" /> were built five, six or seven years ago. There is nothing spectacular about this except that when the action plan for this area was being drawn up, it was intended that it would be a parish and would be served by a road.  This made sense. However, the nearer part of the parish was not developed and the housing construction took place in the furthermost part.  These 500 houses are served by a substandard bridge.  To cross it as a pedestrian or, more dangerously, to push a baby in a pram over it, would involve taking one's life in one's hands because it is used mostly by heavy articulated trucks.  Yet, planning permission was given for the building of these houses.  If an application was made for this purpose by anyone other than a local authority, it would not have been granted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the regulation that reports will be given to local authority members but I am worried &mdash; maybe from my experience as a local authority member &mdash; that this will generate additional paperwork and reporting and the management will see this as another chore to be done before they proceed with what they intended to do anyway.  How strong will the regulation be?  If it is not backed up by the need for consent by members, it may not be very strong.  The Minister mentioned the power councillors have under section 3 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, but I would point out to him that attempts by members of my local authority to use this power have been frustrated because the manager cited different legislation to get around it.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell referred to halting sites.  I agree with him.  My local authority has tried to provide facilities for travellers in Dublin.  The then Dublin County Council proposed to put 85 travelling families in a field with facilities such as running water and toilets.  To me this is not good planning and development and involves ghettoisation.  When we attempted to use section 3 to reduce the size of the development, we were told we did not have the power to do so and the manager cited the 1988 Housing Act, which he claimed gave him powers to <Col N="1341" /> provide emergency accommodation for people in need.  I am sceptical and worried that the safeguards which the Minister is genuinely trying to put in place will not produce the effect intended by him.</P>
    <P>I wish that some of the learned journalists who produced pages and volumes during the course of the County Dublin development plan, which was given huge coverage, were sitting in this Chamber to hear the arguments made by Members on all sides that local authority members, because of their local knowledge, would not embark on rezoning proposals or section 4 motions unless they knew they were sound.  Local authority members have to face the electorate, unlike managers and journalists.  They have to defend decisions and if they are indefensible they do not deserve to be reelected. Their non-election would be one of the effects of bad decisions.  However, planners do not have to face the electorate. There was a huge controversy about the development plan in Dublin because planners embarked on a particular course of action ten years ago and decided on a settlement strategy.  They could not admit that that settlement strategy might be flawed and members decided to take matters into their own hands.</P>
    <P>The only place in Ireland to have a task force on urban crime is Clondalkin, County Dublin, an area which was devised and designed by planning experts.  It has been said that professionals and technicians designed the <i>Titanic,</i> but Noah who built the ark was just an ordinary Joe Soap without any of that expertise.  It should not be presumed that experts know best, as has been said over and over again.</P>
    <P>A settlement strategy for the three county towns in Dublin meant that an adjoining local authority bought huge tracts of land for public housing.  If that was good planning and development, if it would have my support.  However, if it was good planning and development, could the Minister explain why Dublin Corporation is now selling off at a frightening rate the land which was purchased <Col N="1342" /> for housing?  If this was a settlement strategy involving a mixture of local authority and private housing with a good social balance, why is that local authority selling off its land bank in County Dublin?  Our local authority came forward with the exact same reports on every attempt to change the usage of land in the county and the managers refused it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is in these regulations that the planners should receive dictates in relation to the planning and development of urban areas.  The parking of lorries in urban areas is an absolute nightmare and headache for communities, which complain to me regularly. I do not know if the Minister has drawn up regulations for that.</P>
    <P>I live in Blanchardstown, which is one of these new satellite towns.  It is larger than most of the areas which were referred to today, with the possible exception of Limerick, which Senator Kelly represents.  However, we do not have a public toilet in Blanchardstown. We do not have one area where a mother can change her child's nappy.  Large housing estates have been constructed without footpaths.  If young families are moved to suburban areas it seems quite obvious that they will produce children. Those children will have to be pushed in buggies unless one is lucky enough to have a car, which many people living there do not.  I do not know how that is stitched into planning regulations.  Small shopping centres, housing estates, pubs and bookies shops have been built and yet there has not been a requirement for one public toilet in all of that.  That is supposed to be good planning and development.  Those developments were not section 4 or rezonings but were done by the paid planners for the area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for a public notice requirement and I agree with Senator Kelly that it was ludicrous to see notices appearing in <i>The Irish Times</i> as Gaeilge and so on.</P>
    <P>With reference to listed buildings, the Minister can make all the restrictions he likes but buildings will still disappear overnight without planning permission. It has happened in my own area and will <Col N="1343" /> continue to do so.  I ask the Minister to impose a penalty on the owners of listed buildings which disappear overnight.  I am suspicious when a listed building disappears overnight and then a housing application is made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other exempted developments, I would sound a note of caution in relation to the B&amp;B situation. Throughout the seaside villages of north County Dublin, which I also represent, there is a fear among people who have invested a great deal of money, gone through the planning process and complied with all the regulations and requirements that these developments will spring up overnight, with very little regulation, and put them out of business.</P>
    <P>Another point I mentioned to the Minister for the Environment is that Dublin city and county has a huge problem with homeless young people.  The emergency provisions to deal with that are that young people are being put into bed and breakfast accommodation. There is a huge fear among residents of suburban housing estates that accommodation for homeless people will spring up &mdash; perhaps a result of necessity but certainly not through good planning and design &mdash; throughout these estates, with people making spare bedrooms available for bed and breakfast and the health boards placing vulnerable young people in that accommodation.  I am sure that is not what the Minister intended by this exemption, but I sound a word of caution.</P>
    <P>My only other suggestion is that if it were possible &mdash; I know that it is not constitutional but I am going to say it anyway &mdash; for the track record of a developer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am almost finished. It is not possible to take the track record of a developer into account when granting planning permission.  That is a shame.  I would like to take the Minister <Col N="1344" /> around parts of County Dublin to see the mess &mdash; the unfinished housing estates, the lack of public lighting, the lack of footpaths &mdash; which has been the inheritance of people who paid good money to developers who went bust overnight, set up as a new company the next morning and applied for planning permission.  The elected members recommended refusal because we knew that company X had become company Y overnight.  We continue to be told by the manager that it is not possible to take the track record of a developer into account when deciding on planning permission.  I do not know how the Minister can address it.  We did it under the compensation legislation.  I think that the Minister must look at it again.  Other than that, I welcome the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank the Senators for their contributions. My responsibility for environmental protection makes me particularly aware of the need for effective development control procedures which can subject projects to careful scrutiny of their strengths and weaknesses. The 1994 regulations will improve both the efficiency and the effectiveness of the planning system.</P>
      <P>A number of issues were raised which I will deal with quickly.  Senator McDonagh referred to the need for control over matters such as fire safety in guest accommodation. The new exemption is only concerned with planning permission requirements and will not detract in any way from the application of other statutory requirements, such as building regulations, the Fire Services Act and health and hygiene regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran and other Senators referred to the planning controls for forestry development.  The controls over forestry development are being reviewed at present by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Hyland.  My Department will be consulted about the planning and environmental aspects and I will bring the concerns with Senators <Col N="1345" /> expressed today on this matter to those people.</P>
    <P>Section 4 was mentioned.  I was a member of Wexford County Council for 13 years and we never had a section 4, whereas some counties seem to have a great deal of them.  There was much criticism in the past.  However, it has been clarified on a number of occasions in court cases that a manager has to comply with the terms of a section 4 resolution unless it would require the manager to do something which is not legally permissible. That whole area has also been questioned from time to time.  However, if the manager is satisfied that it is illegal to implement a section 4, then he has the power to object to it.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh was also somewhat dubious about the practicality of the new site notice requirements for planning applications, as were a number of other Senators.  This requirement is not an unreasonable burden on applicants.  It will, however, require them to ensure that the notice is kept in place for one month and is replaced or renewed if it becomes illegible or is defaced or removed.  The onus is on the applicant to ensure that the site notice is there for a month.</P>
    <P>With regard to the time taken to deal with planning applications, I agree with Senator McDonagh, Senator Farrelly and others that applications should be processed without delay.  It concerns me that some councils write to applicants seeking further information a couple of days before the eight weeks are up.  This stifles development and progress and can cause problems for job creation.</P>
    <P>My Department has, on many occasions, impressed on local authorities the need to deal speedily with applications so that as many as possible can be processed within the two month period. Senators can be assured that we will continue to put pressure on local authorities to deal with applications as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran mentioned how difficult it is to get planning permission and said that some of the new planners are <Col N="1346" /> causing problems by specifying particular types of bricks and chimneys.  We have all encountered that problem.  I hope that planners will deal with applicants practically and as efficiently as possible. There are some developments causing concern in that area which we hope to address in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran said he heard comments to the effect that the regulations may be over rigorous.  I do not agree.  An overview of the regulations will show that they are balanced and reasonable.  I hope they will speed up the planning process and assist the efficient processing of applications.  The Senator also referred to developments by the ESB.  Developments by the ESB, other than minor changes, are subject to the full planning process.  The new regulations will not water down or affect that position in any way.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran mentioned national roads and the powers of the National Roads Authority.  It is probably outside the scope of this debate but I would like to explain that the overall management of the construction and maintenance of national roads will be the responsibility of the National Roads Authority.  The Roads Act, 1993, provides for the drawing up of a programme of national road works by the Authority who will have to take account of a number of factors relating to local authorities.  The Act provides that the Authority will work closely with local authorities in the area of development.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly referred to developments by the Office of Public Works and gave the example of a Garda station in Kells.  Security works are subject to planning controls but obviously certain exemptions are necessary.  Those are very clearly outlined in the regulations.  For security reasons, prisons, Garda stations, etc., have to be exempt.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Kelly's welcome for the new information leaflets.  I assure her that they will be readily available in the future.  With regard to the new procedure for local authority development, the regulations recognise that the traditional arrangements are necessary <Col N="1347" /> for a smooth transition to the new procedure. If development proposals are notified to councils before 15 June and work starts before the end of the year, the new procedure will not apply.  This will ensure that work programmes are not disrupted in the manner Senator Kelly fears.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly also mentioned submissions or observations by the public. Submissions or observations made in writing to the planning authority must be on the file for inspection with all other documents relating to the application. That should ensure continuity and prevent delay.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Farrell that the planning system should not impede worthwhile development proposals.  One of the objectives of the Department of the Environment is to ensure that the process operates efficiently and without delay.  I hope the new regulations will help in that respect.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their views and support.  The questions and concerns raised by Senators will be taken up with the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the new FÁS programme Community Employment; and welcomes the valuable work, training and development opportunities which it will provide.</P>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire don Teach agus comhghairdeas lei maidir leis an obair atá á déanamh aici.</P>
      <P>The Minister has left a positive mark on every Portfolio she has had since entering public life and I have no doubt that she will leave her mark when she tackles the unemployment problem by creating jobs.  She is working in a positive, sincere and dedicated manner.  I congratulate her on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very good scheme.  When I was young the minor relief scheme started <Col N="1348" /> just before Christmas each year.  My first job with Sligo County Council was through the minor relief scheme and I earned 4s. 8d. a day, which is about 22p in today's money.  I recently bought a hammer similar to the one I used to break large stones into half inch shapes but it is now an antique.  Some man wore down that hammer breaking stones.  I participated in that scheme in the early 1940s.  We have come a long way since then.</P>
    <P>When I hear about unemployment today I think of the work we did then.  If we did not take the six weeks' work before Christmas, we would have a very poor Christmas.  This was followed by the social employment scheme, a good scheme, but this one is superior.</P>
    <P>The new scheme responds to the needs of the community.  It gives the community an opportunity to get involved in worthwhile projects and simultaneously pays people a reasonable wage.  A disadvantage of the previous scheme was that people could only participate in it for one year.  Very often the scheme was only properly under way by the end of that year.  There was no continuity.  When a scheme starts, the first four or five months are spent getting things organised. However, staff were let go at that point and new people had to be recruited the following year.  This made it impossible for organisers to have continuity.</P>
    <P>This scheme is great because people can be kept on for up to three years.  The same people, or at least a core number of people, can continue on the scheme, and if new people are recruited others are already there to co-ordinate and keep the work going.  This is a major improvement and the Minister of State should be congratulated for introducing it.  I advocated this move because many good people were let go because they could not be kept on for a second year; often, the whole thing then collapsed.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will create a work culture and a work ethic.  For too long there has been no work ethic and a dole, social welfare mentality.  It is terrific that 40,000 people will be employed on this scheme by the end of the year.  In the <Col N="1349" /> 1950s, when I started collecting rates, there was a large number of people unemployed.  When I called to collect the rates, people did not want to see me; they disappeared.  Their houses were dilapidated and everything was run down. However, as soon as people got work and started earning some money, they did up their homes and they had the few bob for the rates.  It gave them a new lease of life and completely uplifted them.  They felt they had a little independence.</P>
    <P>This scheme will give people independence and they will see others progressing. Previously, they were in a rut. They drew the dole and sat up on the high stool or went home.  They were not bothered about doing anything and the result was that nothing was done.  As the old adage states, if one wants something done, ask a busy person.  In the 1950s, when people got work, they improved their homes, etc., and the same will apply as a result of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Previously, many people did not take up jobs on schemes because if they did, they lost their secondary benefits.  If they had a medical card or their children's school books were paid for or any of the other free services, they lost them if they took up a place on a scheme.  They will now be able to work and retain their entitlements.  This is wonderful because this problem was the largest barrier to people taking jobs.  People felt they were losing too much if they lost their medical card or other services.  The Minister of State should be complimented for considering this matter because it is at the core of what keeps people at work.  It is most important.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to extend this measure to include temporary work. Many people would take temporary work in the summer.  This week I heard of a person who was offered a job.  She said she would love to take it, but if she did she would lose her unmarried mothers' allowance.  I can give the Minister of State details of the case.  It would be marvellous if people who took summer jobs for three or four months in peak periods could be paid wages, on which they would pay tax, but retain their secondary benefits. <Col N="1350" /> If people thought they would not lose these benefits, there would be many more in work today.</P>
    <P>I have experience of this matter.  I know of many people who would take work but do not do so because they lose their medical cards, etc.  I ask the Minister of State to consider extending that measure to include temporary summer work, particularly in the west where there is plentiful summer work in hotels and guesthouses.  If it was implemented, many extra jobs would be created, many of which perhaps would continue long after the summer.  Allowing people to retain their secondary benefits is the best thing the Minister of State has ever done. People worry if they get sick that they will not have the money to pay for their care.  It is important that people can retain their cards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new age limit, but I would like if the Minister of State could reduce it even further.  People could not avail of the previous scheme unless they were 25 years of age or over and that was wrong.  We must get young people at work.  In the days when many people went to England, if they got a job as soon as they got there, they were successful. However, if they did not get a job and ended up on the dole or in the pub, it was disastrous.  We must target the youth. I ask the Minister of State to consider lowering the age limit to 18 years rather than 21 years.  The youth of today are good and it would be much better if they could go straight from school into those type of jobs, rather than telling them that they cannot avail of the scheme until they are 21 years of age.  If young people come out of school at 18 years of age, why not make it possible for them to avail of the scheme at that stage?  They are good workers, able and capable.  If the Minister of State is to do anything, she should reduce the age limit even further.</P>
    <P>The training programme the Minister of State has introduced is terrific.  It is an important matter.  Earlier the House discussed planning and I said that we must try to marry industry and planning in an effort to create jobs.  We cannot have one area acting as a barrier to another <Col N="1351" /> and preventing it from progressing. Perhaps a scheme dealing with planning would be a good idea because nobody is trained in this area.  Very few people know how to make a planning application or the problems that can arise, what to research or what they need.  Perhaps there should be a course to train young people for what they will come up against in the planning area.</P>
    <P>In the debate earlier I mentioned the case of a young man who went on the dole.  He tried to set up a small business, but he got so fed up dealing with applications to change the use of a building, dealing with health inspectors and other matters that he threw in the towel.  Young people starting work are full of enthusiasm. Perhaps we should try to organise a one stop shop where young people could go and explain their needs to someone who could help them.  Perhaps they could go to FÁS, where someone could help them to fill in planning applications or applications for a licence to sell food or whatever.  Everything could be dealt with in the one office.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is more discouraging for people like me who were brought up in an age that when one decided to do something, one went ahead and did it. The rules or regulations of today did not exist then, but we must abide by them. We must try to develop an environment that is friendly towards people who want to create jobs or who want to work.  At present one must go to the county council with a planning application.  One must fill up another application at the health board and then go to the tax office for a tax clearance certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Straightaway that person gets bogged down and fed up.  We must get to grips with unemployment, particularly in relation to young people.  After a certain age people say they will not get jobs and that is it.  However, young people coming out of school are full of enthusiasm and ambition.  If they run into <Col N="1352" /> a grumpy official, and such people are in every walk of life, they can be discouraged by what that official thinks.  It breaks their courage.  This FÁS scheme includes extra money for training and we should try to establish a section where a young person who wishes to go into business could approach one person who could advise on all the requirements necessary to set up the business.  The adviser could help the entrepreneur to fill out the necessary forms.  When the forms are sent away there were no requests for further information because the adviser would have filled out the form correctly.  That would be very encouraging for people starting their own business.</P>
      <P>As I have said on many previous occasions, it is difficult to start a business today.  Years ago when a person decided to start a business he could approach a bank manager for extra funding to supplement the money already saved.  Then he could buy the property, carry out the necessary alterations and start doing business.  That is no longer the case.</P>
      <P>There are now too many regulations and rules.  None of the industries in my village could be started today because it would be too expensive.  When those businesses were started 20 years ago they simply applied for planning permission which cost nothing.  The planning officer called out to inspect the site and gave the go-ahead.  Planning and building took place side by side and people were delighted.  There was a hunger for work.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is not the case today.  It is very expensive to carry out environmental impact and other studies which are required for planning permission. It is a major job just to get a business started and it can be heartbreaking for many people.  In one case the prospective business person just gave up and went on the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should deal with that problem in our training schemes.  There are many good aspects to this employment programme. It is the path to further progress and I hope the path will widen.  It will become a first class road to further job creation.  It was great to hear about the <Col N="1353" /> creation of 2,000 new jobs in Dublin. This Government is dedicated to creating jobs.  No society is healthy if it is not working.  If our young people were working we would have less violence and crime.  As the old adage says: the devil finds work for idle hands.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on her wonderful work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion.  I commend the Minister on taking this initiative.  The scheme will help the long term unemployed.  Recently there have been indications of a downward trend in the unemployment figures. That is very encouraging.  However, State intervention through these schemes will be necessary for quite some time to help eliminate unemployment especially in areas where, because of regional imbalances and difficulties, it is difficult to get work.  Any new efforts in this regard are welcome, particularly at a time of economic development when it is likely that the unemployment figures will be reduced substantially.</P>
      <P>All the indications are that there will be an upturn in economic activity here. In the international arena the GATT negotiations have been resolved, there is a new EU-EFTA agreement in place which opens up new economic areas, the North American Trade Agreement has been resolved and the south-east Asian economies are co-operating with each other.  The international trend now indicates quite positively that there are enormous opportunities to increase employment, economic prosperity and development in the next four to five years.  We must keep abreast of those developments in a number of sectors, particularly in new technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen with the Motorola announcement during the week that advances in new technology will mean many employment opportunities.  It will be important to keep abreast of developments in the technological area and to have trained professionals in that area.  It is likely that, in the advanced technology, bio-technology, engineering and science sectors, there will be a substantial <Col N="1354" /> increase in employment opportunities during the next number of years.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to translate such prospects to areas where there are long term unemployed who do not have the basic educational requirements to fit into such schemes.  Although there will be positive opportunities for young people coming out of schools and colleges with high educational qualifications, they will not apply to a substantial number of people, many of whom are to a large extent unemployable, although they are on the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>If we look at the list of unemployed in areas where big projects have taken place, we discover that the project did not make any material change to the list.  I recall, for example, the huge Moneypoint generating station being built when 1,100 people were employed around the clock on its construction but there was only a minimal reduction in the unemployment figures in the town of Kilrush.  The reduction consisted mainly of young students who took summer employment on the project.  The fact is that within two miles of Kilrush a huge construction site employing 1,100 people did not materially affect the unemployment figures in the town.  I believe there is something more to the unemployment register than meets the eye.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that many of the people on the register will seek the type of employment opportunity contained in this training scheme.  That is why I welcome the work being done by FÁS in organising community projects at local level in many areas.  The projects give employment and training for a certain number of hours each day or week at a certain rate.  The participants have an opportunity of acquiring skills and the community is provided with important facilities.  There are numerous examples everywhere, and particularly in the west of Ireland, of the FÁS community training scheme providing community halls and other facilities while providing part-time employment for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>There are some problems with the schemes.  A common complaint is that there is no real incentive to get involved <Col N="1355" /> because of the small margin of difference between what somebody earns working on a scheme and what he would receive by signing on at the local employment exchange.  In spite of the huge unemployment figure there is a marked reluctance on the part of many people to participate in the schemes.  I recall going through a list of 18 people who had spoken to me a year ago about the prospects of securing employment.  None of them would take a job on a FÁS community training scheme for two reasons. First, they were not satisfied with the income return.  Second, many young people felt there was something more meaningful to do than being involved in community programmes or schemes which were below their skills or qualifications.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have the evidence from the returns of the various schemes to show that many people who start a scheme find employment before it concludes. This indicates that provided they have an opportunity or a long term prospect of meaningful improvement, young people are prepared to get involved in these projects.  When the opportunity does arise because of the training and experience they gain, they have taken up long term employment with construction and other companies.</P>
    <P>I have not examined the scheme in great detail but I am aware certain conditions attach to it.  I welcome the reduction of the minimum age limit from 25 years of age in the old scheme to 21 years in this scheme.  This has caused anxiety because it debars people from getting employment in these schemes.  It is reasonable to say that the age when people are most motivated to seek employment is immediately after leaving school.  Most students are keen to obtain employment on immediately entering the workforce.</P>
    <P>The age limit of 21 leaves out those aged between 18 and 20.  That group will take employment in any scheme, as we can see everywhere.  Young people also seek employment in the holiday period from university and second level schools. <Col N="1356" /> Even primary school children are pressing for jobs in their holidays, although they should not be employed under the laws of the land.  Younger people are more enthusiastic to get into work, be busy and do something constructive and positive.  Although the age limit has been reduced, two or three vital years are being missed and that requirement should be examined.</P>
    <P>There are other areas to which I would direct the scheme.  We all welcome the community work undertaken, such as sporting facilities, games rooms, halls and community centres.  There are many young married and single women seeking part time work, especially in the clerical and services sector.  The number of applicants for clerical positions in institutions such as health boards is huge.  Thousands of people are also applying for nursing positions.  FÁS should consider providing clerical training in schools or community development associations.  In my constituency many young women leave commercial classes with no prospects of jobs. They find themselves unemployed in a short time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the steps the Minister has taken and encourage her to continue along those lines.</P>

      <P>The motion states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the new FÁS community employment programme and welcomes the valuable work, training and development opportunities it will provide.</P>
      <P>I would prefer if we were debating a motion proposing that the Government make available a portion of the money for training to local authorities so they could employ people to work on our roads.  Some weeks ago the Minister for the Environment visited my county council, having travelled the roads of the county.  He lectured us on what we should be doing along our roadways and undoubtedly intended this to be done all over the country.  If we had the number of workers available in years gone by, our current problems would not be as great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> We are discussing the numbers of people who can participate in these schemes.  The programmes are only useful to people while they are on the scheme.  There is no long term prospect of employment for many of them.  I would like to be able to welcome the programme; but although we are giving people the opportunity to do something for a short period, we are not providing them with a future.</P>
    <P>If anyone on a scheme is married or intends to marry and applies to a local authority for loan assistance because he or she does not have permanent employment, the authority cannot allow them to apply for a proper mortgage.  The difficulty is that there is no permanent solution. One effect of these schemes is to reduce the numbers on the unemployment register.  This suits the Government of the day, whoever that might be, because such schemes are not new.</P>
    <P>I said previously in this Chamber that I would prefer Government directing local authorities to establish teams of people who would be trained as carpenters, fitters, bricklayers, etc., to work on behalf of the community.  They could build houses for the thousands of people on local authority housing lists.  We can give trades to people and provide houses. Why can we not give money to local authorities to do this?  My authority was given £1.75 million to build 47 houses but it was not allowed to take on people to be trained to do the work.</P>
    <P>One wonders what was the thinking behind the schemes.  Money was given and the houses will be built but there will be no long term effect because young people will not get trades.  If money is to be made available for such groups, as it has in Dublin and elsewhere, why can local authorities not avail of that funding? They could train scores of people, men and women.  Only yesterday the Minister mentioned the numbers of young people entering the trades and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>We are at a crossroads.  We are providing more schemes for the long term unemployed but we are not providing long term work.  We should train people <Col N="1358" /> so they can have long term work.  They should be able to finish their training and get jobs.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Farrell who mentioned the obstacles confronting those who want to employ people or start their own businesses.  He also mentioned the costs involved.  There is a new scheme where the main financial institutions make money available to young people who want to start-up their own businesses, or to people who want to take an extra person off the unemployment register.  However, it is difficult to get this money.  Recently we were informed that a substantial amount of the £25 million or the £50 million was committed. However, three people I know, who have legitimate businesses and are looking for an extra person, were refused funding because they did not meet the criteria. We have schemes for certain people but not for others.  As Senator Daly mentioned, we have introduced an age limit. If people cannot get work when they leave school, or no training is available, as proposed in these schemes, they get disillusioned with the system.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a Minister will explain why we can organise substantial funds for unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, FÁS schemes and training but we cannot replace an outdoor staff member in a local authority area; there are more engineers than outdoor staff in some areas.  At one time there were 20 men in certain sections, but now there are only two or three and no one is being replaced. Anyone who came through the local authority system knows what I am talking about.  We talk about helping the long term unemployed, but the Government must make a decision to employ people to do work that was done for years by the fathers of the people we are talking about, otherwise, we may not need the money to repair the roads in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members who tabled this motion and I am glad to come into the Seanad to speak about the Community Employment Programme which was a joint effort between my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and myself.  We were pleased to launch it together at the end of March.</P>
      <P>There has been a downward trend in unemployment levels but I do not shout about this fact because our unemployment figures are still too high.  While we welcome the downward trend, we cannot reduce our efforts in dealing with unemployment.  While there are approximately 284,000 people unemployed, we cannot cease to work towards reducing unemployment.  The downward trend is only part of the picture.  Redundancy figures, the compilation of which comes within my brief, have shown a welcome downward trend.  This is nothing to shout about because this must be kept in perspective.</P>
      <P>The recently published ESRI report stated that even if positive economic growth continued and led to a downward trend in unemployment levels, the Irish economy would still need special interventionist measures to deal with the long term unemployed.  There must be direct policies to deal with this and that is what we are considering in the Community Employment Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are finalising Ireland's Structural Funds allocation for 1994-99 and a key part of this will be a local development programme.  A major part of that programme will be the 33 local area partnerships, which were designated by the Government and which the Taoiseach launched last week in Dublin Castle.  I was glad to be part of that.  We will all be involved in these local area partnerships, including the public and private sectors and workers and employers who will come together to see what they can do to stimulate employment and to generate creativity in their local areas.  In addition to the local development programme, the <Col N="1360" /> Government will commit £150 million each year for community employment in the 33 areas.  We welcome these positive indications but they are only the beginning.</P>
    <P>As regards intervention, people say we are only interventionists and that we should allow free market forces to operate so that everyone can find their proper level of activity.  However, our unemployment figures mean there must be a combination of market forces and interventionist policies.  The NESC report also said this; it stated that many people want to work and there is a large amount of work to be done.  A marriage of the two, with proper structures and training, will achieve the best results.</P>
    <P>We have amalgamated the social employment scheme, the community employment development programme and Teamwork.  Their strengths are coming together in the Community Employment Programme.  It provides part-time work together with personal and skills development opportunities and the number of hours people must work are also highlighted.  It is operated as a key resource in areas covered by the local development programme.  I am pleased to be working closely with the new local development areas through the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Taoiseach's office, which is the motivating force for the local development areas, and the Tanáiste's office to improve the progression chances of participants through co-ordinated area action.  At the end of last month there were 27,000 participants in the Community Employment Programme; by the end of the year we hope to provide 40,000 places.  This is a substantial increase.</P>
    <P>People have asked me what is the difference between this scheme and other schemes.  Those involved in community projects say there are better chances for people on the Community Employment Programme.  People have a chance of employment for longer periods and better training.  One had to be 25 years of age to qualify for the social employment scheme; the age limit has been reduced to 21.  There is no age limit with regard <Col N="1361" /> to those in receipt of unemployment benefit. Furthermore, persons in receipt of lone parent's allowance are also eligible. Some 25 per cent of all available places have been set aside for those over 45 years of age who have been unemployed for three years or more.</P>
    <P>During the last 12 months I travelled around the country visiting the local area partnerships, the FÁS offices and meeting community groups.  The most important point put to me was that 25 years of age was too high.  Many below that age wanted to do this community work and wanted to get involved but were prevented from doing so because of the age limit.  We have reduced the age limit to 21 years in the new programme. Senator Daly said we need to reduce it even further.  A measure must be put in place for young people between school leaving age, which averages at about 18 and 21 years.  We hope that a new programme, Youthstart, will deal with that.</P>
    <P>Participants will retain their secondary and other social welfare benefits, if entitled to them in the first place.  Community employment contains a number of specific developmental elements, which are new and important.  People may avail of specially targeted programmes of training and may draw down time and moneys to engage in their own training.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly and Senator Daly spoke about the need to progress in the scheme.  There will be opportunities for progression.  This has been clearly marked out.  Participants may go on for two or three years.  There is no longer a cut off at the end of one year, which was the real deterrent in the old social employment scheme.  There is a chance to continue.  I am insistent on the type of training in the programme.  I do not want people engaged in a project for a project's sake and when it is finished to be cut off with nothing to hope for.</P>
    <P>Professor Kieran Kennedy of the ESRI wrote a booklet on unemployment.  He said there can be a nationwide programme of good work and training for the unemployed in a progressive manner linked to benefits, but also linked to <Col N="1362" /> proper training for local development employment placement.  He added that it will take enormous work and management skills to do this in each local area.  It will not be easy.  Support must be given so that a person's developed or innate skills may be matched with the project in hand, whether it is historical, infrastructural, the compilation of parish records, restoration, tidy towns or any other community employment project replacing the social employment scheme. We must match the participant's innate skills with the work in hand, not their potential.</P>
    <P>Training should be given during the course of the work which will be targeted to suit the person concerned.  Throughout this training vocational guidance and support should be given.  The participant should be assisted in a search for employment in their local area at the end of the one, two or three year period.  We will not be able to do this for everyone, but we can give it keen attention.</P>
    <P>When meeting with FÁS &mdash; I concluded a series of meetings in the past couple of days &mdash; I insisted that training be proper, documented, certified and progressive.  The role of the old placement officer seems to have lessened recently, because we put too much work on FÁS and demanded more from it.  The job placement role will be enhanced and developed.  It is a decisive shift towards a participant centred approach emphasising the need to provide useful work and skills for participants.  On several occasions I described it as a pact between communities and their local unemployed. I want to broaden that pact to include others at local level who may help to build community employment and provide pathways to further progression.</P>
    <P>The Department and FÁS believe 5,000 more places could be made available if local difficulties with the social partners in some areas could be ironed out.  I want to do that.  I have taken on board what Senators have said about those aged between 18 to 21 years.  As Senators rightly said, people leave school with high hopes; it is the nature of youth. Young people have stars in their eyes, <Col N="1363" /> yet they are plunged into dependency at a time when they should be independent. They are plunged into a sense of increasing failure when they should be able to hold their heads up high.</P>
    <P>The EU Commissioner, Mr. Flynn, is engaged in developing a community initiative, Youthstart, which would give training, education and a right to a job to all young people between 18 and 21 years.  I developed within FÁS &mdash; I spoke about this at the National Youth Council of Ireland &mdash; a pilot project, which we hope to have in place in two areas in the autumn and then broaden it out so it could be eligible for particular community initiative funding.  Whether we do that or not, we are going to have that Youthstart idea.  I do not want young people going on a year course.  I would like them to engage in at least two years developmental type training.</P>
    <P>I would like employers on board because it is an area where on the job training must be carried out by them.  I want it to be progressive, so that if a young person does two years, he or she may then consider going to a regional technical college, further education or apprenticeship.  A person should be able to progress; there should no boundaries preventing someone from doing something if they have the ability.  I will not engage in a Youthstart project which only goes so far.  All community development programmes should allow people to develop if they have it within them to do so.  We cannot consign large numbers of people, particularly young people, to long term unemployment.  We cannot say the economic parameters are right and refer to other economic jargon of the day, while at the same time looking at the register of high unemployment.  I will not accept that and I am sure Senators will agree.  I am not in that type of business. I like to see people develop and local areas revitalised.</P>
    <P>FÁS is doing magnificent work throughout the country.  I am not here as a propagandist for FÁS, but the face of Ireland has changed through work done by it.  If one sees the red sign in any <Col N="1364" /> village, town or county, one will see wonderful community initiatives where sponsors have put in endless hours of voluntary work in their particular idea or project.  Yet FÁS is an aunt sally for people to take pot shots at.  It does a huge amount of work.  Because it must be a lot of things to many people, its definitive role in its areas of responsibility &mdash; training for people in employment, training the unemployed and community initiatives &mdash; is sometimes clouded over.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly spoke in the House on the Apprenticeship Bill.  I met with local authorities which want to get back to their role in apprenticeship.  I also met with Senator Farrelly's county manager who has gone to County Kildare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I met with five local authorities which are keen and which will come back to me with proposals for taking on apprentices in local authority areas.  Senator Farrelly spoke about taking on full time local authority workers.  I do not have the remit to extend into that area, although I accept the philosophy of what the Senator has said.  Are we spending money when we could have people in full time employment in local authorities?  We must spread the money around.  The unemployment figure is too high; we must give people a first or a second chance for employment.</P>
      <P>I commend community employment to the House.  I welcome Senators' contributions. I hope we will work through any difficulties which may arise in the implementation of community employment.  With my colleague, I will work to see the programme is fruitful, developmental and positive for participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the welcome to the House which the Minister has received from other Senators.  I also wish to be associated <Col N="1365" /> with Senator Farrell's tribute to the Minister at the outset.  Having said that I must also admit that I probably know less about the realities of what actually happens on these schemes than anybody else who has spoken in this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the ideal behind the community employment programme and the selection of these 33 areas, because although it has been demonstrated recently &mdash; and we all know that poverty is very widespread throughout the country &mdash; that there are poor people everywhere, nevertheless a culture of poverty develops in particular areas.  Cultures of poverty are area located and area bound and therefore it is very important in trying to break the culture of poverty that there be area programmes, however much poverty may be distributed at an individual level and can be found everywhere. I welcome very much the principle behind this.</P>
      <P>It is also the case that it is very difficult to plan for areas because that involves going beyond sectoral planning and trying to blend a whole range of what are normally parallel activities and to get people to think in terms of the area as a whole as distinct from one particular sector.  Whether it is at governmental level or at local level, achieving the cast of mind which involves co-operation with others, thinking about a common area objective is a major psychological challenge as well as an administrative one.</P>
      <P>Therefore I welcome these approaches very much.  I welcome them partly because the people in FÁS in Cork to whom I have spoken about these matters are very enthusiastic about this scheme and think that in the light of their experience with a pilot project on the north side last year, it has enormous potential. I respect the judgment of these people and I was glad to hear the Minister's tribute to FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am no expert on FÁS.  One hears differing reports, probably depending on whom one is speaking to, because as we all know in every institution there are those who excite one and there are those who discourage one.  But FÁS was quite severely castigated, it is fair to say, in the <Col N="1366" /> Culliton report and there were massive proposals for extensive restructuring. The evidential basis was not provided for the severe castigation and FÁS itself was the product of restructuring only a few years previously.  It was not a product of inaction.  It may have been the product of somewhat mindless action at times, but certainly not of inaction.  I am glad to hear that tribute because it has a very important remit and it is very important that it discharges that remit to the satisfaction of those who have an opportunity of observing its activities on the ground.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis that Senator Daly laid on the younger age group.  In a sense my only complaint to the Minister is that in her own contribution she has so completely anticipated virtually every question that could be possibly asked that it is a little difficult to think of angles of approach.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that there are really two different programmes going on here.  If 25 per cent of places are rightly reserved for over 45s who have been unemployed for three years, that is a very different type of programme and challenge from that of getting to the school leavers and making sure they get work straight away.  It would be unfortunate if these two rather different trajectories of activity were to get in each other's way, so that two different types of official might be needed to deal with this, with two different concepts of where one is going with the workers on these schemes.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the emphasis on work for young women, which again Senator Daly has mentioned, and how young women can be incorporated positively into the workforce.  Here, both for young women and for young men, one should look at part-time employment from a positive rather than from a negative point of view.  There was and probably still is with the majority of the population a view that part-time employment is somehow second best to full-time employment.  In the world of work into which we have already entered, part-time employment will become much closer to the norm than it has been; and shifting from job to job <Col N="1367" /> and even in some respects from career to career will become much more the norm than it has been.</P>
    <P>The changes in the nature of the labour market, even in the last five years, are quite extraordinary.  I may be generalising from a somewhat privileged level but I have gone recently through the work patterns of about 200 of my own graduates over the last three or four years and nearly all of them are at work, but very few of them are at work they thought four years ago they would be at.  Several of them have come to that work through one or two other jobs in the meantime.</P>
    <P>What is now important is that we produce people, whether at 18 years old, 21 years old or whatever, who have the capacity for work.  They must be work oriented and have sufficient flexibility to adjust to the changing requirements of the market and indeed to identify and pursue requirements themselves.  The idea of the job for life is virtually gone at all levels, and if that mentality is imbued into our young people it is a recipe for defeat and disillusion on their part.</P>
    <P>I know I am speaking from the privilege of a job for life but the young people themselves, at least the ones I talk to &mdash; and again they may be from the privileged end of the market &mdash; are much more alert to the changing nature of the labour market than many of us of an earlier generation are.  They are aware that the job for life is, except in very rare cases, not there.  They are adjusting psychologically to that and therefore the type of scheme the Minister has in mind for encouraging them to think along those lines and to prepare themselves as individuals and personalities for work, even though one cannot predict the precise type of work, is very important.</P>
    <P>This leads me to wonder what sort of relationship the Minister perceives between these schemes and the educational system.  She talks about training, about identifying educational routes for them, and quite rightly, she is very keen on that.  Nobody here is more familiar with the educational system than she is. The relationship has to be specifically <Col N="1368" /> fostered rather than left to some sort of chance.  Young people can be encouraged to think for themselves about what sort of course they ought to be encouraged on.  The institutions, at whatever level, can also be encouraged to respond and to think pro-actively rather than simply waiting for a demand.</P>
    <P>The ideas the Minister has expressed in her contribution should be injected into the thinking of the educational institutions as well as into the thinking of the young people and of FÁS itself.  I am not looking for more work for educational institutions.  We all know that there are intense pressures on them, but nevertheless the co-ordination of activities is important.  This Minister is constructive about education even when she is not Minister for Education.  I would like to see more Ministers of that type.  I would like to see the Minister give a lead in guiding the thinking of the educational institutions as well as of FÁS and of the young people.  I wish this scheme well, it deserves well and more power to the Minister in pursuing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House again and I also welcome this new community employment scheme. When the social employment schemes were first moved, we were moving onto new territory really, something that had not been done before.  I compliment the people in FÁS who worked so hard to make these social employment schemes a success.  Many local groups deserve our gratitude for getting them to work.  I wish to mention the staff of the county councils, particularly the local executive engineer.  Very often he had to select the job that was to be done.  Often it was very difficult because there would be conflicting opinions as to whether it was a worthwhile job, whether it would conflict with unions or otherwise.  Therefore there was a lot of teasing out to be done and it was done very well by the FÁS officials and also by the local authority officials as well.  As I mentioned already, the executive engineer locally played a tremendous part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good that the community employment <Col N="1369" /> scheme replaces three other schemes because too many schemes confuse the issue; one overall scheme is better.  That is not to say that good work was not done under the social employment schemes, the community employment development schemes &mdash; the CEDP &mdash; or the Teamwork schemes.  Getting people working must be the aim.  Long-term unemployment is a curse; when people who are willing to work are left without employment day after day, week after week, year after year, and have nothing to do, it is soul destroying and brain destroying.  We now have second and maybe third generations of families who have not seen work.</P>
    <P>The right to work must be a priority and the community employment scheme gets us off to the right start.  It is good to see people getting off unemployment benefit or assistance and doing meaningful work.  In any forum or at any meeting the words &ldquo;migration&rdquo;, &ldquo;emigration&rdquo; and &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; have been so commonplace for so long that people are getting fed up hearing them.  We must emphasise that the only way of stopping those three phenomena is to provide work, such as community employment.</P>
    <P>Whether it is on heritage work or improving a local area for tourism, there are many small jobs which can be done by the community.  Could that not be expanded?  Many of the older politicians often suggested taking the money from social welfare and giving it to the county councils to get work done.  It is important to highlight that point.  I would like to see a development of the community employment scheme so that more work would be done by the county council, where people who were working on a community employment scheme could be taken on by the county council when they are finished so that there would be a continuity of work.  I admit that it may not be easy to do.</P>
    <P>Under the old scheme a person was employed for six months and when the job was done they went back on the dole. I am glad to see that the duration has been extended to 12 months and be extended to two years, and even three. <Col N="1370" /> That is welcome because it gives continuity. It would be good if there was the prospect of full-time employment in a local authority or any other community organisation and that a person's work on a community employment scheme could be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>We sometimes overlook a point about which people who have been involved in social employment schemes in the past are proud, and that is when they apply for a job they can get a reference.  It is a tremendous boost to be able to say they were employed on a social employment scheme, and that the person who employed them, the FÁS official or the county council engineer, can give them a reference.  This is the only opportunity to work many people have had for ten or 15 years; previously all they could put down on a form when asked what they had been doing for the past ten years was &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo;.  That alone has done a lot for people.</P>
    <P>I am glad the age limit has been reduced to 21 years and that the secondary benefits may be retained.  People got a fright when they got a few pounds more only to lose it in benefits.  People would shy away from these schemes completely if they felt that they would lose their medical card.  They might get a few pounds extra but, if they caught a cold or a bout of the 'flu while working they would have to go to the doctor, pay his fee and pay for the medicines and tablets prescribed and the money would be spent.  In that case they would be better off unemployed.  We must get rid of those difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned the Youthstart scheme.  The age limit in the community employment scheme is being reduced to 21 years but we must remember that school leavers have never had full time work.  They might have done holiday work or held a part-time job at the weekends or been involved in babysitting, but they have never worked for a sustained period.  People often leave school and sign on for those formative years between the ages of 18 and 21, but that is not good enough.  We must provide for those between 18 and 21 years <Col N="1371" /> because we are not taking them on board at present and this could be a severe loss for us.</P>
    <P>Under the Community support framework we must get money into more of these jobs because they are often the only type of employment in rural areas, such as my own in west Cork, as there are no factories but only small local projects. Our local group of Macra na Feirme is holding a seminar on emigration and migration in my home town tomorrow night.  It will stress that in rural areas migration has been and is nearly more damaging than emigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I enthusiastically welcome this scheme.  It is a great improvement on the previous schemes, including the social employment scheme.  I often feel sorry for FÁS because I feel that it gets a bad name.  I had better declare a family interest at once; it is always wise to do so.  My son went overseas with FÁS.  A large number of young graduates go overseas with FÁS and I have not known one firm which did not want to keep them on. Indeed, some firms asked if there were any more graduates at home.  That was extremely encouraging.</P>
      <P>One of the most important aspects of this scheme is that all the fringe benefits can be retained.  It was difficult before to urge people to take part in schemes because they did not want to lose their medical card, in particular.  This is a great improvement.  I am also glad that the age limit has been lowered, that the Youthstart scheme is to come into operation and that lone parents will be able to be involved in the community work schemes.  The Minister and several Senators talked about young people leaving school with high hopes only to find nothing to do.  The Youthstart scheme is a good idea.</P>

    <P>It is important to have certification because there is a training element involved in many of these schemes.  As Senator Calnan said, it is also important that these people have a job to go to every day and that when their course is <Col N="1372" /> completed they can get a reference from their employer.</P>
    <P>The importance of that in the social framework of someone's life cannot be underestimated and it is something far too many have lacked in the last few years.</P>
    <P>I am always fascinated by people who want workfare, where one must work for the dole money.  If we can help all the people who are desperate to work, we can then start on the recalcitrant group who do not want to work; we will all be old before we have dealt with all of those who want to work.</P>
    <P>The one aspect that depressed me &mdash; the Minister did not mention it in her contribution but it is in her script &mdash; was that 5,000 places could be made available in local authorities if industrial relations problems were resolved quickly.  This matter must be examined seriously.  Another report said that if people were only permitted to work two hours overtime per week, over 100,000 jobs would be created, which seems an astonishing number.  Employment may have to be shared out a little more; the cake is not that enormous.  Some may be getting more than they are entitled to.  One will have to be prepared to sacrifice some of their work so that those without employment, who strongly deserve to have a job, will get one.</P>
    <P>While I think all FÁS instructions and leaflets are explicit, some have told me that they are not that easy to follow. Those who will be using these leaflets should examine them to ensure they are clear to them.  I am a bad form filler. Whenever I have to fill in a form &mdash; a visa application for entry to America, for example &mdash; and I get to the top of a queue, I am often told that it is not filled in properly.  I am extremely sympathetic with those who find difficulties with this. These forms should be made as easy as possible to fill in and understand. Officials in this area need a tremendous amount of training so they can help people in this regard.  There should be a one-stop shop where people can go to discuss their unemployment problem and the options available to them.  Training for these officials is required for directing <Col N="1373" /> people and finding out the most suitable area for their skills.</P>
    <P>With regard to those over 45 years of age, is it wise to have any limit on the length people can remain on schemes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I know the Minister has raised the limit from a year to three years, but the chances of these people getting employment are not good. If they are slotted into a post within the community where they are useful, do we really need to drag them out of it?  We will have to give them unemployment benefit when they leave this job anyway. Whatever small business they are in may be extremely sad to lose them.  Some people told me they had got a well trained secretary of 52 years of age for a community project.  They did not know that they could keep a person on under this scheme for three years.  I told them that the scheme had been extended recently and that they should apply again.  This was a terrific fillip for them.  What is the point of letting her go?  She is most unlikely to get any other work in the area.  Apparently, she is valuable to this small circle.  If she leaves, they will have to train someone else.  I know it is designed to give someone else a chance, but could the Minister give some leeway on that?  Does it really matter if people are allowed to work for another period of time if they are useful to the community? Perhaps the Minister could be flexible on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to &mdash; I know the Minister is sympathetic on this &mdash; child care for those women trying to become involved in training programmes and community work schemes.  This is a major problem for women who want to work.  There are no State creche schemes. Any money they earn to get into a better economic position is spent on child care. A large number of lone parents have applied for these schemes, which is terrific. As I have said before, only 12 per cent of single mothers stay on long term unemployment benefit.  Obviously, they desperately want to become economically <Col N="1374" /> viable.  No one wants to be poor forever.  However, they have no chance of improving their economic position unless they become involved in training schemes that, as Senator Calnan said, gives them a reference and some experience. Everything should be done to encourage this, not only financially, but also in the provision of better facilities.  I welcome the scheme and congratulate the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming this scheme.  I am sure it will be beneficial and will bear fruit in the years ahead.  We are not alone in having this unemployment problem.  It exists worldwide, especially in the EU.  I heard a reference on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; this morning to the potential removal of shorthand and ordinary typists by a voice activated computer that can do their job effectively.  This problem is becoming greater each day and has nothing to do with any Government.  Modern technology is making it more difficult for any Minister or Government to provide jobs for young people.  This may be progress in one way, but it will also reduce the number of jobs.  If this gadget is introduced it will have this effect on secretaries, but what can be done?  One cannot stop progress.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the FÁS staff.  Its staff in my constituency of South Tipperary, for example, are courteous.  Our county council has been one of the fortunate ones over the years in that we have had many hundreds of jobs under the FÁS schemes.  We have also had great co-operation from both the social partners and the trade unions and the county is better for it.  I thank everyone in FÁS for their help with these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day is long gone &mdash; Senator Henry and others referred to it &mdash; when people could say that they would be a teacher or a nurse and that they would not do anything until they got a certain job.  I know of a case where two young neighbours sat their leaving certificate.  One of them got many honours while the other did not do as well.  The young man who done well stayed at home for a few years <Col N="1375" /> and his parents supported him.  The other one sold petrol at the local filling station and washed cars by day and worked in a chip shop at night.  He worked at many kinds of jobs for two years.  A job in a local co-operative came up.  He was one of many &mdash; maybe 60 to 80 &mdash; people who applied for it.  The applications were shortlisted to five or six candidates.  He got the job, even though he had no honours in his leaving certificate.  Naturally, questions were asked.  The mothers of both boys talked to the manager of the co-operative, who told them he got the job because of his references.  It is great for a person who cannot get a permanent job to say they were on a FÁS scheme and had worked in different places.  This young man had references from all of the places he had worked.  He saw what the real world was like, what it was to earn a bob, and more importantly, not to spend it too freely.  The other young man, while brilliant, stayed at home for two years and had no experience of life.  He was waiting for a certain type of job, but that day is long gone.</P>
    <P>We all had to work at minor jobs when we were young, whether on the farm, in a shop or elsewhere.  It did not do us any harm.  We might not have got much financial reward for it, but it did us some good.  As one goes on in life, one learns its ups and downs.  Ten people may have been employed in a business five years ago, but the same business might now be manned by only two people.  Competition is intense in every walk of life.  One has to be competitive to survive; it is a vicious circle.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put considerable thought into the scheme and has discussed problems with staff on the ground. There should be more co-operation at local authority level.  Sadly, local authorities have more engineers than outdoor staff.  The county council worker is an endangered species.  There is a great deal of work which cannot be undertaken by machinery, only by outdoor staff.</P>
    <P>Some counties may have let more staff go than others; this issue was discussed by my own council recently.  While the <Col N="1376" /> council maintained its staff levels, a different system was established; people who retire, take ill and cannot work are not replaced.  At some stage local authorities will have hardly any outdoor staff, this is a step in the wrong direction.  They have nothing to do with this scheme, but there should be some linkage, especially in counties where there is no co-operation among the social partners, to ensure involvement in the various programmes the Minister has launched in this scheme.</P>
    <P>All chiefs and no Indians in any walk of life is not healthy and all people hear is that there is no money for this or that. Is it possible to ascertain how much of every £1 a local authority receives, whether it is from the European taxpayer through Brussels or the Irish taxpayer, is allocated to roads or other developments such as housing?  Little monsters have been built up in every county where there is continuous demand that the Government provide more money, resulting in the doors turning around all the time.</P>
    <P>Too many people advise that there is no money to do anything while it is they themselves who are gobbling up any money which is available.  There is too much officialdom at local level given that the purpose of a local authority is to provide services.  Matters have got out of hand in the past ten or 15 years.  Officials must be paid before any potholes are filled, or if they are to be filled.</P>
    <P>In the past ten to 15 years there was also an embargo by certain bodies on recruitment.  The chief agricultural officer of any county council could not employ a typist because of an embargo. However, the county manager could employ as many engineers and clerical staff as he liked; the people were employed in a non-productive area.</P>
    <P>These areas must be examined because they have gone out of control.  I wish those administering this community employment scheme every success.  No scheme is perfect and the old FÁS schemes had their weaknesses, perhaps because of regulations from Brussels and so on.  However, this scheme is a step in the right direction.  It will give hope to <Col N="1377" /> many people.  I thank the Minister and those involved for it.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to conclude the debate and to thank those who spoke.  Senator Farrell proposed the motion which Senator Daly seconded Senator Farrelly, Senator Lee, Senator Henry, Senator Calnan and Senator Byrne also spoke on the motion. Seven contributions is a fine record and I thank Senators for their comments, for the time they spent in the House and the many suggestions made.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell spoke of his experiences long ago with the relief schemes, as they were known, in the county council areas.  He spoke from a clear knowledge of that era.  Senator Daly spoke of the necessity for the needs of young people to be accommodated from the age of 18 years upwards, and of the vacuum created by not having schemes or projects to deal with young people.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrelly, referring to county councils, spoke of the need to have permanent employment and posed the question of transfer of funding from projects such as this into the local authority area. This theme was taken up by Senator Byrne.</P>
      <P>The area partnerships were referred to by Senator Lee, as was his experience of one of them in Cork.  He also spoke of the need to address the cultural poverty of the north side of Cork, a need which could be addressed within such partnerships. Senator Lee rightly entered the caveat of different types of programmes for young and older people and the necessity of having two different approaches to their different needs.  He also referred to the link between proper training, experience and education and always to have that link to the forefront of these programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Calnan referred to the county councils.  He is supportive of the scheme, especially the secondary benefits which <Col N="1378" /> will now remain if people have their entitlements and the age breakdown is maintained.  In this respect Senator Henry referred to trade union difficulties. There could be 5,000 but for these difficulties. There are pockets of trade union difficulties around the country which we are working to bring to a satisfactory conclusion by consensus and discussion. Many areas have been progressive on this issue, linked to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  Hopefully difficulties at local level will be worked through by means of this mechanism.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of clear leaflets and proper language, I confess that forms terrify me.  That is why I always call for clarity and simplicity.  I fail to see the need for complicated forms when precise information can be requested in a clear manner.  I will pursue this matter as there is no point having beautiful leaflets if the requirements are not clearly indicated.</P>
    <P>The idea of including those aged over 45 years, allowing for the three year span in certain areas, will be considered.  The likelihood is that others will want a chance to get on a project, but often there is not another person fully qualified to do so.  Senator Henry referred to the lady who engaged in secretarial work.  Her services were required, she was willing and all would be satisfied if she could be kept on.  This issue must be considered, otherwise people are only being consigned off the programmes.  A balance can be found between the need for others to get a chance and to recruit those over a certain age with accomplishments in certain fields.</P>
    <P>Regarding child care, when Senator Henry sees me coming she jumps to the ramparts.  I could take the facile view and advise that this issue is the responsibility of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, but I do not take that approach.  If these are projects the Department of Enterprise and Employment wishes to establish, and on which it is our stated aim to have women included, and one of the barriers to this is child care, then it must be addressed. There have been good examples of how child care has been satisfactorily introduced. <Col N="1379" /> However, these are only isolated pockets and they have arisen only where huge and determined efforts have been made by women, who have battered down the doors of FÁS and of all of us to say they would like to work on such projects but are hindered by the absence of child care facilities.  There needs to be greater provision for this, even within FÁS projects themselves.  Each project could have a child care component.  The NOW initiative for women has done a great deal of work in this area.  I hope to bring this from a developmental stage into the mainstream.</P>
    <P>Senator Byrne spoke of his long years on local authorities and the work done by them through projects.  He praised Tipperary South Riding County Council for its developmental work.  He also welcomed the age reduction but thought it could be lowered further.  He spoke about the Youthstart programme and young people at work.</P>
    <P>I have gained from this debate.  Three or four clear points have been made during it.  The local area partnerships were emphasised.  There are now 33 of them, which is good.  Young people are determined not to go down the road of unemployment but to start working. There is a need for projects at county council level.  I have tackled the issue raised by Senator Farrelly through the apprenticeship scheme and I might be able to do more in this regard.</P>
    <P>We need to look at cultural poverty. Times were hard for people 50 or 60 years ago.  There is a different kind of deprivation today which takes the form not of hunger but of cultural poverty. This must be dealt with if we are not to have generation after generation of people knowing nothing but unemployment. People want to get up in the morning with an objective in mind.  They want a purpose in life, whether it involves temporary or short term work or job sharing.  People want to have a stake in life and their communities.  This is only possible if people can work with their hands, mind or brain and engage in meaningful activity for which they are <Col N="1380" /> recompensed.  The community employment programme allows for such participation.</P>
    <P>We speak about the apathy and alienation of voters and their reluctance to vote in European elections because they feel European issues are not relevant to them.  However, these issues are important for them, because unemployment is a European phenomenon.  Part of the difficulty is related to Senator Henry's point that issues are not laid out clearly before people.  The community employment scheme is mainly funded by the Exchequer but we are receiving some funding under the EU community support framework.</P>
    <P>This year is the 100th anniversary of the founding of the co-operative movement by Horace Plunkett and this will be well celebrated.  This movement was part of the flowering and empowerment of people at that time.  People had moved on from the Parnellite episode and the land wars to the congested district boards, the Gaelic League, the Abbey Theatre and the co-operative movement. This movement involved people coming up with their own ideas.  We use the word &ldquo;meitheal&rdquo; to describe people coming to the aid of their neighbours when there is work to be done.  You, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, would know this well from your agricultural activities.  A meitheal involves people coming together to share their strengths and foster their community spirit.  I am convinced that the more this spirit is encouraged the further it will spread.  I welcome this debate and am glad to have been part of it.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, for having this motion <Col N="1381" /> taken this evening and I thank the Minister for State for coming to the House to deal with it.  The Kilbeg/Knockferry Bridge has been a long-running saga in Galway for many years.  I raise it this evening because it is time we had a definitive decision from the Government, one way or the other, on this project. The people of Connemara and, particularly, of Headford deserve to know once and for all the exact thinking of the Government on the provision of this facility, which has been promoted in Galway for a long number of years.  While I accept the point I am sure the Minister will make that the project is very expensive, when one looks at the impact it would have for Connemara and north Galway, there is no doubt that the cost involved would be insignificant in the long term. We are talking about building a bridge across the narrowest point of the Corrib, which is estimated to cost about £4 million. If the Minister has any better &ldquo;guesstimates&rdquo; than that, I am anxious to hear them.</P>
      <P>The principal advantage of the proposal is that it would open up a significant part of Connemara to the Headford area. At present people have to drive into Galway city and around the Corrib.  This proposal would result in a time saving of one hour for them.  Farming in Connemara has been an important industry over the years.  In recent years, with the improvement of farming, the need to be able to access the Headford area, where there is a mart and a number of other suppliers, is vitally important and would greatly assist the economic development of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Increased accessibility to the Moy-cullen-Oughterard area would be of major benefit to the development of tourism and industry.  The decision to proceed with this bridge would result in major economic advantage.  I ask the Minister, in conjunction with his Government colleagues, to decide on this proposal at some time in the future.  We do not expect this project to be completed this week, this year or next year.  It is desirable as part of the national plan to provide this infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> If the Government made that decision, one way or the other, it would be a start. If it is decided on a cost benefit basis that this project is not viable, then let us have that information.  The time has come for the Government, in particular the Department of the Environment, to decide whether it sees a benefit in this bridge being built.  If it does, it should say that over a period of years it will proceed with the planning and development of this project.  If it does not see the project as being possible, then it should say this to the people rather than giving them false hope.</P>
    <P>The question of Galway County Council's late application this year was discussed with the Department by a deputation.  Quite honestly, whether the application was in on time or not is not that significant.  What is significant is whether the Government wants to build this bridge.  If the Minister cannot answer that question tonight &mdash; and I accept that he may not be in a position to do so &mdash; I ask him to, along with his senior Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, to put that question at Government level. A decision should be taken on whether in principle the Government wants to build this bridge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Senator Fahey for raising this issue.  I understand that a proposal to construct a bridge across Lough Corrib linking Kilbeg and Knockferry has been mooted for decades and that the matter has been raised by residents of the area concerned with Galway County Council. As such a bridge would connect two county roads, statutory responsibility for its erection rests with the county council, which would also have to provide funding for the work.  I believe that the estimated cost of the bridge is over £4 million and, in addition, further significant expenditure would arise in respect of necessary associated road improvements.  It is a matter for the council to determine the priority to be accorded to the bridge in the context of other demands for the <Col N="1383" /> improvement and maintenance of non-national roads throughout County Galway and taking account of the needs of all road users.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully conscious of the important social and economic functions of non-national roads in the Irish context and their contribution to industry, tourism and rural development.  In recognition of this, very substantially increased Exchequer resources have been provided for the improvement and maintenance of these roads in recent years, reaching a record high of £106.4 million this year.  The national development plan marks an important new departure in relation to these roads.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year my Department invited local authorities to submit applications under the new scheme of EU co-financed grants for improvement works on non-national roads and set 26 February 1994 as the deadline.  Over 450 applications were received, including 27 proposals from Galway County Council. The latter's submission did not include an application in respect of Kilbeg/ Knockferry bridge.  On 12 May local authorities were notified of grant allocations totalling £33.6 million, the entire provision available for the grants scheme in 1994.  Galway County Council's grant allocations totalled £1.61 million.  On 5 May 1994, two months after the date set for grant applications for 1994, Galway County Council submitted a proposal for the construction of the bridge but the proposal could not be considered at that stage.</P>
      <P>Local authorities will be invited later this year to put forward applications for suitable projects which could be undertaken in 1995.  Consideration will be given to any grant application put forward by Galway County Council for the Corrib bridge in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I wondered if the Minister <Col N="1384" /> for Education would reply, but obviously she has delegated the responsibility.  I hope that the reply which she has delegated is in the affirmative.  Sixty parents travelled from Mallow to Cork this morning and in a peaceful protest handed in a letter to the inspectorate in the Department of Education in Cork.  The case which I want to make this evening is to have expedited the upgrading of the school and the appointment of a teacher.</P>
      <P>The need for the rationalisation of primary school structures in Mallow was raised as early as February 1993.  Monsignor Denis O'Callaghan decided to convene a delegate conference of the boards of management of six schools in the parish, the purpose of which was to identify all relevant factors.  The conference got underway but failed to make any recommendation.  As a result, the parents decided that their children who would be due to transfer to other schools on the north side of Mallow when they were due to go into third class in September should remain in Scoil Ghobnatan. They took this course because there were empty classrooms available and because they considered it more logical for all the children in a family to be in the same school for primary education. This would provide great relief for parents.</P>
      <P>The pupils were supervised by the parents in the school from September to December 1993.  The Minster stated that no change would take place in the 1993-94 school year.  The parents accepted this and appointed a qualified teacher, who is at present teaching in the school and being paid by funds raised by the committee and the community.  The INTO, which was the only outside body to examine the situation, recommended in 1993 that a temporary teacher be appointed and the parents were prepared to accept the condition laid down by the INTO proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister and Department officials are well aware, the demographic trends in Mallow favour a general reorganisation of the primary schools to make better use of the facilities which are available. The parents have a legitimate case <Col N="1385" /> and a constitutional right to have their children educated in their own locality, especially as the space is available.  The parents contend that the rights of children are paramount and I urge the Minister for Education to approve the appointment of a teacher and to sanction the upgrading of the school.  The Minister has the power under the rules for national schools to authorise a change in the status of any school.</P>
    <P>The 1993-94 school year &mdash; the period during which the Minister said that a decision would be made &mdash; is now almost ended.  Given the commitment of the parents and the community to the school, I appeal to the Minister to make a decision without further delay.  In their letter to the Minister the parents said:</P>
    <P>As a teacher, Minister, you will appreciate that the last month is spent organising the new school year and we are not in a position to do that as we are awaiting your decision.  We very much regretted that agreement could not be achieved locally through the delegate conference.  Nevertheless, we feel that a positive decision in our case would lead to constructive planning and organisation throughout schools in Mallow generally.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make that decision now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  There are six primary schools in Mallow town, including the Church of Ireland and all Irish schools.  These are Scoil Ghobnatan, with boys and girls to second class inclusive; the Mercy girls' national school with girls from first to sixth class; St. Patrick's boys' school with boys from first to sixth class; Scoil Ios-again with infant boys and girls; Gaelscoil Thomáis Dhaibhis with the full range of boys and girls and Mallow Church of Ireland school with the full range of boys and girls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1993 the authorities of Scoil Ghobnatan applied for sanction to retain boys and girls in third class from September <Col N="1386" /> 1993 and to be allowed to extend to a full range school.  These pupils would normally have transferred to the Mercy girls' and St Patrick's boys' schools.  Scoil Ghobnatan is located on the south side of the River Blackwater, whereas the other schools are on the north side of the river.</P>
    <P>The school was established in 1970 for children up to and including first standard. The main reason for its establishment was that it was considered that children of that age were considered too young to travel the 1.5 to 2 miles distance through the centre of the town to the schools on the north side.  In 1986 the school was allowed retain boys up to second standard and in 1992 to retain girls to second standard.  The chief reason given for the request to develop to a full range school was that children in the third to sixth classes should also not have to travel to the other schools because of their age.</P>
    <P>Following the request the Department consulted with the patron of the schools and the local inspector. Submissions were received from the school authorities of Scoil Ghobnatan, school parent groups, Mercy Convent girls' national school and St. Patrick's national school. The authorities of the Mercy Convent and St. Patrick's schools were totally opposed to any change in the status of Scoil Ghobnatan as it would significantly reduce their enrolments and lead to loss of teaching posts.  I should add that with the declining demographic trends these schools' enrolments were already declining but the loss of the pupils from Scoil Ghobnatan would exacerbate the situation.</P>
    <P>The Department considered that the retention of pupils in Scoil Ghobnatan was part of the much larger issue which needed to be addressed, that is, the reorganisation of the schools generally in Mallow in light of the expected major decline in enrolments in the centre.  In order to allow for a fuller examination of this complex matter, the Department decided that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained in the centre for the <Col N="1387" /> 1993-94 school year and a major examination would take place early in that school year.  The Scoil Ghobnatan authorities were informed of this decision in July 1993 and were also informed that if the pupils were retained in the school in September 1993 they could not be included for staffing or capitation grant purposes.</P>
    <P>The present difficulties arose from the decision by the parents of the pupils in question to ignore the Department's decision in the matter.  The parents presented their children at Scoil Ghobnatan on 1 September 1993 despite the Department's instruction.  The school authorities felt that they could not refuse the pupils entry and, accordingly, they were allowed into the school.  No additional teaching services were provided on the basis that these services were available in the schools to which the pupils should have transferred.  The parents supervised and taught the children themselves for a number of months and subsequently employed a private teacher.  That remains the position.</P>
    <P>The parish priest following a preliminary meeting of the boards on 23 September last organised a delegate conference to discuss the immediate problem and the question of a general reorganisation of the schools in the light of declining enrolments.  Each school was represented by the chairperson of the board, a parent and a teacher.  The full conference met on seven occasions and between meetings, the various groupings, chairpersons, parents and teachers met to discuss and formulate proposals.</P>
    <P>The outcome of this conference was disappointing in that agreement in resolving the issue was not forthcoming.  A <Col N="1388" /> proposal from the conference chairperson regarding an appointment of a temporary teacher to Scoil Ghobnatan pending a resolution of the difficulties was objected to by the Mercy Convent girls and St. Patrick's boys' schools for two main reasons.  These were that allowing irregular action by a group of parents to override a specific Department decision on a given matter would constitute a dangerous precedent which would undermine authority generally in the field of education and that the present unacceptable situation of the 32 pupils retained in Scoil Ghobnatan without a teacher is due to that irregular action, for which the boards of the Mercy convent and St. Patrick's schools cannot be held responsible.</P>
    <P>The Senator will appreciate that the difficulties in Scoil Ghobnatan are complex. However, the Minister is giving the matter detailed consideration at present and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities before the end of the school year.</P>

      <P>Following a meeting of the delegate conference, the monsignor informed the committee that he had the acquiescence of all parties to the conference for a request for a temporary teacher for the 32 children at Scoil Ghobnatan. On 3 December, Monsignor O'Callaghan made a commitment to make an immediate application to the Department of Education for a temporary teacher.  There is a conflict between that statement and the statement issued by the Minister.  I want to put that on record.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 June 1994.</P>
