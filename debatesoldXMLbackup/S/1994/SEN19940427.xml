      <P>I have notice from Senator Farrelly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to clarify the funding being provided for the water supply to Ashbourne, County Meath, as his Department's allocation to Meath County Council of £2.61 million represents 90 per cent of the cost; and if local authorities will have to make up the difference.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business, I am sure the House welcomes what is happening in South Africa today because it has always been consistent in its support of developments there.  It is phenomenal that, for the first time, people aged up to 100 years can vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, Irish Shipping Limited (Payments to Former Employees) Bill, 1994, from now until 6 p.m.  We will deal with all Stages <Col N="206" /> of that Bill today.  Item 39 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I suggest 20 minutes for spokespersons on Item 1 and 15 minutes thereafter.  If necessary, we will continue Item 1 after 8 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>My party concurs with the Leader of the House; this is a great day in the history of the world as well as of South Africa.  I congratulate the millions of people in South Africa who are voting for the first time.  This marks the culmination of their prolonged struggle for liberation.  We congratulate those who have turned out in great numbers to vote despite the terrorist campaign designed to intimidate them against voting.  It is also a great day for people in Ireland who campaigned for many years for freedom in South Africa.  I congratulate Members of this and the other House who have gone to South Africa to assist, supervise and observe what is happening.  They are playing a part in ensuring the success of these elections.</P>
      <P>I again call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I also wish to condemn the murder of one individual and the kneecapping of 16 others by the IRA.  I concur with the sentiments expressed by Dr. Joe Hendron, the West Belfast SDLP MP who said the IRA shootings were nauseating and hypocritical and that it is a waste of time appealing to Mr. Gerry Adams and the IRA, but that the people must stand up to them.</P>
      <P>I understand the Local Government Bill, 1994, will be before the House tomorrow.  As all Stages of the Bill will be completed in the other House tonight, we will not have an opportunity to study it.  There are also some amendments to this comprehensive Bill.  Although we will not have the opportunity to discuss it, we are requested to debate Second Stage at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.  If that is the case, it is unfair and a misuse of our role to expect us to fully debate a Bill which will be completed late this evening, which will be printed over night and which will be before the House at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.</P>

      <P>While I support points made about the emerging democracy in South Africa, it is ironic that over the past two days citizens or emigrants from South Africa have voted at their embassy in this country.  We discussed this issue long before we discussed the need for a democratic state in South Africa.  The Government should take example from what is happening there and learn from the new state and give votes to Irish emigrants who are entitled to vote.  This House has asked for that time and time again.  South Africa is a model as to how it would work.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to recent celebrations of the First Dáil.  This week we were invited to celebrate the memory of the 1916 Rising.  It is disgraceful and cynical for the main Government party to use the celebration of the Rising as a photo opportunity for election candidates.  It is more than people can be expected to accept.</P>

      <P>I join with other Members in congratulating the people of South Africa on this historic day which sees the first all race elections.  We should pay tribute to the strong leadership of Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk.  It is the strength of that leadership which has brought this about in such a quick and effective manner.  I heard somebody from <Col N="208" /> South Africa on the radio this morning say that the spirit of reconciliation motivated both men and the people in South Africa and brought them to this situation effectively and quickly.  There may be a lesson for this country in what has happened.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Neville in condemning atrocities on both sides in Northern Ireland in the past week.  I hope we will get the kind of leadership that brings reconciliation as it has done in South Africa.  I realise the situations are very different and that there has been some positive leadership in the North of Ireland.  However, there is room for more positive and reconciliatory leadership in the North.  There is a lesson to be learned from South Africa today.</P>

      <P>I join with other Senators in congratulating the people of South Africa on this historic occasion.  For any of us who watched it on television yesterday and today it made very emotional viewing.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Neville's comments about the atrocities in the North; I also support last week's call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  The giant step taken in South Africa is an example to the people in the North of what could happen and, hopefully, we will see that in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>I also call for a debate on the recent health strategies launched by the Minister for Health, particularly to deal with women's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Members who spoke about the significance of this day in terms of the liberation of the people of South Africa.  We in this country can recall with pride the action of the young strikers at Dunnes Stores who, by their action, helped to create a change in attitude and policy here.  They paid for it dearly economically through the loss of their jobs.  We can take pride in the fact that the action of ordinary Irish people had an impact outside this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remember the many people who sacrificed their lives in South Africa, particularly noble figures like Steve Biko, <Col N="209" /> who were brutally murdered by a regime of which we, as humans, are all ashamed. We should be glad that Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk have so courageously and with initiative and broad thinking managed to create a situation in which they can be tolerant of each other. The generosity of the black and coloured people in extending a hand of friendship and tolerance to the white people who, as a group, so consistently abused the human rights of their fellow South Africans, has been remarkable.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Neville about the importance of a continuing debate on Northern Ireland and with everything he said about the atrocities committed by both sides over the last few days and weeks.  If we want to see the kind of country we would live in if Sinn Féin/IRA had their way, we need only look north of the Border over the last few days and observe the way &ldquo;justice&rdquo; is meted out by these gentle persons.</P>
    <P>Members may not realise &mdash; I just heard it on the news &mdash; that one of our colleagues from the other House, Deputy Michael Ferris, who is acting as monitor in South Africa suffered a heart attack and is in hospital.  I am sure the House would like to send its best wishes for his recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed particularly by the Leader of the House and Senator Neville. I am not going to add anything about lessons we can learn.  It is a glorious day for South Africa and South Africans. Senator Norris referred to the two young girls, shopworkers, who, to be honest, were better visionaries than most of us. They ran up a flag when it was unpopular to do so.  It is also good to record today people like Terence McCaughey, Kader Asmal, a young Senator Mary Burke, all young people with me in Cork involved in Amnesty International.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have to be inhuman not to be moved when listening last night to a man of 70 years voting for the first time in his own country.  I wish to join with others in paying tribute to Nelson Mandela. History from time to time gives us <Col N="210" /> somebody who can save the human race. I wish also to pay tribute to the outstanding courage and vision of FW de Klerk without whose courage this step could not have been taken.  It is only fair to say that it has taken the whites in South Africa a long time to see the light, but at least they had a leader who matched the vision of Nelson Mandela.  All we can do here today is wish them well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the comments made about what is happening in South Africa today, yesterday and tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I wish to support a point made by Senator Neville with regard to a proposal for tomorrow's business.  In regard to the Local Government Bill, whatever about Second Stage, we should be very careful where Committee Stage is concerned.  I say that because local government and local government representatives will always have a special relationship with this House.  Therefore, matters that concern local government should be given time for mature discussion here and I appeal to the Leader to allow this.</P>

      <P>Reference has already been made to the rights of voters abroad. I wish to deal with voters in this country and I address this matter to the Leader of the House.  It has been brought to my attention that there are approximately 400,000 illiterate people in this country, and we should know that from our adult literacy classes and everything that is geared towards them.  When it comes to an election these people are effectively disenfranchised.  My proposal &mdash; and this is the ideal Chamber in which to discuss the matter because it would take very little to rectify it but it needs proper debate &mdash; is that we should have photographs of the candidates on every ballot paper.  This practice has the agreement of Údarás na Gaeltachta candidates.  This matter could be discussed in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I support the statements made on South Africa.  It has been proved beyond doubt that it is not those who inflict most but those who can endure <Col N="211" /> most who win in the end.  That has been the case in regard to the people of South Africa.  Congratulations are due to Nelson Mandela and his people.  The enthusiasm with which the people of South Africa have used their franchise should be a lesson for the Irish people, because a high percentage do not appreciate it.  I also support the condemnation of the atrocities in the North of Ireland.</P>

When does the Minister for the Environment propose to bring in a proper statistical analysis on a sex and age basis so that, before we start any screening programmes, we will have some notion of where we will find those people whom we propose to screen?  I also support Senator Gallagher's call for photographs of candidates on ballot papers.  I am sure there was no self-interest on her part in asking for this.</P>

We will deal with the Local Government Bill, 1994, on the Order of Business tomorrow, but it is a Bill for early signature and will have to be dealt with within the next two days.  I have taken note of what Senator Howard has said and, with the agreement of the House, we will deal with Second Stage tomorrow.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure for me to be here.  This is an important Bill and one of its distinguishing features is the speed and thoroughness of the concise scrutiny to which it was subjected during its passage through the Lower House.  In the nature of things, this Bill remedies a national tragedy, a shameful interlude in our history which began in 1984 when the then Irish Shipping Company went into liquidation.</P>
      <P>In advance of my referring to my notes, I would pay tribute to my predecessor in office, Deputy Woods, who is the author of this Bill.  It is an excellent Bill which seeks to remedy a national tragedy, and it remedies that tragedy to a certain extent. However, it cannot undo the psychological damage done to men and women who were seafarers by nature and by action.  Their psychological hurt about losing their jobs cannot be undone &mdash; some of them were never to work again. Some of them got work as harbour masters or port controllers etc., but, they never returned to their original profession &mdash; the operation of ships at sea.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping had a proud record, a record second to none in the context of the Second World War.  The ships were manned &mdash; if I may use that politically incorrect expression &mdash; by men of great courage and bravery, who sailed the high seas with the goods and chattels which were so necessary to an island nation at the time; men who foresaw when they left this country to collect their cargoes that the trips out and back would be an adventure where their lives would be at stake.  For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to Deputy Woods and to my colleague Deputy G. O'Sullivan, who was of great assistance to me. One of the complaints about this Bill was that it was not brought forward soon enough.  Speed can sometimes do damage and deliberation was the key in the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to present this Bill to the Seanad and to hear Senators' contributions.  When I introduced the Bill in the Dáil last week I did so with mixed emotions.  Like many <Col N="213" /> others, I regretted the liquidation of Irish Shipping in November 1984 and its consequences for so many people.  On the other hand I am pleased to introduce a measure which enables us to give due and meaningful recognition to those most directly affected by the liquidation, the staff of the company.</P>
    <P>The collapse of Irish Shipping Limited was a traumatic event in the history of the State.  As with many other traumatic incidents its victims were wounded suddenly and deeply, without any warning. This Bill represents, I hope, a final point in the healing process.  I am not sure if it is a final point of the cure, but it is certainly a final point in the healing process, as far as legislation can do that.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited came into operation to meet the State's trading requirements during World War II.  The fortitude of Irish Shipping crews helped secure the supply of essential services to the State during those difficult years.  I fervently hope that the heroism of those involved will never be forgotten by the State.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited continued to operate and expand after the war years. For a generation of our school children the operations of the company were an important part of the geography lesson; the movement and location of its vessels in different parts of the world were followed with interest.  I recall, as a relatively young schoolboy, our geography lessons being given in the context of the location of Irish ships on the high seas.  It was instructive and I recall it with great fondness.  It is rather unusual and ironic that I should today, almost 40 years later, introduce a Bill which will lessen the hurt that was done to those people in November 1984.</P>
    <P>The State for its part was happy in the knowledge that the existence of the company ensured that a strategic fleet was available in the event of any future emergency.  However, shipping is a cyclical industry and for more than three decades the company successfully steered a steady course through peaks and troughs.  It experienced a downturn in trading in the late 1970s and early 1980s <Col N="214" /> and found it could not meet the resultant financial commitments.  The &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; followed with liquidation in 1984.</P>
    <P>The liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited was a severe body blow to our merchant shipping fleet which was effectively halved; it was also a severe body blow to the psyche of the nation.  During the time of Seán Lemass, the tide was beginning to turn, but unfortunately, when boats sank it was a huge psychological and tragic blow to the nation which, at that time, was effectively on the move.  Overnight, the bulwark which had sustained our strategic fleet had disappeared; a highly regarded, wholly State owned company had disappeared.</P>
    <P>Our merchant fleet has recovered since the demise of Irish Shipping Limited, thanks largely to incentives introduced in 1987.  The fleet, contrary to experience elsewhere in the EU, has increased from 142,000 deadweight tons in 1986 to approximately 190,000 deadweight tons currently.</P>
    <P>The decline in the fortunes of EU fleets over the past 15 years or so has coincided with the rapid growth in flags of convenience which use third world crews, often poorly trained, poorly paid and with little regard for safety.  As Minister for Defence and the Marine I have observed these third world flags of convenience countries.  They are a threat to themselves and to other shipping because inevitably these crews do not have a common language, cannot commute <i>inter alia</i> the bridge and the ship proper, are poorly trained and are generally badly prepared for the job in hand.  The increased use of flags of convenience has been a recognised factor in the increase of serious maritime accidents with detrimental effects on the marine environment and, more unfortunately, loss of life at sea.</P>
    <P>The ethos represented by flags of convenience is the antithesis of the reputation which had been earned by Irish Shipping crews and the Irish merchant fleet generally over many years; that of well trained, highly regarded seafarers <Col N="215" /> and officers operating to the highest professional standards.</P>
    <P>In spite of the advances made since 1987, the Irish fleet, like all EU fleets, is under severe pressure due to competition from flags of convenience vessels.  The position is further complicated by the array of different measures which have been introduced by member states to confront this difficulty.  Unfortunately, a huge bureaucracy is building up in certain member states as a direct result of the need to arrest the problem on the high seas.  Actions taken to date, however, have not succeeded in arresting the decline in EU fleets, and, ironically, have led to a competitive distortion between member states which needs to be rectified.</P>
    <P>Recognising these difficulties, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-1997</i> undertook to have a review carried out of the fiscal and regulatory measures affecting merchant shipping with a view to enhancing employment opportunities for Irish seafarers.  This review is under way in consultation with interested parties.  The Department, in order to inform and advance the process, plans to have an economic evaluation of the shipping industry carried out during the coming months.  It is my concern that this evaluation be done as a matter of expedition and urgency.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt, however, as to the general direction in which we wish to move &mdash; safe ships, manned by suitably trained crews; clean seas and the maximum opportunities for qualified Irish and EU seafarers.</P>
    <P>If the general public was stunned and disappointed by the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited, its employees were devastated.  The company which they had nurtured and served, some from its inception, others for many years, had collapsed like a house of cards.  The careers which many had established in the company over the years had been tragically terminated.  They faced into an insecure future with little recompense to sustain them.</P>
    <P>While the State fulfilled its statutory <Col N="216" /> obligations in relation to payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts, the company was not in a position to pay anything more.  Some of the staff were fortunate enough to be able to ease the pain caused by liquidation by securing alternative employment; others were not so fortunate.  It was most unfortunate that when the liquidation suddenly occurred in 1984, there was no place for some of the staff to go.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is two-fold.  It is a measure of recognition for service rendered to the State by the staff in question and it is also a measure of relief in relation to the loss and trauma endured because of the circumstances of the liquidation.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to speak in detail about the provisions of the Bill before the House.  These will be thoroughly discussed on Committee Stage.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide the necessary legal framework for implementation of the Government's decision last December to make <i>ex-gratia</i> once-off payments to certain former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>The commitment which I made then to introduce the necessary legislation at the earliest possible date has been delivered on with all possible speed but not at the expense of credibility or thoroughness. At this stage I am making a further commitment that following enactment of the Bill payments will be made expeditiously. The Bill outlines that payments should be made over a period of 12 months and that applications must be submitted within that period.  As soon as those applications are received they will be processed and payments made as a matter as urgency.  Enough hurt has been caused already and there is no reason this sad episode in our maritime history should not be concluded.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, certain former employees, or the representatives of deceased former employees, will be eligible for payment of a lump sum equivalent to three weeks' pay per year of service up to a ceiling of £50,000 per employee.  It is expected that just over 300 people will qualify for payment at a <Col N="217" /> gross cost to the State or taxpayers of £3.5 million.</P>
    <P>Those entitled to payment are persons who at the date of liquidation of the company, 14 November 1984, were employees of the company, having had at that date at least two years' continuous employment and who make application for payment in the manner specified. Only those former employees who are eligible for payment may receive payment. In this context, I would like to stress that applicants must have been in the employment of Irish Shipping Limited at the date of liquidation.</P>
    <P>A committee representing Government Departments is to be set up to assist and advise on the assessment of the applications, once the legislation is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The processing of payments to the former employees will follow as quickly as possible after the Bill becomes law and the committee is being set up purely and simply to facilitate and, I hope, expedite that process.  I wish to stress this point strongly in view of concerns expressed in the Dáil last week.  The purpose of the committee is to bring together the relevant expertise in the areas of redundancy, tax and finance and thus enable applications to be speedily dealt with in a fully informed and thorough way.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested widening the composition of the committee to include nominees other than departmental officials.  I think it was a fair point and I have considered the matter very carefully and sympathetically.  On balance, I do not think this will add anything to the process and I do not propose to widen the committee in the way suggested.  I can assure you, a Chathaoirligh, and all representative and interested parties, however, that the Department will keep representatives of the former employees fully informed of developments throughout the processing of applications. Explicit arrangements to ensure this will be put in place.  If anybody who is not represented on the proposed committee makes themselves known as individuals or organisations, they will be kept fully informed of what is going on in the committee. <Col N="218" /> I feel that the smaller committees, the quicker business can be done in the overall interests of what we seek to achieve.</P>
    <P>Recovery from the effects of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited has been a slow and at times painful process for all concerned.  I believe that the terms of the Bill, which are acceptable to the former employees' committee, provide, at last, a fitting and appropriate ending to a trauma which none of us would wish to see repeated.  I strongly commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is not controversial in the objective it is seeking to achieve.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill and I support its objective.  It will, as the Minister has explained, enable the State, through the Department of the Marine, to make payments to former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  I concur with the Minister's view that the fate of Irish Shipping Limited was very regrettable and I endorse his comments on the excellent service Irish Shipping Limited rendered to this country during the war years. I join him in acknowledging the courage and bravery of the people who manned ships flying the Irish flag during that difficult period.  The fate of Irish Shipping as a State company was regrettable.  The Minister has spoken of the company's highs and lows but we have to acknowledge that poor management played a part in the tragic circumstances that emerged in 1984.  We must also question the structures by which the State should have been apprised in time of the financial difficulties which led to the liquidation of the company.  It would appear from the history of the period that checks and balances which are present to a greater degree now in monitoring the performance of State companies, were not in position then and their absence no doubt contributed to the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who really suffered were the former employees.  Their losses, which for many were severe, occurred through no fault of their own.  I remember meeting representatives of the former employees on a number of occasions outside <Col N="219" /> the gates of Leinster House.  My attitude was quite close to one of embarrassment because of the situation in which these people found themselves. Although ten years have passed, I welcome the steps being taken by the Government to compensate for the trauma and loss the employees of Irish Shipping endured.  I am glad the position is now being rectified and I support the measure the Minister has brought before the House.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's observations about the position of EU fleets and the pressure confronting them from fleets operating under flags of convenience. There is an urgency to confront this situation and to resolve it.  I am satisfied from what the Minister has said that he is approaching the subject with this in mind.</P>
    <P>I said the measure was non-controversial by and large as well as being one whose objective I support.  If there was any part of the Bill about which I had reservations, it would be the composition of the committee which will advise on these payments.  As I understand section 3, this committee will essentially sift through individual applications and make decisions concerning their validity as well as the amount to be allocated. I would prefer to have seen representations from the employees. However, I know that this is a matter more suited to Committee Stage.  At present, I am simply indicating the areas about which I have reservations.  The committee will comprise five members: two from the Department of the Marine and one from the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I do not anticipate problems in that regard.  However, the remaining two positions will be filled by nominees from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners. These two bodies are not noted for their urgency or eagerness in paying grants or other money due to members of the public.  I do not want to see an impediment to the speed with which decisions or payments are made. <Col N="220" /> The Minister expressed the hope that the sums involved would be speedily paid.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the allocation of £3.5 million for 300 employees with a ceiling of £50,000 in individual cases. There will be 300 applicants, some of whom will be personal representatives of deceased employees of Irish Shipping.  I am concerned that if the committee must adjudicate on 300 individual applications &mdash; bearing in mind the composition of the committee &mdash; there will be additional delay to the already lengthy waiting period endured by the employees.  The inclusion on the committee of representatives of the employees and others who have been affected would be beneficial. However, we can discuss these matters on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I support the objective of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for the Marine, Deputy David Andrews, for introducing it and ensuring that compensation is paid to former members of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
      <P>Agreement on compensation has been delayed for about ten years.  I am delighted that it has been finalised and that the crews of Irish Shipping, who have served this nation well in good times and bad, will get their just entitlements. I remember when, after 40 years' service to the State, the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited was announced in 1984.  It was a shock, especially to people in rural Ireland and those older than I who could remember when Irish Shipping was founded and how its ships, during the economic war and World War II, ensured that Irish people would have the food, grain, fertilisers etc., that were required for survival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to take a brief look at the 40 year history of Irish Shipping Limited; it would take several hours to give the full history of the company.  Irish Shipping Limited developed from a modest start in 1941.  A meeting was held in Dublin on 21 March 1941 at Earlsfort Terrace which was, I think, known at the time as the Department of Supplies.  The meeting was chaired by John Leyden, the secretary <Col N="221" /> of the Department.  The outcome of the meeting was the formation of a national shipping company to be known as Irish Shipping Limited.  There was a total of £200,000 in shareholding: £102,000 held by the Minister for Finance, £87,500 held by Grain Importers Limited, £3,500 held by Limerick Steamship Company Limited, £3,500 held by Palgrave Murphy Limited and £3,500 held by Wexford Steamship Company. The Emergency Powers Order authorised the Minister for Finance to buy shares from the shipping companies to enable the State to have full control if required.</P>
    <P>The objectives were to acquire, operate and maintain the deep sea merchant fleet in order that the country's economy and people could survive the course of the war.  Urgency was a key word; a minimum of 30 ships were needed if the level of pre-war imports was to be maintained. When required, management of the company would be placed in the hands of the three ship owning partners.</P>
    <P>The first vessel bought by Irish Shipping was a Greek ship, the <i>Veasilios Denstounis,</i> purchased for £142,000.  The vessel had been abandoned off the Atlantic coast of Spain after an air attack. Spanish fishermen boarded the vessel, took it to their home port of Aviles and were awarded £80,000 for the salvage. Captain Moran and two other officers travelled to Aviles and took delivery of the ship on 9 April 1941.  During examination of the ship they found it had been stripped of all movable equipment, including the radio which had been confiscated by the Spanish authorities.</P>
    <P>After some repairs the vessel was released to sail to Lisbon and an Irish crew was sent to Aviles to man her.  The ship was taken to Lisbon, where she entered dry dock and was repaired.  After loading a full cargo of grain &mdash; the first load on Irish Shipping's first ship &mdash; the vessel sailed for Dublin on 1 October 1941.  On her arrival on 8 October she was renamed the <i>Irish Poplar</i> and left again on 20 December 1941 for St. John's, Newfoundland, on her first transAtlantic voyage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> The next ship to join the fleet was the <i>Irish Elm.</i> By the end of 1941 ten ships were operated by the new company. Most of them required immediate repairs and some needed extensive repair, but there were few Irish facilities for that purpose.  There were only two dry docks in operation, both in Dublin, and neither was suitable for deep sea vessels.</P>
    <P>In order to perform repairs on their vessels, Irish Shipping established an Irish Dockyard Company in May 1941, taking over the old Rushbrook dockyard which had lain derelict since 1930.  It was reactivated and by April 1942 was in use for the repair and overhaul of the fleet.  It also proved useful to the privately owned vessels of the merchant fleet and units of the marine service.  The first ship repaired in the Cork dockyard was the <i>Irish Larch.</i></P>
    <P>In April 1942 another vessel was purchased, which became the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> The search continued for possible purchases and over 100 ships were inspected, with only 15 bought or chartered by 1943. The two largest vessels operating during the war years were the <i>Irish Pine</i> and the <i>Irish Rose,</i> chartered from the US Government in September 1941.  Unfortunately both were victims of U-boats in 1942 and 1943; the <i>Irish Pine</i> was lost with all hands.  Another ship was bought in 1943 and renamed the <i>Irish Cedar</i>.  She was the last ship acquired by the company during World War II.</P>
    <P>When Irish Shipping was originally formed it was intended that the company only be used until the end of the war, however soon that came.  In 1944 the chairman of Irish Shipping announced the Government had decided the company should continue after the war ended.  It is interesting to note that during World War II the Irish Shipping Company Limited carried 712,000 tonnes of wheat, 178,000 tonnes of coal, 63,000 tonnes of phosphate, 24,000 tonnes of tobacco &mdash; many people smoked then also &mdash; 19,000 tonnes of newsprint and 10,000 tonnes of timber, as well as an assortment of general cargo totalling 105,000 tonnes.  It is also interesting to note that all petroleum imports were carried <Col N="223" /> in British flagships and Ireland did not acquire any tankers during the war.</P>
    <P>The company lost two ships during the war with a loss of 33 lives.  The crew of five ships, totalling 166 men and including 33 survivors from the company's Irish fleet, were rescued by Irish Shipping vessels during the war.  After the war Irish Shipping Limited took over the management and operation of its vessels and began the replacement of its old and obsolete fleet.  Arrangements were made to return chartered vessels to their former owners and the <i>Irish Cedar</i> was returned to Italy.</P>
    <P>In 1945 orders were placed for the construction of seven vessels at a cost of £1.7 million.  The Irish Shipping Bill, 1947, contained a provision to increase the capital of the company to £5 million, with the authority of the Minister for Finance, and a provision to pay subsidies to guarantee loans.  After the war two vessels were chartered as a stop gap until the delivery of the new vessels.  The cadet scheme for deck and engineering officers, which was introduced in 1943, was also expanded during 1947.  The first of the new vessels, the <i>Irish Rose,</i> entered service in July 1948 and made its first voyage to the Baltics under the command of Captain Frank Kelly.  It was joined in October by its sister ship, the <i>Irish Willow,</i> which was launched in May.  Over the next couple of years, these ships were joined by others which became household names, the <i>Irish Pine,</i> the <i>Irish Ash</i> and the <i>Irish Hazel.</i></P>
    <P>Two colliers were ordered, the <i>Irish Heather,</i> which was delivered in August 1952, and the <i>Irish Fern,</i> which was delivered in December 1954.  These were soon employed in Bristol, Shannon, Cork and Dublin by Córas Iompair Éireann. In December 1953 the steamer, the <i>Irish Elm,</i> entered service.  It had been ordered in a second building programme and it was the first ship in the fleet to be equipped with refrigerated cargo space. A further building programme was embarked on in November 1951 with Government guarantees.  Orders were placed for two motor ships in 1954 and <Col N="224" /> the first of these, the <i>Irish Rose,</i> was launched in 1955.  Its sister ship, the <i>Irish Willow,</i> followed soon afterwards and both were in service by the end of 1956. They were joined by the <i>Irish Fir</i> on 31 December 1956.</P>
    <P>In 1955 it was announced at the AGM of Irish Shipping that the Minister for Finance would take up the additional shares for the £5 million authorised share capital.  By 1959 Irish Shipping Limited had a fleet of 20 ships and a fleet of traditional steamers, motor ships, colliers and small goods carriers.  Their average age was five years and there was none older than 11 years.  It had a modern, well equipped fleet but the shipping world was changing.  Larger diesel powered ships now combined the modernisation of the fleet.  Irish Shipping Limited decided to sell or convert the older ships and to give old war powered steamers and older larger vessels diesel powered engines. The first ship to be converted was the <i>Irish Oak,</i> which was given a new engine, and shortly afterwards its sister ship, the <i>Irish Pine,</i> was similarly converted.</P>
    <P>During this time negotiations were taking place between the Irish Government and the ship building industry for the sale of the Rushbrook dockyard.  On 9 January 1959 a contract of purchase was signed.  The first ship to be laid down at the new shipyard on 15 October 1960, was a 14,700 tonne deadweight cargo vessel order by Irish Shipping Limited for delivery in 1962.  The <i>Irish Oak II</i> was the first ship to head for the Great Lakes in 1960 thus winning for her Master Captain J. Poole, later Commandant Poole, the freedom of the City of Duluth.  Two further vessels, 15,000 tonne boat carriers, were ordered in 1961 from Verolme.</P>
    <P>The fortunes and misfortunes of Irish Shipping Limited continued until 1971 when two events threatened to upset the careful planning of the fleet.  First, the bombshell news that the Upper Clyde shipbuilders were to go into liquidation thereby placing the building of four new ships in doubt and, second, the decision by both of Irish Shipping's partners in the ferry service to France to withdraw from <Col N="225" /> that route at the end of the 1971 season. The news of the withdrawal of the partners in the ferry service so late in the season made it impossible for the company to organise a service for 1972.  The service which had operated successfully since 1956 came to an end.</P>
    <P>Further misfortune befell the company with the loss of another vessel on 26 January 1972.  The vessel, which was on a voyage to New Orleans, was declared a loss after grounding off Nicaragua.  In the report of the year ending 1 March 1972, the chairman said he was in a position to report a profit, although it was a modest one.  In his review of the company he said that the year just ended had been one of severe difficulty for those operating on the international shipping scene. The difficulties facing the industry were escalating costs, low freight rates and the devaluation of the pound.</P>
    <P>In February 1973 the first of the new carriers entered service.  She was the <i>Irish Pine III</i> followed at two monthly intervals by her three sister ships, the <i>Irish Maple II, </i>the <i>Irish Oak III</i> and the <i>Irish Ash III</i>. Another step forward in 1973 was the formation of a new company to operate a ferry service between Rosslare and Le Havre.  This was called the Irish Continental Line and a passenger and car carrying vessel was launched on 17 January 1973.  The vessel was named the <i>St. Patrick</i> and on completion she entered service in June 1973.  It is also interesting to note that in 1973 the first female to serve as a crew member joined the <i>Irish Maple</i> as a junior radio officer.</P>
    <P>Another ferry, the <i>St. Killian,</i> was purchased in 1978.  Irish Shipping Limited had come a long way since 1966 when the company found itself in severe financial difficulties following a period of heavy losses.  There was a large debit balance on the company's profit and loss account. From 1967 to 1981 the company maintained a steady profit which continued to rise each year.  Profits in 1967-68 totalled £20,345 and, in 1980-81, they totalled £4.214 million.  Irish Shipping had come a long way since the £200,000 was invested in 1941.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> During the war Irish Shipping set up an apprenticeship scheme for training deck and engineering officers.  That scheme was in place until its liquidation.  In March 1981 Irish Shipping Limited took over the management of their smallest ship, the sail training vessel <i>Asgard II</i> which was named by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, at Arklow where she was built to take the place of an earlier vessel built in 1905 and which is now preserved in Kilmainham.</P>

      <P>In 1984 Irish Shipping came to an end through liquidation. It was not a proud day for the ships and crews which had sailed the seas and had served this nation to the best of their ability.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Irish Shipping, especially for their contribution during the war years and thereafter. At times the crews, deck hands and captains of these ship took their lives in their hands, and some lost their lives, to ensure that others would survive in times of need.</P>
      <P>I salute the former employees of Irish Shipping.  I hope that the passing of this Bill will in some way compensate them for the years of hardship.  I understand approximately 300 will benefit from this Bill, but unfortunately over the years there has also been a toll and, I understand, some 20 former employees have passed on.  It is gratifying that section 7 makes provisions for the payment of lump sums to personal representatives of deceased persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Second Stage speech in the Dáil the Minister said &mdash; and he said so again today &mdash; that his sentiments in introducing this Bill were a mixture of sadness and satisfaction.  He concluded by saying he hoped these measures would facilitate a solution to the problem and that a sad <Col N="227" /> chapter in our economic and maritime history could be put to rest.  I endorse what the Minister said and I commend the Bill.  I thank the Minister, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy G. O'Sullivan and the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, who worked hard to bring this Bill to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is ten years since Irish Shipping was dissolved and it is no surprise that this decent treatment of former employees of Irish Shipping should be introduced by this Minister.  He was a humane and forward looking Minister for Foreign Affairs and he has shown these qualities throughout his political career.  I have no difficulty supporting this Bill, which is long overdue.  I hope all Governments will learn from the mistakes made in Irish Shipping.  These mistakes were worrying and, without being divisive, I want to refer to some of them in the context in which this Bill is framed.  A number of Governments were involved, principally the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, but other Governments dragged their feet in trying to solve this problem, that is until this Minister took office.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, I tried to raise this issue on a number of occasions over the years but I was prevented from doing so by the fact that it was held to be <i>sub judice</i>.  Concern was also expressed by members of Fianna Fáil; it was not entirely a matter of party politics.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, who was in Opposition in June 1985, said:</P>
      <P>This act will never be forgiven by the generation of today or those who come after.  The Government will be written into our history books as one which reneged on national responsibilities, gave this country a bad name abroad and above all took away pride in serving under our national flag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day the Government are prepared to let the workforce of Irish Shipping walk around this city begging for a living.  Why should they <Col N="228" /> have to come to their Members of Parliament and go on their knees to beg for what is rightly theirs, having served this country in an emergency and built up a company which was the flagship of the semi-State sector?  They did everything that was humanly possible but in return the Government say there are legal complications and financial sensitivities.</P>
    <P>That was the situation in 1984-85 and in subsequent years.  The Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour pleaded legal constraints for not honouring their obligations because they felt they would be writing a long term blank cheque &mdash; that was the exact phrase used &mdash; for other employees.  They were prepared, perhaps under the instructions of the Department of Finance, to take this rather miserly and Scrooge like attitude towards the unfortunate former employees of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>I recall as many other Members will the shameful sight of members of Irish Shipping in their uniforms parading up and down outside this building with placards and handing out leaflets.  I have a leaflet here which I think was handed at the gates of this House in 1990.  It is headed: &ldquo;Irish Shipping Workers Request Dáil Éireann To Demand Report From Minister for the Marine&rdquo;. The leaflet gives a little catalogue of events.</P>
    <P>On 31 March 1987 the Minister told the House that he expected to be able to report to the House within a reasonable time.  That is political jargon with which we are all familiar.  I remember before I was elected getting Dr. Noel Browne to raise a question in the House on another matter.  He was told by the then Minister for Justice that it was being considered. Some 14 years later it was still being considered and that, I assume, was regarded as a reasonable time.  A phrase like &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; can be very flexible in political terminology.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the House he hoped to report within a reasonable time on additional compensation for Irish Shipping workers and the establishment of a <Col N="229" /> national shipping company.  On 24 November 1987 the Minister reassured the House that he would do his utmost to have this matter brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  On 3 May 1988 the Minister informed the House that he expected to have an examination of the issues completed and conclusions brought to the Government for consideration shortly.  On 30 May 1990 the House was still awaiting a report on those two issues from the Minister for the Marine.  Over two years had elapsed since the Minister informed the House that the matter would be brought before the Government shortly.  There certainly was foot dragging on all sides in this regrettable and unfortunate matter.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be divisive but there are certain things we need to learn.  We need to be open, honest and clear in looking at the situation.  The Minister referred to this but dealt with it in a way which, perhaps, was intended not to hurt sensibilities or because of the constraints of time when he said in a very general sense:</P>
    <P>Shipping is a cyclical industry.  For more than three decades however the company successfully steered a steady course through peaks and troughs.  It experienced a downturn in trading in the late 1970s and early 1980s and found it could not meet the resultant financial commitments.  The &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; followed with liquidation in 1984.</P>
    <P>That is accurate and quite clear but it lacks detail which is important for this House to consider as background.</P>
    <P>In a certain sense the Minister's statement is almost too bland because it just states a historical sequence and does not look at the reason for that historical sequence and it was by no means inevitable. I maintain that it was the responsibility of a succession of Governments which led to the collapse of Irish Shipping. I am sure the Minister and his advisers will wish to bear in mind the background so that any such happening can be avoided in the future.  I have documentation which is germane to the issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> With regard to pensions the point is made in this document &mdash; which I have had for some years but this is the first opportunity I have had to place it on the record &mdash; that there was and is correspondence available to show that the Government considered the company to be a public sector employer and the Government made sure that the board and management adhered strictly to the terms of successive national wage agreements and so on.  The Government also determined the size of the company's fleet of ships and when and where additional ships should be built.  For example, <i>M.V. Irish Spruce</i> was built in Verolme Cork Dockyard and taken over by the company in August 1983, and thereby hangs another rather instructive tale.</P>
    <P>The document continues:</P>
    <P>The day to day operations of the company was not funded by the Government as is the case with Córas Tráchtála, the Industrial Development Authority and other similar State bodies.  Apart from very infrequent injections of capital it was not subsidised by the State and had to compete in one of the few free markets of the world.  The salary, pension, leave and other conditions of employment were influenced more by the private sector than the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>That is an important point when judging the entitlement of former employees to full respect, both moral and to the letter of the law, for their pensions.</P>
    <P>The document gives a summary of the difficult period.  I listened with great interest, as I always do, to my colleague and friend Senator Fitzgerald because when he speaks on issues relating to the fishing industry or to shipping in general, he is always a mine of information.  It was quite fascinating that he gave a broad history going right back to 1941.  I want to look exclusively at the period from 1973 to the collapse of the company, although I honour the service done by Irish Shipping during the Emergency and the war years.  I take that as read and I <Col N="231" /> do not want to waste the time of the House repeating it.</P>
    <P>The problems really started because the operating policy of the company was radically altered early in 1973 when the company entered into a joint venture with a foreign shipping company, Sir William Reardon Smith &amp; Son Limited of Cardiff.  Details of the joint venture were first reported to shareholders in the company's annual report and statement of accounts for the year ended 31 March 1973.</P>
    <P>There was an inquiry by an Oireachtas Joint Committee which believed at that point that the Minister ought to have sought details of the joint venture agreement to make sure it was in line with both Government policy and the law.  Having regard to the fact that Irish Shipping was a wholly owned State company, it must be open to question if such a joint venture with a privately owned foreign company was authorised by the objects clause in the company's memorandum of association.</P>
    <P>Chartering agreements were then entered into by this company.  Irish Shipping and Sir William Reardon Smith &amp; Son Limited were made jointly and severally responsible for these chartering agreements.  In 1982 the partner company, Sir William Reardon Smith &amp; Son Limited, got into financial difficulties and withdrew.  Irish Shipping then became the principal and sole target of the equivalent of specific performance actions by the other financial parties to the agreement.</P>
    <P>There was a shrinkage in the market which compounded problems but it became clear that the company was in severe financial difficulties.  The precise details of these financial problems were reported to the Government by way of a board report in September 1982 but no action was taken for 13 months.  The Government remained completely immobile until December 1983.  That represents a lapse in terms of responsibility on the part of Government.</P>
    <P>The nine chartering agreements which led to the collapse of Irish Shipping were <Col N="232" /> entered into by the management of the company without the approval of the board &mdash; that is absolutely astonishing and I have no reason to challenge it.  Five of the agreements gave the company the option of acquiring 50 per cent of the share in the vessels concerned on the payment of additional hire.  This option was exercised by the management.</P>
    <P>I wish to say something about the management of the company.  I am not speaking about individuals but about the whole question of management.  The principal difficulty with the management was that it was largely a matter of political appointees.  The people serving were not actually qualified.  This was another break with tradition.</P>
    <P>When Irish Shipping was established all the people appointed had had a direct professional long term acquaintance with the shipping industry.  For example, in the early years of the company's existence people such as J.J. Stafford of the Wexford Steamship company, S.J.K. Roycroft of Limerick Steamship Company and others who had chartering experience, such as T.D. Hallinan of Cork Grain and Stephen McKenzie of McKenzie Coal Importers, were appointed to the board of management of the company.</P>
    <P>During the 1970s and 1980s as Governments came and went, frequent changes were made to the personnel on the board without the slightest regard for their expertise.  It was simply political gamesmanship. I want to place on the record the astonishing fact that at the time of liquidation not one member of the board had any shipping expertise.  I find that astounding.  It is not entirely surprising that a company under such direction entering into complicated long term leasing chartering arrangements came unstuck.  Partly as a result of this political interference of the worst kind some extraordinary decisions were made.  For example, it was decided by Irish Shipping to build the <i>Irish Spruce</i> in the Verolme dockyard in Cork.  One can understand the motivation, the wish to give employment and so on, but it is surely unusual for a Government to direct a company of <Col N="233" /> this kind that a vessel must be built in a specific named dockyard, particularly when at that time it was widely known that the cost of building such a ship in the existing highly competitive situation would be more than twice the cost had it been built in Japan.</P>
    <P>I understand the motivation, but in this difficult situation, when professional people who knew the shipping industry would have spotted the difficulties the company was in, it was inexcusable to force this further burden on the company. The vessel cost £26.5 million to build and there were further problems with it, because the specification of the vessel's hull and machinery was outdated, but it was the only type the Cork dockyard was capable of building at that time.  The design of the ship meant that it could only load to two thirds capacity in American ports when it was used for one of its principal purposes which was bringing coal to Moneypoint.  It was inevitably and continually a lossmaker both in capital terms and in terms of the finance generated by the exercise of its principal business operation.</P>
    <P>There are a series of difficulties in the background of Irish Shipping from which we need to learn.  We need to learn the dangers of political appointment, the dangers of appointing people who do not have expertise in a particular area.  I know the Minister will agree with me that never again should we have a situation where Government appoints a board consisting entirely of people who have no expertise at all in the area in which the company is trading.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record a list of eleven reasons given by Irish Shipping in claiming that the Government were negligent at that time.  The Government was negligent in failing to appoint a sufficient number of people with shipping expertise to the board, in making too many changes in the personnel of the board between 1973 and 1981.  It did not remove the board of directors and top management in September, 1982 when details of the company's financial problems were made known and replace them with people who would have had the <Col N="234" /> expertise to take immediate and effective action.  The Government failed to take any action between September 1982 and December 1983 to deal with the problem of charters.</P>
    <P>It failed to seek details of the joint venture with Reardon-Smith when details of the venture were revealed in the annual report for 1973 and also to monitor the operation of the joint venture. It failed to monitor properly the profitability or otherwise of the company's fleet and to regulate the limits set by the Government itself on the tonnage to be operated by the company.  It failed to question and seek details of the company's chartering policy when the annual report of the company revealed for the first time in 1979 the extent of the company's chartering operation, particularly when the Government was aware from successive annual reports that the freight rates available on the international market were well below the levels required to enable the company break even on its shipping operations.</P>
    <P>It failed to instruct the board to terminate the charter agreements where their existence became known to the Government because they were <i>ultra vires</i> the management, particularly the five charters which involved capital expenditure in acquiring a 50 per cent interest in the vessels concerned.  It allowed a management team renegotiate the charter agreements in January 1984 and approved the terms negotiated, which included the purchase of two of the vessels at values very much in excess of their market value.  I understand that the cost was £120 million to liquidate Irish Shipping, so it was a very foolish action financially by which we lost.  It did not protect us at all.</P>
    <P>It instructed the company to build the <i>mv Irish Spruce</i> without satisfying itself that such additional tonnage could be traded profitably, since the company itself had not approval to build another vessel and the building contract was designed to maintain employment levels in the yard in the short term.  It failed to avail of a further reduction in charter hire offered by the owners of the chartered in <Col N="235" /> vessels after the appointment of a provisional liquidator, or failed to negotiate a buy-out of the seven remaining charters.</P>
    <P>In other words, there was a period when a significant reduction could have been organised by a Government negotiating team, and this was clearly known. I do not wish to point blame and when I say &ldquo;Government&rdquo; I do not mean this Government.  I wish that to be quite clear.  I would be lacking in my duty to this House if I did not rehearse the sad history of events that led to this appalling situation in which decent and honourable people, personnel of Irish Shipping, were literally left walking the streets looking for their pensions.</P>
    <P>For some of them it is too late.  They will never get the entitlement which they had, but I commend this Minister on the humane arrangements he has made for their representatives to be compensated to some extent.  The amounts are not enormous, they are of the order of £3.5 million.  I am not a mathematician, arithmetic is my very worst subject, but I tried to divide 300 employees into £3.5 million. It averages out somewhere around £20,000 each, so I presume there is a sliding scale from £10,000 to £45,000 or £50,000.</P>
    <P>They are not enormous rewards, but they are justly deserved and the Minister himself deserves great credit for his characteristic humanity in introducing this Bill to the House.  Despite the somewhat negative and critical context in which I have placed the Bill, I have no difficulty whatever in commending it to the House and in saying that I welcome the fact that we have at last lived up to our obligations.  I would have been failing in my duty to the House if I had not placed on the record what the problems were and suggested some careful method by which Governments in future can avoid the kind of dangers and foolish decisions that were so unfortunately and regrettably made in the case of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin by thanking <Col N="236" /> that renowned institution, Trinity College, for dividing 300 into £3.5 million and getting the right answer.  In 1984 I had a motion on the adjournment in relation to Irish Shipping and the Minister then was Deputy Jim Mitchell.  The public gallery was packed to capacity with the staff of Irish Shipping, from the commodore of the fleet down to junior members of staff.  They all wore the Irish Shipping uniform and they sat there and listened to the response made by a Government Minister, a Government of which I was part, and very little solace was given.</P>
      <P>I never pass the monumnet on the quays in Dublin, with its big anchor, without feeling dishonourable in some way.  I am sure it will happen again that backbenchers in Governments, whether they are Deputies or Senators, are brought in and somebody will lay out a terrible vista. They have been advised by Finance, they have been advised by the Attorney General's office, the best financial experts in the world, that unless a particular course of action is taken the assets of this State will be dissipated.  Backbenchers are then asked to take a decision based on trust.  I remember quite distinctly the feeling of the ordinary members of the parliamentary parties in that Government. In some way we felt we were being bounced into this because we did not understand why the Irish Government should be held responsible by Japanese or Korean bankers to unlimited damages. We simply had to accept what was put in front of us and we voted accordingly.  It did not lessen the pain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister, Deputy Andrews, referred to Minister Woods and Minister of State, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, and I join him in extending congratulations to both of them.  I also enjoin the present Minister and his Department to that tribute, because there are people within that Department who also felt that this was a chapter in Irish history whose end had to be written with some sense of decency, that at some time some Government would have to address it.  I am glad that I happen to be on the same side of the House I was in <Col N="237" /> 1984, but instead of doing the damage, we are at this stage rectifying it.  I am glad to be part of that.  Senator Howard said it in his earlier contribution: it was a bad day to be in Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald gave us a fascinating trip down memory land which reminded me of one of the best books about Irish Shipping between 1939 and 1945, written by Robert Fisk, which details the events leading up to the establishment of Irish Shipping.  The visionary involved was Seán Lemass, who was then Minister for Supplies.  He went all over the world and bought vessels that nobody but a kamikaze pilot would go to sea in &mdash; rust buckets and wrecks.  Some of them were inspected in half sunken form in all sorts of funny places.  There were old Greek freighters, American First World War troop ships; anything that would float was what they bought and they mended them.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the long history of what they shipped into this country, but if we had a fighting force between 1939 to 1945 it was the men of the merchant navy.  Their record in terms of individual and corporate bravery is well documented. They were bombed, burned and drowned and also messed around in no uncertain fashion by our nearest neighbours, who sent them on long treks around the coast, the longest way home, in order to apply pressure on our Government to change its stance on neutrality.  I accept that we did not have tankers and Britain, out of the generosity of its heart, supplied us with some petroleum spirits &mdash; although there was a great deal of self-interest involved.</P>
    <P>I went to sea in 1957 in the British merchant navy and there was a standing instruction that whenever an Irish ship appeared on the horizon, they sent down for me &mdash; depending on who was looking for me they sent for the Catholic or the Irishman &mdash; to say that there was an Irish ship sailing by.  I would come up on deck and look at the magnificently maintained ship; they were always sparkling clean, pristine.  The colours were always bright and the Tricolour well painted, <Col N="238" /> and there was never any rust, which was amazing for what were essentially tramp ships.  They were beautifully maintained. Anytime they were in harbour and I happened to be in harbour with the Esso tankers, I would board them with great joy.  I was proud of them, and although I was sailing under the &ldquo;Red Duster&rdquo;, it was good to see the Tricolour flying fresh and clean in some of the queerest ports in the world.</P>
    <P>It was a terrible fate for the company to be allowed to go under, figuratively speaking and in reality.  It was not just the collapse of an ordinary factory.  The employees were highly specialised.  They were not fitters or engineers who get work ashore &mdash; a few of them could, some of the engineers and radio operators, for example.  However, there is no work for skilled deckhands or riggers.  Some people were skilled enough to take a 20,000 tonnes ship, leave the port of Cork or Dublin and steer it into Valparaiso almost on the hour, and they were discarded as if they were of no value.  They paraded in protest, but all one could do was to keep the head down when one passed them because one could not look them in the eye.</P>
    <P>I had personal connections with Irish Shipping.  My brother was drowned at 23 years of age from an Irish Shipping vessel and my family and I had a great affinity for Irish Shipping.  Although this Bill is being introduced, we should not expect the former employees to be grateful. They are barely getting justice &mdash; three weeks per year of service when the norm now is about six weeks.  We set the norm way back and denied them what was rightfully theirs for almost ten years.  So much so, that quite a number of them are now dead.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Department of the Marine, to the Ministers and the Government. It was a welcome gesture to allocate the money and it was an act of compassion and generosity to include the dependants of those who are no longer alive.  There is always a tendency to deal with the living &mdash; they are alive and will get so much; but if one had passed away, that was that.  I am glad in this case that <Col N="239" /> it is intended to compensate the relatives of those who have passed away.</P>
    <P>The history Senator Norris gave us in relation to the commercial operations of the company was interesting as an historical review.  Hindsight, as we know, is twenty twenty vision.  I have no doubt that lessons were learned from the collapse. We have had problems with State companies &mdash; Aer Lingus, for example, and one coming up on the inside track at present is Irish Steel.  There can be problems with State companies and it is not a question of just appointing people with no expertise in an area to the board of the company.</P>
    <P>I have often looked at Senator Norris's bailiwick, the universities, and they seem to be terribly busy awarding each other degrees.  At times it is best that an impartial, outside eye can be cast on these proceedings and I would suggest that we might have lay people on academic university boards.  They might sometimes insist that they join the real world.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Government's bringing this Bill forward. I am glad for the survivors.  I apologise to them for the ten year delay, and I hope that if there is any occasion in the future when a State company gets into such difficulty that we do not use the same remedy of which I was part in 1984.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome this Bill and pay tribute to the Minister for at last resolving the long running saga of the former employees of Irish Shipping. Since the demise of the company in 1984 &mdash; ten years ago now &mdash; more than 300 men and women, former employees of the company, have been ignored.  We are at long last acknowledging the exceptional circumstances in which they found themselves at that time and seeing fit to compensate them.  I am pleased that justice is at last being seen to be done because these are the people who suffered most during this unsavoury episode in Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As many Senators have said, we must learn from the lessons of Irish Shipping. <Col N="240" /> Irish Shipping was out of control and no adequate measures seemed to exist to track the course of its commercial decisions.  It was a hard and painful lesson to learn and the episode damaged our national image and reflected badly on us because, as legislators, we must accept the responsibility that there was a lack of awareness through the State reporting structures.  There were serious difficulties in the company which did not seem to come to light to the people who were in power.  There has tended to be different approaches as between State companies and private enterprise.  If Irish Shipping had been a private company the difficulties that existed there would have been addressed far earlier and it would never have been allowed to get to the state it did in 1984.</P>
    <P>As Members of this House we have had to pass former employees of the company picketing outside and these men and women found themselves forced to take their case to the streets for the past ten years.  They had given long years of service to Irish Shipping and they could not be seen as responsible for the ill advised commercial decisions which led to the demise of the company as they were only the workers.  It has taken many years of a long and sustained lobbying campaign for the tide to turn in their favour and that is at last happening.  The Bill makes provision for a lump sum to certain former employees of Irish Shipping Limited. It is calculated on the basis of an amount equal to three weeks pay per year of service up to the date of liquidation and is a maximum figure.  May I ask the Minister why he has set this maximum figure per former employee?</P>
    <P>I also welcome the arrangements which have been made to pay to the estates and families of former employees who are now deceased the amounts they would have been entitled to.  It is important that all who are entitled to money under this provision be informed of that decision. In addition, I welcome the establishment of an interdepartmental committee by the Minister which will comprise officials from his Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise <Col N="241" /> and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners. This will ensure the smooth administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>This Bill will finally bring to an end a sorry episode in our history.  It is a lesson to us all how a disregard for proper accountability of taxpayers' money led, not only to the demise of Irish Shipping Limited, but also to much hurt and suffering for the innocent workers in this case.</P>
    <P>I wish the former employees of Irish Shipping well and I am sure they are pleased that, at long last, their case has been met.  I also commend the Minister for introducing at last this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome enthusiastically the introduction of this Bill to the House and I hope it has a speedy passage so that the wrong which was inflicted on the unfortunate former employees of Irish Shipping Limited can be rectified.  I also have a sense of anger regarding the long delay in introducing this Bill which has meant that people who went about their business in a legitimate and patriotic fashion have had to wait so long, and even still the final proposals leave a certain amount to be desired.  I do not wish to sound churlish, however, and it will be to the eternal credit of the Minister, Deputy Andrews, that he was the Minister to process this legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not help but be moved by some of the contributions to the debate in the House today, especially that of my friend and colleague, Senator Magner, who has had personal tragedy as a result of his family's life long involvement with Irish Shipping Limited.  Senator Fitzgerald and others outlined the context in which this piece of legislation is being introduced, so it is justifiable that one should feel somewhat emotional about what is admittedly little more than words on paper.  However, behind those words on paper in this Bill lies a sorry, sad tale.  It was salutary to note that Senator Magner spoke of it being a black day in the government of this country, acknowledged as such by Senator Howard, when <Col N="242" /> the process of liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited went through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Considering the history of Irish Shipping Limited, especially during World War II, which was the company's finest hour, I recall that my late father purchased a series of books on the war at some country house auction.  As a small boy I recall going through them in great detail because they were full of photographs of the conflict.  Inevitably, being Irish, I wanted to delve into the books to find out what the Irish contribution was during World War II.  I was aged nine or ten years and was not aware of the intricacies of foreign and diplomatic policy, Ireland's neutrality during the war and the politics surrounding it.  The books, all six of them, told me a great deal which was a platform for further study regarding Ireland's position during the war and our neutrality.</P>
    <P>The one photograph which stood out from the books was of one of the vessels of Irish Shipping Limited which had been attacked by German fighters or perhaps by a U boat.  The photograph showed the ship in all its glory, and in this respect I recall Senator Magner referring to the pristine condition of Irish ships, together with the Irish Tricolour, and, placed across the side of the ship, the name <i>Éire.</i> This name was also placed on the top of ships as every effort had to be made to ensure that the ships were seen by belligerent nations to be neutral vessels.</P>
    <P>This photograph, among all the photographs of the holocaust and of the awfulness of war, is the one that stayed with me.  Fast forwarding to 1984, I was not a Member of this House but I remember, in much the same way people recall where they were on the day President Kennedy died, where I was the week that the demise of Irish Shipping Limited was announced.  My brother, who was and still is resident in Marseilles in the south of France, phoned me to tell me that the <i>Irish Spruce,</i> one of the flagships in the fleet of Irish Shipping Limited, was tied up in Marseilles harbour and that the harbour master and his officials had gone on board and had tacked onto the flag <Col N="243" /> mast the order preventing the <i>Irish Spruce</i> from leaving the precincts of Marseilles port.</P>
    <P>Despite protestations from Captain Greevy and his crew, they had to sit there, and sit they did for 18 months to two years while protracted negotiations ensued to release the three ships in the fleet of Irish Shipping Limited.  Two of these were tied up, one at Marseilles, the other, I believe, at Mombassa and the third was on the high seas at the time the order was made to liquidate the company by the then Government.</P>
    <P>The impact of that decision is still with us today and its ghosts continue to surround the House.  There was shock felt by employees and their families at the arbitrary decision taken by the then Government.  The question asked at the time was why the Government could not wait until either the ships were back at home or, in the case of the <i>Irish Oak</i> and the <i>Irish Spruce,</i> until they were out of harbour before the decision was communicated to the relevant port authorities.</P>
    <P>Not only did the patriotic, diligent and committed employees of Irish Shipping Limited, who had flown the flag proudly across the world and who had the illustrious background of keeping this country fed during World War II, have to suffer the hardship, financial and otherwise, of the then Government's decision, but they had to suffer the further ignominy of being pirated, controlled, restricted and prevented from taking their ships out of the harbours in question.  I blame the then Government for this and make no apologies for it because there could have been a better way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in mismanagement or bad management or what was going on at the board of Irish Shipping Limited, or the level of expertise, which Senator Norris so eloquently referred to, or the lack of it.  What I would like to know &mdash; and I hope the truth will come out some day &mdash; is who made the decision at that time, where and with whom did the buck ultimately stop and does that person have <Col N="244" /> any idea of the impact which that decision had?  I hope it will haunt them.</P>
    <P>I visited Marseilles on many occasions and was on the <i>Irish Oak</i> many times.  I saw at first hand many of the things which Senator Magner spoke of regarding the condition of the ship, the morale of the officers and crew, the family atmosphere in which they worked and the cruel twist of fate which found them in this far off shore wondering about their future, not knowing when they would return to their families and not knowing when this nightmare was going to end.  In this respect I wish to pay a singular tribute to Captain Greevy, whom I knew, and to all the other captains and to the crew that was on the ship at Marseilles for the manner in which they held their dignity in the face of the most severe adversity.</P>
    <P>What happened when they returned? What happened when the accountants, lawyers and legislators got together to break up Irish Shipping and cast it to the four winds?  What happened to these fine people?  They found themselves outside the gates of Leinster House.  Having already had indignity heaped on them, they had the further indignity of having to demonstrate outside this House.  Anybody who was here at the time will remember it well.  I hope those who made the decision to liquidate the company, and who passed them when entering and leaving this building hung their heads in shame.  I met those people.  They were not ciphers, numbers or statistics but people with families, hopes, aspirations and ambitions, as we all have.  All they wanted was a recognition of the contribution they made to this country.  They were not looking for a great deal.  They were looking for redundancy money, some acknowledgement in financial terms which would have helped the majority of their members who found themselves out of work.  All this happened in 1986 or 1987 at the height of the recession when things were much worse than they are now.</P>
    <P>The then Government and my own subsequent Government said no.  I will never believe a Minister of any Government who stands up here or in public and <Col N="245" /> says something is impossible.  The present Minister, Deputy Andrews, has done it. If he seems to have done the impossible, good luck to him.  He has restored faith in the democratic system.  The people who marched outside the gate were there because they believed in that system.  It took ten years for this Bill to be introduced but they can now feel a certain amount of justification.  I applaud the Government's decision.  I do not wish to turn the screw on the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  All parties were culpable in that it has taken so long for this sad, sorry saga to reach its end.  It has reached its end in financial terms but not in terms of the hardship it has caused to individuals and families.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan questioned the ceiling provided for in the Bill.  I, too, question it.  I do not wish to sound churlish.  I enthusiastically welcome and endorse this Bill, but who decided on the ceiling? Former employees have criticised this aspect of the Bill and said it is far from adequate.  I am anxious to know if the ceiling of £50,000, which I hope the majority of people involved will receive, will remain intact.  The Minister stated that the committee which is to be established will &ldquo;bring together the relevant expertise in the areas of redundancy, tax and finance...&rdquo;  Will the £50,000 be diluted to the point where it bears no resemblance to £50,000?  I know the Minister and the Government will argue this is the way things are but in this instance I ask that it not be so.  If people are to get £50,000, they should be given the full amount with a heart and a half and the thanks of the country.</P>
    <P>Some of the former employees were successful in finding alternative employment. Others who found employment subsequently found themselves back on the dole when a number of schemes, projects and employment opportunities in the shipping area, which were open to them in the wake of the liquidation, were terminated as a result of the competitiveness about which the Minister spoke.  I hope I have expressed the strong feelings which were expressed to me on board that ship in Marseilles many years <Col N="246" /> ago and the equally strong feelings expressed to me outside the gate of Leinster House, when I felt helpless and, like many Members, unable to give an adequate response.  It is a proud day for me as a Member of this House to welcome this Bill, which shows that the impossible is possible and that there will be at least some justice at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to request the committee he is establishing to review Ireland's shipping policy to consider the impact on this country of the containers plying between Ireland and Britain and onwards to the Continent.  In the last week I have become aware, as I am sure the officials have, of a concept known as piggy-backing, which will reduce considerably the cost factor for container business through Britain and on to Europe.  It means containers will now be able to use the Channel Tunnel.  Its cost was previously thought to be exorbitant but is now much less and it will be a relatively inexpensive and efficient way of shipping container traffic through the UK to Europe.  It is vital for this country and its future that we take advantage of every and any innovation in relation to this tunnel.  Perhaps the review committee could evaluate its impact on container traffic.</P>
    <P>I heartily endorse the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily, absolutely and without any reservation welcome the Bill and commend the Minister, Deputy Andrews, for bringing it before us.  My reasons for welcoming it are deep and personal.  My father was on board the <i>Kerlogue</i> when it was destroyed by British RAF fighters.  The destruction of Irish Shipping in 1984 was an act of absolute infamy, unpardonable stupidity and vandalism against one of the finest State-sponsored bodies this State ever created. The ten long years the staff of Irish Shipping have had to wait for some measure of justice is unforgivable.  The people who caused this destruction did not suffer any of the privations the workers in Irish Shipping and their families suffered.  I commend the Minister and the Government <Col N="247" /> for, even at this late stage, restoring their dignity and hope.</P>
      <P>My late father was a seaman with the Wexford Steamship Company.  He served the nation, like so many young men, through dangerous times in the war years.  In every sense he and his colleagues put their lives on the line day after day, in ships which today would not be licensed to go on the high seas, to bring supplies to this nation.  Many of his colleagues and friends and many people from Wexford and around the coast paid the ultimate price in serving this nation by losing their lives.  The ships were so rickety, old and derelict that we would not go to sea in them today.  Yet, these brave, perhaps foolhardy, men crossed the Atlantic, went to the Mediterranean and North African coast and kept Ireland supplied with vital provisions.</P>
      <P>My father's ship, the <i>Kerlogue,</i> was involved in one of the great rescues of the war.  One of the proudest possessions I have is a decoration awarded to him and other members of the crew for rescuing German sailors in the Bay of Biscay in December 1943, when they hauled hundreds of young men from the water and carried them, under threat from the RAF and the Royal Navy, to safety in Cork. This ship was rewarded for its humanitarian efforts when, on its next voyage, it was blown out of the water by the RAF, in spite of the fact that the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; stood 12 feet high on the port and the starboard, the Tricolour was blazoned across the ship and it was lit from stem to stern.  A Polish pilot, who apparently suffered from a mild form of colour blindness, thought that &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; was &ldquo;Italy&rdquo;, that this Italian ship was lit from top to bottom and that the Tricolour was the Italian flag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the war, these same brave people formed what became Irish Shipping.  It was one of our great State sponsored bodies and one of the extraordinary contributors to the building of a nation.  Now we discuss State sponsored bodies in terms of financial policy, in cold, accountants' terms as if they did not contribute anything other than pounds, shillings and <Col N="248" /> pence.  However, they gave hope to this nation and helped to build it.  These people were dedicated in a very real sense to Ireland.  They were proud of the Irish flag and their shipping company.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited is deeply ingrained in my family.  My father, uncles and cousins all sailed on the ships of Irish Shipping Limited.  Like Senator Mooney, I remember the day in 1984 when the news broke.  My father was very ill at that time &mdash; we did not know it then but he was, in fact, terminally ill.  I remember him saying with great bitterness how, in the name of God, could an Irish Government do this to its own people.</P>
    <P>The decision was incomprehensible in its stupidity because Irish Shipping Limited was a fundamentally good company. It had contributed profits for many years and sailed in the black when big shipping lines were in the red.  For the 15 years before 1984, the cargo rates went down every year, yet Irish Shipping Limited kept very much to the fore.  It provided this nation with a corps of young men trained to the very highest standards of seamanship.  It was the national training college for all the people who went to sea in those years after the war.  Ships such as the <i>M.V. Oak,</i> the <i>M.V. Spruce,</i> the <i>M. V. Elm</i> and the <i>M.V. Pine</i> served this nation well.</P>
    <P>The liquidation itself was carried out in a particularly hamfisted way.  I cannot understand what happened and I could never comprehend the way it was done. It was astonishing that, as the previous speaker said, ships such as the <i>M.V. Spruce</i> were allowed to tie up in port and be impounded by a harbour master's summons tacked to the mast instead of being told to come back to the home port to protect the investment.  As we all know, one of those ships, which was new at that time, was sold virtually for its scrap value a few years later.  We, as a nation, would not even give the unfortunate men who had served with Irish Shipping Limited the dignity of coming back to the home port before we sacked them.</P>
    <P>We should not need to be here passing this Bill today.  We, collectively, on <Col N="249" /> behalf of the Irish people should be saying how deeply sorry we are for what we inflicted on those people.  Senator Mooney made the valid point that for years we walked in and out of this building and saw those men and their families outside.  It was a shame on all parties, none of us could take any pride in that. We have now, at this late stage, given them back a bit of their dignity.</P>
    <P>I hope, like Senator Mooney, that the £50,000 ceiling will not be lowered because that is not a handsome payment. I say to the Minister of State, whom I welcome here, and to the Minister to think of the payments which some of the management staff in that company got just before its final demise and weigh them against the payments the workers will get now.  There should be no question of this small compensation being taxed away.</P>
    <P>My father has gone but, on behalf of all those people, I thank the Minister for what he has done here today.  It comes ten years too late but better late than not at all.  The fleet is lost, the skills are dispersed and the hopes have all gone. We should make certain here today that this can never happen again in companies that serve this nation.  It was a day which will go down in the annals of history as one in which none of us will take any pride.</P>
    <P>I have often said, and I do not say it with a sense of bitterness, that I hope the people who took the decision to destroy Irish Shipping Limited can live with themselves.  Their jobs were secure and their families had what we would all want for our families.  However, the last ten years have been ten years of misery for men and women who served this nation well and who deserved much more.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill and I am very proud to be here today.  However, I am just a little sad that it has taken so long for justice to be done.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions which, in keeping with my experience of this House, were thoughtful <Col N="250" /> and constructive.  A question was asked in regard to the £50,000 ceiling. This was agreed with the representatives of the former employees at a political level.  It affects only the senior management level of the company; I understand it involves about five people.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a watershed in the process of recovery from the collapse of Irish Shipping Limited.  For the former employees and their families it signals the end of a long, dark tunnel.  I hope that the light it sheds will herald a new day for the former employees, the shipping industry and the community in general. We can now remember the past and respect those who served us well without looking over our shoulders.  Instead we can turn our attention to making the best of the future.</P>

      <P>I have a couple of queries on this section.  I do not want the Minister or anybody else to feel that I am raising these points in a niggardly fashion or to delay the legislation.  My main purpose is to get clarification and to ensure that there are no bottlenecks in the procedure we are putting in place to enable the payments to be made as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 2(2), the method of calculation is three times the former employee's normal weekly remuneration, within the meaning of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  What is the <Col N="251" /> advantage of making the calculation on the basis of the normal weekly remuneration as against the annual remuneration?</P>
    <P>Section 2(3) states that the lump sum shall not exceed £50,000.  The Minister has indicated that only five people will be involved.  However, Senator Mooney asked if we are talking about £50,000 net or £50,000 subject to tax.  That is very important.  I am in no position to crow from this side of the House but we are dealing with very niggardly sums which should be exempt from tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Howard. In terms of what these people lost, £50,000 is a paltry sum.  I understand the legal arguments which were put forward. I spoke to every Minister for Transport since 1984 on this issue because I was deeply, personally affected by it.  I was moved by the plight of those people and £50,000 is a paltry sum in terms of what they lost.  It is a very small sum and for the ships' officers £50,000 is nothing because they were the people who could not get new jobs.  Like Senator Howard, I would hope that this £50,000 will not be watered down in any way.</P>
      <P>I commend Senator Howard for making the point that the method of calculation was less than generous because in other redundancy cases people who served this nation less well than the staff of Irish Shipping were given more generous multipliers.  A multiple of three is not generous.  It would be a terrible travesty, and something that I personally would find it difficult to stand over, if it was to be whittled down in any way.  I would hope the Minister will be as generous as possible.</P>

      <P>Senator Howard and Senator Roche have more or less nailed their colours to the mast, if I could use that colloquialism.  I endorse their comments. We are all aware that these families had to incur substantial debt while they were campaigning outside the gates of this House in the hope that they would get some remuneration.  The fact that this <Col N="252" /> Government has now delivered does not detract from the reality of ten years of waiting.  What were they supposed to do in the interim?  How were they to live? Some were fortunate, as the Minister pointed out, in obtaining employment but the vast majority and their families had to suffer all the financial difficulties and hardships consequent on the 1984 decision.  That is why I believe there is a moral obligation on this Government to ensure that when a figure is mentioned, that is the figure they get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question raised by Senator Howard related to the method of assessment of income.  The method used will be the same in terms of what pay counts as remuneration as per the 1967 Act, except that the £250 per week limit which applies in normal redundancy cases will not apply here.  In relation to the payments being subject to taxation, my understanding is that only about a quarter of the payments will be subject to taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I am constrained by the party Whip and have to support this, but I want to put on record the fact that I am deeply opposed to it. This is a charade.  Give them their money. Do not say you are giving them something and then take 25 per cent off the top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to record my disappointment. If ever there was a case for the State to act generously this is it.  I realise that there have been so many problems with precedents being argued backwards and forwards over the years but the reason we did not compensate the Irish Shipping people up to now, let us face it, has been the argument that it was going to leave us vulnerable to suits from other people who were involved in the debacle; in particular from the Chinese who ravaged the company not once but twice.  I feel very strongly about this.  We should not be in a situation where the tax take will diminish the compensation <Col N="253" /> by 1p or £1.  As a nation we owe this to these people.  We are not doing them any favours and if we respect service to the nation we owe it to ourselves to be generous.  I feel disappointed. Like Senator Mooney I am constrained by the Whip but if there was ever an occasion when I felt like bucking the Whip and saying &ldquo;To hell with it&rdquo;, this is it.  We should have another close look at this.</P>
      <P>I do not know what are the functions of this committee but when it comes into operation we should look at some device to create the transfer of these paltry sums to these people and their families.  I know people from Irish Shipping who were made unemployed that day; people whose sons and daughters were denied the kind of education those men went to sea to provide them with.  I know from my own family experience what it is like to be a child of a seaman; your father is missing for God knows how many days and months of your life.  Children came into the world, grew up, went to school, their mothers reared them and then they were denied the chance to educate them further.  We owe these people and we should pay this money without taxation. For God's sake, do we have any self respect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Senator Mooney and Senator Roche.  I became worried about this aspect when I saw the actual composition of the committee, which is covered in the next section.  The Minister said he anticipated that only about a quarter of the payments would be subject to tax. Did I hear him correctly?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to make some gesture of decency following the turmoil, upset and disturbance suffered by these people.  The Minister, Deputy Andrews, said it was anticipated that the total fund would come to £3.5 million and would be distributed among approximately 300 employees with a ceiling of £50,000.  If we are prepared in this day <Col N="254" /> and age to give £3.5 million what does it represent?  Have the calculations already been done?  Is that figure the net cost to the State?  Or are we representing ourselves as providing £3.5 million when we know that a sizeable chunk will be returned through another channel to the State?  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty but unless he can try to meet us on this point, I would suggest that the remaining Stages of the Bill be taken on another day, even though I am against creating delay here.  We are not looking for a major sum.  I do not want us to go away today and say we are being generous and decent in giving £3.5 million when we know that a substantial part of that will be returned to the State by another avenue.  I would suggest that between now and the next Stage, the Minister should try to find a way to ensure that this sum will be a net figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board the points made in relation to tax deductions from the payments due to the former employees of Irish Shipping.  I should point out that the deductions are in accordance with tax law.  We are dealing with a Bill which enables the Minister for the Marine to make payments to former employees of Irish Shipping.  As was stated by some Members, the interdepartmental committee which will be put in place by the Minister includes an officer nominated by the Minister for Finance and an officer of the Revenue Commissioners but my understanding is that deductions which would be due would apply to about 25 per cent of the payments. They relate to tax law.  We are dealing here with a Bill which is being presented by the Minister for the Marine.</P>

Subsection (4) says that &ldquo;Schedule 3 (other than paragraphs 1 and 2 thereof) of the Act of 1967 shall apply,&rdquo; Section 2 (2) refers to &ldquo;within the meaning of the Act of 1967&rdquo;.  Is the Minister referring to that?  If so, could he clarify it?  Could he also clarify Schedule 3 of the 1967 Act?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the situation of the Minister and Minister of State with regard to the payment issue.  I have no doubt about their personal views.  No Member of the Dáil, Seanad or nation would wish to see one shilling clawed back from these people.  I accept the Minister's remarks regarding the expertise on the committee.  I will not seek a vote on this matter because I understand there has been agreement with the representatives of the Irish Shipping families. If that was not the case I would be in a difficult situation.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible for us to have a role in monitoring how the committee operates?  I agree with Senator Howard that it would be an appalling travesty if some of this money was clawed back.  It is a small amount; in terms of the hardship that has been caused to individuals, it is a paltry amount.  Is it possible to ensure that there is no taxation?  I am sure the Minister has the answers to these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answers but they may not be the right answers.  The Senators are raising the issue of fair play because these individuals have waited so long for their entitlements.  The company went into liquidation in November 1984 and this is now April 1994.  The Senators are saying that there should not be a claw-back on the awards.  Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to mislead the House in this regard but I understand that tax must be paid in these circumstances. The law of the land must be accorded its place.  I agree that it is unfortunate.  However, it is the reality. The Senators are threatening to call for divisions.  That is a matter for them. Despite our words on Second Stage about courage, heroism and tragedy, we must face reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Divisions are not being threatened.  We recognise the Minister's commitment and achievement in introducing <Col N="256" /> this measure.  However, we wish to ensure that the best possible deal emerges from this legislation.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss the law of the land and tax law.  This Bill is before the House today because the law of the land could not rectify or deal with the problems of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was the will of the land, not the law of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Tax law was referred to earlier.  Since the component parts of the law was incapable of dealing with the problem that arose it was necessary to introduce this Bill.  These circumstances have the same application to tax law.  If we must deal with the void that existed by introducing this legislation and if it is the view of the Minister and the House that we should treat these people with absolute generosity, the insertion of a section would meet with the unanimous approval of the House.</P>
      <P>I also wish to discuss the £3.5 million. We wish to understand this matter more clearly because, having been informed that there is an agreement with representatives of the employees, we are constrained in our discussion of it.  As there is an agreement with which the employees are satisfied, there is a natural reluctance on our part to interfere with it. However, how has this settlement been represented to them and what do they believe they are accepting?  Has it been suggested to them that the Government is prepared to make £3.5 million available to resolve this case?  Have they made their calculations on the basis of £3.5 million without recognising that a substantial portion of that amount will return to the State?  It may be that the employees and their representatives are not being offered £3.5 million.  I would like clarification on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator makes a good case.  We are compassionate people.  This Bill was introduced to deal with a problem which the State should have dealt with ten years ago.  I understand that, subject to the most transparent <Col N="257" /> scrutiny, the amount of £3.5 million was agreed by the workers and the representatives.  In those circumstances and subject to examination, I would have thought that they understood that the tax laws would take effect.  We have consulted the Revenue Commissioners and they have insisted that the law must be applied.  However, the law of the land today will be applied more generously than it would have applied in 1984.  That is an ascertainable fact.</P>
      <P>I cannot and the Seanad cannot constitutionally amend this Bill in a tax context. It is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and ask its approval.  However, I will not take that course.  I do not wish to delay the House or be tedious as I believe in getting to the core of a matter.  We cannot amend the tax law in this Bill.  It would require further amendment of tax law to exempt the payments from taxes.  I understand that about 25 per cent of all employees will be subject to taxation.  The £50,000 ceiling applies to about five of the 300 people who will benefit from this Bill; the five are former senior executives.  The compensation will be taxed at more favourable rates than would have applied in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of taxation is covered by the relevant Acts and it would require amendment of those laws to implement the wishes and desires of the Senator.  I do not deny that he has made a strong case but in the circumstances of the time and place, and given the urgency with which we must deal with this legislation, I cannot accede to his request.  I would <Col N="258" /> genuinely like to do what he asks but I cannot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that constitutionally we cannot take a financial decision in this House, as the Minister said.  As I did before he returned to the House, I commend the Minister for introducing this Bill.  He has given us back a sense of dignity because we as a nation debased ourselves in what we did to Irish Shipping.  The Minister is now compensating for the last ten years.</P>
      <P>When the committee looks at this issue, it might consider some points.  We are discussing an <i>ex gratia</i> payment which not merely compensates for the loss of a job at a particular time but for the hardship suffered in the intervening period. If there is any compassion in the Revenue Commissioners, this will be seen as a cumulative flow of income and as such it would attract a much lower tax burden, if any burden whatever attaches.</P>
      <P>While the Minister is present, I express pleasure at the Bill.  Like him, I would prefer if we could be more generous, but the Minister has given these Houses back a sense of self-respect on this issue.  The committee could regard this <i>ex gratia</i> payment as a cumulative flow of cash over time to compensate for all the losses over a ten year period.  If Revenue was inclined to look at it in that way and calculate using an averaging process over the ten years, there would probably be no tax burden.</P>

I also understand litigation was initiated or promised at some stage by Irish Shipping employees.  Perhaps they proceeded with it and failed, or on advice decided not to proceed.

In graciously conceding the point to Irish Shipping employees, the Minister may be signalling that they would have been successful in a court case.  Any damages that would have been awarded in a court case would not have been subject to tax; the employees would have received the full amount.  This relates to the point made by Senator Howard, that the Minister or the Government is in a position to do something about this issue.  The Minister has already said he will not do so.</P>

      <P>We are all compassionate, none more so than Senator Mooney.  It would be good if we were all as compassionate as him.  Senator Roche's point is an interesting one.  When this committee looks at the implementation of the requirements and the applications received, there might be a case for giving effect to his proposal.  The committee would do well to look at his suggestion, but I cannot give any guarantees or undertakings.  I am not certain the law can do as the Senator wishes or can address the issue he raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question about a court case, I know from my practice as a hazard barrister, dealing with insurance companies, that any sum of money awarded to a victim is tax free.  I assume the same principle would have applied if Irish Shipping employees had taken a case and succeeded, although an element of risk would be involved.  As Senator Roche has pointed out, they did not have to go through the trauma of a case.  Any proceedings can now be withdrawn on the basis of the Bill before us.  Any <Col N="261" /> awards that might have been made would not have been taxed, but that is engaging in speculation.  If a case had gone forward and was successful, they would have received awards; but again one can only speculate how positive their day in court might have proved.  If I had been their adviser, my opinion would be that on the balance of probabilities they would have done well.</P>
    <P>My information as to why such a long period has elapsed between liquidation and the introduction of this Bill is that it was necessary to formulate an arrangement acceptable to the former employees, while at the same time ensuring the State was not exposed to other claims.  This Bill provides specifically for former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>

      <P>I have a number of queries. When I raised my question on section 2, I explained to the Minister of State at the Department of the Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy O'Shea, that I was not raising queries to delay the business of the House but to ensure a smooth mechanism which would deliver earlier results.  I am concerned about speed in relation to this Bill, which perhaps is stymied by certain provisions in section 3.  Section 3 states that &ldquo;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this Act, appoint a committee&rdquo;. How soon will that happen if we pass the Bill this evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> The functions of this committee are explained in detail in section 6.  Each one of the 300 applications must be examined and processed by this committee.  In relation to section 3 and the constitution of this committee, I have no difficulty accepting two officers from the Minister's Department, or an officer of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. However, I question the two other proposed appointees.  In relation to the last proposed appointee, and following our discussion on section 2, I am concerned that this appointment may reflect the interest of the office represented rather than the requirements which the Minister expects from the committee.  Section 3 states that the &ldquo;quorum for a meeting of the Committee shall be three&rdquo; and that &ldquo;The Committee may act notwithstanding one or more vacancies among its members.&rdquo;  However, there may only be two.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the part of the section which states that &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Committee shall regulate its own procedure and business.&rdquo; Is it wise to allow a committee to regulate its procedure and business when concerns have been expressed about its constitution?  Would it not be in the people's interests, whose needs we are attempting to deal with, for the Minister to advise the committee on how it should conduct its business?</P>

      <P>We may be falling into a trap and imputing wrong motives to the officer of the Revenue Commissioners nominated by the Revenue Commissioners. The Senator is suggesting that this officer will do his worst as far as the employees of Irish Shipping are concerned.  Perhaps that is the main motivation behind the Senator's wish to purge this individual from the committee, as set out in the legislation.</P>

      <P>He may have a font of passion like Senator Mooney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also said that the Minister should regulate the committee's procedure and business.  Like the planning laws, the Minister should be at arms length from such proceedings because the moment something goes wrong, or someone thinks he is being offended, or somebody gets more than someone else in the legal share out of £3.5 million, the finger is pointed at the Minister and political <Col N="264" /> charges are made in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am not underrating politics or politicians.  In fact, I have the highest respect for them and I do not share the sophistication that we are a &ldquo;low lot&rdquo; unable to regulate our affairs.  I have the highest regard for people who have the guts to put themselves forward before the people and be elected.  The people who criticise us would not be elected across the room.  However, the further the Minister is away from the involvement of this committee the better.  These responsible individuals will be able to regulate their own business and procedures in the full light of public scrutiny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister because it is important for them to be at arms length.  I do not share the cynicism or sophistication, which was the Minister's eloquent phrase, about politicians being a &ldquo;low lot&rdquo;.  There must be a distance between this committee and the Minister because in Ireland there is always the suspicion that a political string has been pulled if one person gets one shilling more than another.</P>
      <P>There are no representatives of Irish Shipping personnel mentioned in this section.  The Minister said he would consider an outside person for the committee, but he then decided against it. Was consideration given to representing the workers or the ex-workers of Irish Shipping on the committee?  Were the representatives in agreement?  I disagree with Senator Howard's point about the Revenue Commissioners.  If a tax efficient means of payment were to be decided, it would be important to involve the Revenue Commissioners from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am subject to correction, but I understand consideration was given to the presence of a trade union member on the committee who would represent the views of the workers.  On balance, it was decided, presumably with the agreement of the individuals concerned, to accept the committee as presently constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> Why is a committee being established? Is this another layer of bureaucracy?  Will it involved additional Exchequer expenditure? Why are the former employees not being given a voice on the committee? The purpose of the committee is to enable the Minister to have the benefit of the advice and expertise of those with experience in the areas of tax, redundancy and finance when deciding on applications.  Rather than creating an unwanted layer of bureaucracy, this should facilitate the efficient and speedy processing of applications.  There will be no Exchequer expenditure involved.  The committee is not a representative group, but a process whereby the assessment of applications is assisted and expedited by the availability of expert advice.  It is not a haggling forum, and I do not say that with disrespect.  If a person representing the interests of former employees were to be nominated to the committee, the liquidator, IBEC or the Irish Chamber of Shipping would also wish to be represented and this would delay the process.</P>
    <P>When going over the nitty-gritty of the committee with civil servants, this question as to why former employees of Irish Shipping were not represented arose. The reason was &mdash; this may or may not have happened &mdash; that if A was represented B and C would also want to be represented.  At the end of the day the committee would have been an amorphous mass.  I believe in small committees which do business and produce conclusions quickly.  A large committee leads to a sense of ponderousness which inevitably produces a conclusion it does not understand and those it seeks to advantage are disadvantaged and may not understand the deliberations of such a committee.  This would be too complicated.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister responded by saying the Government would be generous, but to me the most important person on this committee would be the representative of the Revenue Commissioners.  I would be more concerned about an officer of the Minister for Finance being on the committee because &mdash; the Minister would be the first to testify to this &mdash; it is more difficult to get money from the Department than it is from the Revenue Commissioners. Revenue Commissioners deal with people at the coalface and would, therefore, be generous and would stretch existing laws to their limits.  Based on the Minister's remarks, I presume that the two officers appointed by him would articulate the views he expressed here.  I have no difficulty with the composition of the committee and it should not be held up for that reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said in regard to the representation of workers on the committee.  For ten years Irish Shipping workers lobbied, campaigned and harassed public representatives in order to see justice done. I have no doubt that it was the realisation on the part of the Government that it could not walk away that resulted in this Bill.  An opportunity should be given for representation at this time and I support that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to see Senator Sherlock because I was in the other House with him for a long time.  If one appoints representatives of the workers or the trade unions to the committee &mdash; I am not in any way diminishing either &mdash; there would been calls for other representative groups such as the Irish Chamber of Shipping, IBEC and others to be appointed.  We had to draw a line somewhere.  Warts and all, it is the best I can do in these circumstances. However, I appreciate the Senator's point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister is making his own argument.  I would be happy with a small committee.  I am <Col N="267" /> motivated by the speed and generosity with which we can distribute the £3.5 million to the 300 former employees. Given that each case must be examined by this committee, I would have thought that a committee composed of members from the Minister's Department or the Department of Enterprise and Employment, as representatives of employees affected, would be adequate.  Perhaps I was unfair in what I said about the Revenue Commissioners, but, despite what Senator Mooney said, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are reluctant to give out cash.  The Minister wants to ensure the committee is at arms length from him and he has a valid argument in that regard.  The committee will be required to set its own procedures and business.  If the committee is properly motivated, there will be no problems, but if it is not, it could take some time to examine the 300 cases.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4(1) states: &ldquo;An application for the payment of a lump sum under this Act shall be made in writing to the Minister within 12 months after the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  I am sure the Minister has considered ways of ensuring that each person, or the descendants of deceased employees, will be made aware of this Bill.  We are dealing with 300 people and the descendants of some of these people.  It would be reasonable to assume that some may be outside the jurisdiction and may not be aware of this legislation within the 12 month period &mdash; although I note in subsection (3) the Minister may extend the period.  Has the Minister considered means such as newspaper advertisements to convey this to those entitled to benefit if they follow the correct procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="268" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has expressed a concern.  However, it is reasonable to assume that those affected by this Bill know about its existence.  It is unlikely that those concerned would not be aware of this.  I have no doubt but that the committee will take note of what the Senator said.  In the event of people being identified as entitled to money under this Bill and if some people or their personal representatives have been left out, action will be taken.  This is a valid point and it is interesting to note that section 4 (4) states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the Minister may, if he or she thinks fit, extend the period of time referred to in said subsection (1)&rdquo;.  This subsection preempts or anticipates the point made by the Senator.  It indicates flexibility in the application of the Bill because it says the Minister may extend the period of time referred to in said subsection.  There is no limit on that time, it could be 12 months, two or three years.  That is how subsection (4) may be interpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister finds at the end of the 12 month period that applications have not been received from 20, 30 or 40 of the 300 former employees, subsection (4) will provide him with an opportunity to extend it.</P>
      <P>I seek clarification on subsections (5) and (6).  Subsection (5) sets out how the Minister deals with a proposal in relation to an application.  Subsection (6) states:</P>
      <P>A person who has been notified of a proposal under subsection (5) of this section may, within 21 days of receipt of the notification, make representations in writing to the Minister...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shall then take certain specified steps.  To put it in layman's terms under subsection (5) when the Minister proposes to refuse an application he is basically saying no.  However, the person is then given the opportunity of going back to the Minister.  If I interpret this correctly, the Minister is being asked to decide the matter twice.  I would have assumed that the refusal in subsection (5) would be by the committee rather than <Col N="269" /> the Minister and that the appeal would be to the Minister against the committee's decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be taken that, in the first instance, it would be the committee which proposes to refuse an application for the payment of a lump sum under the Act and then notify in writing the applicant of the proposal and the reasons for it.  Then it goes to the Minister who has a sort of appellate jurisdiction to decide whether there is any reasonable grounds to continue the refusal.</P>
      <P>I imagine there is third opportunity for the individual who is refused, which is an application to the courts.  If he is dissatisfied, he would probably take legal advice and resort to the courts.  There are a number of avenues open to the individual who is refused an application. However, having read the Bill, people applying would take account of the conditions under which they make their applications and not make a vexatious application.  They would make an application based on a sustainable case that cannot be refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>While money is never adequate compensation for the loss of a job or a career, the eventual decision to make the payments is a vindication of the workers' determination.  In what circumstances would the Minister envisage refusing an application under subsection (5)?  What are the parameters or criteria to be laid down for people who will be making applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is clear on the conditional nature of applications. The individual must have been in the employment of the company for a certain period and must have been an employee at the date of liquidation.  Section 6(2) states:</P>
      <P>The Committee shall investigate an application referred to it for the purpose of ascertaining&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  whether the applicant is a former employee of the company or <Col N="270" /> the personal representative of a former employee,</P>
    <P>(b)  the period of service with the company of the former employee concerned,</P>
    <P>(c)  the normal weekly remuneration of the former employee concerned</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>That of course would depend on the amount he would be getting out of the £3.5 million package in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>(d)  whether a lump sum is or is not payable to the applicant,</P>
    <P>(e)  the calculation of such lump sum (if any) or,</P>
    <P>(f)  any other facts relevant to the payment of the lump sum,</P>
    <P>and shall, as soon as may be, prepare a report in writing on the result of the investigation and shall transmit the report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 6(2) sets out the functions of the committee investigating an application in determining in each case whether the applicant is a former employee or the personal representative of a deceased former employee, whether the applicant qualifies for payment, applicable service and pay level, amount payable and other facts relevant to the payment and it must report thereon in writing to the Minister. There is a fail safe mechanism there and the conditional nature of the application is set out clearly in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the involvement here is at arm's length?  He went to great trouble on section 3 to say he was operating at arm's length.  May I assume that the existence of the committee is to advise and assist and that there is not an interventionist element involved here?  Is it the committee who makes the ultimate decision on the bona fides of the application or the Minister?  Is the Minister satisfied that the sort of consequences he outlined on section 3 will not be heaped on the Minister for an interventionist approach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals with false information.  It begins by saying: &ldquo;A person shall not give false information to the Minister...&rdquo; Subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to show that he or she did not know and could not, with the exercise of reasonable care, have known that the information was false.</P>
      <P>Information is either false or it is not. The wording in the section is raising a level of uncertainty in my mind.  I cannot visualise the situation envisaged here. Perhaps the Minister in his capacity as Minister and with his Law Library background might be the best person to explain to a layman like myself the nature of the safeguards in subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not presume to have any more or less wisdom than the Senator.  However, this section illustrates the flexibility of the Bill.  It states:</P>
      <P>It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to show that he or she did not know...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the person had no <i>mens rea</i> or evil intent.  The person may base the application on a set of circumstances he or she thought were absolutely accurate but which could, following close scrutiny by the committee, subsequently turn out to be incorrect.  That would not be false information because there was no intention to represent false information as being true.  It was a mistake or <Col N="272" /> an error of fact based on the proposition that the individual making the application thought he or she was giving the correct facts.</P>
    <P>However, where a person specifically launches into an application which he or she reasonably knows to be false, the application will fail.  Section 5 (3) is a generous subsection and reflects the thread of generosity that runs through the Bill.  However, we should not be taking too much credit ten years later; it should have been done earlier but unfortunately it was not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the extensive and open consultations already carried out by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Environmental Protection on the development of waste management policy, as well as the new EU co-financing <Col N="274" /> envisaged by the Government for waste infrastructure; and, recalling the important commitments of the Programme for a Partnership Government to a waste recycling strategy and new waste legislation, urges the Government to advance these as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne, who has special responsibility for environmental protection.  I mean to speak to this motion by way of a case study to use a sometimes over tried academic device.  I want to illustrate the urgency of a national waste disposal programme by reference to something which is happening now in County Wicklow in the Ballinagran-Coolbeg area.  The Minister will be familiar with this area since he passes through that beautiful part of my county each day.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we urgently require a national programme for waste disposal and management, and that we have for far too long let this matter lie fallow without attention.  The House should welcome that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for environmental protection whose record so far proves that he cares about these matters. In the performance of his official functions he illustrates that he is conscious of the difficulties we face in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have a green and pleasant island almost by default.  Considering the extraordinary behaviour we have engaged in as a nation over the years, it is a mystery that our country is still green and pleasant. We dump waste here and there; we are untidy in virtually every regard; we approach civic buildings and properties with total disdain and we behave in a way which would give vandalism a bad name.  This is also done at official level because among the worst polluters are our public authorities, the sanitary authorities charged with the task of protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>In the case study which I will mention to the House we have a well intentioned but, to my mind, entirely misplaced waste <Col N="275" /> disposal strategy.  I will give credit at the outset to the fact that at least in Wicklow County Council some thought is given to long-term waste disposal but the credit ends there.  From herein it is downhill. By way of illustrating the nature of the task that faces the Government, and to assist the Minister and the Department in drawing up a national strategy to deal with the crisis, I will give some statistics.</P>
    <P>County Wicklow currently generates 42,000 tonnes of waste per year for disposal by the local authority.  It is conservatively estimated that by the year 2010 100,000 tonnes of waste will be generated and disposed of each year in County Wicklow.  They are horrific statistics, particularly if one looks at the analysis of the waste.  A huge proportion of it is material which could be recycled and a large amount of it is material which should not come into the waste cycle at all.  We are literally destroying ourselves under a mountain of detritus.</P>
    <P>One man's waste is another man's opportunity.  The proposal in County Wicklow is that all the waste generated in the urban areas along the east coast will be gathered together.  There will be some recycling and some reduction in the level of the waste, and this will take place in a number of specific locations.  I do not wish to be too tedious or to go into too much detail, but what will happen in the north-east of the county &mdash; the area where I live and get the majority of my votes &mdash; in towns like Bray and Greystones is that the waste gathered through the waste disposal services of the local authority will be brought to one central location in Bray.  It will be sorted there and rags, paper and a certain amount of other recyclable material will be taken out of it.</P>
    <P>The other waste will be compacted, put into 40 foot long containers, driven to Ballinagran via the Beehive crossroads &mdash; a hostelry well known to the Minister. I know he is an abstemious man but, nonetheless, he will have dropped in there from time to time to engage in Mr. Clancy's hospitality and have a refreshing cup of coffee and a healthy Wicklow <Col N="276" /> sandwich.  The waste will be driven to one of the most pleasant agricultural valleys on the east coast, the Ballinagran valley, and the county council proposes to buy a 300 acre site in that valley, high up on the hill and create what is euphemistically called a landfill site; it is the first above ground landfill site I have known.  In this 300 acre site they are going to dump up to 70,000 tonnes of rubble a year.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the impact that will have on the valley, its infrastructure, agriculture and tourism, and on the life of its residents.  At present about 0.75 million gallons of milk for the Dublin market are produced in Ballinagran.  Bailey's Irish Cream draws a substantial proportion of its supply of cream from many of the east coast suppliers from along that valley.  About 40,000 tonnes of the milk annually is produced on the boundary of the proposed site of the dump.  These are extraordinary statistics but they do not end there.  Annually, £100,000 worth of mushrooms is produced in the immediate vicinity of the dump site.  There is a large scale organic vegetable production unit across the valley from the site, probably one of the biggest on the east coast, and certainly one of the biggest south of County Dublin.  In addition, there are beef and suckler farms adjacent to the site.</P>
    <P>Regarding the impact which this so-called waste management policy will have on the life, including the agricultural life, of this valley, it must be accepted that where there is dumping above ground there is no control on carrion crows, animals and rodents invading the site and carrying material, some of it infected, from the site to surrounding farmlands, destroying those farmlands and livelihoods. In addition, how is it possible to have a quality food image if people are advised that the biggest single landscape item in our area is a 300 acre dump?</P>
    <P>The reason this landfill site or dump is above ground is that leachate will be drawn from it by forces of gravity.  This will be put into large containers, brought up and put into the waste disposal system which is currently being built, with the <Col N="277" /> assistance of EU funding, in Greystones and then pumped into the sea.  Having poisoned our land, having set up what will undoubtedly be, <i>per capita,</i> the biggest and most expensive waste disposal system in the country, the fish in the sea will be poisoned also, for good measure.</P>
    <P>These proposals are not perpetrated by some cash hungry, profit mad private entrepreneurs, but originate from the public sector, a statutory agency which has the statutory responsibility of protecting the environment of County Wicklow, the garden of Ireland, to be named from here on, at least one part of it, as the compost heap of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a viable factor in this extraordinary valley, which is a beautiful place.  There has been big investment in the area, such as John Clancy's hostelry, The Beehive, which has been upgraded by substantial investment, and attempts to develop holiday chalets.  Among the other scenic amenities of the area, one of the biggest dumps in Ireland will be on offer.  The river which flows through the valley is fish rich and unpolluted because the farmers in the area happen to be environmentally conscious.  There has never been a fish kill, but our statutory agencies are going to ensure that this record does not last much longer.</P>
    <P>The situation in Ballinagran/Coolbeg has arisen because we do not have a policy on this issue in this country and we have been deficient in this respect.  If there is to be a waste disposal strategy, we would all accept that the first thing to do is to fight waste at its origin.  Go into any supermarket and look at any supermarket basket and it will become apparent that a huge proportion of the bulk in the basket is waste.  It is packaging which is superfluous, expensive, adds to the cost of every item consumed and does not add anything at all to the consumer's wellbeing.  The packaging goes home, it is stripped from the product and becomes a chore as money has to be spent to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>We have developed a cavalier attitude towards packaging in this country and towards the other alternative ways of disposing of waste.  For example, a huge <Col N="278" /> proportion of the waste that goes into each and every bin could be composted and reduced down to something valuable, organic and environmentally friendly.  Instead, we throw all this waste on dumps and produce countless millions of tons of poison every year.  We produce leachate, which is among the most poisonous substances that could possibly be produced, chemical cocktails which could destroy an entire eco system, and we charge people to do this.</P>
    <P>The situation at Ballinagran/Coolbeg is merely a symptom of the problem we have in this country regarding this issue. To give another example of the madness proposed for this 300 acre site, the site is above the level of most of the surrounding houses.  Most of them draw water from pure wells in the immediate vicinity of Ballinagran/Coolbeg.  They will not be drawing the water from those wells for much longer.  Big dairy farmers depend on plenty of clean water to get their product to market and to be clean.</P>
    <P>I do not mention this to attack a fine public authority.  However, it is misguided on this issue and it has been allowed to go off the rails by an executive system which gives too much power to non elected personnel and by the fact that there is a deficiency in terms of a national strategy.  What is happening in Ballinagran/Coolbeg arises in no small part because of arrogance at official level. There has been no consultation with the local community and no consultation with the elected councillors.  These did not arise until after the proposals were launched.  At present there has been a series of sales talks taking place around the country.</P>
    <P>This case illustrates the deficiency in our thinking about waste.  The first priority must be waste reduction.  The second priority must be the recycling of the material which is currently being dumped.  The third priority must be in respect of material which can be compacted in order to be composted, following which an alternative use must be sought for it.  Alternative ways of disposing of the small residual must then be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> I am grateful for the opportunity to deal with this matter in the House this evening.  I could have dealt with it at far greater length, but I suppose it is merciful from the point of view of the House that I did not have the time to do so. However, I compliment and commend the Minister on the work that is currently being undertaken.  We have an urgent need in this country, if we are to develop our tourism, our standing as a quality food producing nation and to retain the quality of life we currently enjoy, to establish a waste recycle, waste management programme which is comprehensive and is put in place with the support of the people, particularly the absolute support of those who have to live near landfill sites &mdash; a programme which at the end of the day makes sense. The current way in which we handle the problem of waste makes no sense at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister to the House.  When Senator Roche mentioned Ballinagran I thought of the place by the same name in County Limerick, and I am pleased that there is another place with this name.</P>
      <P>Waste disposal is a dirty term to everybody, and everybody in every county in Ireland has a problem with it, especially when trying to locate a site for it.  Everybody wishes to dispose of their waste somewhere, but nobody wants it.  When a suitable site is located, there are objections from people living three, four or five miles from the site because they have concerns about the traffic to and from the site and the possibility in rural areas of traffic jams being created when their children go to school and so on.</P>
      <P>I have been involved with waste disposal over the years and have undertaken work in trying to identify sites for the people of my own County Kerry.  At present I am proud to say that County Kerry has a state of the art landfill site established and operating.</P>

      <P>We visited the site in Athlone, a Chathaoirligh.  You had a wall around it and we were not happy with what was inside the wall.  We will invite you to the official opening of the site in County Kerry.  There is no wall around it.  It is surrounded by trees, is nicely landscaped and so on.  In this respect most of the counties are envious and jealous of what has been achieved in County Kerry.  It took us a long time to construct the site and substantial amounts of money were invested in the project, including a considerable amount of EU funding.  If all the other local authorities wish to take a junket to County Kerry, I will issue the necessary invitations to enable them have a good look at what we consider to be one of the best landfill sites ever established.  I thank the local people and the county manager and engineers for their help in developing it. Every county can have a similar site. Recently our county manager invited all the other county managers in Ireland to Kerry to look at it.  I am proud of this site.  For many years we struggled to establish it.</P>
      <P>Many people could do a great deal to prevent dumping of rubbish.  The newspaper industry could take a leading role in waste disposal by starting a recycling operation.  This would lead the way for others to follow suit.  When one is on the way home late at night one sees people who have bought six, eight or 12 packs throwing empty drink bottles on the side of the road.  Pressure should be put on the drinks industry, which could play a leading role by offering 1p or 2p for the return of empty bottles which could be recycled.  Supermarkets also have a role to play.  I am sorry Senator Quinn is not here this evening because he could lead the way.  He could encourage a system whereby people could return bags to supermarkets for recycling.  When people go home after shopping they have to go through a large quantity of paper to unpack the items they have bought. Supermarkets could play a major role if they are interested in protecting the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> Senator Roche spoke about tourism.  I am proud of this country and what it is doing to attract tourists.  I am proud of our countryside.  People living in the countryside should also be proud of it and should not throw their rubbish wherever they feel like doing so.  Tourists have told me they like our environment, green grass, cows and so on.  It is an absolute disgrace that rubbish is thrown by the sides of our roads.  People should be very conscious of this problem.</P>
    <P>When I speak about supermarkets and the drinks industry, I am speaking about the leading people in them.  They should support the protection of the environment because it is their rubbish which is being dumped on the side of the road. They have an important role to play. Local authorities also have a major environmental role.  They should take a leaf out of Kerry's book.  I invite all of them to Kerry to look at the state of the art landfill site there, of which I am proud.  They should see how we are going to develop and promote the site and have organised the bringing of all waste to it. I guarantee that if all the other local authorities followed Kerry's example, we would have a clean environment.  I welcome the Minister and the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State with responsibility for environmental <Col N="282" /> protection have engaged in extensive and open consultation on the development of waste management policies.  This motion is very important.  It is important to have discussions but it is more important to implement their conclusions.  I am concerned that members of the Government party, represented by Senators Roche and Kiely, have had to put down a motion urging the Government to advance the procedures vital to the environment and the development of a waste management policy.  Are the Senators on the Government side concerned that the Minister is dragging his feet?  Do they feel he does not realise the magnitude of what is involved?  I concur with the motion and urge the Government to advance its proposals immediately.</P>
      <P>In this and every other country we used to have a simple way of dealing with waste.  We dumped it on land, in the sea and into the air.  With expanding populations and economies, this practice became unacceptable and we recognised the need for treating waste.  Such treatment incorporates any method, technique or process which changes the physical, chemical or biological character of waste.  The emphasis is on the generation of less waste and the consumption of less raw materials and energy.  It must be recognised that good environmental performance is an economic issue.  Failure to conform will result in the loss of export markets, with consequences for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of waste management will get more and more expensive. I look forward to going to Kerry on the business trip mentioned by Senator Kiely.  I do not think the word &ldquo;junket&rdquo; is appropriate.  I am sure the Senator meant a business trip to see what they are doing in Kerry.  Once a landfill is full, it must be fully rehabilitated.  This even applies to an old style dump, where rehabilitation can be extremely difficult and expensive.  Toxic waste can only be disposed of in a specially constructed and licensed toxic facility.  I understand none exists at present.  In the absence of toxic waste treatment facilities toxic waste must be exported under strictly controlled <Col N="283" /> conditions.  This option may be closed off in the future if the EU insists that each country deal with its own toxic waste.  This will be another very expensive process.  The costs of constructing, running and rehabilitating modern landfills can be ten or 15 times more than those of the old style dumps in real terms. Whereas capital moneys are available for development of landfills, the enormous running costs will impose a major financial burden on the local authorities in the future.</P>
    <P>The EU demands that the principle of the polluter pays be applied.  If so, costs to dump users are likely to increase dramatically.  Recycling is very desirable but is not as economical as dumps and landfills.  New directives on landfill sites should be before the European Parliament in the very near future which will make developing, operating and rehabilitating landfills even more demanding.  I remind the Minister and the Government that this is extremely expensive.</P>
    <P>Many EU requirements are already in force where new landfills are concerned. Waste must be segregated.  Certain types are no longer acceptable at dumps.  Offal, most liquid waste, toxic or dangerous wastes must be dealt with separately. Landfills must be controlled and managed at all times and, I understand, must be closed when not supervised.  All refuse dumped must be covered with earth or similar material each day.  Dumping must be in cells with each cell rehabilitated as a new cell is opened for dumping.</P>
    <P>The complete landfill site must be lined with plastic if it contains leachate &mdash; Senator Roche has already referred to this matter &mdash; that is, contaminated water which in the case of traditional dumps can run off and contaminate surface water, lakes, rivers etc. and percolate downwards to contaminate groundwater.  This leachate must then be collected and pumped to a specially constructed treatment plant or to a suitable sewage treatment plant.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to refer to a dump in my own area, Carrowbrowne, and to remind the Minister that this dump, beside an expanding city, <Col N="284" /> is filled and overtaxed.  There is much concern on the part of the local people and I ask the Minister to take cognisance of any representations which may come from Galway city or county regarding the future of this dump at Carrowbrowne.</P>
    <P>Enormous costs mean larger and fewer landfills, often one per county.  If this is the situation, then people will have to travel many miles to the dumps.  There will be ongoing maintenance of landfills and this will be extremely expensive, especially coming from limited local funds.  Centralisation and a limited number of landfills will increase the waste transport costs.</P>
    <P>I have gone through a number of issues this evening with regard to dumps and waste in order to outline the enormous expense which will be involved.  It is important that in any developments the Minister would take heed of these enormous costs which will be imposed in the future on local authorities.  It is essential that local authorities would be reimbursed for any developments which may be undertaken as they do not have the resources to comply with the European restrictions and laws.  Regardless of what regulations or stipulations come from Europe, unless the local authorities, which at the moment are almost on their knees, get the requisite funds they will not be able to implement these proposals.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, the Government and the Members who tabled this motion to take cognisance of the fact that if all these regulations are to be implemented, the Government must provide the necessary funds.  Otherwise we will be in breach of European law, which we do not want to happen.  I support the motion but I would like to remind the Minister and its proposers that they must now provide the funds to implement the proposals which they are advocating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford)</i>:  I thank the Senators for putting down the motion and for their very positive remarks.  Many speakers mentioned green Ireland and it is important that we would enhance the perception abroad of <Col N="285" /> Ireland.  Tourism and the food industry were mentioned and these are areas which we can build upon and utilise the perception of a green Ireland for marketing purposes.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty identifies &ldquo;the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources&rdquo; as one of the leading objectives of EU environment policy.  Waste issues are central to this concern.  Our attitude to waste prevention, recycling and management is a symbol and a test of our commitment to sustainable development.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason that Agenda 21, the major product of the Rio Conference on Environment and Development, places such emphasis on the need for environmentally sound waste management.  This must clearly encompass the safe disposal and recovery of wastes.  However, waste management must also, according to Agenda 21, seek to address the root of the problem by attempting to change patterns of production and consumption.</P>
      <P>This motion is, therefore, timely.  It reflects the much higher political priority which waste issues now enjoy, both in Ireland and elsewhere, as well as the complexity of finding solutions to them. In response, I will briefly describe some of the major problems and challenges associated with waste today; review the efforts and progress made by the Government in the last year to address these challenges; and describe the major initiatives on waste management which the Government are about to take in the form of the national recycling strategy and the Waste Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious problems are facing all industrialised countries in the waste management area.  Domestic waste generation <i>per capita</i> has been increasing in most countries.  The EU Fifth Environment Action Programme notes, as a disquieting trend, that despite increased recycling throughout the Community, the overall volume of municipal waste increased by 13 per cent between 1988 and 1992.  Municipal waste generation in Ireland has also been increasing at a similar rate.  Latest figures show that an increase of some 30 per cent in household <Col N="286" /> waste took place between 1984 and 1993. Hazardous waste production has virtually doubled in the same period.</P>
    <P>While Irish society has been increasing its production of wastes, there is also a much greater concern than previously about the problems of waste disposal. Landfill currently enjoys a bad press; only a very small number of new local authority landfills have been brought on stream during the 1990s.  Senators have heard about the state of the landfill sites in Athlone and Kerry, which are probably the major landfill sites developed in latter years.  In effect, the provision of landfills is becoming costlier and more politically difficult.  With the adoption of the strict provisions envisaged by the draft EU landfill directive, it is certain that the overall number of Irish landfills, which now stands at 120, will have to be considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>A more critical public awareness now exists about waste disposal practices, as well as a consensus that waste must be managed in a more planned and environmentally acceptable way.  At the same time, it is clear that waste management must be addressed on the basis of the well established principle of shared responsibility.</P>
    <P>Waste is not created by Governments or local authorities.  Municipal waste is a by-product of the way in which householders, consumers and the industries and services which cater for them, now organise their transactions and exercise their preferences.  Hazardous wastes are a by-product of industrial activity, which society is anxious to accommodate for the jobs and the economic development which it brings.  Hospital wastes arise from the provision of services strongly demanded in all our communities.</P>
    <P>All sectors of society have some stake in the provision or enjoyment of these activities or services.  These sectors must correspondingly accept their responsibilities for managing the wastes which these processes generate.  All Government and local authority efforts at improving and finding new solutions to waste management must be based on the premise of shared responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The Programme for a Partnership Government set out a number of objectives in the waste management area, notably the development of a national recycling strategy and of comprehensive legislation on waste.  These are major and complex undertakings.  In preparation for them, and consistent with the principle of shared responsibility, the Minister for the Environment and I have conducted a series of broadly based and open consultations.</P>
    <P>As regards industrial and hazardous waste, I launched a specially commissioned discussion document in October 1993 on the promotion of cleaner manufacturing technologies in Ireland. This document identified a number of obstacles to the uptake of cleaner technologies by Irish companies.  These include lack of awareness among managers, the absence of proven cost/benefit in relation to initiatives, problems of technology transfer and available investment capital, particularly in small companies and, in certain sectors, external constraints such as validation requirements relating to new processes.</P>
    <P>The report proposed a new promotional strategy, based on a co-operation between relevant State agencies, higher education colleges and industry associations.  It also recommended pilot waste audits and other demonstration projects in selected companies and further investigation of technologies which might have wide application across industrial sectors.  The report's recommendations are now being analysed closely, as well as the comments which we have received on it, with a view to incorporating it into a wider national waste strategy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment also arranged, in co-operation with Trinity College, Dublin, for a major consultative conference in January 1994 on hazardous waste management options.  The proceedings of this conference, which had a large and widely based participation, will assist the development of hazardous waste related proposals within the Environmental Services Operational <Col N="288" /> Programme, 1994-1999 which is being finalised in the Department.</P>
    <P>As regards municipal waste, I have been operating on a number of fronts. First, I have continued assistance towards demonstration projects in the recycling area.  Between 1989 and 1993, £1.6 million has been provided by the Department of the Environment in grant aid to some 50 recycling projects.  This year we will be allocating a further £500,000 in recycling grants.  Kerbside Dublin and Rehab have been notable beneficiaries of this policy, and recycling rates have shown a steady increase.  Glass recycling in Ireland has now reached a level well in excess of 20 per cent and there is a national industrial capacity to cope with continued expansion in this area.  Recycling of cardboard stands at 16 per cent while the recycling of aluminium cans has increased to 16 per cent by virtue of increasingly efficient selection arrangements and despite the lack of domestic recycling facilities.</P>
    <P>Second, a conscious decision has been made to direct some EU co-financing within the 1994-1999 period towards improvement of waste management and infrastructure.  This allocation of EU funding is the first of its kind by an Irish Government and two significant local authority proposals &mdash; a baling station in Ballymount, South Dublin, and a landfill at Castleisland, County Kerry, as you heard earlier &mdash; are at present benefiting from Cohesion Fund assistance.</P>
    <P>Third, I have carried out an extensive and prolonged process of public consultation to provide input to the Government's national recycling strategy.  A report by ERM Consultants, &ldquo;Towards a Recycling Strategy for Ireland&rdquo;, was published early in 1993 and submissions were invited on it.  To complete the process of consultations, a national recycling conference was held in December 1993 with the participation of experts and all interested parties.</P>
    <P>I believe that this extended process of consultation has served to raise awareness in many different sectors about the need for recycling and to stimulate thinking on practical ways and means of advancing it.  I have received submissions <Col N="289" /> and suggestions from many different interest groups and operators which will help to inform the recycling strategy now being completed.</P>
    <P>Three initiatives are now being finalised which will each provide a major contribution from the Government to better waste management in Ireland.  These are first, the development of a solid waste sub-programme within the next environmental services operational programme; second, the formulation of a national recycling strategy; and third, the preparation of comprehensive new legislation on waste.</P>
    <P>The Government is making specific provision under the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999</i> for the improvement of waste management systems and infrastructure.  We will offer new EU co-financial support under the operational programme for improving recycling infrastructure, for the development of waste management strategies at county and/or regional level, and for the provision of hazardous waste infrastructure. The public and private sectors will be eligible to benefit on the basis that better waste management capacity needs to be encouraged both within local authorities and the private waste industry.</P>
    <P>The Government has been preparing a national recycling strategy for some time. The new strategy will have two broad objectives.  First, to encourage the prevention and reduction of municipal waste and to give greater support in appropriate cases to re-use systems.  The second objective will be to guide waste recycling in Ireland from its present output to levels consistent with the targets which we are undertaking.  These are demanding targets.  They mean that in relation to packaging waste Ireland must double its present recycling performance within a five year period and increase it four-fold within a ten year period.  We will also have to intensify efforts to recover or recycle suitable non-packaging wastes such as newsprint, certain farm plastics and organic wastes.</P>
    <P>An important purpose of the strategy will be to identify responsibilities for recycling as between different players in <Col N="290" /> society and to give guidance on organisational arrangements for achieving higher recycling levels.  Local authorities, industry, business, voluntary organisations and the consumers will all have roles to play.  However, a key principle involved will be that of producer responsibility.  In general, it is right that those who benefit commercially from packaging and other products contributing heavily to the waste stream should bear a major responsibility for the pollution they cause.  Consumers must also shoulder appropriate responsibility given that they too use and benefit from packaging wastes.</P>
    <P>As the strategy is nearing completion &mdash; we intend to publish it next month &mdash; I envisage it as a rallying point for all interests in society involved in the waste chain, and I hope that it will consolidate and intensify support for recycling.</P>
    <P>Last November the Government approved my proposals for a waste Bill and drafting is now at an advanced stage. There are three broad reasons we need comprehensive new legislation on waste at this stage.  First, we require a wider and more flexible national framework to implement the growing body of legislation on waste which has been adopted at EU level over the past decade.  We also need provision for tougher penalties than are now possible under the European Communities Act, 1972.  Regulations under this Act are limited to imposing penalties at District Court level.</P>
    <P>Second, we need to bring local authorities, who form a major part of the Irish waste industry, under licensing control in relation to their waste operations.  I intend that the Environmental Protection Agency will take on this licensing function and that the waste Bill will generally expand the Environmental Protection Agency's role in relation to waste management.</P>
    <P>Third, the waste Bill will have to provide support, in the form of mandatory recycling plans and other obligations and incentives, for the promotion of recycling as envisaged by the new national strategy. My Department is working urgently <Col N="291" /> to finalise the Bill and I hope to publish it by the summer.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned supermarkets, plastic bags and the problems they cause.  I recently had a meeting with the supermarket owners around the country and we put forward a number of proposals and suggestions to them as to how the problem could be dealt with. They have taken our views and ideas on board for consideration and will report back to us very soon.  We also had a meeting with the newspaper industry who seem for different reasons to be reluctant to become involved in any form of recycling or waste management.  We put a number of proposals to them also and we expect some kind of response in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Landfill sites were mentioned &mdash; Senator Roche mentioned one in Wicklow. The acquisition and operation of landfill sites is a function of local authorities. I hope that when planning new landfill sites local authorities will have full and open consultation with the public.  It would be totally unacceptable to me, as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, and to the public if decisions were made behind closed doors.  That arouses suspicion and fear.  I am not referring to Wicklow in particular.  However, I hope local authorities which intend to develop landfill sites will have open and frank discussions on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to a case in Galway.  If Galway Corporation forwards proposals to the Department of the Environment they will be given consideration. I am sure a case could be made for EU funding.  New landfill sites are subject to EU directives and their construction must be state of the art. Senator Kiely has encouraged people to visit Kerry to see the new landfill site there.  He would appear to be on a promotion tour for Kerry.  However, the landfill sites in Kerry and Athlone are certainly on a par with other new landfill sites in Europe.  I hope that future landfill sites will achieve such a standard.  Landfill sites which are eyesores and health hazards <Col N="292" /> must become a thing of the past.  In future years many of the 120 landfill sites which we have at present will be closed down.  We hope to have a realistic number of about 50 which can be managed and developed properly and which can provide a good service.</P>
    <P>The licensing, operation and closing down of landfill sites will, in the not too distant future, become the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency.  It will have the power to ensure that old landfill sites are closed down properly.  It will also have the power to ensure that new landfill sites will be opened and operated properly.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and I look forward to hearing more views in the course of this debate. We in the Department of the Environment do not have the monopoly in managing waste.  It is a shared responsibility and we are open to the views offered by organisations, local authorities and others.  We must develop the recycling strategy and adhere to the regular EU directives on waste management. We will do that and we look forward to the support of the Seanad in that work.</P>

      <P>This is an important issue.  I am delighted that the motion was put down by the Fianna Fáil Party, whatever its motives at this juncture.  I was heartened to hear from Senator Kiely that my native county is pioneering aesthetically attractive landfills and I never need an invitation to return there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it was frightening to listen to Senator Roche's case study.  It appears to be an off the wall example of how things must not be done.  The Minister said that such a case will not be possible when the Environmental Protection Agency is up and running.  One wonders if the rush in Wicklow may have been an act of conscious defiance of the Environmental <Col N="293" /> Protection Agency and what may happen if it does its job properly.  The Programme for a Partnership Government specifically includes under the authority that will be given to the Environmental Protection Agency&mdash;</P>
    <P>supervision of local authority operations, including tight controls on landfill sites to minimise visual impact and disruption of the locality, and the development of guidelines/advice on environmental impact assessment, with the regulations being strengthened;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Minimising visual impact&rdquo; is obviously not what the Wicklow initiative had in mind.  One wonders what its motivation was at that time.  I hope such a proposal will not be remotely conceivable much less implementable when the Environmental Protection Agency is in charge.</P>
    <P>I was also heartened to hear the Minister refer to the necessity for open consultation and to hear him say that it will no longer be possible to make decisions behind closed doors, although such decisions have been a long standing objective of politics.  One hopes we will move in that direction.  There is a fear that the Environmental Protection Agency could be used to restrict the free flow of information rather than to enhance it.  I hope that will not be the case.</P>
    <P>I had one reservation about the Minister's speech which was a holding operation although it was useful and instructive.  He said that hazardous wastes are a by-product of industrial activity.  That is somewhat fatalistic.  Of course they are a by-product of industrial activity.  However, the manner in which they are handled and the degrees of pollution that may arise from them depend very much on legislation, goodwill and technology.</P>
    <P>The Greenpeace report on Cork harbour which was published last week would give one cause for concern.  If the figures cited in the report about the breaching of the agreements reached between the firms and the local authority are correct &mdash; and if they are not correct <Col N="294" /> the error should be exposed instantly &mdash; they are quite frightening as an indication of the indifference of many firms to abiding by such agreements.  One wonders if we are a nation of such mendicants that we must quietly swallow the transgression of these agreements for which there has been no prosecution.</P>
    <P>As far as the companies are concerned one might inquire why they cannot observe best practice.  The quality of performance varies widely among them. Some companies have an excellent record in the Cork harbour area.  It is not clear why other companies involved in the same activities believe they can and must get away with breaching agreements they have made.  It shows, I fear, an unacceptable disdain for the character of law enforcement in this country.  I hope that will be examined closely and that Cork harbour will not be expected to bear the burden of public pollution in the foreseeable future.  That report, assuming it is correct and stands up to scrutiny, is a sad indictment of current practice in a major area of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to sound unduly negative. Public consciousness is rising and the Government can play a constructive role in raising consciousness on this important issue.  I have two questions for the Minister. The Programme for a Partnership Government states that the EC directive on freedom of access to environmental information will be fully implemented. At what stage is full implementation?  If it is not fully implemented, what is the schedule for such implementation?  In terms of informed public discussion, where a balance must be struck between environmental and other factors, it is very important that the fullest possible information is available and that the public is confident that it is not being hoodwinked and that information is not being held back.  To what extent have we implemented the provisions of the Paris Convention, signed by the Minister for the Environment in 1992, which committed us to phasing out the use of certain dangerous chemicals by the year 2000?  It is now 18 months since that was signed <Col N="295" /> and we should be told whether we have begun to comply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Lee for sharing his time with me.  The Minister spoke about the management of waste, but we could make a start in this House. I would not suggest that ministerial speeches are not always thought provoking and interesting, but why are they only printed on one side of the page?  The technology necessary to print on both sides is available and it is a good way to start putting our own house in order.</P>
      <P>I feel I should defend my colleague, Senator Quinn, from Senator Dan Kiely. If he shopped in Senator Quinn's emporium, as I do, he would know one takes as many items to the shop as one brings home, between bottle banks, tin can dumps and plastic recycling bins.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed in the way the Minister alluded to hospital waste in his speech.  This is a serious problem and it is not enough to say such waste arises from the provision of services strongly demanded in all of our communities.  In this city there is an enormous controversy about what to do with hospital waste, how many hospital incinerators to build, where to build them, and what to do with radioactive and chemical waste from hospitals.  The Minister's reply is not a sufficient response.  I work in hospitals so I know they are most valuable institutions. However, extraordinarily dangerous products come from them and we must deal with them, from a biotechnological and a chemical point of view. Often we do not examine the biotechnological aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Lee's remarks about areas where there has been serious waste and chemical pollution.  The Minister mentioned legislation which is due but if we enforced current legislation we would go a long way towards reducing an enormous number of problems from pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries. A much greater effort has been made to enforce the provisions in the agricultural sector.  Senator Lee asked whether we <Col N="296" /> were such mendicants that we would put up with anything.  As Senator Roche said, we might destroy our heritage by taking the industrial shilling to get what we see as valuable opportunities for employment. Current measures should be enforced while we await the introduction of future legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. If ever a motion was timely, this one is.  However, I am worried that the clock is ticking in Dublin; if something is not done soon by the four local authorities the city will be in crisis.  For various reasons, not wholly attributable to the Minister, the local authorities in Dublin put all their eggs in one basket by planning one large dump in Kill.  The residents of Kildare were supposed to accept municipal waste and one cannot blame them for protesting.  Planning permission was refused, but the application is under appeal.  If the appeal is defeated it is no exaggeration to say waste disposal in Dublin will be in crisis.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech and its thrust would be in accord with green politics.  The environmental buzzwords are recycle, reuse and reduce and the Minister addressed those issues.  I would not disagree with Senator Henry about Superquinn, but I object to the amount of packaging in supermarkets.  Every item is excessively packaged.  This issue, which concerns marketing, advertising and money, must be tackled.  If we do not, the level of waste will not be reduced. The Minister said: &ldquo;Despite increased recycling throughout the Community, the overall volume of municipal waste increased by 13 per cent between 1988 and 1992&rdquo;.  That will be the position in Ireland and worldwide unless we take the hard legislative decisions to direct companies to reduce packaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that landfills have had a bad press, but such criticism is only beginning.  Dunsink dump is in my electoral area; it receives a good deal of bad press and is probably well known to Members.  That was set up by a local authority and I am a member of its successor which now runs it.  If that <Col N="297" /> is an example of how a local authority disposes of its waste, it is unacceptable and the people of Finglas cannot be expected to endure such management.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to take a legislative stand to ensure local authorities put their houses in order.  Holes have been carved in the land and many problems have followed.  Waste was not covered; travellers have set up camp in close proximity to many landfill sites in Dublin and often they were scavenging on those sites.  The potential dangers and health hazards to those living beside the dumps are unbelievable.  I am happy to see the bad press continue until those responsible correct the problems.</P>
    <P>We should discuss what is happening because local authorities have not tackled the problem of waste.  They have done nothing and have a bad reputation because of the landfills they have operated. The landfill in Senator Kiely's area is an exception to the rule.  When a local authority attempts to open a landfill there is a massive number of objections, which is understandable.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke on national radio about the proposal made by a private company in my area to open a state of the art landfill on a 336 acre site.  That project seems like a knee jerk reaction; it may have been prompted, but it is unacceptable in the area I represent.  The people of Blanchardstown will not accept a super dump even if it is state of the art. They will continue to object to landfill sites.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that, as the Minister says, waste is not created by Governments or local authorities but by all of us as consumers and householders and we do not want to deal with it.  Nonetheless, proposals made at local authority level to segregate waste and offer recycling services have been knocked down.  When my colleagues in the Green Party mooted these suggestions they were laughed at, criticised and held to ridicule by county management.  Our course has been set in a particular direction &mdash; we will simply continue to bury huge amounts of rubbish. Unless local authorities realise that is not the way to proceed and central <Col N="298" /> Government decides waste must be reduced, we will still have major problems. The Minister said landfill is becoming more costly and politically difficult and that will continue to be the case.  He says the level of waste will be reduced, but I ask him to say specifically how that will be done.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to recycling, and I pay tribute to Kerbside.  I thank the Minister and the Department of Enterprise and Employment for their support for this scheme.  Kerbside operates in my area and it is a service which has been demanded by the public and to which they have adjusted.  It is strange that the more successful it becomes, the more reluctant the local authority is to support it.  I hope central Government does not adopt the same position.</P>
    <P>Recycling is identified as being the saviour, but it is a costly solution to our waste problem.  Dublin County Council decided to use recycled paper and to make it available for processing free of charge.  The result was that the product was being supplied to a company which then decided it was too costly to recycle. Dublin County Council took back segregated waste and dumped it in landfill sites at great cost.  I want waste management, as does the public, not because it is a good idea, but because I do not want a 336 acre dump in my area.  Waste management will be a costly option and the Minister must clearly state this fact. One is talking about costs of approximately £30 per tonne, which could increase to £100 per tonne.  Our recycling efforts are below average and they must be improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that a time bomb is ticking in Wicklow, Dublin and the other areas which telephoned the programme the Minister referred to.  Aspirations to do something about it and proposals to introduce Bills are laudable, but the Minister must bite the bullet on this issue and we as local authority members must ask the community to accept the result.  I wish the Minister well because he must be Solomon in this case and try to find a solution which the public must accept, although it will be costly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my party for introducing this motion.  It was suggested that the Government was falling down on the job in relation to waste disposal, but it is doing a good job and the Minister is committed to easing the problems of waste disposal.  However, that does not mean we should not debate this issue because it is healthy to debate our success as well as our failures, although they are few.  This issue has been handled well by the Government and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne <i>(Wexford)</i>.</P>
      <P>Waste disposal is always causing a problem.  In my maiden speech in the Seanad some years ago I referred to careless dumping of waste, particularly in relation to bags of waste on the roadsides. This has been reduced as a result of the Government's efforts, although some individuals continue to cause problems by dumping bags on the roadsides instead of disposing of it properly.  Careless dumping of waste does not take place on the same scale as it did previously.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
      <P>While Irish society has been increasing its production of wastes, there is also a much greater concern than previously about problems of waste disposal. Landfill currently enjoys a bad press; only a small number of new local authority landfills have been brought on stream during the 1990s.</P>
      <P>He also said that the overall number of landfills, which now stands at 120, will be considerably reduced.  Landfill sites in my area are properly supervised, although I do not know if they are supervised in County Kerry.  These sites were a good purchase for Limerick County Council. The Minister said there would be fewer landfills, but Senator McGennis did not agree with the 336 acre landfill site.  What will we do with waste when the number of landfills are reduced?  Perhaps incinerators could be used.  Many problems arose recently in County Limerick about the erection of an incinerator.  There was public protest about where it should be sited.</P>

      <P>Waste disposal is a problem for local authorities and county councils; but, as has already been stated, it is not a problem for the consumer.  The shopkeeper causes some problems also and Senator McGennis referred to over-packaging. Plastic bags must be cheap because when I go shopping the purchases are often placed in two bags and this causes waste problems.  Even when one tells the shopkeeper that a bag is unnecessary, they will still use one.  These bags should be used properly to ensure less waste, especially in homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that recycling is desirable and I agree with him.  He stated:</P>
      <P>Glass recycling in Ireland has now reached a level in excess of 20 per cent and there is a national industrial capacity to cope with continued expansion in this area.  Recycling of cardboard stands at 16 per cent and aluminium cans has increased to 16 per cent by virtue of an increasingly efficient collection arrangement and despite the lack of domestic recycling facilities.</P>
      <P>In relation to packaging waste, he said that &ldquo;Ireland must double its present recycling performance within a five year period and increase it fourfold within a ten year period.&rdquo;  In his reference to municipal waste he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> I have been operating on a number of fronts.  First, I have continued assistance towards demonstration projects in the recycling area.  Between 1989 and 1993 £1.6 million has been provided by the Department of the Environment in grant aid to some 50 recycling projects.  This year we will be allocating a further £500,000 in recycling grants.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the processing of applications for grant aid because a recycling plant in my county, which was grant aided, did not last a year and a half and people knew this would happen.  I do not know what criteria are used to process these applications.  Do these people need recycling or money management experience?  For example, a once-off grant of £50,000 was paid to Shannonside Recycling Co-operative Society (Limerick) by the Department of the Environment. In addition, FÁS provided financial and administrative assistance, while Clare County Council and Limerick Corporation provided financial assistance on an ongoing basis.  However, the project experienced severe operational difficulties.  An inspection by an official from the Department confirmed that operations had ceased after a year and a half.  The man involved was too lazy to go to the toilet, let alone operate a recycling plant.  While projects like that need to be grant aided, they should be monitored so that money will not be wasted.  Can anything be done about wastage or carelessness if money is misused or treated with disrespect in cases such as this which involved a £50,000 grant and other grant aid?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major issue and a number of important points were made by previous speakers which I will not repeat.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank him for the work he has done in this area during his time in office.  As previous speakers said, he faces a difficult time because unpopular decisions must be made about halting sites and landfill and we wish him every success.  Although the county manager <Col N="302" /> must make the final decision, the local authority and the Minister must carry the can and this has caused problems in every county.  This problem has become more serious in recent years.</P>
      <P>As Senator R. Kiely said, we are now living in an age of plastic bags.  In the past there were no motor cars or refrigerators and our parents, whether living in a town or in the countryside, used a basket when shopping because plastic bags were not available.  Plastic bags, which become caught in bushes and hedges, are unsightly and damage our tourism industry. They are also dangerous to livestock because they chew these bags and become seriously ill or die.  Plastic bags also block waterways, thus causing all sorts of problems.</P>
      <P>I believe plastic bags should be banned.  Supermarkets which use plastic bags, while not irresponsible, want to get their produce out of the shop.  The Minister has spoken to supermarket owners about this problem and that is a step in the right direction.  By using ordinary baskets, our parents avoided this problem.</P>
      <P>I believe we are going backwards.  We need people to visit our beautiful countryside in order to create jobs.  The Government is doing what it can to encourage people to visit and consume our produce, but people are careless. They forget about the damage done when they drop bags of rubbish from their homes on the side of the road.  We should be concerned about this; otherwise it means we are not concerned about those who have no jobs.  People are not impressed by indiscriminate dumping in rural and urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Different types of plastics are used for various purposes, including plastic covering for silage pits, fertiliser bags, etc.  If this plastic is burned, it can be dangerous to one's health.  Recently I heard a doctor say that the fumes from burning plastic may be fatal for a child or a young person with bronchitis.  Often we do not know what materials are in the plastic.  It is time we tackled this problem in the national interest.  Most local authorities are doing what they can, but plastic bags are continually <Col N="303" /> used and it should stop.  I hope supermarkets will follow the Minister's advice.</P>
    <P>The difficulty the Minister and local authorities faced &mdash; I have been a member of a local authority for 27 years &mdash; when trying to get new sites has been caused by badly maintained dumps, many of which have now been closed.  I am glad to hear that the dump referred to by Senator R. Kiely in County Limerick is well managed.  In many counties there have been deputations from people who spent money developing their homes in private housing estates which are located near dumps.  One such dump was located in my area and the county manager drew up a charter, or 12 commandments, for its maintenance; but they were all broken bar one.  I hope the Minister will ensure that local authorities who get State or EU funding will spend that money properly.  A number of years ago I visited a dump in the Midlands which was far better than existing ones. One may spend as much money as one likes, but if the local authority is careless, it is money badly spent.  Given demands on local authorities and central Government, we cannot afford to spend money badly.</P>
    <P>People fear public dumps.  Even within one mile of a dump, one finds plastic bags everywhere and all kinds of people gathering scrap.  If dumps are badly maintained and not filled with clay frequently, birds feeding may spread germs, thus causing disease among livestock.  I know a person living close to a dump who has had a breakdown in their herd because of brucellosis.  Dogs and birds, including crows, carried material and dropped it in this person's field.  Badly maintained dumps are also a danger to humans because of flies and vermin.  Vermin control in the dump I referred to was bad. The rats were so large that one could have entered them in the Derby &mdash; that is how healthy they were.</P>
    <P>It is terrible to locate a dump near a housing estate.  The county manager, members of county councils and the Minister will face problems in trying to <Col N="304" /> find a suitable site.  We have a problem in south Tipperary in trying to find a suitable site.  We must find sites.  There is no simple solution and we must face up to that.  The maintenance and the design of new sites will ensure that our water sources will not be damaged by effluent or leakages from dumps.  Often industries deposit on dumps materials we do not know about.  Such materials could get into our springs.  A lot of damage has been done in the United Kingdom because of careless siting and maintenance of dumps.  We are lucky because when setting up new dumps we can learn from mistakes made by other countries.  We will not make those mistakes again.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that when the State, the EU and local authorities spend money developing these dumps, they are properly maintained because every local authority or private housing estate fears them.  Who could blame them?  The record of local authorities in dump maintenance leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>In this so-called modern age, in addition to plastic bags, unnecessary packaging occurs and this adds to the price of products and to the lorry loads of rubbish.  The Minister, local authorities, the county manager and the public face a major task in trying to keep Ireland a clean and safe place to live and in creating jobs for young people in the tourism industry.  This is a beautiful country, but a lot needs to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion because it calls for a waste recycling strategy, new waste legislation and that such legislation would be advanced as soon as possible.  It is disappointing that glass recycling in Ireland, according to the Minister's statement, has now only reached a level of 20 per cent.  There is a national industrial capacity that could cope with containment expansion in this area.  There has to be because the waste disposal problem must start with segregation. The sooner there is legislation on this issue the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the forthcoming waste Bill that will provide support <Col N="305" /> in the form of mandatory recycling and other obligations and incentives.  I ask the Minister to introduce that Bill as early as possible.  There are no two counties in Ireland or no two divisions in counties that have the same policy for waste disposal.  I ask the Minister, perhaps when replying, to define a landfill site.  I am a member of two local authorities in the north Cork area &mdash; Mallow Urban District Council and Cork County Council, Northern Division.  We have always had a problem with this in Mallow but we secured a fine site and were doing well until the county council decided it would use that site.  Then problems arose. The controlling of dumps was referred to by other speakers.  In north Cork we bought a substantial tract of land and made it what has been described as a landfill site.  Of what does a landfill site consist?  Both the Minister and his Department should closely scrutinise what is being proposed.  As a lay person, I can clearly see that this project is not on.  It does not matter how much one refers to the impermeable nature of the soil on which that refuse is being dumped. The leachate has to drain off at some point, although in the north Cork area it is currently being drawn off and taken to another waste disposal unit.</P>
    <P>Money does not seem to be a factor with regard to the northern division landfill site at Ballinagran in North Cork.  I am being parochial on this matter because it concerns me greatly.  Although there are few living in that locality, there is great concern at the installation of gas ventilators to take gas out of the site and that leachate is seeping into the water mains. Some people are contending that the discoloration is coming from something else.  I am saying this in a determined manner because there is no point in glossing over such matters; one must face reality.  This is why I welcome legislation governing waste disposal.</P>
    <P>The problem of plastic bags has already been mentioned.  I have observed in many areas &mdash; the greatest explosion will come in a few years time &mdash; people taking manure from plastic bags, spreading it and dumping the plastic bags, some of <Col N="306" /> which still contain manure.  They end up going into streams and causing a lot of blockages.  I said a few years ago that those who supply the product should at least set up an arrangement to collect the waste bags and dispose of them at a central depot.  We all recognise that there are now EU regulations on these matters and that an environmental impact assessment will have to be made when one remembers that over 25,000 tonnes of waste per annum is dumped in a landfill site.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister saying that legislation will be introduced to deal with this problem.  When we talk about local authorities and their financing, we should remember that in many areas, there are private companies organising and collecting waste.  Is there any control over where those companies dispose of their waste?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister for his contribution because he made some interesting points.  The Minister's emphasis on recycling picked up a train of thought from many other Senators' contributions.  I also thank all of the Senators who contributed because this meaningful debate is above party politics. I was especially interested in Senator Sherlock's contribution because I was thinking about landfill and leechate when the debate started.  Indeed, both of us finished up with precisely the same conclusions. I was critical of my local authority and Senator Sherlock was critical of his.</P>
      <P>One trend that came across from this debate was that recycling makes sense.  It can also create jobs.  The Rehabilitation Institute has shown that money can be made from recycling.  Indeed, Rehab has done marvellous work in the recycling of glass.  A number of Senators made the point that local communities and voluntary groups could make more of this waste.  &ldquo;There is brass in muck&rdquo; is an old English expression which could be adopted here.  I thank the Minister for referring to the proposed landfill site at Ballinagran.  The best reference he could give to it is to say it will not go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> The recently established Environmental Protection Agency comes into final operation next week.  It would make a lot of sense if the planning, management and rehabilitation of landfill sites was taken from local authorities, who are currently fidding around with plans and spending a lot of public money on consultants, and handed over to the Environmental Protection Agency <i>ab initio</i>.  We could then have a cohesive policy.  The Minister's contribution was thoughtful and thought provoking and there was a great deal of meat in it.</P>

      <P>I apologise for my lateness, I was watching with interest and thought Senator Roche would go on until 8 p.m.  Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to raise this issue of the funding of a major scheme, the east Meath regional water supply scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that over a long period Meath County Council has been making representations to the Department for funds to put this scheme together.  On numerous occasions representations were made by the locals and local representatives.  A number of deputations were accepted and meetings were held in the Department of the Environment with the Minister for the Environment. Some time in February this year following one of these meetings, a decision was made and the Minister, Deputy Smith, informed some members of the delegation that £2.61 million would be provided for part of the scheme but the remainder of the funds had to be found locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> I find the overall situation and the result of the meeting amazing.  Since the foundation of the State the funding of these schemes has always been provided by the Department.  In this case an application was made, the meeting took place with no official from the county council present and when three weeks later the March meeting of Meath County Council took place, no details had yet been sent from the Department of the Environment to state that this money had been approved.  There was a row there about it, even though some of the people who attended the meeting had informed the general public that they had secured this funding; yet three weeks later there was still no word.</P>
    <P>Following that pressure a letter was sent to some of the representatives who were at the meeting which then found its way to the local media, and six hours later the council were informed.  The letter stated as follows:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for the Environment to refer to the preliminary proposal for the Meath East Regional water supply scheme currently under examination in my Department.  The Minister is prepared to allocate a maximum sum of £2.61 million for the provision of the scheme to the town of Ashbourne only, excluding the other areas that were included in the application.  [Excluding Dun-shaughlin, Ratoath, Curragha and Dunboyne.]  No further grants will be approved in respect of this work and additional costs must be borne locally. Before proceeding to contract document stage, please confirm your agreement to the proposals set out above.</P>
    <P>Never in the history of the State has such a letter been sent to a local authority. It sets a precedent and if it is accepted, local people who pay for the building of their own houses, residential property tax, water rates and all the other charges, will have to fund the extra 10 per cent.  If the Minister tells us later that the council may have to provide these funds, where will we get the funds to cover the extra cost?  Will we increase <Col N="309" /> our water charges by another 15 per cent or 20 per cent a year?  That is the only revenue we have.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister to tell us tonight whether this scheme will be fully funded by the Department.  Is it intended to change the policy of funding these major schemes now and in the future so that only 90 per cent of the funds will be made available?  If that is the case, the people will have to take up the slack of the 10 per cent funding that was made available to the Department under the national plan.  I wish the Minister to inform us of the situation because we in Meath County Council, and I as a Member of that body, will not accept funding on the basis that we must come up with the balance of the funds.</P>
    <P>In 1982 there was a major investment of £2.4 million in the water supply scheme in this area which was fully funded by the then Government.  Representations were made by me and other elected representatives at the time and we were given 100 per cent funding.  I do not see why or how we can allow ourselves be put in a position where we would get 90 per cent funding because if this happens, it is a watershed for every other local authority, and I would not like to see that happening.  I hope the Minister will enlighten all local authorities on this major issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford)</i>: I thank Senator Farrelly for raising this matter in the Seanad today.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware of the problems associated with the existing water supply to the town of Ashbourne.  This town has in the past suffered water shortages as a result of being located at the extreme end of the east Meath regional water supply scheme.  In response to this water supply problem, Meath County Council developed a borehole source at Curragha, which was to serve Ashbourne and the surrounding areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the yield from the Curragha borehole source, while being adequate in quantity, was not of an acceptable standard for drinking water.  This groundwater <Col N="310" /> source has a high iron and manganese content which caused frequent discoloration of the Ashbourne water supply.  Consequently in November 1993 my Department approved, at a cost of £100,000, the installation of a filtration plant and chlorine residual unit.  The purpose of this is to reduce iron and manganese levels in the water supply below the maximum admissible concentrations as required by the European Union Regulations and reduce the amount of sediment from these elements which was getting into the system.</P>
    <P>This work was completed in March 1994, the unit became operational recently and I understand the water quality has improved significantly.  I would stress that these works were carried out as an interim measure to effect an immediate improvement in the quality of the Ashbourne water supply pending consideration of the quantity difficulties/distribution network by Meath County Council and my Department.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council has submitted a proposal to my Department to deal with the distribution difficulties and the council has been advised that the Minister is prepared to provide a maximum budget of £2.61 million for these works, on the condition that any additional costs would be borne locally.</P>
    <P>This offer was made to Meath County Council by the Minister, Deputy Smith, following representations made to him by a deputation of concerned local people. This scheme was not on my Department's national priority list, but the Minister considered that a way forward could be found either through stringent cost control of it, or by a local contribution to reduce Exchequer outlay.  The alternative would be simply to refuse any approval to the scheme or to put it on hold, as unfortunately has to be done for many schemes around the country given the excess of demands over finance available.</P>
    <P>Is Senator Farrelly saying that this offer is unacceptable and that he would prefer the people of Ashbourne to wait, perhaps indefinitely, for unconditional <Col N="311" /> financial provision to be made for the scheme?  He should be clear on this matter.</P>
    <P>There are many well justified water service proposals competing for funds. Innovative solutions may help us to ease some of this pressure and to enable some schemes to progress ahead of schedule. What is certain is that if public representatives indulge in making automatic objections to new solutions this will not bring water to people now waiting for it.</P>
    <P>If Meath County Council agree to this arrangement, the scheme could then proceed to contract document stage.  It is, however, a matter for Meath County Council to determine how the scheme can be managed within the specified budget or, failing this, how any balance of cost should be met.</P>

Only recently in my constituency on the extension of a main drainage scheme, a number of people contributed a substantial amount of money to meet half the costs of the extension.</P>
