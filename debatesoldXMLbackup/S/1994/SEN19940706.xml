      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Sullivan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the obligations under the Wildlife Act, 1976, to conserve wildlife, the need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to consider the provision of funding for the reintroduction of game and habitat development grants.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Naughten of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide adequate funding to health boards to meet their commitments under the Health Nursing Home Act, 1990, and to treat this scheme as a demand led scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to support Resolution 47/19 of the United Nations General Assembly, entitled, &ldquo;Necessity of Ending Economic, Commercial and Financial Embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2078" /> I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to take note of the difficulties facing both the settled population and itinerant families because of the poor conditions at the halting site outside Castleblayney, County Monaghan and the danger of a complete breakdown of inter-community relationships.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline his attitude to Aeroflot's application for pick up rights at Shannon to New York and Boston.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to consider the introduction of alternative methods of transporting money for social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Sullivan and Naughten as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Neville, Cotter, Taylor-Quinn and Rory Kiely may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>A disturbing trend has emerged in the way Adjournment motions are treated.  Yesterday evening there were two motions, one for the Department of Finance and the other for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Each one was dealt with by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy O'Shea.  He is a former Member of this House and is a very able person, but it is not right that Departments should simply send a messenger to the House to handle the debate on behalf of the Department, especially since the Minister for Enterprise and Employment was in the vicinity of the House when the appropriate debate was taking place.  I ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to take up this matter because it is a bad reflection on the House.  This is not how business should be done.  Ministers will often take questions at the end of the debate on the Adjournment resolving the difficulties of the Senator concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House take into account the difficulties which arise when all Stages of a Bill are taken on the one day?  My experience yesterday was that it would have been possible to have amendments to the An Bord Bia Bill considered differently had we not swept through it all in one day.  I am sure the same thing will happen today with the Fisheries Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Leader that this House <Col N="2080" /> can be of immense benefit if we allocate time for more long term discussions.  We should find time to discuss issues such as the enlargement of the European Community, rather than wait until it is too late.  Austria recently had a referendum and soon there will be one in Finland. We should discuss currency at some point and not wait until a crisis occurs.  I support Senator Kelleher who asked yesterday for a discussion on the economy. We have to ratify the Uruguay General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.  I urge the Leader of the House to consider not waiting until the last moment to consider these items.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I seldom clash with Senator Manning but I reject completely the classification of Ministers of State as messengers.  They are part of the structure of Government and are entitled to come in here and represent Cabinet Members.  We should not denigrate the Office of Minister of State.  The very important function of Ministers of State is to assist Cabinet Ministers in doing their jobs and that sometimes means substituting for them.  In my motion, I made it absolutely clear that I wanted the Minister's attention brought to it, not his physical presence.  I was quite happy to explain to his substitute what we want and I am satisfied that the Minister concerned will get that information.  All Ministers and Ministers of State deserve the same respect.  I reject completely the idea of messengers at any level, including nominated Senator level.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House be kind enough to arrange a worthwhile debate after the holiday on the diminishing role of members of local authorities?  Most of us are elected to the House by members of local authorities. They are our electorate.  There is a new emphasis on the regions.  Members of local authorities participate less in the county enterprise boards and their participation in vocational education committees is under threat.  The local authorities and local authority members are a very important aspect of democracy <Col N="2081" /> within the country.  Most Members of the House will agree that this is important. There is duplication in the functions of organisations such as Forbairt, county development teams or local tourism organisations.  The whole area is becoming a jungle of administrations.  Some have no funding, some overlap and some do not know where they are going.  I ask for a debate in this House on the future structure of local authorities, how members should participate in government and how they should represent their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Magner did not deal with the point raised by Senator Manning.  It was not Senator Manning's intention to denigrate any Minister of State.  The House is entitled to respect and where people raise matters on the Adjournment which require answers, they expect somebody with competence and an expertise in that department to deal with it.  That is a reasonable principle, one which the House should support. The House is entitled to respect, apart from whatever respect Members of the Government might earn.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's point about the way we deal with Bills.  I realise we are coming to the end of the session and the Leader has been treading a very delicate path quite well up to now in the way he has ordered the business.  We have not had incidents like those we had in the past when guillotines were imposed. However, to put a Bill through all Stages in one day is not the best way to order business, because it is not then possible to consider the issues properly.  In the Fisheries Bill there are over 20 sections to be considered.  Having said that, I will not oppose the Order of Business but I suggest to the Leader that in future he try as far as possible to avoid a situation like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Cabinet Minister <Col N="2082" /> who did not deprive himself of the privilege of attending Seanad debates, I sympathise with Members who suggest that Cabinet Ministers have an opportunity to learn much from the objective, non-confrontational discussions we tend to have in the Seanad.  I disagree with the notion that Ministers of State are messengers.</P>
      <P>In the context of the importance of debates and arising from what Senator Quinn said will the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the role of education in employment for our young people and have the Minister here to deal with it? Much funding that could be applied to education is being dissipated through various training programmes.  It is important to apply ourselves to the crucial issue for our young people of education for permanent employment as distinct from dissipating fundamental resources through training schemes, some of which are not very successful.</P>
      <P>In that context we could discuss a range of issues such as the development of a third level centre for rural development in Tipperary.  It is the type of issue that we could deal with as a positive priority. I hope we will have an opportunity of having some such debate in the future.</P>

      <P>I support the case made for the attendance of Ministers on Adjournment debates.  I also ask the Leader of the House for an early debate on the charter for self local government which is part of the Government programme. We are the only country apart from the United Kingdom which has not signed the EU Charter for self local government.  That would address many of the questions raised about the powers of local authorities about which there has already been a debate in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning on the necessity for Ministers and <Col N="2083" /> Ministers of State to be present to respond to relevant questions.  Senator Manning did not say that Ministers of State were messengers.  He was discussing Ministers and Ministers of State from Departments other than the relevant Departments dealing with the issue raised.  I recently raised an issue which came within the responsibility of the Minister for Health or the Minister of State at the Department of Health and, as the Cathaoirleach is aware, he hardly had time to reply to me.  He interrupted my contribution to say he had to leave at 8.30 p.m. for a division in the other House.</P>
      <P>The issues on the Adjournment are important to the Members who raise them and they then make their case.  It is to be expected therefore that the Minister with the relevant responsibility will reply and answer questions on issues raised on the Adjournment rather than a Minister from another Department who has no responsibility for these issues, other than to read a script prepared by the Department concerned.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House provide time for a debate on the rural environment protection scheme, known as REPS, as it is probably one of the best schemes for rural Ireland initiated for some considerable time?  The scheme will go a long way towards cleaning up rural areas.  Together with the community employment scheme, which has been introduced recently, and the Leader programme, these three schemes will achieve an enormous amount for rural Ireland.  There should be a positive approach to them, coupled with a debate in the House.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Quinn's call for a debate on enlargement of the EU.  It is a debate I have requested for approximately a year.  As the process continues it has profound implications for Ireland and raises issues which have not been addressed.  It behoves the House to address these issues and I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a <Col N="2084" /> debate on this matter at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement of the Adjournment debate in the Dáil is outside my control and remit, and that of the Whip.  It is not the first time that a Minister of State has been requested to deputise for a Minister.  Regarding the remarks made by Senator Neville, I recall that only two or three years ago the business of the House closed down every time there was a vote in the Dáil.  In this respect, changes have been made to ensure the smooth running of the House.</P>
      <P>I have no disagreement with Senator Quinn's remarks regarding the processing of Bills through the House. However, now and again a judgment is made that certain Bills can be dealt with in the manner in which An Bord Bia Bill, 1994, was processed yesterday.  It is rare that the House deals with a Bill on the one day, as the record illustrates.</P>
      <P>Hardly a week goes by when the House does not have a topical debate on issues raised, and several of the issues raised on the Order of Business will be addressed in the next session.  The House will debate Northern Ireland tomorrow, which provides yet another opportunity for the House to express its views on this issue.</P>
      <P>Many other issues can be addressed on Private Members' Business, the Adjournment and other such procedures. I have noted many of the concerns of Members and requests for debate.  I assure the House that some of these matters will be debated in the next session.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill amends and extends the Solicitors Acts, 1954 and 1960, and provides for related matters.  It is 40 years since the principal legislation, <Col N="2085" /> the Solicitors Act, 1954, relating to the solicitors' profession was enacted.  The Solicitors (Amendment) Act was made necessary mainly as a result of a Supreme Court decision that disciplinary powers conferred on the Law Society by the 1954 Act were unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a product of a thorough assessment of the experience of the basic legislation in practice.  The Bill also recognises developments in the legal services field and changing conditions under which legal services are provided by solicitors to their clients.  It also represents a major reworking of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1991 which lapsed following consideration by a special committee on the dissolution of the 26th Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Bill introduces major reforms and is intended to provide a modern legislative framework for the solicitors' profession. Many of my predecessors have signalled their intention to introduce legislation amending the Solicitors Acts. For my own part, I am happy to have the opportunity to bring this legislation before the House.  In addition, the Bill meets the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to provide greater protection for clients of solicitors. It also take account of a number of recommendation made by the former Fair Trade Commission.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes a wide-ranging reform of the law relating to solicitors involving almost every aspect of the regulatory framework of the profession.  It provides for four broad categories of reform.  The first of these ensures that clients of solicitors are better protected by the law in their dealings with solicitors. Second, it requires the profession to maintain the highest standards of conduct and a strict disciplinary system.  Third, it provides for more competitive conditions regarding the provision of legal services.  Finally, it updates the training and educational arrangements for solicitors. Of course, these broad objectives are in many ways complementary.  For example, clients clearly stand to benefit from a tightening of standards of conduct in the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2086" /> The first major area of reform relates to the rights of the consumer of legal services provided by solicitors.  My main concern is to ensure that the client's interests are fully protected in the client/solicitor relationship.  This aspect of the Bill, perhaps more than any other, is driven by changing circumstances, especially in the legislative area, since the inception of the principal legislation 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>Consumer's rights <i>per se</i> were not generally recognised in legislation of that period.  Today, however, there is in place a substantial body of what I would refer to broadly as consumer law.  It is entirely appropriate that the legislation regulating solicitors' conduct and practice builds on and contributes to the development of consumers' rights in law.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains many consumer driven measures.  Solicitors' clients will have the right to redress where a solicitor provides inadequate services or where charges for services are excessive.  For the first time solicitors will have to be fully insured against damages awarded to clients arising from civil liability claims against their solicitors.  The Bill increases the power of the Law Society and of the High Court to intervene in the practice of a solicitor in the interests of clients. Solicitors will have to provide clients with clear information regarding the cost of their services while percentage charging is being prohibited.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant provisions is the setting up of a scheme for the investigation of complaints by an independent adjudicator regarding the Law Society's handling of complaints about solicitors.  The Bill was introduced against a background where there had been persistent public concern about the way in which complaints concerning solicitors are dealt with by the Law Society. The setting up of an office of independent adjudicator is an innovative approach to this problem and will, I am confident, do much to restore public confidence in complaints handling procedures.</P>
    <P>With regard to disciplinary matters, the supervisory powers of the Law Society and of the High Court are <Col N="2087" /> enhanced.  New tighter controls with heavy sanctions where client's funds are not handled in accordance with regulations are also being introduced.</P>
    <P>To improve the competitiveness of solicitors' services, the Bill contains new initiatives regarding advertising of legal services and the provision of probate services. In addition, Part V of the Bill updates and streamlines the training and educational provisions of the existing legislation, amending extensively the Law Society's functions in this area.</P>
    <P>I now propose to elaborate on some of the details of the Bill.  Section 8 gives the Law Society new power to impose sanctions on solicitors who are found to have provided inadequate or shoddy services. The society will be empowered to limit the cost which a solicitor may recover from a client, or require a solicitor to refund costs paid by a client and to rectify any error at the solicitor's own expense arising from the inadequate services. Under section 9, the society will be empowered to order solicitors to refund fees paid by their clients or to waive the right to recover costs where those solicitors have been found to have charged excessively.  These are practical and accessible measures which will provide a speedy and inexpensive remedy for many complaints against solicitors and they do not affect the client's right to seek redress through the courts.</P>
    <P>The Law Society is empowered under section 10 of the Bill to require a solicitor to produce any documents relating to a complaint made against him or her which the society is investigating.  This is intended to facilitate investigations under sections 8 and 9.  Under section 12, the society will have new powers to enable it to recover from a solicitor some of the costs which it may incur in investigating complaints made under sections 8 or 9 of the Bill.  To ensure fairness in the law, the new powers being conferred on the society by sections 8, 9, 10 and 12 may be appealed by solicitors under section 11.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> In recent years public confidence in the manner in which complaints about solicitors are handled has reached a very low ebb indeed.  There is widespread dissatisfaction about the profession's complaints procedures.  What is needed is an effective and transparent system for dealing with complaints against solicitors. In response to this, section 15 provides for the setting up of an independent adjudicator to investigate complaints about the society's handling of complaints against solicitors.</P>
    <P>The adjudicator will have wide powers, including the power to fully reinvestigate the original complaint made to the society about a solicitor if he or she is dissatisfied with the society's investigation of any complaint made to it.  The adjudicator may also direct the society to reinvestigate a complaint if he or she is not happy with the society's original investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's consent will be required for the appointment of the adjudicator who, it is specifically provided, will be independent in carrying out his or her functions.  Additionally, the adjudicator must not be a practising solicitor, a member of the society or practising barrister. I am satisfied that the independence of the adjudicator is further ensured by the requirement to report annually to the Minister.  These annual reports of the adjudicator will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the society is opposed to the funding of the adjudicator scheme. I have little sympathy with that viewpoint. The introduction of this new complaints apparatus has become necessary because of the failure of the solicitors' profession to live up to the responsibilities of self-regulation.  That failure should not give rise to a cost on the taxpayer.  The profession itself should bear the cost involved and section 15 provides precisely for that.</P>
    <P>To further enhance public confidence in the profession's disciplinary system, section 16 provides for the appointment, for the first time, of up to five lay members nominated by the Minister to the disciplinary committee of the High <Col N="2089" /> Court to represent the interests of the general public.  This committee, which from now on will be known as the disciplinary tribunal, is appointed by the President of the High Court and is responsible for conducting inquiries into allegations of misconduct against solicitors.</P>
    <P>Section 17 empowers the disciplinary tribunal to impose limited penalties where it finds that a solicitor has been guilty of misconduct.  This will enable the tribunal to dispose of some less serious cases of misconduct without involving High Court proceedings which are necessary under the present legislation.  This was a course recommended by the Fair Trade Commission and I am satisfied that it will improve the efficiency of disciplinary procedures.  I referred earlier to the Supreme Court decision in the &ldquo;Solicitors' Act&rdquo; case that powers conferred on the Law Society by the 1954 Act were unconstitutional.  I am advised that the new powers being conferred on the disciplinary tribunal under section 17 will not breach the constitutional requirements laid down in that case.  The tribunal's new powers include directing a solicitor to pay up to £5,000 to the compensation fund and to pay up to £5,000 as a restitution to an aggrieved party.</P>
    <P>Section 18 extends the existing powers of the High Court to impose penalties on solicitors where the disciplinary tribunal reports a finding of misconduct against a solicitor.  Section 22 will oblige the Law Society to publish information annually on complaints received about solicitors and the outcome of investigations by the disciplinary tribunal of complaints alleging misconduct.  This move improves the transparency of these procedures.  I hope that making this information generally available will help to restore public confidence in the manner in which the Law Society handles complaints.</P>
    <P>In the past, funds were not always available to meet the cost of damages awarded to clients arising from negligence on the part of their solicitors. Section 26 addresses this by enabling the Law Society to require all solicitors to be covered by indemnity insurance against <Col N="2090" /> losses arising from civil liability claims. The vast majority of practising solicitors are, in fact, covered by professional indemnity insurance but this provision constitutes an important additional safeguard. Practising solicitors also will be required under section 54 to satisfy the Law Society that they are complying with the indemnity insurance requirements before practising certificates are issued to them.  This question of solicitors' insurance is an urgent matter and the Law Society has assured me that it will introduce the necessary arrangements under section 26 as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Law Society can intervene in a solicitor's practice in limited circumstances. Experience has shown that the grounds for intervention should be extended to protect the interests of clients.  Under the provisions of sections 31 and 32 the Law Society will be empowered to intervene in the practice of a sole solicitor who has died or who is incapable of managing his or her affairs through illness, or because of an accident, or who is adjudicated a bankrupt, or who abandons his or her practice.  In such circumstances, the society will be empowered to take whatever action it deems necessary in the interests of the clients.  Where the conduct of a solicitor is likely to give rise to the payment of grants out of the compensation fund, the High Court may authorise the society to sell that solicitor's practice under the provisions of section 33.</P>
    <P>Section 28 extends the society's powers to apply to the High Court for an order to freeze bank accounts where it believes that a solicitor has been guilty of dishonesty. It also gives the society a new power to apply for an order to freeze the assets of a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Section 37 restricts newly qualified solicitors from setting up in practice, without the consent of the Law Society, as sole practitioners for a period of up to three years following qualification.  A newly qualified solicitor will be able to enter a partnership but only if a prospective partner has been engaged fulltime in the provision of legal services for at least three years.  Clients stand to <Col N="2091" /> benefit from this provision, the purpose of which is to ensure that young solicitors develop sound practice habits during this period.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to solicitor and client costs are addressed in section 68.  I am particularly concerned that this Bill ensures maximum transparency in this aspect of solicitor/client dealings.  Clients should be informed in advance about a solicitor's charges or likely charges for providing legal services.  As it stands it is quite usual for clients to be left in the dark about the cost of the solicitor's services. There can be great uncertainty and often it is only when the business is over and done with that clients learn of the full liability to their solicitors.  I feel sure that Senators will agree that this situation badly needs to be changed.  Not all legal business lends itself to a ready calculation of actual charges in advance; I have in mind especially contentious matters. However, section 68 offers a very flexible structure for providing statements of charges, and solicitors should have little or no difficulty in complying with it.  Solicitors will have to provide clients, at the outset, with particulars in writing of the actual charges or, where this is not possible, an estimate or, if neither is possible, the basis on which they will be charged for legal services.</P>
    <P>In contentious business, such as personal injury actions, solicitors will also be required to inform clients where they will be liable to pay additional costs to the solicitor over and above those recovered from the losing party.  When the contentious business is disposed of, solicitors will be required to provide clients with details of the legal services provided, damages and costs recovered and, separately, the charges for the solicitor's services.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this section alone goes a long way towards assisting clients in their dealings with solicitors.  Section 68 ensures that the client gets the maximum information possible, at the outset and at the conclusion of business, <Col N="2092" /> about the costs of a case and the costs of dealing with solicitors.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that this Bill will prohibit percentage charging.  I want to explain the case for this provision.  The practice among solicitors of deducting a substantial premium &mdash; often 10 per cent or more &mdash; from the damages awarded to their clients in personal injury cases, over and above the costs payable by the losing party, is apparently widespread.  One objection to this practice is that clients have no way of knowing what they will eventually have to pay as the charge is based on a fixed percentage of an unknown quantity of damages.  In any event, party and party costs &mdash; that is the costs that the losing party pays the successful party &mdash; should normally cover most if not all of the necessary costs incurred by the successful client's legal representatives.</P>
    <P>Section 68, therefore, prohibits solicitors from deducting an amount from clients' damages without the prior agreement in writing of the client.  The section also prohibits solicitors from charging costs to their clients on the basis of a percentage of any damages that may be awarded to a client.  Again, this provision will help the client to decide what he or she is getting into when taking a legal action.</P>
    <P>Section 76 faces up to the difficult issue of serious dishonesty in the solicitor's profession.  Senators will not need me to tell them that the reputation of the profession has been harmed by a small number of solicitors who have misappropriated or absconded with clients' funds.  That is both unfortunate and regrettable.  Solicitors are often entrusted to handle very large amounts of money belonging to their clients.  That is in the nature of the work that solicitors are required to do.  But that is not, of course, any excuse for dishonesty on the part of the solicitors.  On the contrary, this should establish a special relationship of trust between solicitors and their clients, and in fact the law recognises that there is a fiduciary relationship between solicitor and client.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> This special relationship of trust is abused by solicitors who misappropriate their clients' money.  I must first stress my belief that the vast majority of solicitors are hard working and honest professionals. It is a fact that the money misappropriated by dishonest solicitors is very small in comparison with the total amount handled by the profession in its dealings with the public.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here nevertheless, and I know that the society is as determined as I am to tackle this abuse.  To deal with this problem, section 76 creates criminal offences for breaches of a number of new requirements in relation to the handling by solicitors of clients' moneys.  Solicitors will be required to keep clients' funds in bank accounts prescribed by the society and to maintain an accurate record of transactions involving those funds.  The society will also be empowered to enforce these provisions. A maximum fine of up to £10,000 will apply where these requirements are breached and I am confident that strict enforcement of these provisions will make significant inroads into this problem.</P>
    <P>Section 76 provides for a quick and more effective system of dealing with such cases of dishonesty as they arise. The major impact of this section will be to act as a significant deterrent against abuse involving clients' moneys.</P>
    <P>Section 73 obliges the society to make regulations with the concurrence of the High Court requiring solicitors in general to maintain clients' funds in deposit accounts or to pay them the interest on such moneys.  The Law Society has already taken action in this area but I am convinced it is appropriate in the public interest to make statutory provision for these matters.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Bill dealing with the compensation fund will also benefit the clients of solicitors although perhaps less obviously than some of the provisions to which I already referred.  The fund is maintained by the Law Society to compensate for losses arising from dishonesty on the part of solicitors.  The Bill introduces two major changes in the provisions <Col N="2094" /> governing the compensation fund.  The first concerns section 21 of the 1960 Act which provides that any person suffering loss can be compensated from the fund.  A Supreme Court decision in 1989 interpreted this as giving access to the fund to financial institutions incurring loss as a result of undertakings given by solicitors.  Section 29 of the Bill will limit the scope of the compensation fund to clients of solicitors only, an important refinement.  It was not the intention in drawing up the 1960 Act that financial institutions engaged in large financial transactions, in pursuit of their own business and relying on undertakings from solicitors, should be able to claim against the compensation fund if the solicitors default in circumstances where the financial institutions are not clients of the solicitors.</P>
    <P>Banks and other financial institutions have always relied on solicitors' undertakings for purely business reasons and without any expectation that they would be entitled to have recourse to the compensation fund.  They are in a very strong position to protect their own interests. These institutions should not have to rely on the fund as a form of insurance considering the resources at their disposal and the expertise available to them in deciding whether to accept a solicitor's undertaking.</P>
    <P>The second change affecting the compensation fund is the application of a cap or maximum grant limit of £350,000 in respect of a claim made on the fund.  I am satisfied that this limit will provide more than adequately for the vast majority of claims for compensation made against the fund by private individuals and small businesses whom the fund was primarily designed to protect.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, if a claim in excess of £350,000 arises, section 29 provides that the society may grant an amount in excess of £350,000 in cases of grave hardship.  I am also empowered to increase the cap of £350,000 in line with inflation.  I should point out that I have set the cap at a level well in excess of the maximum amount that has ever been paid in respect of a claim on the fund by a non-corporate <Col N="2095" /> client of a solicitor.  I am satisfied there is a compelling case for this cap.</P>
    <P>Without these amendments, there would be the continuing risk of large financial institutions lodging claims against the fund of the order of perhaps several millions of pounds.  Such huge claims would, inevitably, deplete the fund and it would become impossible for the Law Society to make good losses suffered by clients of solicitors for whom the fund was designed to protect in the first place.</P>
    <P>Regulations made by the Law Society in 1988 permit solicitors to advertise their services, subject to certain general limitations, including a prohibition on specifying a fee for services.  Section 69 provides for the removal of that restriction and prevents the Law Society from prohibiting fee advertising by solicitors for any specified legal charge.</P>
    <P>The society is not happy about this provision.  One objection to it is that clients are not in a position to assess in advance the quality of the service being offered and are likely to be misled if they make decisions solely on price.  This is not a valid objection.</P>
    <P>First, the Bill gives the society powers to deal with false and misleading advertising. Secondly, I have more faith in consumers than perhaps the society has. Consumers make important financial decisions for themselves in relation to services and products on a day-to-day basis.  Users of legal services are accustomed to making decisions about the quality of services offered by solicitors who have advertised their services since 1988 although fee advertising continues to be prohibited by the society.  Price is clearly a key factor that consumers take into account but there are also other factors such as the reputation of the supplier, dependability and quality of service. Withholding information about the price of the service denies the consumer the opportunity of making the optimal choice.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that it would be possible to advertise the prices of all services provided by solicitors.  I have <Col N="2096" /> already touched on this point in relation to the information that a solicitor will have to provide to a prospective client at the outset of business.  However, there are services of a more routine and predictable nature which will be suitable for price advertising, such as conveyancing and probate.  There is no evidence to suggest that price advertising in England has had the dire consequences predicted by the society.  In fact it is understood to have resulted in substantial reductions in costs, particularly in the area of conveyancing.</P>
    <P>The society also suggests that price advertising is likely to expose the public to the risk of shoddy work from unscrupulous solicitors.  However, they are very much in the minority and I take it that the society is not suggesting otherwise in its objections to this provision. The Oireachtas has delegated to the society the responsibility to maintain a high general standard of professional conduct under the Solicitors Acts.  Moreover, sections 8 and 9 of the Bill give the society new and additional powers to deal with shoddy or inadequate services while the Bill generally strengthens the society's regulatory functions.</P>
    <P>The society, therefore, will have sufficient powers to deal with false or misleading advertising and to crack down on unscrupulous solicitors who provide less than quality services to their clients.  No doubt the society will deal vigorously with any such cases that may arise.</P>
    <P>While I am confident that the consumer stands to benefit from fee-advertising, I am aware that concerns have been expressed about this provision in the Bill and I accept that they are genuinely held.  Therefore, I have decided to include in the Bill a failsafe provision which will allow the experience of fee-advertising to be reviewed over time. This will enable the society to prohibit fee-advertising in respect of given services but only with the consent of the Minister where she is satisfied that prohibition is in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Section 78 opens up will-making and probate services to competition from credit unions.  I am a proponent of greater <Col N="2097" /> competitiveness in the provision of services generally as I believe that invariably the consumer stands to benefit.  In relation to the relatively specialised services such as those in question, however, we should proceed very cautiously down this road.  It is reasonable to allow credit unions to compete with solicitors for this business as they are generally small organisations operating at local or community level and function on an nonprofit making basis for the benefit of their members.  They should be enabled to provide will-making and probate services subject to the comprehensive safeguards in section 78.  One of these is that credit unions will not be allowed provide these services until they are subject to the scheme of investigation of complaints provided for in section 79 of the Bill, or a similar scheme.</P>
    <P>The Solicitors Acts contain restrictions on the organisation of solicitors' practices. Incorporation by solicitors, multidisciplinary practices involving solicitors and members of other professions and multi-national practices involving Irish solicitors and lawyers from other jurisdictions are not permitted under the Acts.</P>
    <P>Clients may benefit from changes in the structure of working arrangements in the profession.  I do not think that we should rule out the possibility of future developments in these areas and, accordingly, sections 70 and 71 enable the Law Society to bring forward regulations &mdash; which will require the concurrence of the Minister &mdash; to provide for these new forms of working arrangements.</P>
    <P>Incorporation by solicitors is currently prohibited which may be over restrictive nowadays.  The professions in England, Wales and Scotland are no longer prohibited from engaging in such working arrangements.  Similarly, inter-professional marketing developments here may dictate the pace of development of multi-disciplinary practices involving solicitors. Developments in the EU and further afield suggest that movement towards multi-national practices may be inevitable.  Again, both multi-disciplinary and multi-national practices are <Col N="2098" /> permitted in England and Wales.  These sections are framed so that the Minister will have sufficient powers to ensure that the interests of clients are adequately protected, if such new working arrangements are ultimately introduced.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains the final major area of reform.  It provides for a number of significant changes relating to the education and training of solicitors. The subject of legal education is currently being debated by both branches of the legal profession.  The central issue here is rationalisation of the present system, including resources and the structure of legal training.</P>
    <P>An advisory committee on legal education and training comprised of representatives from the Law Society, the Bar, the universities, IBEC, ICTU, the Union of Students in Ireland and the Higher Education Authority is currently considering proposals for rationalisation. The Minister is also represented on that committee which is chaired by the Honourable Mr. Justice Ronan Keane.  I hope to see progress in this area before too long.  Section 49 of the Bill provides that the Law Society may join with other bodies in holding examinations leading to a joint or common qualification.  This has been designed to anticipate arrangements for joint vocational training which I hope will result from rationalisation of the current position.  I expect, in time, that suitable use will be made of these new provisions.</P>
    <P>Changes in admission requirements for intending solicitors, which were introduced by the Law Society in 1989, have resulted in a large increase in the number of students being admitted to the society's law school.  Since then, law graduates no longer have to sit the society's entrance examination once they have passed exams in certain subjects prescribed by the society as part of their degree course.</P>
    <P>There is a problem, at present, for intending solicitors seeking admission to the society's law school in obtaining apprenticeships.  Apprenticeship is a prerequisite for entry to the society's law school and, ultimately, to the profession. <Col N="2099" /> There are a number of provisions in the Bill which will assist the profession in providing apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>Section 47 allows a solicitor to have two apprentices instead of one and to have an apprentice for every two assistant solicitors.  Section 42 reduces the period of apprenticeship from a maximum of five years to a maximum of two years. Section 44 reduces the minimum period of continuous practice required before a solicitor may take on an apprentice from seven to five years and section 53 enables the society to make regulations providing that apprenticeships may be served in Northern Ireland, England and Wales.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the cumulative effect of these provisions will be to ease the pressure on obtaining apprenticeships. This will allow many well qualified graduates to get a foot hold in the profession.  In particular, increasing the number of apprentices which a solicitor can have will allow a solicitor with the capacity and the work to take on extra employees.</P>
    <P>Section 51 of the Bill will facilitate freer interchange between the barristers' and solicitors' professions and was a course recommended by the Fair Trade Commission. This section provides for exemptions from the society's examinations for barristers wishing to be admitted as solicitors. It reduces from a maximum of five years to a maximum of three years the period of practice at the Bar required by such persons.  I sincerely hope that the Bar Council can reciprocate to enable practising solicitors to move more easily into the other branch of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill strengthens the control of the Law Society over the issue of practising certificates.  Section 61 extends the grounds upon which a practising certificate can be refused or issued subject to conditions, while section 59 empowers the society to give a direction imposing conditions on a current practising certificate. In addition, section 58 allows the society to apply to the High Court where the society considers there has been a serious failure on the part of a solicitor <Col N="2100" /> to comply with the Solicitors Acts or with conditions imposed on a practising certificate. The court may suspend a solicitor's practising certificate in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Part VII contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.  I will mention section 67.  From time to time in the past, members of the public have experienced considerable difficulties in engaging the services of a solicitor to take an action against another solicitor.  The Law Society can, and does, make arrangements to assist persons contemplating actions against solicitors, but I think it is more appropriate in the public interest to ensure that adequate statutory arrangements are in place to cater for this situation.  Accordingly, section 67 of the Bill requires the society to maintain a register of solicitors who are prepared to act for any person who is unable to find a solicitor to take civil proceedings against another solicitor.  The society will also be required to take reasonable steps to assist a person to obtain the services of a solicitor for such purposes.</P>
    <P>The main challenge posed in formulating these proposals was the need to strike a balance between protecting the public in their dealings with solicitors and providing for a regulatory framework giving the solicitors' profession latitude to provide a range of high quality legal services.  I am confident that this Bill gets that balance right.</P>
    <P>This Bill is, more than anything else, a blueprint for reform which provides for the needs of clients of solicitors while, at the same time, revitalising the profession as it faces changing conditions now and in the future.  The proposals in the Bill are consistent with the overall policy of self regulation by the profession. However, that policy of self regulation needs to be counterbalanced and supplemented with safeguards to protect the public interest.  This Bill provides for such safeguards.  Many provisions in the Bill call for change and innovation on the part of solicitors.  I am confident that this old and honourable profession will adapt to the changes proposed in the Bill and will continue to prosper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> I look forward to an interesting and lively debate on the many issues which arise and I will be happy to provide further explanation to Senators of any particular provisions they may wish to raise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the legislation I have been aware for some time that there has been cause to introduce changes in the law relating to solicitors and a Bill was produced in 1991 to do this.  The Bill is too limited in its objectives. We need a root and branch reform of the legal profession and legal operating systems to bring them up to standards of efficiency achieved in other areas of business and the professions.  While the Bill before the House contains many important changes, it is difficult to understand why the Government should confine reform to only one aspect of the legal environment and totally disregard the rest.  The entire legal arena needs urgent and radical reform.</P>
      <P>The public perception of the legal area is not healthy.  The public perceives the legal environment in which we operate to be antiquated, clumsy, inefficient and inadequate in serving the people.  It is a fact that the vast majority of those who operate the legal system are honourable, decent, honest people who do an important job as well as they can on behalf of their clients.  Solicitors are not merely members of a profession acting for private clients but are also officers of the court.  They handle trust money and property for their clients.  The public interest requires from the members of that profession, both individually and as a professional body, high standards of efficiency, integrity and, above all, honesty. For these reasons, the Bill before the House must seek to regulate the general affairs of the legal profession and also safeguard the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with the efficiency &mdash; or, more correctly, the inefficiency &mdash; of the court system.  As a layman, I am often amazed to see court rooms at 10 a.m. full of solicitors, barristers, gardaí, witnesses and so on waiting for a case to be called. It appears that there is no proper listing system and, consequently, everybody <Col N="2102" /> arrives at 10 a.m., resulting in an enormous waste of man hours by the legal profession and others.  I have been obliged to appear as a witness and have left my work to give evidence of two minutes duration and had to wait for several days to do so.  This approach adds to the overall cost which is funded by the taxpayer.  Surely, in this age of highly trained public servants and computer technology, we could have a more simplified and efficient system.</P>
    <P>Another issue of which I have had experience is the changing of barristers at the last moment in a case.  It is not unusual for a barrister to return a brief to a solicitor at very short notice.  This can occur after a case has been in a solicitor's office for several years.  To the client, it is a most important matter in their lives and often they have built up a relationship with a barrister.  However, a different individual may be asked to take the brief at the very last moment.  He or she will not know the client and the client will be grossly disillusioned by the change in personnel and will inevitably feel insecure as a result of the change.  Whatever the reason for this, changes must be made to prevent such a situation occurring. It does nothing for the image of the legal profession to allow it to continue.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about the training and appointment of judges.  It is difficult for the public to understand the considerable variation in thinking and determining of levels of sanctions between judges, up to and including High Court level.  Those wishing to serve as judges in our courts should undergo some training prior to appointment and guidelines should be set to determine the suitability of individuals to serve in this capacity.  Judges should also have the benefit of in-service training. Many areas of law require great sensitivity, such as the family law area.  I do not see why a solicitor should not be considered for appointment to any court provided he or she is a suitable candidate.</P>
    <P>A barrister, in assessing the chances of success of a case with a solicitor and clients, will often take into account which judge will hear the case.  There should be a means to prevent this from occurring. <Col N="2103" /> I am only too aware of the divergence in sentences imposed by different judges for similar offences.  This even applies to breaches of the Road Traffic Act.  Such differences have recently become obvious.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Law Reform Commission on its work.  It has produced excellent reports over the years, but unfortunately many are gathering dust on the shelves of the Department of Justice. Why do we have an excellent body such as the Law Reform Commission many of whose recommendations are not followed? The Law Reform Commission is capable of producing legislation to progress its recommendations and the Government should encourage it to publish Bills embodying many aspects of its reports.  Any changes the Government may wish to make subsequently could be introduced on Committee Stage.  This would mean that changes in our laws would occur more quickly than through the present system.  Many of our criminal laws are out of date and, as Fine Gael has suggested for many years, the Government should set up a criminal law reform commission to deal specifically with this area of law.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern which I raised in the House on a number of occasions is the work of the Land Registry.  I regard delays in the Land Registry as nothing short of appalling.  This has nothing to do with the excellent staff who man the Land Registry office and who work in antiquated conditions.  Systems should be updated and staff should be trained to deal with them.  Staff in the Land Registry work hard and do excellent work in extreme conditions.</P>
    <P>It has been shown over and over again that changes in the Land Registry would not alone lead to greater efficiency but would be self-financing.  Delays in having land registered can have serious effects on the economy and can cause a great deal of extra expense and annoyance to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>On the general principles of the Bill before the House, I refer to the report of the Fair Trade Commission published in <Col N="2104" /> March 1990, which states that the commission considers that there is a fundamental requirement that the public should have available an adequate supply of legal service of sufficient quality with a wide degree of choice among practitioners, delivered efficiently at a reasonable price.  It accepts that it is in the public interest that suppliers of legal services should maintain a high standard of competence, conduct, integrity and independence for the protection of the consumers.  That is a useful and fundamental statement of our concerns in dealing with legislation for legal services and the legal profession generally.</P>
    <P>Members will note the Fair Trade Commission refers to an adequate supply of legal services.  I am disappointed that the Bill deals only with solicitors.  Other groups apart from solicitors are involved in the due process of law.  Why are barristers, including Senior Counsels excluded from the Bill?  Do we have a three tier system of legislation?  This Bill will effectively deal with the lowest rank in the legal profession and leave the other two tiers alone.  Why do we not extend the legislation to all those involved in the legal profession?  The many ills in relation to the administration of justice about which we hear so much from clients and solicitors in the legal profession, are not confined to complaints from solicitors only.  This legislation should extend to all involved in the legal area.</P>
    <P>Do we need two separate groups of lawyers?  Is the public interest best served by continuing the existing professions?  It is a strict rule of the Bar Council that in almost all cases, except where an opinion is sought or where professionals such as accountants are allowed access to barristers for briefing, a barrister must not accept a brief except on the instructions of a solicitor.  What is the logic in continuing such a practice?  Why should the Bar Council be allowed to dictate this approach?  Surely these matters should be laid down by legislation and not by an independent body?</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission believes that no rule should limit direct access.  It recommends that whether or <Col N="2105" /> not a solicitors is involved, there should be a direct contractual relationship between a barrister and a client.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the public to make complaints and take proceeding against solicitors, something which we welcome.  Why should barristers be free from such remedy?  Is it time the unnecessary differences between the two branches of the profession were eliminated and to consider the fusion of these professionals into one profession of lawyer which would include training as well as practising law?  This process would be helped by the appointment of solicitors to the bench of every court up to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I suspect that one of the reasons the Bar Council clings to the out dated practice of wearing wigs and gowns is to continue the distinction between barristers and solicitors and to keep the latter out of the High Court.  Since solicitors are considered capable of arguing their case as far as the Supreme Court, as they have since the Courts Act, 1971, they should be allowed to sit on the bench of the same court.  It would further the unification of the professions if the restrictive practice of access to barristers via solicitors was eliminated.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions in this House I raised the wearing of wigs and gowns by barristers in court.  The Minister has frequently commented on this during discussions on Bills in this House.  Although he promised to take action if the Bar Council did not do so, yet none has been taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Barristers continue to wear wigs and gowns in court.  It is interesting to note the views of the Fair Trade Commission in this regard.  The commission does not believe that the wearing of wigs, in particular, adds to the formality and solemnity of the court, but the reverse.  It considers wigs to be anachronistic, unnecessary and possibly intimidatory. In so far as they convey a degree of anonymity to barristers, the commission considers this to be contrary to <Col N="2106" /> its recommendations concerning a closer relationship between barrister and client. Wigs differentiate between barristers and solicitors in court and may inhibit solicitors from representing their clients more frequently.  The commission also stated that since both judges and barristers wear wigs, this may convey the impression of an association and a community of interest between the two.  The commission stated that it would be a sensible move towards a more modern profession if barristers no longer wore wigs. I invite the Minister to comment on this.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed about the dual role of the Law Society, which is both a trade union association representing solicitors and a body which has been conferred with certain duties to protect the public.  Surely there is a conflict of interest?  The Law Society worked in favour of solicitors in the past and there is no indication that there will be any change in the future although the independent adjudicator provisions will help in this area.  The role of the protector of lawyers' clients should be taken from the Law Society and given to an independent body with the right to hear complaints against solicitors and barristers.  The duality of roles is not in the public's interest and is causing increasing concern, even among solicitors.</P>
      <P>Part III deals with disciplinary matters. It is to be welcomed because it provides for the investigation of complaints about inadequate services, not just in relation to possible negligence but also complaints about shoddy work and clients not receiving notice of excessive fees charged by solicitors.  The appointment of lay members to the disciplinary tribunal is also welcome.  The tribunal will have the power to summons witnesses, take evidence and impose sanctions in cases of misconduct.  There is also provision for the publication of information on complaints received by the Law Society which will help to protect the clients of solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to comment on the cost of the new measures contained in the Bill.  What is the envisaged cost of the redress where there are complaints to the <Col N="2107" /> new adjudicator and complaints about the negligence of solicitors and who will bear this cost?  Will it be the Law Society or will the Government provide funding? If the profession is allowed to be self regulatory, there is surely a case to be made for the profession funding the protection of members' clients.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in Part IV which contains additional proposals for the protection of clients.  This includes compulsory indemnity cover for solicitors against civil liability and a new power for the Law Society to intervene in the interest of clients where a solicitor is guilty of dishonesty or a sole practitioner ceases to practise, dies or abandons his or her practice.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with the educational requirements of solicitors.  It should be compulsory for all solicitors to take practice management training on a regular basis as insufficient education on how to properly manage a practice is provided for solicitors in the pre-qualifying stages. A solicitor's practice is essentially a business. Many lawyers may be extremely efficient in dealing with the legal aspects of their firms but can be ignorant about the management of a practice and clients' accounts.  This can lead to shoddy workmanship and negligence claims.  Compulsory business management training should be necessary for solicitors in the pre-qualifying stages of their training. This is particularly important for the management of a client's money and the proper functioning of a credible solicitor's office.</P>
    <P>Part VII contains miscellaneous provisions including the computerisation of the roll of solicitors and a requirement that the Law Society maintain a register of solicitors prepared to act against other solicitors.  This is an important measure because many solicitors would refuse point blank to take an action against a colleague.</P>
    <P>The requirement on solicitors to give clients some indication of litigation costs is welcome.  Litigation is very expensive and its cost is not helped by the delays caused by a badly funded and inefficient <Col N="2108" /> court system.  Delays caused by administrative deficiencies and an inadequate team of Circuit Court and High Court judges undermine the administration of law and contribute to the high cost of litigation.  We must not ignore the impact of the inherent deficiencies in the administration of the court system as they also affect the efficient conduct of commerce and industry.  If we correct the deficiencies in the court system and impose proper control on solicitors in respect of costs, we should solve many of the problems.</P>
    <P>Many people are extremely upset about legal fees because they have not been made aware of them by their solicitors. Legal costs are extremely high and put enormous pressure on people who do not have access to free civil legal aid.  The cost of litigation should be raised at the first interview with the solicitor and solicitors should not shy from discussing fees at an early stage.</P>
    <P>A solicitor should be compelled to inform clients about the cost and the possibility and implications of losing the case.  Only one person can win a civil case and a client who loses is often presented with a large bill.  Solicitors should inform their clients of this, discuss whether it is worth going to court and explore the possibility of negotiating a settlement. Section 68 goes a long way towards controlling this area and we look forward to teasing it out on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is overdue but positive and reforming legislation.  I hope it is the beginning and not the end of a reform in this area as further reform is necessary.  The legal profession is an integral part of our system of justice and a very influential grouping in their own right.  However, the influence wielded by any group in Irish society should not render it immune from the introduction of new legislation and the demands of a changing society.  I am not convinced that the legal profession has adapted to changing times and that is precisely why this legislation is so welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us have required the services of a solicitor or barrister at some stage. <Col N="2109" /> This is often an uncomfortable business and I advise anyone who has found a good solicitor or barrister to cherish him or her.  We have all heard horror stories about people who had to engage the services of a solicitor or barrister when they were at their most vulnerable and needed people to represent them in a capable fashion.  Bad representation and shoddy workmanship present a tremendous cost to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The legal profession surrounds itself with language, codes of dress and arcane rituals which intimidate and confuse lay people.  As Senator Neville said there is room for further reform in these matters. Unfortunately, the rituals and language contribute to an unequal relationship between the solicitor and the client.  The client is often reluctant to ask the solicitor questions because of a lack of knowledge.</P>
    <P>I have on occasion been involved with constituents during or after court cases where they believed that the barrister or solicitor had not represented them properly. This was not because of shoddy workmanship but because they were not listening to the points made by the client before the case and did not ask the questions which would have assisted the case. For that reason I welcome the setting up of the disciplinary tribunal on which there will be lay representation, it is a step in the right direction.  I ask the Minister to consider further relaxing the situation.</P>
    <P>As a member of a committee in the Four Courts I suggested to barristers and judges sitting on the committee that lay people are best equipped to represent themselves, particularly in family law cases.  The learned gentlemen were horrified at my suggestion that the people with the best knowledge of their own circumstances should be permitted to come into court.  This is true in family cases and I presume the law allows it but it does not happen very often.</P>
    <P>Parties to family law cases, men and women, have said to me that they believed their point was not listened to and decisions were handed down which were grossly unfair and unjust to them. They believed the same decision would not have been made if they had been <Col N="2110" /> allowed to present their case.  The people affected are capable of putting their own case but the legal profession underestimates their ability.  I ask the Minister to consider this point.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville mentioned the insistence of members of the legal profession on wearing wigs and gowns.  This was raised in the other House and I know the Minister has referred to it on many occasions.  While we might regard it as rather quaint, it is a badge of elitism we can well do without.  The garb only serves to compound the public perception of the legal profession as distant and removed. If nuns are able to doff the habit without inhibiting their work in the community I do not see why the legal profession cannot follow suit.  As Senator Neville said, the insistence on the continued wearing of wigs and gowns is to distinguish barristers from solicitors in courts.  It also establishes a link between judges and barristers, this is wrong.  I support Senator Neville's comments that there is a case to be made for appointing solicitors to the bench.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the profession of lawyer, as distinct from the dual system of solicitor and barrister, is another proposal which probably has widespread support but does not form part of this legislation &mdash; although from some of the Minister's comments it may be put forward at a later date.  Solicitors can argue a case to Supreme Court but I do not think it is done often.  If they can do so, I do not see the need for the dual system. I hope the Minister will tackle that matter.  Lawyers should represent people in court and, where possible, people should be able to represent themselves.</P>
    <P>The legal profession, like many others, surrounds itself with impenetrable jargon and this has contributed to the gap between the client and the offerer of the service.  It is understandable that they use such jargon &mdash; all professions have jargon &mdash; but only to a degree.  There comes a point where jargon becomes more of a hindrance than a help, and it becomes a real and active barrier to better understanding on the part of the consumer. In terms of changing or adapting this <Col N="2111" /> language, it is up to the legal profession itself to make the necessary changes.  I hope it will act accordingly.</P>
    <P>At a time when many public bodies and professions are changing, the legal profession cannot be seen to set itself apart.  A case in point is the medical profession which used to be associated with the use of jargon and the exclusion of client or patient from a relationship. That has changed dramatically and those who visit their GP or have occasion to use consultants in hospital have found that when they ask a question they get a reply in layman's language.  That is not yet the position with many members of the legal profession.  They will have to change but if they do not, the Minister will be forced to make further changes to the law.</P>
    <P>The language and presence of the legal profession and the Judiciary in court is not client oriented &mdash; it is a game.  I have attended court on a few occasions and it appeared that what was being played out was a game between the judge and the barristers who were representing the clients.  The game seemed to revolve around who was the smarter and which of the barristers could make the most impressive point to the judge.  The ordinary person involved felt it had nothing to do with right or wrong or the merits of their case.  Because to the nature of our justice system cases hinge on precedent and quoting previous cases of law.  That is probably correct to a point but justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done, and in many cases it is not so perceived by the client.  This legislation is client oriented and the users of the service will welcome it.</P>
    <P>I have noted that the legal profession is over-sensitive to any perceived criticism. This should not be so.  Nobody should be over-sensitive to positive and constructive criticism.  All professions must change with the times and, above all, become more accessible to the members of the public they serve.  I support Senator Neville's point that a contract should exist between barrister and client. It is unacceptable that a barrister should <Col N="2112" /> be briefed only by a solicitor and that no contract is formed between the client and the barrister.</P>
    <P>I labour the point because it is worth repeating &mdash; clients often feel that the barrister they meet for five or ten minutes goes into court not knowing the intimate details of the case.  It may not help them to put the legal points but if they had a feel for the person they are supposed to represent, the client would at least feel they are being served properly.  While there is no accountability by barristers to the people they represent, there will always be shortcomings in the relationship between barrister and client.</P>
    <P>I understand the consumer rights argument. The Programme for Government contains a range of commitments with regard to consumer protection and many of these commitments have already been acted upon.  No one group can remain removed from this process, and that includes solicitors and barristers.</P>
    <P>Changes are proposed in relation to the Law Society.  It is seen as the trade union for solicitors and to have it as a watchdog &mdash; as was the position to date &mdash; over solicitors constituted a conflict of interests.  Furthermore, on the one occasion I made a complaint the Incorporated Law Society it refuse to take any action.  There was no further recourse; there is no other court of appeal for anyone who has a justifiable complaint and makes it to the Incorporated Law Society.  It is the final arbiter.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an independent adjudicator as provided for in this legislation is vital and is one of the most important and welcome aspects of the Bill.  It is the first time the client has been acknowledged as a consumer and not just an object between solicitor and barrister who has no rights as to how he is represented. The decision in the legislation to publish information on complaints received will make practitioners more alert.  No group can be seen to be above the law and above complaint.  I particularly welcome the appointment of lay persons to the tribunal.  It further strengthens my call for increased representation by people in certain courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2113" /> The Minister referred to the increased controls over solicitors who abscond with clients' funds.  Such cases are often highlighted in the media and there is a need to prevent this.  I have been informed of cases where pensioners have seen accountants or solicitors walk away with their life savings.  These people need to be protected.  However, such cases are in the minority.  The cases about which I have received complaints have more to do with shoddy representation.  The client or the consumer has had little redress.</P>
    <P>It was important that the Minister did not just give additional powers to the Law Society or set up the tribunal because without the proviso that a solicitor would be available to take a case against another solicitor it would have been futile.  I know of a case where a solicitor who was approached to take on a case which another solicitor had not dealt with properly discovered that a complaint had been made to the Law Society and decided not to take on the case.  It is a vital safeguard for the consumer that there is a panel of solicitors willing to take cases on behalf of people who have not been represented properly.  This is positive and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The courts system needs a major overhaul sooner rather than later.  A huge amount of the time of members of the Garda Síochána, the public and the legal profession is wasted hanging around, waiting to see what time they will be called, if at all.  It is not sensible to call all cases at 10.30 a.m. or 2 p.m.  I accept that the workload of the courts is extremely heavy but I do not accept that there is no way around the problem of everybody being called to the courts at 10.30 a.m.  This needs to be addressed if we are to continue to focus on the fact that this is a service and not just something people might get at the discretion of others.  The service that is offered needs to be improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the education and training aspects of the Bill, which are most welcome.  The change in the length of time during which apprenticeships may <Col N="2114" /> be offered will increase the number of apprenticeship places available.  Many students are finding it difficult to secure an apprenticeship and this welcome change will help.  Perhaps I am over optimistic but the Minister appears to suggest that in time there will be a common system of representation, in terms of lawyers only.</P>
    <P>The point about solicitors advertising has received much criticism, some of which is warranted.  There is a suggestion that the bulk of solicitors who advertise deal with compensation claims, so called &ldquo;ambulance chasing&rdquo; solicitors.  This has brought the profession into disrepute. However, it exists and if a person has a valid claim they are entitled to seek legal advice.  I have always had a problem with the manner in which those cases are taken on a 10 per cent &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; basis. The Minister is tackling this issue and that is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of charges, it is vital that anybody using a service or going for a consultation for a service should have some idea of what it is likely to cost.  If one goes to any professional for a service, one must know the cost involved in order to know if one can meet it.  The only exception is if one requires medical treatment but one has insurance which will cover the cost.  It is ridiculous for somebody to pluck a fee out of the sky.</P>
    <P>However, I have a particular problem with the Incorporated Law Society's reluctance to allow people to advertise a fee for services.  The Minister specifically referred to this when he said that the society also suggests that price advertising is likely to expose the public to the risk of shoddy work from unscrupulous solicitors.  Whatever about unscrupulous solicitors, if it has a problem with that, it should deal with it.  This exudes an air of superiority.  People take weighty decisions daily, such as the purchase of a home.  Is there a suggestion that we are not capable of making a decision on the basis of somebody offering a cheap service, which is obviously what one will receive, or a much more expensive service?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> The legal profession should not feel threatened by this Bill.  The vast majority of the profession carry out their duties to the best of their abilities but nothing should be taken for granted.  The strengthening of controls, established in this Bill, is most welcome.  It allows for greater answerability and more protection for consumers.  That is the direction in which all legislation should go.</P>
    <P>The process of reform must be ongoing.  The legal profession can help themselves and the Minister has stated that on many occasions by being pro-active in changing the ways and means of how they carry out their business. However, if they are not seen to change as time and consumers dictate, it will most assuredly be time for further legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  Its purpose, as the explanatory memorandum outlines, is to effect major reform of the law relating to solicitors. This is to be welcomed because the legal profession has come in for much criticism of late from the public.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced in the Bill allow for procedures to deal with complaints against solicitors, which are of great concern to the public.  When dealing with many professionals, ordinary members of the public feel they are at a distinct disadvantage due to their lack of knowledge of the system in relation to, for example, legal matters or, as Senator McGennis said, the medical profession. When dealing with professionals, if one does not have a great knowledge of the profession involved, one can be intimidated. Many lay people would be concerned about taking up issues with their solicitor in relation to how the case is dealt with and the costs they are charged. The reforms introduced in the Bill are most welcome from that point of view. Many of the provisions are in favour of the consumer, and that is also to be welcomed. The balance is tilted in favour of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> The Bill also introduces measures to increase the Law Society's powers to intervene in solicitors' practices and increases the High Court's supervisory functions over the legal profession.  This is an area of concern to the public.  These measures are welcome.  The provisions in the Bill in relation to the Law Society's function regarding the education and training of solicitors and the changes that have been introduced are very important.</P>
    <P>This legislation originated in 1984 when the then Minister for Industry and Commerce requested the Restrictive Practices Commission, which became the Fair Trade Commission, to undertake a study under section 12 of the Restrictive Practices Act.  It was to look into certain professional bodies and practices which were deemed to be very restrictive, those which curtailed or limited employment opportunities and practices which led to increased costs to the consumer.  The comprehensive report was published in April 1990.  As the Minister said, a Bill was introduced in the 26th Dáil but lapsed with the fall of that Dáil.  The legislation has been updated and this Bill is a result of that work.</P>
    <P>As previous Senators have stated, it is regrettable that we are only dealing with one area of the profession, although the Bill is quite detailed and that is welcome. In common with other Senators, I would like reforms of other areas of the legal profession and we look forward to the Minister introducing reforms in those areas.</P>
    <P>Central to the report of the commission was that the Incorporated Law Society or the Bar Council should be requested to delete certain clauses from their rules or codes of conduct, failing which a restrictive practices order could be introduced which would make such clauses illegal.  It also provided that a legal ombudsman should have powers to prosecute solicitors on behalf of clients.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with disciplinary matters and it will be welcomed by the public because it provides for the investigation of complaints by the public about inadequate services.  We are not just talking about negligence but also <Col N="2117" /> shoddy work and complaints about clients not receiving adequate notice of the details of the fees that are charged by their solicitor.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the Bill is the appointment of lay members to the disciplinary tribunal and it confers powers on that tribunal to summon witnesses, take evidence and impose sanctions in the case of misconduct.  All these provisions are welcome.  The Bill also provides for the publication of information on complaints received by the Law Society.  There are many measures contained in the Bill but the main priority is the protection of the client as a consumer of a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill contains proposals for the protection of clients, including a welcome provision for compulsory indemnity cover for solicitors against civil liability claims.  It also contains a new power for the Law Society to intervene in the interests of clients where a solicitor has been found guilty of dishonesty, where a sole practitioner ceases to practice, where he dies or abandons his or her practice or where he becomes insolvent or is declared bankrupt.</P>
    <P>The proposal to cap payments from the compensation fund caused some controversy. The Minister has increased the sum of £250,000, the figure in the Bill when drafted, to £350,000.  That is a welcome change.  I also welcome the fact that financial institutions cannot claim from this fund; it is specifically for solicitors' clients.  The financial institutions are well aware of their rights and have access to appropriate advice when dealing with solicitors.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision in section 9 that in exceptional circumstances the cap can be extended for cases of hardship. That is an essential provision.  The Law Society was concerned that without a cap on the fund there would be no protection against extremely large claims.  It was also concerned that the fund would become unsustainable in terms of the contributions which individual solicitors would be obliged to make.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> Part V of the Bill deals with educational requirements for solicitors.  It is a welcome provision.  That area required examination.  Senator Neville said that many solicitors do not appear to have management training; the Minister said in the Dáil that it would be important for solicitors to have some management practice training.  Solicitors are dealing with large sums of money and, due to shoddy workmanship, they may give rise to claims for negligence, although some of my colleagues would be of the opinion that in many cases where solicitors make off with clients' money the solicitors are well aware of what they are doing and are not ignorant of practice.</P>
    <P>Management training is important because solicitors deal with substantial amounts of clients' money.  The Law Society should make it compulsory for solicitors to occasionally take courses related to management practice.  I also welcome the provision precluding solicitors from going into sole practice until they have been qualified for at least three years.  It is important that young solicitors acquire the necessary experience before they establish their practices.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill refers to miscellaneous provisions such as the computerisation of the roll of solicitors and the requirement on the Law Society to maintain a register of solicitors who are prepared to take actions for clients against other solicitors.  This is an important provision because in the past I have dealt with people who found it extremely difficult to get solicitors to act for them in actions against other solicitors.  Many members of the public feel vulnerable when they are dealing with the legal profession and it is essential that somebody is seen to be on the consumers' side when they run into problems.  As the Minister said, most solicitors are hard working and honest but, unfortunately, since the public can be badly affected by a small minority, these provisions are welcome.</P>
    <P>The requirement for solicitors to tell their clients the expected costs of the litigation in advance is welcome.  Many people are shocked at the size of the legal bill when they are obliged to pay costs. <Col N="2119" /> Most people who go to court are optimistic about winning their cases.  Many do not envisage having to pay the legal fees.  Legal costs can be substantial and can be a shock to clients.  It is worth pointing out that not all the costs involved are attributable to the solicitors' or barristers' fees; they are also attributable to the delays in our justice system.  There is a shortage of judges in the Circuit and High Courts and there is a large backlog of cases.  This can contribute to the size of legal costs.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that problem with a view to improving the efficiency of the court system.  That might result in a small reduction in legal costs.  It is not a major cause of high legal fees but it deserves consideration in that context.</P>
    <P>Legal costs are prohibitive particularly for people who do not have access to free legal aid.  As Senator McGennis said, the only other large costs people incur when dealing with professionals are medical costs, and many of those can be covered by insurance.  It is important to introduce measures that would reduce legal costs for ordinary individuals.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with advertising of fees has proved to be controversial.  As a person who believes in competition, I should not be opposed to this provision. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that even though the Law Society objects to it, he believes that people do not make decisions based on price only and that the reputation, dependability and quality of service would also be taken into consideration by the public.  People are not fools.  However, this measure has resulted in substantial reductions in costs particularly in other countries.  I support the provision for that reason.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fail-safe provision which will allow a periodic review of our experience of advertising of fees.  This will enable the Law Society to prohibit fee advertising in respect of given services but with the consent of the Minister.  My only concern is that the advertising we have seen thus far from the legal profession has not been great.  Much of it is of the ambulance chasing variety which <Col N="2120" /> almost encourages people to take actions against insurance companies and local authorities.  We have had several discussions in this House about the high cost of insurance, the amount of damages awarded for claims and the consequent effect on society in general.  I am concerned that a small minority of solicitors might unscrupulously advertise fees and encourage people to take such cases. However, the safeguards introduced by the Minister are welcome.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first introduced consideration was given to extending will making and probate services to banks and other institutions.  I welcome the fact that credit unions will be allowed to provide such services.  However, the Minister's safeguards in this area are also welcome.  Many of us in our experience of dealing with banks are familiar with the pressure they can exert on their clients to avail of the services of their insurance companies.  It has given some of us cause for concern so the extension of this provision to credit unions is welcome.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  Its reforms will ensure that clients of solicitors are better protected by the law in their dealings with solicitors.  It also requires the legal profession to maintain the highest standard of conduct and a strict disciplinary system.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1994.  I note with interest the use throughout the Bill of the male gender when referring to the profession. The parliamentary draftsman should note that there have been more female than male entrants to the profession in recent years.  I am aware that we passed legislation recently which made gender terms applicable to both sexes but, where possible, such legislation should state &ldquo;him and her&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has received much attention to date from the media, the Law Society, the Bar Council, consumers' organisations and many individuals.  Many years have passed since the legal profession was given an overhaul.  The discussions <Col N="2121" /> conducted since this Bill was introduced have been welcome in awakening the practitioners and public to the need for change.  Every professional body should examine how it operates from time to time.  The proposed legislation has caused the Law Society to look at itself and examine ways in which it can effect beneficial change.  However, we should be wary of change for the sake of change or change as a result of lobby groups which operate in many spheres of the legal profession.  I wish, therefore, to express caution and concern regarding certain aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As a practising solicitor I welcome the Bill's provisions in sections 8 to 15 for the investigation of complaints.  It damages all solicitors when a consumer of a legal service gets a raw deal; when a client feels he or she was not provided with a proper legal service or overcharged for it. The individual with cause for complaint must have a procedure by which the wrong can be rectified or compensated for in an appropriate fashion.</P>
    <P>At present the individual can complain to the Incorporated Law Society which then raises the matter with the solicitor concerned, giving her an opportunity to explain her actions.  The Law Society relays that response to the complainant who may again reply.  I have seen this procedure in operation and have heard complaints about it; people have said it is inadequate, cumbersome, time consuming, unfair and often unproductive. We know the maxim that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, welcome the provision of a complaints procedure in a statutory format.  We all need to know that a channel is open to us as consumers by which we can hope to redress wrongs.  The procedures outlined in the Bill and the powers given to the Law Society, courts and individuals to effect these procedures appear to be adequate and workable.  I hope they are implemented and thus show the public that the law protects them from the wrongs or neglects of solicitors they have retained.</P>
    <P>I especially welcome the sanctions imposed against those few solicitors who <Col N="2122" /> tend to charge excessive fees.  It often seems to be the poorer or less educated client who bears the brunt of the unscrupulous solicitor who overcharges for services, while shrewd business people can negotiate fees.  I welcome the protection this Bill will provide for the more innocent consumer of legal services.</P>
    <P>It is annoying that, because certain solicitors tend to overcharge, the profession as a whole has a bad name.  In smaller firms, work is done for which no fee is charged or collected.  Much of a solicitor's average working day can be taken up in dealing with telephone queries, once off letters to deal with client's problems and miscellaneous matters for which a fee is never charged.  In a town practice one cannot afford to alienate potential clients; therefore, work is unpaid and not every solicitor makes a huge amount of money.  It is unhelpful and unfair to tar all solicitors with the same brush on the fees issue.</P>
    <P>Also, because of vastly increased competition in the profession, many solicitors find it hard to make ends meet, particularly those who do not own a practice and people starting out after many years of expensive college education and poorly paid apprenticeships.  That said, one hopes the sections of the Bill which provide a procedure for complaints will not only benefit the public but give them a wider perception of the problems of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>The procedure for complaints should be totally independent of the profession. However, section 15 of this Bill requires the Law Society &ldquo;to establish, maintain and fund a scheme for the examination and investigation by an independent adjudicator of any written complaint&rdquo;.  Is it perhaps rather too clever of the State to introduce major and significant reforms and changes in legislation and then require solicitors to run and pay for it themselves?  It is unfair that solicitors have to pay for a watchdog.  If it is agreed by all that a complaints procedure is necessary to protect our citizens, the State should pay for it, as it pays for the Ombudsman and other institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2123" /> More importantly, the best way to protect legal clients is to provide for an independent legal ombudsman, paid by the State.  That would eliminate the Law Society's power to determine clients' complaints.  Lay people know nothing of the Law Society, the Bar Council and other organisations for legal eagles; therefore, they are naturally wary of approaching such a body or a person appointed by such bodies with a complaint. Again, justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice should reexamine these provisions and consider appointing an independent legal combudsman to effect the new procedures.  This would greatly improve how the profession is perceived and the effectiveness of the complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>Previous legislation provided that a complaint must be brought within five years of the event giving rise to it.  Section 15 (4) (f) of this Bill, however, allows an individual a further three years to raise the complaint with an adjudicator.  In essence, a complainant will be able to wait many years before raising a concern and follow a solicitor for eight years to deal with it.  Information and documents may then be missing, practices may have changed and other factors altered, yet a complainant can pursue a solicitor for a potential eight or nine years.  Is that time provision necessary?  It should be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>Section 15 (11) requires the adjudicator to obtain the prior written authority of a client in possession of documents needed to deal with a complaint. However, it does not appear to provide for the client refusing to co-operate. What would happen in such circumstances? Perhaps that should be provided for in the section.</P>
    <P>Having raised those queries, I generally welcome the protections for our citizens in the Bill.  The penalties and disciplinary actions which may be taken against the offending solicitor will cause the profession to take heed of the Bill when implemented.  The resulting increase in the quality of service and the <Col N="2124" /> ways in which solicitors deal with the initial complaint made directly to them will be vastly improved as a result of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Another bone of contention in the legal field is the capping of awards.  It is ironic that while legislation such as this gives protection to our citizens, it also considers reducing their rights by limiting compensation awards.  This is giving with one hand and taking with another.  How can we say that, no matter how appalling the injuries and consequential loss suffered by an individual, the independent Judiciary can only award up to a maximum sum deemed and determined by legislation?</P>
    <P>The shrewd lobbyists of the insurance industry have argued that compensation must be limited if insurance costs are to be reduced.  This is untrue and unfair. When people suffer injury through no fault of theirs and have their claim litigated, the court should have full power to determine the compensation warranted and should not be fettered by restraints won by greedy insurance groups.  The capping of awards is unjust to the victims of accidents and should be scrapped.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, some insurance firm bosses have admitted that limiting awards will not reduce our insurance costs.  How would it, since so much of the cost is caused by uncontested and easily settled claims, huge administrative costs and the ever large profits for insurance company shareholders?  We should not be blinded by the empty promise of reduced insurance costs by taking this step and thus penalising the unfortunate victim who will be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions on education and recruitment to the legal profession, the solicitor's profession in particular.  Many of the changes are welcome and appear to ease entry but all is still not well.  For the first time, solicitor friends of mine are unemployed as a result of the vast increase in the numbers entering the profession.  This has happened to them after seven years of education and training.  My office receives applications for apprenticeships every week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> This is a practice owner's paradise. Such solicitors can choose to employ a solicitor at a low salary, or take on an apprentice &mdash; this Bill now provides that they can employ two, who will be paid a pittance.  While the Law Society recommends certain levels of pay to apprentices, they cannot rely on this.  As many apprentices are seeking an office where they can gain the experience necessary to qualify as a solicitor, the solicitor owning the firm may feel free to offer paltry pay as he knows the students are almost begging for the opportunity to be hired. While the opening up of the profession may facilitate legal partners to hire their sons and daughters, I am concerned that it will work against those without connections. Brains and ability are no longer the only requirements needed to qualify as a solicitor.  One now needs to know someone in the profession who is in a position of authority and one also needs money so that they can live on the shameful pay apprentices are given.  This worries me greatly and I am disappointed the Bill does not protect the apprentice or make entry into the profession easier for those without money or connections.</P>
    <P>Having read the Bill and listened to the earlier debates, I stress that many of the problems experienced by clients are out of the control of the solicitor involved.  However, solicitors suffer the brunt of the complaints, many of which relate to the court procedures necessary to effect legal services.  It is not the solicitor's fault that a case can be arbitrarily adjourned by a judge and left to the next term many months later.  This matter is often out of the solicitor's hands.  We must examine the court procedures, the legislation covering them and the administration of our legal system.  I am pleased the Department of Justice is considering these matters.  I hope legislation will at least be drafted in the next term to deal with some of these shortcomings in the legal procedures which are the main cause of complaint from consumers.</P>
    <P>It is good that this legislation arises from the complaints of various individuals and is providing protection which they justly deserve.  The same protection <Col N="2126" /> is also necessary in relation to barristers. It must be remembered that barristers are often, and necessarily, more distant from clients who perhaps only meets them on the morning of the court. Although one does not dare to question their barrister, it should be done.  Barristers need to be regulated in the same way as solicitors.  The fault lies with many people, yet only solicitors are targeted.  I am anxious to see the same protection given to consumers of legal services from barristers as well as solicitors.  The same protection should be given to the consumers of all professional services.  This should be considered and we should not point the finger at the unfortunate solicitor who is closest to the client.</P>
    <P>The profession welcomes the Bill. Many decent solicitors do an honest day's work and help people whenever they can. It is not always easy for them, especially when they suffer the brunt of the complaints and when people have an unfair perception of them.  This Bill will address many of the problems, an unfair perception of them.  This Bill will address many of the problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Fine Gael group support the general terms of this Bill, which was introduced after much work by the Minister and some of his predecessors. The fact that the principal legislation was approximately 40 years old suggests that its provisions should be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is intended to safeguard clients, to guarantee the consumers' rights and to deal with other related matters. The Minister said that the vast majority of the members of the solicitors profession are decent, hard working people who have their clients' best interests at heart.  Unfortunately, like other professions, it is not without a few bad apples.  Problems have arisen, some of which have been notorious.  This Bill seeks to protect a client's rights.  We are all aware of instances where clients' money was misappropriated.  The gazette of the Law Society regularly publishes the list of payments made to various firms after damage has been done.  The question <Col N="2127" /> of professional indemnity insurance also arises.  From my experience, we could not carry on without it.  However, some solicitors do and, as Senator Gallagher knows, we will all suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the client will be better protected, particularly non-business people whose court award from an estate may have been misappropriated. It is important to look after such people.  Usually the person who is well versed in business does not suffer greatly, although some companies lost out.</P>
    <P>Many complaints have been made about the profession in regard to delays or a lack of knowledge of the system. Delays occur in the various court systems. It takes time for some court cases to be heard.  For example, it would be negligent of a solicitor to proceed with a serious accident case before one knew how the person would recover.  There are delays and problems in the operation of the Land Registry Office and there is a two tier system as regards registry of deeds and registered land.  This means that one must go to different buildings in the city, depending on what county one is dealing with.  This creates problems. There are also delays in the probate and revenue offices.</P>
    <P>The Law Society needs to improve its systems.  The little details which annoy clients result from the non-performance of bodies which are outside the direct control of solicitors.</P>
    <P>The courts system must be considered. Great improvements have been made in certain areas.  Many practical aspects must be considered when appearing for a client in some district courts.  To be fair, facilities in many buildings have been improved but in some local courthouses almost the only place and time it is possible to talk to a client is in the local convenience or outside in the rain.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>At times in other courts the solicitor is with the clients, the barrister comes along at the last minute and so many people are in the building it is like Croke Park on All-Ireland day.  It is not always possible <Col N="2128" /> to hear as the acoustics are very bad, and barristers or solicitors mumble to the judge.  The client is left with a very bad impression.  Barristers and solicitors attend regularly but the client is only there on that day and does not necessarily think he is getting a fair deal.  We are all aware of overcrowded courthouses which must be improved although some have greatly improved their system.  They have waiting and consultation rooms and telephones but I am sure the Minister is only too well aware that some of them still leave much to be desired.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the whole question of how complaints are dealt with is seen to be above board and that the response is adequate, regardless of whether the complaint is serious or trivial. As Senator Gallagher said, the present complaints system has achieved results in many cases, but in regard to some, people felt there was an element of the Law Society looking after its own and that their complaint was not treated in a sufficiently serious manner.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the appointment of the adjudicator or the Ombudsman must be examined.  There have been queries in relation to funding the adjudicator. It is necessary to look at similar bodies to see where they get funding for this office.  I know the Law Society has reservations about the question of funding and some people are concerned that if the Law Society pays for it, the independence of the adjudicator might be compromised.  Perhaps when the Minster is replying he might expand on this and also give us more information in relation to when the office might be set up.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher mentioned the capping of awards and I agree with her.  We must oppose the compensation mentality and what is known in the United States as &ldquo;ambulance chasing&rdquo;.  However, in relation to very serious cases there is a balanced, fair system.  It is possible to get a rough idea on hearing the extent of a person's injuries and on reading the medical report and prognosis as to how much compensation a victim will be awarded.  It would not be fair to value different parts of the anatomy at certain <Col N="2129" /> levels.  Other factors must often by taken into consideration in different cases. There may be shock, disturbance and mental anxiety.  It is not possible to value a certain injury at a certain amount across the board.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks and months many cases have been dismissed by members of the Judiciary.  There is a question of accidents being set up and people developing a stiff neck weeks after an accident where there has been no serious injury.  Some people were almost making an industry out of it.  Accidents have frequently occurred at particular round-abouts in the country and in some cases they were minor but certain individuals were manufacturing claims.  Indeed solicitors and doctors may have been involved and this whole question must be examined.</P>
    <P>I support the basic thrust of this overdue Bill, and I am glad the Minister introduced it.  We have to root out people who have overcharged clients or misappropriated money and deal with them severely.</P>
    <P>To improve the system it is important to realise that solicitors are not the only people at fault.  Other improvements in the system can and should be brought about.</P>
    <P>The sister profession has been mentioned and changes are required there. Perhaps in his reply the Minister will indicate what changes, if any, he sees being brought about.  There was a mention of a fusion of the professions.  Many people would prefer to retain the system with the proposed improvements.  We must see how areas of the legal system can be improved.  We must improve the whole area of the court system and investigate delays.  Some of these people might be in court only once in their lives and they want to see an efficient system.</P>
    <P>The system is not efficient.  We have overcrowded courts with too many cases listed at the one time.  We do not have a satisfactory system in relation to remands and adjournments.  Members of the gardaí have to appear in court as witnesses. Perhaps a better system could be looked at.  We will have the opportunity <Col N="2130" /> on Committee Stage to tease some of the sections out further.  We on this side of the House welcome by and large the contents of the Bill as do most members of the profession.  We want a more efficient and just profession from the solicitors' point of view and, more importantly, from the point of view of consumers.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most other Members I welcome the Bill.  I also welcome the fact that after 40 years a profession is being dragged kicking and screaming into the latter part of the 20th century.  As the Minister and other speakers said, in the last 40 years a great deal has changed in Ireland, not least the relationship between the citizen and authority, whether private or public.  The profession was a rather sleepy one 40 years ago. Competition was a word that very seldom entered the vocabulary but all that has changed.  The profession is now highly competitive.  There has been a huge influx of young talented people into the profession and there is even talk now of a glut of solicitors.  That is not the only change.  The Irish people have become more demanding, more litigious and less willing to tolerate incompetence.  A major change has occurred between the profession and the citizenry.</P>
      <P>The Bill is long overdue.  Its predecessor was introduced to the Dáil in December 1991 but collapsed in November 1992 after a special committee had spent some time considering it.  The Bill is welcome in that it is a reforming measure putting much needed structures in place. The Minster has outlined the four main categories of reform in it.  It protects the clients of what has been a self governing profession, which will re-establish standards of conduct and discipline, will provide for more competition, although sometimes competition is not always what it is cracked up to be, and will update training and education for solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recognises that changing circumstances have largely determined the focus of the Bill, and that there should be a specific focus on the relationship <Col N="2131" /> between the solicitors' profession and the citizen, especially when a complaint arises.</P>
    <P>In terms of consumer protection, the Bill make considerable strides.  It provides for full insurance for damages by solicitors which is welcome.  There is a clear system of redress for excessive charging, which is also welcome.  Many members of the profession who operate on the right side of the dividing line between right and wrong will welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>The powers to intervene in a practice in the interests of a client are clearly detailed and are welcome.  Solicitors must provide up front information to their clients on costs.  That is client and consumer oriented and will not cause any problems for the great bulk of solicitors who operate properly.  It will, however, cause problems for some solicitors.</P>
    <P>The core of the Bill for the consumer is the establishment of a system for investigating complaints against solicitors. Under the scheme envisaged an independent adjudicator is to be appointed and funded by the Law Society with the approval of the Minister.  Annual reports will be made by the adjudicator to be presented to the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Clearly the proposals are a major step forward.  They are innovative, new and progressive.  However, it would have been preferable if the Bill went a step further and appointed an independent Legal Affairs Ombudsman.  This is a drum I have been beating for a number of years.  The Minister is aware that I was vociferous on this matter in the Dáil as far back as April 1992 and in the Oireachtas committee established to deal with the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1991.  On that occasion time allowed me to read into the record of the Dáil the most extraordinary and bizarre case, where, for over 11 years, a person has been scandalously rooked by a number of solicitors and the Law Society has responded with nothing but a snow job.  Unfortunately time constraints today do not permit me to read the case into the record, but it is <Col N="2132" /> cited in the Official Report, 2 April 1992; Vol. 418, col. 511.  Two years later this horrific case continues and the lady is still suffering at the hands of a solicitor and at the hands of the Law Society.</P>
    <P>A complaint mechanism must possess certain objective criteria if it is to be fully successful.  The mechanism must be competent and physically capable of handling complaints.  It must have the authority to go to the heart of the matter, to <i>subpoena</i> witnesses to appear before it.  It must also have the power to compel adherence to its findings.  The complaints mechanism must be physically and psychologically accessible, and above all it must be financially accessible.  It must also be independent of the source of complaint in this case, the profession complained of.  Finally, the mechanism must be appropriate for the culture in which it is to operate.</P>
    <P>While the complaint device created is innovative and welcome, it suffers from a number of major shortcomings.  A Legal Affairs Ombudsman would be infinitely better than the measure proposed.  An ombudsman should be appointed by the Houses of the Oirechtas and funded by way of a bounty charged over the profession. I differ with Senator Gallagher in that I do not believe taxpayers should bear the cost of fixing up messes in any self-appointed profession or self-regulating profession.  An independent ombudsman would possess all of the characteristics which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The problem with the independent adjudicator arises under a number of specific headings.  While doubtless the person appointed will be competent, the capacity of the adjudicator to handle complaints will depend on the level of support the office receives.  However, there is a more fundamental flaw.  I am gravely concerned that the process of investigation envisaged would appear to suggest that the adjudicator will not have an independent capacity to undertake an investigation.  Rather, when the adjudicator is unhappy with how the Law Society has handled a case, he or she will refer the case back to the Law Society for reinvestigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2133" /> I do not wish to be flippant but from my experience of the Law Society, this is the equivalent of requesting Billy Bunter to reinvestigate who broke into the tuck shop.  I have categorised in the Dáil cases where the Law Society has not been just grotesquely incompetent, but criminally unwilling to approach the facts of specific cases.  I have little faith in the society regarding the issue of complaints.</P>
    <P>The biggest single problem with complaints against the legal profession is the perception in society in general that the Law Society deals with every complaint by means of a snow job.  The Dáil Official Report, 2 April 1992; Vol. 418, col. 511 records details of a tragic case which has been before the Law Society whose record is, to say the least, highly questionable.</P>
    <P>In spite of the publicity this case received in 1992, it is still ongoing.  The lady in question has now been reduced to circumstances where she is effectively living in one bedroom on the charity of friends.  It is appalling, scandalous that a woman in her 70s should be reduced to this after 11 years and three separate referrals to the Law Society.  Despite the publicity, this and other cases have been allowed to languish.  It does nothing to elevate in the public view a profession which, by and large, is operated by competent, careful, and caring people.  The number of rogue solicitors are infinitely outweighed by the number of good solicitors.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that the adjudicator's authority will in effect be the authority of the Law Society, which is frequently the subject of complaint.  The complaint mechanism envisaged will also fail the test of accessibility.  People do not have sufficient confidence in the Law Society to be willing to take cases to it. If a case has to go through the Law Society, to the adjudicator and back to the society for re-examination, and the society quite correctly and properly finds in favour of the solicitor, as it must in many cases, people will not believe the society and the finding will not be credible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> The public is suspicious of the Law Society which is viewed as an interest group, more concerned with the interests of its members than those of the public. This may be an unfair judgment, but it is the case.  People frequently reach unfair judgments about professions, for example the public view of our profession is fairly jaundiced.</P>
    <P>An adjudication by the Law Society which finds for a solicitor is inevitably viewed as suspect, defensive and biased. Reinvestigation by the society on the instruction of the adjudicator is no more likely to instil confidence.  The independence of an adjudicator appointed by the Law Society will be subject to public suspicion.  The mechanism is flawed by being out of sympathy with Irish complaints procedures which favour dealing with an individual rather than an institution. This complaint mechanism is oriented towards institutions.</P>
    <P>While the intentions of the adjudication process in the Bill are good, it contains certain flaws. Could the Minister, even at this late stage, take those comments on board?  My criticisms go back to the very drafting of this Bill wherein I would like to see provision for the appointment of an independent ombudsman for legal affairs, in addition to similar appointments for other liberal professions.  No profession in the current day and age can be trusted to be the adjudicator both of its own standards and of complaints against its members.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents progress on a great number of fronts but the mechanism for the appointment of an adjudicator is one which in four or five years time will lack support and confidence.  We will inevitably move towards the appointment of a legal affairs ombudsman.  While I commend the Minister for what is positive in the Bill, I am concerned about the adjudication mechanism.  I hope the Minister will give an undertaking, either in this House or the Lower House, to scrutinise the adjudication mechanism closely over the next three to four years. There should be some process whereby both Houses of the Oireachtas can examine <Col N="2135" /> how efficient the mechanism has been, with a view to moving on to a more independent system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Bill goes to the very heart of our understanding of democracy and to our commitment, if any, to equality of opportunity before the law.  Nearly 20 years ago in Cork, an organisation was set up styling itself the clients of the legal profession.  It later moved to Dublin where an office was established in Arran Quay.  Everyone thought that the new organisation would herald the cleaning up of the legal profession but, unfortunately, it faded away even though the people concerned were really committed. It demonstrated, however, that there were many complaints about the legal profession.  It appears that the organisation disappeared because the legal profession gave a commitment to put its house in order, but obviously that never happened.</P>
      <P>This country prides itself as a democracy with the rights of its citizens guaranteed in a written Constitution and our laws democratically enacted by a freely elected Legislature, but no living democracy can be criticised or circumscribed by laws and the Constitution alone.  The law is only as good as its application which, in this country, leaves much to be desired.  The message from within the legal system is that in order to win in court you must have top lawyers, and to have top lawyers you must be rich. Alternatively, to qualify for free legal aid one must be accused of a crime.  The first law of the Irish legal system is that if you cannot pay you cannot win.  That is a simple fact.  When the average citizen goes to court they are putting their house at risk, which is why so many suffer injustice rather than pursue their legal rights through the courts.  For the vast majority, legal rights only exist in theory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members described their experiences with the law and we have all had such experiences.  Clients of the legal profession who have received little or no satisfaction need to be helped.  I know <Col N="2136" /> of fairly large compensation cases where bank accounts were opened in the joint names of both solicitor and client, and the solicitor's fees could reach any amount.  I have not gone into the Bill in great detail but solicitor's fees is one area that needs to be seriously examined.  I understood that there was a scale of fees but the solicitor and client fees are something else.  I gave up advising people to write to the Incorporated Law Society two or three years ago because it was frustrating. Even though I thought some people had very good cases, it did not seem to make any difference.  I hope that this legislation will do something to rectify that, although I have my doubts.</P>
    <P>On the question of appointing an independent adjudicator to enquire into the Law Society, why has the Minister not conveyed the public's dissatisfaction directly to the Law Society instead of appointing an adjudicator to tell the society what it should do in order to give satisfaction to clients?  That may be putting it bluntly but that is the way I see it.  The penalties for solicitors who engage in shoddy practice are not severe enough. Tougher penalties are the only cure because we have left things go too far.</P>
    <P>When a person comes to the High Court with their family they are worked up because they have been waiting so long for the case to come to court.  Very often they are pressurised to accept a settlement outside the door of the courthouse, and they walk away without even knowing what the settlement was.  In the last 12 months that happened in two cases that I am aware of.  The families concerned were frustrated and were not even invited into the court to hear what the judgment was.</P>
    <P>The entire legal system is in need of fundamental reform.  The legal profession is a closed shop operating the most outrageous restrictive practices.  It needs to be opened up.  The cost of law is excessive and needs to be subjected to competition in the marketplace.  If the Bill is to serve people's interests it must be radically changed to allow for appointing a legal ombudsman with full powers, lifting the time limit within which com-house <Col N="2137" /> pensation claims can be made, lifting the cap on compensation claims, easing access to the legal professions and establishing a system of licensed conveyancers who may compete with solicitors.  Section 78 opens up will-making and probate services to competition from credit unions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he is a proponent of greater competitiveness in the provision of services.  He said that one of the safeguards in the Bill is that &ldquo;credit unions will not be allowed to provide these services until they are subject to the scheme of investigation of complaints which is provided for in section 79 of the Bill or a similar scheme&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on this.  I welcome this change wholeheartedly.  Many people now deal with credit unions and have confidence in them.  This is a great opportunity for them when making wills. Frequently people never think of going to solicitors to make wills and this may result in disputes within families.  Legislation is long overdue and I rely on the Minister to make whatever changes are necessary and to see that whatever is adopted by way of legislation will be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I listened attentively to the magnificent contributions which have already been made.  The contribution of the previous speaker, who like me comes from rural Ireland, was a commonsense one.  Legislation and amendments to it are necessary to deal with changes which occur over the years.  I listened with great interest to the Senators who are members of the legal profession.  I am fully aware that, as in other industries, there is a top income earner in the profession and probably two thirds who are not earning much money as practising solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Castlepollard we are fortunate to have a very renowned solicitor who has practised there for over 45 years and a young man who has practised there for seven or eight years.  They give a great community service, are involved in the community and are personal friends of most of the people who live there.  Unlike the last speaker, I know many people <Col N="2138" /> who have placed their trust in their local solicitor when making their wills and can rely on them.  Only a very small percentage of solicitors, probably less than 0.1 per cent of the profession, have misconducted themselves and given the profession a name which it does not deserve. Most solicitors I know are decent, upstanding men and women, upholders of the law and custodians of the courts. They give a valuable community service to the country in general.</P>
    <P>As a public representative, I find it difficult to understand how conveyancing and probate work can be so time consuming and lengthy.  I used to have a friend, who passed to his eternal reward in 1982, who cut the timescale on such work down to almost a week.  I fail to see how it takes some solicitors six to eight months to process such cases.  I know that the Land Registry office is a major problem.  Some very good people work there but something will have to be done about the problems there.  As a public representative with a large constituency, the Minister would know that there is a major problem in this office at present. It can take from six to eight months to have land registry folios changed or additions made to them.  Perhaps these problems can be dealt with after the summer recess by the Department involved.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that section 67 provides for the drawing up of a list of solicitors who will be willing to provide services to any persons who are not satisfied with the services they have received from their own solicitors and want to take legal action against them.  It is extremely difficult, particularly in rural Ireland, to have a solicitor taken to court.  I am delighted to see that such a list will be in place.</P>
    <P>Due to the increasing number of large claims being made against the owners of establishments such as bars, hotels and theatres, insurance companies will not provide cover for the first £10,000 of such claims.  It is not unusual for owners to have to set aside £40,000 to £50,000 a year for insurance.  If they do not do so, they could easily find themselves with five <Col N="2139" /> or six claims being made against them for sprained ankles, or elbows which have been hurt as a result of being hit against doors.  Often it is one or two solicitors in large towns or cities who handle these cases.  I do not know how the problem of solicitors canvassing for such business and taking a percentage of claims can be tackled.  This is a major problem for people who run businesses such as hotels and give much employment.  Even small hotels employ about 50 people.  Such hotels are significant businesses, particularly in rural Ireland.  They cater for weddings, conferences, dinner dances and so on.  Insurance is becoming a major problem which must be tackled, particularly when one considers the difficulties in which a major insurer in London has found itself over the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively to Senator Gallagher, who said she wanted the position of male and female in legislation addressed. I am all for equality.  At one stage this morning there were three female and two male Senators in the House, which was a great balance.  Over the last 12 years there has been great improvement in the membership of the House in this regard.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to the call for an independent legal ombudsman, not just from the point of view of accuracy but also that of public perception.  I would have total confidence in a person from the legal profession being appointed to this position. Not alone must the profession be just and fair but it must be seen to be so. I welcome the Bill and look forward to its passage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many excellent proposals in this Bill and the approach contained in it is to be welcomed.  The Minister of State has shown an even hand in the preparation of this legislation. Irrespective of the attitude taken to a Bill of this kind, there can be an accusation of a partisan approach.  However, I feel the Bill has been given very serious consideration by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> The solicitors' profession, in general, has also welcomed the majority of the provisions in the Bill.  There are some matters about which solicitors would be concerned but, overall, the contents of this Bill are broadly welcomed by the Law Society and the profession.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, I am a solicitor so it is difficult to make comments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be perfectly frank in what I have to say on this matter. Although the Law Society has been criticised on many matters, in general it has tried to regulate the conduct of solicitors and introduced a number of regulations. With regard to the misappropriation of clients' moneys by solicitors, it is one of the few bodies which has made sure that the money is repaid to clients.  It is important that anybody who has money misappropriated is fully compensated.</P>
      <P>The second matter, which is one about which the Minister of State has been very emphatic and has received considerable support from the Law Society, is in regard to professional indemnity.  It is essential that in the event of negligence, shoddy work or errors being made in the bringing or processing of any claim or in conveyancing that professional indemnity is provided to protect solicitors' clients.  In common with all insurance premia, that cost is rocketing.  I am not sure of the amount at present but it is very high for people who have no claims against them, running into thousands of pounds each year.  No solicitor should be entitled to practice unless they have professional indemnity and the Law Society is very careful about that.  It is essential for that to be waterproof in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Ministers should try to extend such indemnity to a broad range of other bodies.  Some sections of the accountancy profession have professional indemnity <Col N="2141" /> while others do not.  Some life assurance firms and so on are covered by professional indemnity in the event of misappropriation or errors and so on while others are not.  The Minister of State should try to ensure that this indemnity is applied across the board.</P>
    <P>There is quite an extensive provision in the Bill on investigating complaints by clients against solicitors.  In general, the Law Society welcomes such complaints and tries to deal with them.  Many solicitors feel that the Law Society is over rigorous.  Listening to Senator Sherlock, perhaps the public thinks that the Law Society is not strict enough.  However, the Minister has to try to strike a reasonable balance on this.  The section states that where a complaint is investigated and a finding is made against a solicitor, he has to make a contribution towards the cost of the investigation, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy referred to delays in the Land Registry office.  Many of the complaints against solicitors are in regard to delays.  Senator Sherlock made a point about delays in the hearing of High Court cases.  At present, the delay in Dublin is running between two and three years and it may be even longer in Cork.  I have never attended a sitting of the High Court in Cork but I believe that the delay there is in the region of three to four years.</P>
    <P>I can understand people's frustration at having to wait that length of time for a case to be heard.  When they go into a solicitor's office and are told that the case has been set down and will be heard in three years time, they normally do not believe the solicitor.  While the Minister of State is trying to bring about improvements in the legal profession, he should also try to do something about the long delays in the hearing of High Court cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is also aware that these delays are now extending into the Circuit Court.  Sadly, family matters are now taking up a considerable amount of time in the District Court, Circuit Court and even in the High Court.  Other types of cases can be dealt with reasonably expeditiously by a judge but most judges try to take their time in the hearing of <Col N="2142" /> family cases.  It is essential to examine how these matters can be redressed so that long delays will not continue.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cassidy's reference to the delay in getting Land Registry maps.  I have had many dealings with the Land Registry and rarely, if ever, have I met such a courteous staff.  The Cathaoirleach will recall, as he was involved, that some months ago there was a closing date for the filling in of area aid forms.  It was almost like Custer's last stand in the Land Registry Office with the staff under siege as public representatives, solicitors and members of the public looked for maps.  It provides an excellent service and makes a profit, but moneys must be reinvested to improve working conditions and to bring about an overall improvement in the Land Registry Office.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about new initiatives in relation to advertising legal services and the provision of probate services.  I find many advertisements offensive, advertising is not wise or good and may result in people spending money on useless cases which should never have seen the light of day.  It does not benefit anybody.</P>
    <P>In the past the legal profession brought cases for those without money to pay for them and I hope that will continue.  The question of advertising must be carefully considered and this area should not be abused.  There is a danger that members of the legal profession will place advertisements, which they are not able to stand over.  People might believe they have a case, although it may be unwise to take it.</P>
    <P>It was proposed that banks and building societies should be allowed to become involved in conveyancing and probate but I am glad that proposal has been withdrawn.  It would have been dangerous for them to become involved in this area because there would have been a conflict of interest.  A bank manager or someone in a building society would already know about a person's dealings, whether they owed them money, etc., and they would be able to exert influence over that person when making a will and <Col N="2143" /> direct where and when to make particular payments.</P>
    <P>I, like most people, have a high opinion of credit unions.  There has been a lot of talk about a third banking force and I worry that if, in future, there is a third banking force and credit unions &mdash; which conduct their business in a competent manner &mdash; are involved, it would be able to offer probate services.  This would be unhealthy and unwise and I ask the Minister to look at that again.</P>
    <P>Most points have been well covered this morning.  I look forward to Committee Stage in the autumn.  I would like to ask the Minister a number of questions, particularly on section 68, in relation to supplying clients with charges in writing and writing to clients about the beneficiaries of a will, but we will deal with that in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their positive contributions which have given me food for thought.  Senators McGennis and Neville raised the issue of the efficiency of the court system.  There is no doubt that many of the costs in the legal profession and the reason legal charges appear high is because of what it costs the legal profession in time and man hours to hang around courts, etc.  We must speed up the process and make it more efficient.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to tell the House that the Minister for Justice will introduce proposals in the Lower House in the autumn to deal with that issue.  I do not want to anticipate or announce these proposals but they will deal with the powers of the taxing master, give extra powers to court officers and will enable medical reports, lists of witnesses, etc., to be cleared in advance.  Many aspects of a case will be agreed before the hearing comes up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senators who said the Bill relates only to one branch of the legal profession and does not deal with the Bar.  The only legislation to regulate the legal profession relates to one branch &mdash; solicitors.  We are building on that in this <Col N="2144" /> legislation.  If we were to legislate for the Bar, we would have to start from the ground up.  Nobody should be under any illusion in that regard &mdash; I would love to regulate the Bar legislatively, but I would need to be given a mandate by the Government to do that.  If the Government wishes to give me such a mandate, I look forward to discharging it.</P>
    <P>Senators Neville and Honan raised a question about the appointment of judges.  They will be aware that as part of the law and order package, the Minister for Justice obtained Government approval for the appointment of an additional judge to the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court to address delays in hearing criminal cases. The necessary legislative provisions to implement these appointments will form part of the new court and court officers Bill being prepared in my Department.</P>
    <P>Senators McGennis and Neville raised a question about the appointment of solicitors as judges of the superior courts. Senators know that solicitors may be appointed judges of the District Court. Strictly speaking, that matter is outside the ambit of the Bill, but is being considered in the context of legislation being prepared, namely, the court and court officers Bill.  I have no objection to solicitors being appointed to the superior courts.  While I would favour such a move, other considerations must apply. It is being actively considered and if it is to be done, it will be done in the court and court officers Bill, which will be introduced in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville raised the question of the Law Reform Commission's reports. I deny his contention that these reports do not see the light of day or become law.  A lot of the law on the Statute Book at present originated in reports of the Law Reform Commission although we do not always legislate exactly along the lines proposed by the Law Reform Commission. The Department of Justice, the Government or the Law Reform Commission do not have a monopoly on wisdom.  I have made changes to legislation which came directly from a report of the Law Reform Commission as a <Col N="2145" /> result of reasonable arguments put forward by members of Senator Neville's party who proved wiser than the law Reform Commission in what it proposed. The same applies to the Government; it too must change proposals of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>Senators Neville, McGennis and others raised the issue of wearing wigs and gowns and I accept what they said. The dispensing of the wearing of wigs by barristers would go a long way towards making the profession more meaningful, relevant and, as Senator Neville said, less intimidatory.  There is also the problem of a perceived connection between judges and barristers because they both wear this item of clothing.  I have been in touch with the Bar Council about this and it told me it would set up a dress committee to consider whether there should be some alteration to the mode of dress.</P>
    <P>That dress committee was to consider the matter and report back with its recommendations to the full Bar Council. I will make inquiries this afternoon to find out if a recommendation has been made and, if so, what it is.  I will communicate with Senator Neville in that regard.  If something is not done shortly, I will ask my Department to look at the Rules of Court to see if the Government can change this despite the wishes of the Bar Council.  It will be a matter for the Government, I am not empowered to take that decision unilaterally, but I recommend that it be changed and that the wearing of wigs be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate centred on the independent adjudicator.  The ombudsman for the public service &mdash; a subject about which Senator Roche would know quite a bit because he was one of those who originally recommended the creation of the office &mdash; deals with the public sector and areas such as Government Departments, health boards, local authorities and so on.  Any private profession is self-regulated.  Some private professions, including the insurance business, banks and other financial institutions which are self-regulating, have taken it upon themselves to appoint an <Col N="2146" /> ombudsman to whom an aggrieved party can appeal a decision of the institution or insurance company.</P>
    <P>If there is any interference by the Law Society in the functions of the adjudicator, the adjudicator is statutorily bound to put that in his or her report to the Minister.  It will be discussed in the Oireachtas and Members can be assured that if the adjudicator has cause for complaint, he or she will not have cause for complaint a second time.</P>
    <P>We have also provided that the adjudicator will not be a practising barrister or a practising solicitor.  This further underpins the concept of independence.  It has been suggested to me that while it is right that the Law Society should have to pay, it should be done differently.  The suggestion was that the Government would appoint the adjudicator who would be paid out of public funds from the Department of Finance and the Law Society would then repay the Department of Finance. However, the reality would still be that the Law Society was paying the piper and providing the money.  Can one seriously suggest trying to fool the public with some sleight of hand to make them believe that the person is not being paid by the Law Society but by the Department of Finance?  If the Department of Finance is paying them and recovering the exact cost from the Law Society, the reality is that the Law Society is still paying.  I prefer to deal with reality rather than create illusions.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the adjudicator will be independent and that the introduction of the adjudicator system will be a substantial improvement or radical innovation. We are going to keep it under review and if the adjudicator or the appointment of the adjudicator is not seen to be fully independent or is not improving the situation we will move very quickly to change it.  However, I am confident that the appointment of the adjudicator will prove to be a radical innovation which will make the situation infinitely better than it is at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche said he would like to see a mechanism in place whereby we can review the performance of the <Col N="2147" /> adjudicator.  I have the perfect mechanism here.  The adjudicator has to report to the Minister each year and the Minister has to lay his or her report before each House of the Oireachtas.  Rather than just have the Department of Justice review the situation each year, I have gone much further and established a mechanism whereby both Houses of the Oireachtas and each and every Member of both Houses will be in a position to review the operation of the adjudication system each year.</P>
    <P>Section 68 has been welcomed and I look forward to teasing out the technicalities of the section on Committee Stage, as Senator Enright suggested. Section 67 has also been welcomed.  The Law Society is given specific powers to prohibit advertising which is in bad taste, is likely to bring the profession into disrepute, is false or misleading or is contrary to public policy.  This provision gives the Law Society adequate powers to restrict undesirable advertising which I agree would not be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Solicitors in the United Kingdom have been able to advertise fees since 1988 and this has not resulted in the catastrophe envisaged by the Law Society and Senator Gallagher.  It is impossible to be scientifically accurate about these things but the information available to us would suggest that it has given rise to greater price competition and, in fact, resulted in a general decrease in the level of fees particularly for routine matters such as probate and conveyancing.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher also mentioned the shortage of apprenticeships.  I am aware of this problem and have made provision for it.  All a government can do is include provisions in legislation which will make it easier for solicitors who wish to take on apprentices to do so, and this is what we have done.  We cannot force solicitors who do not wish to take on apprentices to employ people.  We would then be forcing people in the private sector to add to their staff and a government cannot do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher also wants minimum wages for apprentices.  While I want <Col N="2148" /> apprentices to be properly paid, we do not want to get into a logical fallacy.  On the one hand we talk about the unwillingness of many solicitors to take on apprentices which results in a glut of people who need apprenticeships while at the same time suggesting that solicitors should pay a minimum wage to apprentices. One provision would contradict the other.  Requiring solicitors to pay apprentices a minimum wage is a further disincentive to taking on apprentices.  It takes us further away from our purpose which to take more people off the waiting lists and into apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher also raised the issue of capping compensation awards.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for Commerce and Technology, Deputy Brennan, proposes to introduce some legislation in this area.  I would fully support that legislation and I will be glad to debate the matter with anybody who wants to.</P>
    <P>I have some experience in this area and I have come to the conclusion that the single greatest factor in the cost of insurance in this country is the level of awards.  If we compare the cost of car insurance, public liability insurance and other types of insurance with the premia charged in other EC member states, even one with a comparable legal system such as the United Kingdom, we will find that it three to five times more expensive here. I have done some research in this area and I have been driven to the conclusion that the single greatest problem is the cost of awards.  Regardless of any constitutional difficulties there may be in this area, something has to be done to protect employment, stimulate the economy to create more jobs and reduce unnecessary costs in business.  I encourage my colleague Deputy Brennan to move ahead on the matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The cap on the amount payable from the compensation fund is to prevent the depletion of the fund.  If unlimited claims were made on the compensation fund, once a certain number of awards had been made, others entitled to payment would have to wait a year or two or would <Col N="2149" /> be forced to accept payment by way of instalment over five years or so.  A bird in the hand is worth much more than two in the bush.  No award in excess of £250,000 has ever been made to those entitled to claim, namely, non-corporate clients of the legal profession.  Following the Dáil debate I increased the sum to £350,000 and it will increase in line with inflation.  The Minister has the power to increase the award by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I want to say but I will give Members the opportunity to take a break.  I thank Senators for their contributions and take on board many of the points they made.  I do not have a closed mind on the Bill and the debate this morning has certainly given me food for thought between now and Committee Stage.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1994:" RHead="Second Stage">
    <Title>Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): The Irish fishing industry provides approximately 15,000 jobs, mainly in peripheral areas of the country where alternative forms of employment are difficult to sustain.  The contribution of the industry to the economy as a whole has increased dramatically in recent years. For example, in 1992, landings of sea fish <Col N="2150" /> were valued at £98 million and exports worldwide amounted to £175 million. Clearly, this is an industry which is worth protecting and the primary objective of the Bill is to provide that protection and to avert the reckless destruction of this valuable national asset.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the key provisions, I will set out the main objectives of the Bill which are to provide tougher penalties for serious fisheries offences, including the possible confiscation of vessels in the case of serious or persistent offenders; to amend the law in respect of the licensing and registration of fishing vessels to take account of considerations of economic link in the granting or refusing of licences; to strengthen procedures for the detention of fishing boats and the seizure of fish and gear where an offence is suspected; to impose certain controls on the fishing, sale and possession of eels and molluscan shellfish, and to increase the protection afforded to fisheries officers through substantially tougher penalties for assault.</P>
      <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the problem of illegal fishing in Irish waters and, through the Minister with responsibility for both the Marine and Defence, has taken steps to bring about maximum co-operation between the services involved in fisheries pro tection so as to achieve the best possible results.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, experience in recent years has shown that, despite the sub stantial fines imposed by the courts, certain categories of vessels continue to flout the law.  In doing so, they threaten the livelihoods of others who comply with conservation and quota management provisions that are designed to ensure the long term viability of our fisher resources.  In particular, the track record of the Spanish fishing fleet has left much to be desired.  More than 50 per cent of Spanish vessels boarded in Irish waters have been detained for serious fishery offences.  It is against this background that it is necessary to introduce strong measures to combat illegal fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1983, provided that, on <Col N="2151" /> second conviction on indictment for a range of fisheries offences, a court could, at its discretion, order a boat to be confiscated. In practice, however, following a first conviction vessel owners systematically contrive to eliminate the possibility of confiscation by transferring the ownership of vessels to new companies. The amendments proposed in section 14 of the Bill will remedy this by permitting the court to order the forfeiture of a vessel (1) where the offence, or a combination of offences, is considered by the court to be a serious abuse of conservation measures; and (2) where the conviction is a second or subsequent conviction for an offence committed on board the same ship within three years of the date of the commission of the previous offence.  Where it is suspected that a change of ownership was effected in order to evade the risk of forfeiture in the event of a further conviction, the onus of proving, to the satisfaction of the court, that the change of ownership was bona fides will rest with the defendant.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision to protect third parties who may, in good faith, have provided a mortgage or loan in respect of the vessel.  In such circumstances the court may, at its discretion, order that the boat be sold and a portion of the proceeds of the sale be paid to meet the outstanding mortgage or charge.  This provision will indemnify third party investors whom the court considers would otherwise be unfairly penalised.  It should be emphasised, however, that the <i>bona fides</i> of the loans or mortgages entered into by such investors will be carefully examined and if the level of investment or mortgage appears to be abnormally high the court will, I am sure, draw its own conclusions.</P>
    <P>Some might perhaps feel that confiscation of fishing boats should be mandatory.  Consideration was given to the introduction of mandatory penalties but having reflected on the matter the Minister has concluded that, notwithstanding the serious nature of certain offences, the imposition of penalties is best left to the discretion of the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> During the preparation of this Bill the Minister also gave serious consideration to the level of fines that may be imposed by the courts.  In particular, he became concerned about the considerable amount of evidence that has come to light regarding the number of vessels using hidden holds for the storage of illegal fish or undersized nets.  On Report Stage, he met the wishes of the Dáil and amended the proposed penalties for hidden holds and the possession of undersize nets to £200,000 and £50,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>These measures reflect our serious concern at the appalling damage which offences of this nature can inflict on stocks and will enable the courts to convey that concern more effectively to those convicted of such violations.  The message being sent to those who cynically abuse our fisheries and see the occasional prosecution as an acceptable risk or occupational hazard is clear: the reckless destruction of a major national resource will no longer be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives the Minister powers to ensure that people who are granted sea fishing boat licences have a real economic link with this country.  In 1991, the European Court of Justice gave its support to the principle that member states have the right to set requirements which ensure that such a link exists between boats fishing off quotas and the coastal communities and regions that the quotas were designed to benefit.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow the Minister to take account of the economic benefit that the operation of a boat will have for Ireland when considering an application for a fishing licence.  In particular, he will be able to consider the projected annual number of landings at Irish ports; the projected annual tonnage and value of fish landed in the State; the projected annual level of expenditure in the State on wages, fuel, supplies, equipment and services; and the projected annual level of social security and tax payments in the State in respect of employees and the operation of the boat.</P>
    <P>This is not intended nor should it be construed as discrimination by the back door.  These provisions will ensure that <Col N="2153" /> Ireland's legitimate interest in securing a fair share of the commercial and economic benefits of our quotas will be safeguarded and counteract the practice of &ldquo;quota hopping&rdquo;, where boats from one state are registered under the flag of another solely for the purpose of gaining access to the latter's quotas.</P>
    <P>The European Court of Justice expressed its view on the concept of economic link in the context of its ruling that the provisions in Irish law, which restricted the right to licence and register fishing boats in Ireland to Irish nationals and bodies corporate, were contrary to the terms of the Treaty of Rome, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality and protects the right of establishment.  Those restrictions are removed in this Bill and the right to licence and register fishing boats is extended to nationals and bodies corporate of member states.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the requirement that applicants establish a real economic link will ensure that Irish quotas continue to be used for the benefit of this country.</P>
    <P>The Bill also removes a legal uncertainty that exists in relation to the procedure for detaining a fishing boat in circumstances where a breach of fisheries legislation is suspected and copperfastens the powers of sea fisheries officers, naval officers and members of the Garda Síochána. In future, it will be possible for a naval officer who detains a fishing boat to transfer the custody of the vessel to a garda or sea fishery officer as soon as the boat reaches port.  This will enable the naval vessel to return to patrol with the minimum of delay while the garda or fishery officer attends to the formalities of initiating a prosecution.  The naval officer will, of course, have to be present at the actual trial to give evidence.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen an alarming increase in the number of violent assaults on fishery officers and there is a clear need to increase, as a matter of urgency, the protection offered to these officers and to strongly deter those who would commit such assaults.  The Ballycotton inquiry into the tragic deaths of four fishery officers highlighted the need for <Col N="2154" /> increased protection for such officers and the penalties proposed reflect that view. In introducing these proposals the Minister is taking account of recommendations made by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Under the new provisions, those convicted on indictment of having assaulted a fishery officer will face up to five years imprisonment and such fine as the court may deem appropriate having regard to the seriousness of the offence.  The Bill also provides penalties for obstructing an officer in the course of his duties.</P>
    <P>It is important that we recognise the essential work carried out by our fisheries officers, often in difficult and dangerous circumstances, and that we provide adequate protection for them in our law. By introducing these measures the Minister wants to clearly indicate our support for fisheries officers in their important work.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes provisions to tighten controls on the catching, possession and export of eels and molluscan shellfish.  Increasingly in recent years licensed eel fishermen operating on midland lakes have suffered assault and have had their gear and catch stolen by armed gangs of poachers.  Existing provisions have not been sufficient to deal with this problem and it is proposed, therefore, to tighten controls on fishing for dealing in and possession of eels, including eels intended for export.</P>
    <P>Part III tightens controls in respect of the sale of eels by applying similar statutory obligations to those which already exist for salmon dealers and exporters. In future eel dealers will be required to hold a licence.  Without such a licence the possession of eels will be an offence. Anyone engaged in transporting eels will have to mark clearly any packages or containers used for that purpose.  Provision is also made for fines and possible imprisonment for eel fishing carried out in breach of statutory authorisations.</P>
    <P>Of equal importance is the fact that the new controls will make it extremely difficult for criminals to profit from their activities because without the required sales permits and documentation which the Bill provides for, the prospect of <Col N="2155" /> detection and prosecution will be greatly increased.  In addition, the task of realising the proceeds of the crime will become more difficult.</P>
    <P>Similar controls are being applied to shellfish.  At present, the movement of molluscan shellfish within the State is subject to authorisations issued by the Department of the Marine.  Nevertheless, recent outbreaks of bonomia in oysters have occurred through unauthorised movements of oysters and these have demonstrated the need for increased controls.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses a number of administrative weaknesses and regulatory deficiencies in the existing law.  It is proposed to amend section 373 of the Merchant Shipping Act, which relates to the registration of fishing vessels, so as to update penalties for registration offences.  It is also proposed to give the Minister the power to make and amend regulations governing the operation of the fishing boat register and to provide appropriate statutory powers for the Minister to remove a vessel from the sea fishing boat register so as to deal with certain anomalies that have arisen.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of an accurate and up-to-date fishing boat register is an important requirement for the management of fisheries at a time when there is pressure on the size of our fishing fleet. It is also important that we have accurate data on levels of catch and market activities, not only for management purposes but also for scientific research and strategic planning.  To this end section 9 provides for a statutory requirement to furnish information relating to the catching or sale of fish.  I know that all those involved in the fishing sector appreciate the importance of having accurate information available for the reasons I have outlined and I am confident of their continued co-operation in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 17 simplifies statutory arrangements in relation to payments to local authorities in lieu of rates levied on private fisheries.  Fisheries which yield an income to their owners are valued for rating purposes in exactly the same way <Col N="2156" /> as land or other property.  These rates are paid to the regional fisheries boards, however, to support their activities.  In order to reimburse local authorities for the loss of this income provision is made in the Department of the Marine Vote for an equivalent amount which is paid out each year.  It has become apparent that there would be a considerable administrative saving if this amount was to be included in the Department of the Environment Vote and paid to local authorities as part of the rate support grants. The revocation of section 55(7) of the 1959 Fisheries (Consolidation) Act will give statutory effect to this arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of this Bill address many of the major issues facing the fishing industry and strike a fair balance between the need to comply with EU treaty obligations and the valid objective of securing a fair share of fishery resources for the Irish economy.  The Bill clearly underlines our resolve to protect the rights of the communities that depend on fishing and to make sure that anyone seeking to abuse their access to our waters will think twice before engaging in illegal fishing or committing other fisheries offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  We are aware of the need to update legislation in light of the changes in fishing regulations emanating from the European Union.  Any legislation which helps our fishermen in their difficult profession is welcome.</P>
      <P>Serious competition in the fishing industry has emerged from the fishing fleets of Europe, especially the Spanish fleet, and legislation is necessary to stabilise that industry and to enforce regulations and procedures whereby our fishing officers and security forces can be in a position of authority to curtail illegal fishing and to deal with the people and fishing boats involved in illegal fishing. Heretofore, there were obvious areas where security officers were curtailed in dealing will illegal fishing.  Legislation which introduces severe penalties, including seizure of vessels and catch, is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2157" /> The legislation also deals with inland fisheries and I welcome its provisions regarding eel fishing.  Being from the midlands I am aware of the enormous potential in the eel fishing industry.  It is worth noting that brown eels command a price of £3,000 per ton and silver eels are making £5,000 per ton.  This is an indication of how lucrative a business eel fishing is.  It also highlights the potential in that industry.</P>
    <P>Fishing officers and the Garda Síochána are given the power to enforce the provisions in this legislation and they will be able to deal with those who fish illegally.  Until now people had to be caught in the act of illegal fishing.  We all know &mdash; I am not saying we all poached &mdash; that it was difficult for the gardaí to catch a person at the right time.  Under this legislation people who are caught in possession of fish will have to explain the circumstances of the catch and they will be responsible for the catch.  That is a helpful provision.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the ESB's research into and involvement with the eel fishing industry.  At present it has divided the country into different regions and licences are issued on that basis.  This has a twofold effect; it controls those in the fishing business and the catches can be monitored to find the areas where they are increasing or decreasing.  This enables the ESB to have a constructive view of the future of the eel fishing industry.</P>
    <P>There is a huge market for eels on the Continent and in Japan.  There has been no eel processing industry in Ireland and there is great potential for such a development.  Those in the ESB who work in eel fishing see this as an area where jobs can be created.  Eel fishing will then be put on a basis for long term growth, which we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>The Bill also places control on dealers. Up to now those involved in illegal eel fishing could dispose of their catches to dealers without restriction.  This legislation requires dealers to register and to account for the amount of fish they sell and the origin of the fish.  I welcome that aspect of the legislation also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2158" /> The main objective of the ESB's River Shannon eel management programme is the assessment of the current status of eel in the Shannon catchment area, particularly the stocks of yellow eel and silver eel.  Since the early 1980s the number of elvers intercepted at Ardnacrusha generating station for collection and release further upstream has been declining.  This shows the importance of research and of having a definite policy for the development of this industry.</P>
    <P>At present over 100 people are employed full time in the eel fishing section.  I pay tribute to them for the areas being developed because this is to be encouraged by everyone.  I am delighted that fishing officers, with the help of the gardaí in certain cases, can go about their duties and enforce the law, now it has been updated.</P>
    <P>Fishing in the midlands, where I come from, has not been developed and progressed as we would like.  Hundreds of English fishermen are now in the midlands and surrounding areas on angling holidays.  This is a great boost to our economy.  These people stay in local guest houses and hotels which provide packed lunches.  The visitors will go to local entertainment.  Other waterway tourists, such as those who hire cruisers, might not spend as much money but everyone benefits from the anglers &mdash; small hoteliers, bed and breakfast operators, local shops and publicans.</P>
    <P>This section of the industry should be developed.  It can improve our fishing sector as a whole and our lakes and rivers. It can also give a much needed boost to our tourism industry.  The Minister should be aware of this potential.  Many fishing clubs in the midlands have approached me about this issue and they are anxious that new procedures and projects be immediately put in place, such as developing river banks and feeder streams and restocking of rivers.</P>
    <P>Stiles and crossings near rivers may also be necessary.  There may be obstructions along riverbanks such as small rivers and streams, drains, walls, hedgerows, etc.  Stiles and crossings have proved effective on some rivers and a limited <Col N="2159" /> number are being used in my immediate vicinity.  They allow easy passage along riverbanks and are an important consideration for the core of visiting anglers, who usually carry a lot of equipment.  If anglers encounter fences without proper stiles or crossing areas, they are at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of trespass. Local landowners are extremely conscious about people on their land.  Ease of access to all parts of the river or lake is essential.  As the farming community often points out the law regarding liability in the event of an accident on a farmer's land is at present heavily against the landowner.  There is a right of way by law along river banks and landowners are not liable at law for people using the river banks.  By improving access through the various bridges along the banks, the need to cross farmers' land would not arise. This area of law needs updating.  Other Departments are involved but with proper thought and legislation the matter can be resolved.</P>
    <P>We have a great market to be tapped in Britain, where the number of people involved in fishing is huge.  With so many lakes and rivers in the midlands and surrounding areas, we have great potential in this area.  Everyone should be encouraged. I pay tribute to angling clubs throughout the country, some of which have cleaned and restocked rivers.  Their interests and ideas must be taken into consideration.  Access is another important area and legislation should be introduced for the landowners and those responsible for the river banks and lake edges.  The local authority and tourist board could also help to develop this area.  There is great interest in local development under the Leader funds throughout the country.  If we had a proper plan, Leader funds could be used to develop this industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise these points and I welcome the Bill.  It protects fishing areas and it helps those who must enforce the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Senator Belton, welcome the Bill because it is time our laws were tightened.  As the Minister said at the outset, the value of landings is £95 million.  The only regret I have is that it is not ten times more, which it should be. We seem to have lost out in the last 30 or 40 years on the development of our sea fishing industry.  That £95 million is only a drop in the ocean.  An acre of sea is just as valuable as an acre of land, perhaps more so in inshore areas where there are good beds of scallops and mussels.</P>
      <P>I am critical of what has been done for the fishing industry and of the fact that over the years we did not say to the EU that we wanted our fair share of the sea. I have a sneaking suspicion that our sea fishing industry was sold out for the agricultural sector.  There is little left at present.  We are tied down to quotas and boxes.  We must proceed and try to make the most of it.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine should be more flexible when granting licences for uncaught quotas of fish and when granting substantial money to fish for new species.  They might be cheap, but there is a large volume of them.  Other countries do not have any problems.  They spend the amount we use to catch fish in one year for the development of their fisheries.  France spent the equivalent of approximately £18 million one year ago to explore the possibilities of one type of fish, which they now land in Dingle, County Kerry.  We do not have the boats, the equipment or the know-how to catch the same fish.  Every time the French fishermen come to Dingle in their boats, which are only 80 or 90 feet, they land approximately £40,000 worth of fish.  We should be able to catch those fish.  Someone must come to terms with this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of this legislation is not strong enough.  When a man decides to build a boat and he deliberately instructs the boat builder to put secret holds in it so that he can break the law, the boat should be confiscated on the first offence because that man deliberately constructed such a boat and got an EU grant <Col N="2161" /> for it.  The boat yards where these boats are built are well known along the coast of Portugal and near La Coruna.  I have seen them being built and I have seen the secret holds which allow them to break the law.  It is not right to let that man off with a fine, regardless of the amount.  The boat should be taken from him.  Are the secret holds in these boats destroyed or is this man only fined £200 and allowed to go out again with the same secret hold in his boat?  That is why this legislation is too lenient.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton spoke about the value of angling.  At a certain time of the year <i>The Kerryman</i> lists all the fines levied on people who snatch salmon from the river, although this was always done by their fathers and grandfathers.  They are usually fined approximately £200.  In the 1930s my next door neighbour got six months in jail for boiling an illegally caught salmon in a pot on the fire.  When he left jail, he went to America, but he never came home again because he was ashamed and embarrassed.  Two people were shot in Castlegregory, County Kerry for fishing offences.  Our penalties for angling are too severe.</P>
    <P>In the Bill the definition of trout is a rainbow trout.  All my life I caught rainbow trout and no one asked me for a licence.  Will a licence be needed by the person who lives two miles outside Dingle, County Kerry and whose ponds are a tourist attraction because one may catch fish in them and he only charges for what the person catches?  Will the tourists who stop to catch fish in these ponds need a licence?</P>

      <P>I hope our distinguished visitors will learn about the problems we have in relation to foreign fishing off our shores.  They are welcome to the House.</P>
      <P>I was of the opinion that there was no need for a licence to fish rainbow trout. Perhaps I have misunderstood.  There is no mention of sea trout.  I do not know whether these fish are in other rivers or not but there is a fish in our river called a Liathán or a grayling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They have them in Clare as well, they call them pinkeens. There is no mention of the white trout or sea trout which weighs anything from a couple of pounds up to ten pounds weight.  I have caught sea trout weighing about ten pounds.  I am not sure about the method I used for catching them but they were very tasty.</P>
      <P>This Bill is welcome and it covers many areas that should have been covered before now.  I welcome the protection for fishery officers.  While one might criticise them for prosecuting local men who poach the odd fish, patrolling the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast is a very difficult job.  I know their boats are fairly good, but they are small.  They have to haul illegal nets and trying to get them into the boat on a stormy day is very difficult, especially if those who are fishing illegally are trying to prevent the fisheries officers from hauling the nets.  We hear stories of slashers being used against fisheries officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest problem is the use of small meshed nets which catch undersized fish, a large amount of which is caught.  I do <Col N="2163" /> not know if not using the net will solve the problem because when a trawler is towing a big trawl the fish eventually get entangled.  I agree with the fines for use and possession of undersized nets, but I do not agree with not punishing a fisherman who has secret holds in his boat.  No fisherman along the coast, or a genuine foreign fisherman would want anything like that.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for the regulation of lobster and crawfishing in this Bill, perhaps it might be in another Bill.  I am concerned because I fished them for 17 years.  The sale of undersized lobster is unbelievable.  They are on sale in tanks in restaurants everywhere and although through glass they look big in reality they are very small.  I point the finger at the Department as many years ago fishermen asked it to bring in a law whereby there has to be an escape in the lobster pot for undersized lobsters but nothing was done.</P>
    <P>This year is probably one of the worst ever for lobster fishing.  A man fishing 200 lobster pots hauls them for five fish. I often hauled 200 pots for five dozen. Something is wrong there, and I would like to see a law brought in giving a chance for the small lobsters to grow because lobster fishing and crawfishing is a big industry.  Some people say &ldquo;cray&rdquo; but I was told that a crawfish is a salt water fish, whereas a crayfish is a fresh water fish.  I would like to see something brought in to protect the lobster, the crawfish and the crabs.  Crabs are all fished out now.  Much of this has to do with the rules.  I used all the fishing methods myself because I was always looking for a better way to fish.</P>

      <P>At least monofilament nets rest on top of the water.  Tangle nets are the deadly enemy and should be banned.  They sink to the bottom of the <Col N="2164" /> water and the lobster, crabs and crawfish get entangled in the net.  The nets stay on the bottom and continue to catch fish until they wear away.  There should be a total ban on them as they are destroying the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Some 50 per cent of the lobster and crayfish caught in tangle nets will die anyway, or are damaged, because when a net is pulled up and the lobster is tangled up in it, it is pulled to pieces.  One half is caught in one mesh, the other half is in the other and the lobster is dead. The fisherman has no way of keeping those lobsters fresh because they must be boiled alive.</P>
      <P>Many provisons in this Bill are welcome, but it should make provision for other areas not covered.  Other Bills of the same nature should be linked with this Bill.</P>
      <P>I did not read every word of the Bill but I read it fairly thoroughly.  A man who sells fish must have a licence.  For some reason the fisherman is allowed to do what he wants as soon as he has caught the fish.  He needs a licence to catch the fish but not to sell it.  He is exempted, and the fishermen themselves tend to be the biggest enemy of all.  We are all human, we break laws.  The fisherman does not need a licence to sell the fish. When he catches the fish he has to sell them and show his licence.  That man could be selling them to different places such as hotels and restaurants and not to a fish dealer.</P>
      <P>Section 20 covers the requirement for a special licence to export salmon and trout.  I know we will be dealing with these on Committee Stage, but why would we drop that requirement?  It is most important.  I read in an ESRI report that we exported about ten times more salmon than we caught.  This proved that the men catching the salmon were not telling us the full story.  This will be explained to me, but I would not drop that.  A lot hinges on the export licence for salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how many here know the difference between tinned salmon and dogfish.  Some 99 per cent of tinned salmon is spur dogfish which is imported <Col N="2165" /> from Korea, Japan or anywhere cheap labour is available.  Tinned sardines are what other countries throw away, they are not sardines.</P>
    <P>There are also various kinds of salmon &mdash; red salmon, pink salmon, real salmon and so on, 90 per cent of which is nothing more than dog fish.  To verify this assertion, the contents of four or five different cans of fish should be tested.</P>
    <P>Regarding the licence for the export of salmon and trout, the same kind of deceit is taking place with the use of farm salmon, and it is difficult to ascertain if a product on sale is farm salmon or wild Atlantic salmon.  To add to this, there are different ways of naming the salmon, such as smoked Irish salmon and Irish smoked salmon.  The effect of this trickery is to ensure that nobody gets caught. For example, somebody buying smoked salmon may not realise that the salmon originates from Canada, even although it could be termed smoked Irish salmon or Irish smoked salmon, because once the salmon is smoked in Ireland its origin is immaterial.  Indeed, salmon is imported into the country, as is a huge amount of processed salmon.</P>
    <P>The licence for the export of salmon and trout is important in ensuring that there is a knowledge of what is being exported and that there are proper statistics. Such statistics will not be obtained in Dingle, County Clare, or elsewhere as it would be foolish for those concerned to provide them.  The only way of acquiring accurate statistics therefore is to obtain them on exports, with allowances made on domestic consumption, which is relatively easy to calculate.</P>
    <P>The lads in Dingle may be on my back if I elaborate any further; however, they will be happy with the provisions of the Bill, especially those relating to the law breakers from other countries who are going to town on our fisheries off the west coast.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the provision of licences for the creation of jobs.  In this respect the west has been decimated and there is no place to turn to.  There is not a blade of grass growing on the hills of the west, as they are over <Col N="2166" /> populated with sheep.  Is the House aware of what is happening to the west? The amount of milk produced in the region is dropping every day, and in many instances the big creameries no longer wish to deliver to peninsulas whose inhabitants they can blackmail, as there is nowhere else to sell milk other than to the east of the country.</P>
    <P>The west must be examined with a view to keeping people at home.  In this respect I plead with the Minister to take it easy with the fishing licences.  Those involved in fishing off the west coast are not looking for major finds.  All they require is be able to fish as fishermen, in the same way as their fathers and grandfathers.</P>
    <P>A halt is being called to this activity because of EU demands.  For example, they are told that they cannot fish, then that they may fish in such an area.  They are told that if they fish in another area they are only allowed catch ten boxes of fish, and that from the month of August they must stop fishing a certain species and catch another species.  The situation has become crazy and out of hand.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the Minister's undertaking that when providing licences these people will be looked after and those who implement the provisions of the Bill will be easy on them.  I welcome the Bill wholeheartedly, although it has not gone far enough in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill constitute a further chapter in the comprehensive package of legislation dealing with sea and inland fisheries development and conservation.  They are welcome in so far as they go and should make a contribution towards the protection and conservation of one of our most important national resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minster of State to the House who today has responsibility for fisheries.  Doubtless his friends, the snap net fishermen, whom he represents, are pleased that he is in charge and, perhaps, he would take the opportunity to extend their season as it is an issue they have complained of for a number of years.  I had the opportunity to visit the snap net fishermen with the Minister and they are <Col N="2167" /> making a big contribution to the economic development of their area.</P>
    <P>Any extension of fishing time may be granted in respect of such fishermen, or for professional fishermen who, at this time of year, coming up to the close of the salmon season, are seeking extensions. Keeping in mind the conservation requirements, the Minister would be wise to grant a temporary extension, in so far as it is possible to do so, to some of the key fishing areas such as the Feale and the Cashan in County Kerry, and Dunbeg and Ennistymon in County Clare.  The people in these areas are traditional drift net salmon fishermen and derive limited income from their activities.  They would benefit enormously from short extensions to the officially declared closure times to enable them supplement their incomes at a time of crisis in the industry.</P>
    <P>Many of the coastal communities suffer from a fragile socio-economic base.  The decline which has taken place in fishing activity, especially along the western sea board, has had an impact on the benefits which would have accrued from the development of the industry.  This decline has been exacerbated by the decline in income generally in many other areas.  In this respect the coastal communities have suffered more than anybody else from falling population and declining incomes.</P>
    <P>This legislation must be viewed against a background of a structural crisis in the fishing industry in the EU.  The over capacity of the fishing fleet has been noted by the EU, given the fleet reduction requirements stipulated for the future.  In addition, there are debt levels in the industry, the Spanish and Portuguese fleets will increasingly be coming to fish our waters and the EFTA enlargement, together with the proposed EU enlargement, will probably bring Norway and other fishing countries into the equation.</P>
    <P>These developments will create further competition for a declining species, because almost all of the traditional species that have been fished here are under stock pressures.  Given this, illegal activities, which have been described both in <Col N="2168" /> this House and the other House such as the behaviour of some boats, which operate with illegal holds and so on, must be stamped out.  This illegal activity, which has gone on for far too long must be brought to an end and whatever powers the Minister requires to achieve this must be provided by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that conduct which has taken place, especially by Spanish boats fishing in Irish waters, should be entertained.  The necessity for vigilance by the Minister and the Department is obvious and further measures must be taken, if required, to put an end to illegal activities which are damaging fish stocks, putting the livelihood of those depending on fishing at risk and creating a climate where an industry which could make a more significant contribution will not be in a position to do so.  So many matters are covered in this legislation that an easy guide to the Fisheries Acts is required which could be divided into two sections dealing with sea and inland fisheries.  The Department of the Marine might avail of the opportunity to publish such a guide giving a breakdown of the laws and regulations governing commercial and inland fishing.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the procedure adopted in this Bill whereby a combination of legislation attempts to deal with totally unrelated issues.  Legislation dealing with commercial sea fisheries should be compiled under one guide.  I am not suggesting that a consolidation effort must be undertaken now but, looking through the Bill, one can see such diverse matters as eels, shellfish and boats with illegal holds are being dealt with together.</P>
    <P>A guide to fisheries legislation is needed to distinguish between the development of sea and inland fisheries, and to explain the fact that certain legislation has been repealed.  I found it almost impossible to find what legislation had been repealed and which remained on the Statute Book.  The situation is confusing and needs to be explained to the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> Some of the areas affected by this legislation have a very fragile socio-economic fabric.  For that reason I welcome the recent Pesca initiative of the European Union which enables coastal communities suffering from population decline and falling incomes from fishing to seek EU and State funding to develop alternative sources of income.  I raise this in the context of developing some of the natural oyster and mussel beds which have been allowed to fall into decay. Apart from the artificial cultivation of fish, such as salmon farming, more attention and funds need to be directed towards helping local community co-operatives and individual fishermen to develop shellfish cultivation.  Such action is needed, particularly in areas of traditional shellfish cultivation which have declined through lack of use and sedimentation. Many coastal areas could exploit such opportunities thus creating extra employment for seasonal fishermen in addition to increasing the economic potential of such areas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in his reply the Minister could indicate how the 250 million ECUs provided for under the Pesca initiative will be spent over the coming three to four years.  Could he also explain how fishery co-operatives can avail of EU funding for the development of important ancillary aspects of the fishing industry which are in decline?</P>
    <P>Development work must be undertaken in fishing harbours which, apart from the five major ones, are in a pretty run-down state.  The bulk of small landing places are also in a dilapidated state. The fishing industry cannot be developed without the infrastructure to enable it to thrive.  Current EU and State funding is inadequate to deal with this situation and unless some meaningful investment is made, especially in small and medium sized harbours, it will be difficult to restore confidence in the fishing communities that the Government is genuinely aware of their difficulties.  It must be made clear that there is a genuine wish to do something positive and worthwhile to help such communities to develop their fishing business and make a living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> I have found the personnel of sea fishery co-operatives to be capable, energetic and innovative.  If they see real commitment on the part of Government, they are prepared to invest their share as well. They are more than willing to sit down with the Department and work out the necessary development programmes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should talk to the county enterprise boards which are familiar with the necessity for development in various isolated coastal communities. He should work out a programme where the co-operatives, the Department and the European Union could carry out an in-depth study in localities where people's livelihood is threatened by a decline in fishing and by falling populations. A way must be found to carry out the proper infrastructural developments required to halt this decline.</P>
    <P>I welcome the work that has already been done by the Marine Research Institute in identifying new species. Because of the decline in traditional fish stocks, further efforts are needed to seek out and develop new fishing activities. The disappearance of sea trout, brown trout and rainbow trout stocks has caused deep and widespread concern.  Fishery records dating back to before the Famine show that sea trout stocks have inexplicably disappeared on numerous occasions.  The stocks disappeared long before the artificial cultivation of salmon here or in Norway.  The disappearance of sea trout stocks in the 1940s was blamed on small mesh nets for herring fishing although, even then, it was obvious that that was not the cause.</P>
    <P>The central and regional fisheries boards have recently undertaken research in the Dunbeg River in County Clare where no salmon farming takes place.  Despite this, the boards found that sea trout stocks were heavily infested with sea lice.  I wish to find out from the Department, maybe at a later stage, the result of that research work and whether it can now be certified that in areas where there are no sea cages, sea trout are heavily infested with sea lice and that this does not support the case being made by <Col N="2171" /> people opposed to sea farming that this is the cause of the disappearing sea trout.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals to deal with and tighten up the unauthorised movement of shellfish.  In Galway Bay, which is vitally important for oyster fishermen in Galway and north Clare, shellfish were seriously threatened by an outbreak of bonomia, which was imported by indiscriminate fishermen bringing stock from areas affected by that disease and almost put the Galway Bay and north Clare oyster fishing business into a state of decline and ruin.  Unauthorised movement of shellfish must be tightened up and I will support the Minister in any action he can take.  I would like him to take action against those who were responsible for introducing this disease, which came from France and devastated the French oyster fisheries.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome and is a further chapter in the legislation on fisheries which is vital to the long term development and conservation of our fishing industry.  I hope it will be successful in curtailing the illegal activities which are taking place.  I also hope it will be a sign to all those involved in the Irish fishing business that we in this House care about how this industry prospers and develops in future, that we have a vital interest in seeing that it does so and that we will do what we can to ensure this.  I hope the Government will do likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. The Bill is very satisfactory and will be welcomed in most circles.  I agree with Senator Daly's point that an easy guide to sea fisheries and inland fisheries regulations should be put in place.  We tend to get bogged down in different types of regulations and an easy guide would be helpful to everybody involved in fishing. Most people are happy with the Bill from a number of viewpoints.  The tightening up of licences, control of which is now being given to regional fisheries boards, is welcomed by them and is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2172" /> The position of fisheries officers in their line of duty is addressed in the Bill and needed to be so.  Some of them come in for a great deal of flak and intimidation. It is only proper and fair that they are looked after properly and that those who do not abide by the law are subject to its full rigours.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring three issues to the notice of the Minister which I believe could be tightened up in the legislation.  The first relates to salmon and eel dealers licences. Multi-store supermarkets, such as Dunnes Stores and Superquinn, require only one licence to cover all their retail outlets.  Some of these companies have as many as 40 outlets.  It is the opinion of the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board that this is inequitable for smaller fish store owners who are in competition with these larger organisations.  The board supports the introduction of branch licences at reduced fees.  The second issue is that salmon which are caught illegally can be smoked and sold legally.  To avoid this occurrence, the board recommends that the words &ldquo;the excluding of smoked salmon&rdquo; be added to the wording of section 155 of the Principal Act.  The third issue relates to clarification of the definition of rainbow trout.  There is no closed season for rainbow trout at present.  This creates difficulties for field staff in the carrying out of their fisheries protection role.  It is recommended that trout be redefined in section 3 to include rainbow trout.  Fisheries boards would like to see these three issues tackled.  We may be able to discuss them further on Committee Stage.  The Minister might examine them and agree to tighten up the regulations.</P>
    <P>There is great potential for sea fisheries. There is also great potential for inland fisheries, particularly from a tourist point of view.  For this reason we would like to see more money provided by the Government.  The money allocated this year is welcomed by all involved in the tourism and fishing industries but we would like to see more provided.</P>

      <P>I have been enhanced by the magnificent contributions made by people familiar with the industry.  We have heard pleas from the heart from people directly involved in fishing, from Dingle, Clare, Galway and the west coast.  I sincerely hope the Minister for State will take back to the Minister the heartfelt views expressed here, particularly on the depopulation of the west and the importance of the industry.  At present the industry provides 15,000 jobs.  It has a great potential for the future, and the Government and the EU recognise this.  I always felt the amount of money invested in the industry by the Government and the EU was not adequate.  As an island we could not be better positioned geographically.  Having listened to the magnificent contributions of Senator Fitzgerald and the former Minister, Senator Daly, my small contribution seems inadequate.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about my area, the lake district of Westmeath.  Section 15 increases the protection afforded to fisheries officers on foot of the recommendations of the Ballycotton tribunal. There are many magnificent lakes in Westmeath &mdash; Ennell, Owel, Derrvaragh and Loch Lene.  Fishing is very important for tourism.  Many local people cannot afford to leave the country on holidays or go to seaside resorts.  Often the only holiday they have is going to Louch Lene for two weeks where young people learn how to swim and enjoy the weather.  The anglers in our area have been terrific when it comes to minding the lakes for all the community and holding sporting events there which have attracted people from many countries, but from Germany in particular.  In the village of Finea, Lough Sheelin and other areas one meets Germans and English people.</P>
      <P>At the weekends, people come to the lakes and with their 75 to 100 horsepower engine speed boats cut fishermen off from the lakes.  People can no longer bathe because of the big waves generated by the speed boats and young children who try to swim are being thrown back onto the shore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2174" /> The anglers made a submission to Westmeath County Council and we received a deputation of over 100 people on this highly emotive issue.  Having researched and consulted with all of the organisations in the area, including speed boat people we passed a motion to allocate to speed boats half of Derrvaragh Lake which is a beautiful part of the lake at the Crooked Wood.  We intended with organisations such as the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Marine, the local authority, the ESB and local anglers to develop this amenity to almost as high a standard as Killaloe.</P>
    <P>We then applied for ministerial approval.  For reasons best known to the Minister and the Department officials, despite my best efforts they have not seen fit to approve the decision of Westmeath County Council.  The anglers in my area feel very aggrieved about this.  Last Sunday we had to leave Lough Lene and take in the boats and the children who were swimming there because these speed boat people took over.  Some of the engines on these boats could be used to fly light aircraft.  I want the Minister to approve the agreement reached by all political parties on the county council.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly called for a national plan to protect our waterways and to deal with technology, whether motor boat engines or whatever.  Sport should be for all people and not just for the rich which is the case in the lake county of Westmeath at the moment.</P>
    <P>I welcome Section 15 and look forward to the Minister of State's reply.  I raised this issue now rather than on the Adjournment tomorrow evening to give the Minister and his officials time to come back to me on it.  I welcome the Bill wholeheartedly and wish it a safe passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate.  Like them, I welcome the strengthened powers and deterrents the Bill provides.  In the past year, we witnessed an alarming increase in the number of foreign boats poaching <Col N="2175" /> our fishing stocks while the courts have lacked the sanctions necessary to penalise those convicted of blatantly committing such offences.</P>
      <P>The new fines should be a major deterrent. Faced with a potential fine of £200,000 which at current exchange rates works out at more than 39 million pesetas the owners of these vessels will surely think again about the wisdom of running the gauntlet of our protection service. They will also stand a much greater chance of having their vessels confiscated, than has been the case up to now, in certain circumstances for a first offence if that offence is considered sufficiently grievous.</P>
      <P>The Bill also addresses the recent piracy in midland eel fisheries where catches and gear have been robbed from legitimate fishermen engaged in the lawful fishing of eels.  The regulation for the sale and possession of eels will make it virtually impossible in the future for these elements to profit from their dishonest greed.</P>
      <P>I also share the general welcome for the strengthening of penalties for assaults on fishery officers, some of whom have suffered vicious attacks in recent years. This cannot be tolerated.  These officers are charged with the protection of our fisheries and cannot be left vulnerable to common criminals.  Under the new provisions, people convicted on indictment of having assaulted a fishery officer risk spending up to five years in prison and such fines as the court may deem appropriate, having regard to the seriousness of the offence.  The Bill also provides for penalties for the obstruction of an officer in the course of his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Senator Belton's sentiments on the value to the local economy of coarse fishing by English tourists and the need for river bank developments.  Senators will be aware that this year, for the first time, EU structural funding will be available for inland fisheries development.  I am sure the fisheries boards will use that funding to the maximum benefit.  That is a welcome change as, heretofore, such <Col N="2176" /> funding was not available.  I hope to see much development in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton also mentioned land owners' liability with regard to trespassers. This will be covered in a new Bill sponsored by the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Law Reform. There is a general call for such legislation from land owners' and we hope legislation will come on stream fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton also raised the question of eel processing.  Eels are fairly big business in the midlands and also in my county.  It has baffled me for quite some time that eels are not processed here but are exported live.  I hope new development plans will see indigenous companies processing eels, which would create much needed jobs.  The Minister has a keen interest in developing this industry and I will pass the Senator's views on to him.</P>
    <P>In considering Senator Fitzgerald's contribution, I asked my officials if we could make the Bill retrospective and have him arrested for some of his statements on his illegal fishing.  He was being honest and I suppose we have all done some illegal fishing over the years.  He referred to hidden holds and confiscation and the Bill provides in section 14 that in addition to fines of up to £200,000 for hidden holds, if the court considers an offence or combination of offences to be sufficiently grievous, it may order the boat to be forfeited on a first offence.  I know the Senator has very strong views on that.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also referred to trout angling licences.  A licence will not be required for angling for rainbow trout. Sea trout and white trout are included under the definition of salmon and, therefore, require a licence.  He also referred to under sized lobsters.  The Department recently consulted with lobster fishermen and is considering the introduction of appropriate by-laws to conserve stocks. There is a minimum size requirement in respect of lobsters but we agree with the Senator that it is difficult to enforce, particularly among holiday makers who set pots during the summer months.  The Senator made a number of suggestions on how it could be controlled which I <Col N="2177" /> will pass on to the Minister.  We hope, following further consultations, to be able to introduce some new by-laws.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also spoke about the salmon export licence.  The removal of this requirement was necessary to comply with European Union law.  The Minister had no option, but he believes that the health and hygiene provisions and general sampling arrangements are adequate to protect the consumer here and abroad.  Under EU law the Minister had no choice but to abolish that licensing system.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly was critical that sea and inland fishing were more or less dealt with together in the Bill.  The urgency of provisions relating to eels and shellfish necessitated using the first available opportunity to bring in new regulations. That is the reason for the dual sea and inland character of this Bill.  The Minister had no option but to deal with it now, rather than wait until a later stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly also mentioned local developments.  The Department is engaged in consultations with local interests in fishing regions along with Leader, the county enterprise partnership boards and <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, to see how best available funding should be spent.  There have been a number of developments in my area on the River Slaney.  The new River Slaney management plan has been funded by Leader and the county enterprise partnership boards.  All the different fishery interests were brought together, including drift net fishermen. Members will know it is difficult to bring them on board because they have a traditional way of fishing and have felt threatened by different Ministers for many years, particular when one month or six weeks were taken off their fishing season.</P>
    <P>When Senator Daly was Minister for the Marine he restored a number of weeks on different occasions, but they were still not happy because the full number of weeks was not restored.  We will meet the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, next week to see if an extra week or two could be added to the present fishing season.  Given that I have <Col N="2178" /> taken this Bill for him today, I hope it will encourage him to add an extra week. If rod fishermen hear me talking about this in the Seanad today, they will shoot me.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly's concerns about sea trout are shared by the Minister who recently accepted the recommendations of a high level task force chaired by T.K. Whitaker.  These recommendations are now being implemented by the Department. I am sure when Senator Daly was Minister for the Marine he had some say in initiating some of the task force recommendations which are now coming on stream.</P>
    <P>The question of guides to inland fishing was raised.  The various regional fishery boards have published guides to game fishing, coarse fishing and sea angling in the regions and they are readily available in board offices.  Under the Bill, each supermarket outlet will require a salmon dealer's licence, which will cost approximately £60.  Some Senators said this was a little unfair.  Heretofore, a supermarket chain had one licence and if there was a difficulty in one store, it was carried on into all its supermarkets.  Under this Bill, if a supermarket in County Wexford has a problem, it is confined to that branch, while other may continue to trade.  This provision is welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised the issue of speed boats.  This problem is not confined to his area; it is also a problem in other parts of the country.  The Minister is aware of the problem and he is trying to come up with a solution.  I will pass on Senator Cassidy's trenchant views on this to the Minister and I will ask him to take some of the suggestions and remedies proposed on board.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly spoke about the development of small fishing harbours.  When I was on the other side of the House, I continually argued that small harbours were being neglected, not alone in County Wexford but throughout the country.  The five major harbours have always received a reasonable amount of funding.  The Minister for the Marine has just announced £2 million for Kilmore Quay harbour and a substantial amount <Col N="2179" /> for a small harbour in Achill.  Obviously, he is taking on board some of the suggestions we made.  I come from a fishing county where there are a number of harbours where fishermen are prepared to contribute a certain amount of money, but they need support from the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>I will pass on Senators' views to the Minister so he can take on board some of the suggestions made.  With the Leader programme, the county enterprise partnership boards and the Department, it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to come up with a plan to develop some of our small harbours. There are tremendous fishing facilities in terms of boats and manpower but harbours lack basic facilities.  I hope the Minister will take that on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 relates to the payment to local authorities in lieu of rates.  I would like to know whether boats will receive money from rates.  How will that be arranged?  Under the new provisions will the fisheries boards be able to go directly to the rated occupiers and collect from them?  There is always concern about the finances of the board which have not been healthy for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer a provision whereby the finances of the board would be sounder under the new arrangements than they were heretofore.  I would be concerned about a provision which might leave the boards worse off financially than they were under the old arrangement.  Under the old arrangement, the fisheries were valued and the rates were levied by the <Col N="2181" /> council which gave a grant.  It was a very complicated and complex system.</P>
    <P>The new arrangement under section 17 is designed to simplify the system but, at the end of the day, the fisheries boards will want to know whether it will enhance their financial position.  Will it be more difficult or will they not be able to get anything from rates?  I am a bit confused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The fishery rates yield an average of £180,000 to the fisheries boards each year.  In 1993 the boards received £201,000 which included some arrears.  The boards will continue to receive a reasonable amount.  Last year compensation to local authorities in respect of fishery rates amounted to £594,000.  The difference between this amount and the amount collected by the boards is due to the fact that fishery rates have lagged behind local authority rates for a number of years.  A figure in the region of £180,000 will still go to the boards.</P>
      <P>Both the Department of the Marine and the Department of the Environment agree that considerable administrative savings will accrue if this compensation is handled as part of the rate support grant.  The necessary financial provision will be transferred from the Department of the Marine Vote to that of the Department of the Environment.  Under the old system, the Department of the Marine transferred the money to the Department of the Environment who in turn transferred it to the local authorities.  The Department of the Environment, under the rate support grant, will now pay the money directly to the local authorities but an amount in the region of £180,000 will still be collected by the fisheries boards from the commercial enterprises around the country.</P>

They were not getting the financial allocations to which they claimed they were entitled.  I want to ensure that the changes will enhance the financial <Col N="2182" /> position of the boards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Fisheries Board recommend that the Department tighten up the regulation which allows salmon to be smoked and sold legally when they have been caught illegally.  It recommends that section 155 <Col N="2183" /> exclude smoked salmon.  I would like to hear the views of the Minister on that.</P>
      <P>The board also recommends that rainbow trout be redefined.  Trout from cages can get up the rivers and be caught legally outside of the trout fishing season.  Someone can catch a trout out of season and say he caught him by mistake.  This regulation also needs to be tightened up as rainbow trout is getting up the streams and rivers and other species of trout is being caught out of season.  The board recommend that rainbow trout should be included in section 3.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Burke's point about smoked salmon.  I also believe that the definition of rainbow trout is wrong.  I was always under the impression that one did not need a licence to fish for rainbow trout.  This legislation provides that the word &ldquo;trout&rdquo; includes fish commonly called or known as rainbow trout.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke is correct, fish are escaping into rivers from trout farms. One cannot be choosy when fishing after a flood.  The definition of trout is very loose.  My view is that a trout is not a rainbow trout.  A trout is generally a small fish.  One can call any fish a trout.  I do not agree with the definition in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to my colleagues for facilitating me in this matter. The first part of the motion concerns the arms trade.  One might have thought that in an increasingly favourable situation in terms of nuclear proliferation one need not particularly worry.  However, as the Minister of State is aware, there is grave cause for concern with regard to the dissolution of the former Soviet Union and the placing of nuclear weapons in volatile control there.</P>
      <P>I will leave that matter to one side because the type of issues I wish to deal with are unprincipled exports from the European Union, in the main, to dictatorial, tyrannical and undemocratic regimes, which have no mandate from their people either to invest in munitions or to employ them wickedly in the pursuit of a criminal foreign policy.  The principal example is East Timor.  This is an area where not only the Minister of State but also the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and his distinguished predecessor, Deputy Andrews, have shown considerable concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the World Bank should make £1.4 billion available in grants to that regime, which is nothing other than a military dictatorship and tyranny.  It is exactly the amount of <Col N="2187" /> money that is spent by the Indonesian dictatorship on arms, including arms which are employed in an act of genocide against the small, defenceless people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>I convict the Governments of France, Germany and in particular the UK.  I wish to read a cynical and shameful exchange which was broadcast in this country in a film made by Mr. John Pilger.  The exchange was between Mr. Pilger and Mr. Alan Clarke, then a junior Minister at the British Department of Defence.  It would require some savage irony to deal with this but I will leave it on the record.</P>
    <P>John Pilger: Shouldn't the public be cynical about all this after what happened over Iraq?  Shouldn't the public be cynical about assurances, guidelines and denials from Government about the sale of arms?</P>
    <P>Alan Clarke: I don't know what you mean by the public but I don't think the majority of people give a damn about it unless those weapons are going to be used against our own troops.</P>
    <P>John Pilger: But it is the assumption that the public doesn't give a damn that allows Ministers and officials to deceive, isn't that correct?</P>
    <P>Alan Clarke: Why should they want to deceive if the public doesn't give a damn?</P>
    <P>John Pilger: Isn't all this in broad terms about the right of a small country not to be invaded by a large neighbour?</P>
    <P>Alan Clarke: Yeah, but they weren't British, were they?</P>
    <P>John Pilger: That makes a difference?</P>
    <P>Alan Clarke: Of course it makes a difference.  My responsibility is to my own people.  I don't really fill my mind much with what one set of foreigners is doing to another.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is perfectly permissible to export lethal materials to a criminal dictatorship, knowing that they will be <Col N="2188" /> used to murder innocent civilians in the pursuit of profit so long as it does not happen to impinge upon the consciousness of the British people, so long as there are no British casualities.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to comment on whether that is acceptable morality.  I remind him that the Constitution of this country is clearly determined as Christian and democratic and there is, therefore, a requirement, with which I have not always felt comfortable, that all policies of this State be Christian.  How comfortable are we with this policy on the part of a neighbour country?</P>
    <P>There is an enormous proliferation of landmines.  The Minister of State is aware of this because he also attended meetings of the Foreign Affairs committee where representations were made by wonderful people from Ireland who have worked in the developing countries, many of them priests and nuns.  One could not but be moved by the passion with which they spoke.  They almost always referred to these devilish weapons, which are so easy and cheap to produce, so profitable to export and so extraordinarily expensive to defuse.  The Minister of State is aware in so many countries of the developing world that children are inevitably used, either by accident or design, as human minesweepers.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this aspect.</P>
    <P>Regarding the second part of the motion, world population is another area where it is important for us to register a point.  A campaign is being orchestrated at present to undermine a sensible approach to world population.  In particular, it is being mounted, supported and pushed out by the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>.  I am told it is unprofitable for politicians to attack newspapers.  I was particularly glad that the distinguished playwright, Dennis Potter, before he died took a swipe at Mr. Murdoch and his works.  I have no hesitation in taking a swipe at the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>, whose editor has liberally libelled me in the past. Consequently, I do not feel that I am in any further danger of his venom.  The editorial of June 19 was a criminal disgrace. It stated: &ldquo;We believe that the <Col N="2189" /> wealthy West is now infected with neoMalthusian thinking&rdquo;.  The House should note the term &ldquo;infection&rdquo;.  It further stated:</P>
    <P>It is not just the widespread use of abortion in very wealthy states to destroy human life... [raising the scare of abortion]  The so-called liberals in western countries feel entirely comfortable in lecturing the poor of India and Africa about the `evil' of having large families...</P>
    <P>What rubbish.  What are these people to eat while this mathematical model, which may be of academic interest, could perhaps demonstrate that it might be possible theoretically to feed the existing population of the world without catapulting certain areas inevitably into famine?  What are they to eat while this machinery is being established?  Are they to eat the editorials of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> or the fatuous article by Mr. David Quinn who, nevertheless, asks a series of excellent questions?  Would that I were Jonathan Swift and had the capacity to deal with this rubbish in the manner it deserves.</P>
    <P>He asks, &ldquo;what exactly does &ldquo;overpopulation&rdquo; mean?&rdquo;.  A very good question, Mr. Quinn.  He asks, &ldquo;can we consider a region to be overpopulated when it experiences famine?&rdquo;.  He thinks this is a vexed question.  It is perfectly clear that if a region is threatened with famine one must consider overpopulation to be one of the ingredients.</P>
    <P>Is a region overpopulated when it is too densely populated?  ...Is a region overpopulated when its rate of economic development cannot keep up with its rate of population growth?  ...Is the world overpopulated when the strain on the ecosystem becomes too great?</P>
    <P>If he does not know the answer to these questions, I will tell him.  The answer is yes.  When people are starving, when the environment is being degraded, when the population is exploding at such a rate that it will double in the next 30 years, we are facing a potential catastrophe and something must be done about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /> Even those people who in the past thought that this matter could be dealt with in different ways are now converted. I refer to Professor <i>Paul McNulty who,</i> in an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 26 June, under the heading &ldquo;Second Thoughts &mdash; Can population policy save Africa from starvation?&rdquo;&mdash;a carefully balanced article &mdash; indicated that he had reconsidered his position.  He says that it is vital to undertake at least some degree of careful, measured population control. Otherwise there is no question that the situation in Africa will be extreme.  He underlines the fact that there must be appropriate birth control measures and that they must be consonant with the cultural climate of the countries being encouraged to engage in them.</P>
    <P>It is not accident that these things are occurring.  I was accused of being part of an international conspiracy when I started the gay movement.  We, at least, have contributed our little bit to the decline in world population although others have happily taken up the slack.  There is some degree of co-ordination in the number of letters appearing mysteriously in the newspapers, the number of editorials in certain sections of the press and the policy of the Vatican.  I deplore that policy.</P>
    <P>The regime in the Vatican is unrepresentative and undemocratic and the Vatican glorifies that.  The Vatican occupies an ambiguous position.  The Papal Nuncio is a doyen of the diplomatic corps representing a tiny state that has a very powerful diplomatic arm.  This is something we must watch.  I hope I do not speak in a sectarian manner but one can follow the movements of the Vatican over the last few years from the Rio Earth Summit, when the Vatican and Mr. Bush's administration conspired to force issues of world population off the agenda of that summit, to the preparations for the Cairo conference in which it is clear that once again the Vatican is attempting to subvert the democratic wish of most of the peoples of the earth by raising a scare and by frightening governments.  I sincerely hope that this Government will stand firm and take a measured, considered, <Col N="2191" /> balanced and humane view on this issue.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister and my colleagues and I will return to this issue at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. Senator Norris dealt very ably with the first part of the motion.  However, the production of landmines is particularly important as they are used against civilian targets.  Countries which give vast amounts of aid to the Third World are, at the same time, producing and exporting landmines.  I urge the Minister to seek not only the cessation of the export of landmines but also the cessation of their production.  Even arable land cannot be used because of the fear of landmines.</P>
      <P>The Vatican has spoken out very strongly about the world population conference. It has also spoken out very strongly on the international arms trade and discussed the ethical issues involved in it.  It has said that while righteous self-defence is one matter there should be compulsory mediation in most areas. However, this did not get much coverage while the Vatican statements on abortion have received the main coverage in the media.</P>
      <P>This is an independent country without a State church.  No Minister is asked by this country to represent views which are abhorrent to him or her.  I will not ask the Minister to represent abortion as being a suitable method of population control. Abortion can never be the preferred end of a pregnancy.  However, I ask him before he goes to Cairo to consider our comments on illegal abortion in the Third World.  Ninety nine per cent of illegal abortions take place in the Third World. Of the 0.5 million women who die each year as a result of conditions associated with pregnancy and childbirth, 200,000 die as a result of illegal abortion.  I hope the Minister will outline what he proposes to do about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maternal mortality rate of any country &mdash; the death rate associated with pregnancy &mdash; is not just a question of poverty.  It is a question of what priority <Col N="2192" /> society gives to women who are pregnant and giving birth.  Geographic boundaries cannot allow us to be indifferent to the suffering of others.  I also read the newspaper articles quoted by Senator Norris.  I read an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently accusing &ldquo;feminists&rdquo; of interfering with traditional cultures in other countries.  It said they wished to &ldquo;liberate&rdquo; the people of the developing world from their inconvenient attachment to children.  The words &ldquo;woman&rdquo; or &ldquo;man&rdquo; were not mentioned in the article.  Governments do not have children.  Women and men have children and it is they who will be affected by the loss of a mother.</P>
    <P>The most important factor that causes families to have large numbers of children is the increase in the survival rate of children under five.  I would be very surprised if the abolition of the immunisation programmes in Third World countries was considered a suitable method of population control.  Let us put that beside the abortion option.  In general, it is not lack of food but illness and inadequate care during illness that causes the death of young children.  All the articles I have read concentrate on macro-economics and not on micro-economics. As Senator Norris said, if one cannot feed somebody surely that is a famine.</P>
    <P>Three factors are important in this forthcoming conference and I hope the Minister will address them.  He is suitably qualified having previously been Minister for Women's Affairs.  The most important factors in family planning are: first, the status of women; secondly, the education of women; thirdly, the provision of family planning.  The status of women in many countries is very low.  The mother of three sons is admired, the mother of three daughters is pitied. Making women more valuable in a country has a tremendous effect on family planning in the country.  Female infanticide has been replaced in some countries by the abortion of female foetuses due to the new technology of pre-natal sexing.  This surely cannot be a method of population control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> Equality legislation must precede changes in attitude and I hope the Minister will make that clear to the national representatives he will address.  Women should be encouraged to participate in politics, in national institutions and to be on decision-making bodies.  They are not participants in many countries.  Women are very involved in environmental issues.  It is interesting to note that two of the women MEPs elected by Ireland are members of the Green Party while Mary Banotti has a strong interest in environmental issues.  Women professionals in the European Union have long urged that women in developing countries should be given a better chance in decision-making bodies.</P>
    <P>In most Third World countries the female literacy rate is far behind the male literacy rate, a factor which makes it almost impossible for them to get information on family planning.  Indeed, it is not the poorest countries which are the worst in this respect.  An educated woman is more valuable to her family and is more involved in decision-making. She delays marriage and her first pregnancy. Her secondary education is especially important in her participation in the life of the country.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that one in five pregnancies in the world is unplanned and unwanted and that 50 per cent of the women who have these children suffer from malnutrition, iron deficiency and anaemia.  In one generation the average family size in Ireland has dropped from four to two, despite an increase in the marriage rate.  There has not been a marked decrease in the birth rate; from about 70,000 per year in 1970 to just over 50,000 now.  If women are given a choice a large number will want to control the size of their families.</P>
    <P>In some regimes it is extremely difficult for women to get access to family planning because of the attitudes of the dominant religion in their country.  This should not be so.  The hierarchies of most religions are male.  Men are little involved in family planning in many countries and more commitment from them within the family is essential.  The sexual practices <Col N="2194" /> in many other countries are not the same as in our own.  There is not always monogamy and family planning must extend beyond the family as we understand it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will refer to the 60 per cent increase in AIDS cases in the past year &mdash; from 2.6 million victims to 4 million worldwide.  The vast majority of these cases have been spread through the heterosexual community.  Like Senator Norris, I cannot understand the articles in the right wing press which seem to try to disabuse people of this notion.  This has also led to a great increase in international child prostitution.  It is classed as tourism in some countries.  Younger children are always being sought for this activity because it is presumed they are the least likely to have AIDS.  The people involved in child prostitution come from Third World countries and the children who are sold into prostitution often come from conditions of great poverty.</P>
    <P>When speaking to delegations from Third World countries, the Minister should inform them that we, too, suffered from authoritarianism, though much has changed.  Austin Clarke may not have been a feminist but in thinking, he was before his time.  This is one of his poems:</P>
    <P>`How many children have you?'  asked</P>
    <P>The big Redemptorist.</P>
    <P>`Six, Father.'</P>
    <P>`The last,</P>
    <P>When was it born?'</P>
    <P>`Ten months ago,'</P>
    <P>`I cannot absolve your mortal sin</P>
    <P>Until you conceive again.  Go home,</P>
    <P>Obey your husband.'</P>
    <P>She whimpered:</P>
    <P>`But</P>
    <P>The doctor warned me...'</P>
    <P>Shutter became</P>
    <P>Her coffin lid.  She twisted her thin hands</P>
    <P>And left the box.</P>
    <P>The missioner,</P>
    <P>Red-bearded saint, had brought hell's flame</P>
    <P>To frighten women on retreat:</P>
    <P>Sent on his spiritual errand,</P>
    <P>It rolled along the village street</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2195" /> Until Rathfarnham was housing smoke</P>
    <P>That sooted the Jesuits in their Castle.</P>
    <P>`No pregnancy.  You'll die the next time,'</P>
    <P>The Doctor had said.</P>
    <P>Her tiredness obeyed</P>
    <P>That Saturday night: her husband's weight</P>
    <P>Digging her grave.  So in nine months, she</P>
    <P>Sank in great agony on a Monday.</P>
    <P>Her children wept in the Orphanage,</P>
    <P>Huddled together in the annexe,</P>
    <P>While, proud of the Black Cross on his badge,</P>
    <P>The Liguorian, at Adam and Eve's,</P>
    <P>Ascended the pulpit, sulphering his sleeves</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion addresses the need for Ireland to pursue a principled independent foreign policy in light of two challenges facing the international community today &mdash; the uncontrolled proliferation of the arms trade and the unprecedented population explosion. These two issues are extremely important. However it is a reflection of the world today that the motion could equally have highlighted a range of other international issues, many inter-related, which require of Ireland and of the international community a strong and committed response.  These include the rise <Col N="2196" /> of ethnic tensions and conflicts in many parts of the world, including Europe; the degradation of the environment; the plague of drugs and international crime; the abject poverty in many parts of the Third World versus the prosperity of the First World; the dangers of nuclear proliferation; and abuses of human rights. The list goes on.</P>
      <P>What all of these issues have in common is that they can only be tackled effectively by concerted international action.  It has become a cliche to talk of the global village and of the world being a small place but today more than ever, in economic and political terms and in terms of communications, the world is one community.  To tackle the issues threatening the international community requires responses at the national, regional and global level.</P>
      <P>Each member of the international community shares responsibility for tackling these issues.  They must engage in the analyses of the issues, debate what responses are called for and play their part in the solutions.  The Irish people have long had a strong and principled interest in foreign policy issues and as a result Ireland has a distinguished record of engagement in the important international issues of the day, be they human rights, peacekeeping, disarmament or issues of justice and development.  I acknowledge the role of the Seanad in our approach to foreign policy and the way it debates so many current issues.</P>
      <P>At the regional and global level, in recognition of the international community's increasing interdependence, the network of multilateral organisations and institutions addressing the international agenda has grown and developed &mdash; the UN and its family of organisations, the EU, the CSCE, the Council of Europe, ASEAN, the Organisation of African States, the Organisation of American States, NAFTA &mdash; a veritable alphabet soup.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underlying all these acronyms is the basic message that we must co-operate or else.  Peace and security, stability and prosperity depend on increasing co-operation at the regional and international <Col N="2197" /> level.  Not even the large powers can ensure their own securities and destinies in today's interdependent world.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a member of the EU, is involved in one of the most advanced regional co-operation arrangements in the world.  Through its common foreign and security policy, the EU has a significant contribution to make in international affairs and through our participation in the CFSP Ireland can make a contribution out of all proportion to our size and greater than if we acted alone.</P>
    <P>The global threat posed by the uncontrolled proliferation of the arms trade is a good example of an issue which must be tackled at all levels.  We need only look at the number of conflicts in the world to day to realise that the excessive accumulation of arms is one of the principle threats to international peace and security.  Whether the appalling events in Rwanda and Somalia and the death and destruction in the former Yugoslavia could have been avoided, there can be no doubt the availability of large quantities of arms contributed to the scale of the carnage.</P>
    <P>So far as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is concerned, the Government is pursuing actively its efforts to help achieve universal adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a successful outcome to the NPT Review and Extension Conference next year.  The threat of nuclear proliferation has not diminished with the end of the cold war: on the contrary, as developments in North Korea demonstrate, the dangers are now greater than ever.  The further spread of such weapons would have destabilising regional effects, encouraging weaker states in a region who may not have the means to acquire other weapons of mass destruction as a deterrent.  The Government is also active in international efforts to eliminate biological and toxic weapons and it was an original signatory last year of the Chemical Weapons Convention.</P>
    <P>With regard to conventional weapons, Ireland neither produces nor exports arms.  We have advocated the maximum <Col N="2198" /> possible restraint in the production, sale and transfer of all conventional weapons. The question for our foreign policy is how our analysis of the issue, which identifies arms control and reduction as a major factor in ensuring international peace and security, can be converted into meaningful action at the regional and international level.</P>
    <P>The international recognition of the threat posed by the uncontrolled proliferation of conventional weapons emerged at the end of the cold war.  When the threat of &ldquo;mutually assured destruction&rdquo; by nuclear weapons &mdash; that chilling phrase from the recent past &mdash; receded, the need to focus on the dangers posed by conventional weapons was recognised. The end of the East-West confrontation resulted in massive stockpiles of military hardware becoming available. The danger this posed was inescapable.</P>
    <P>At the European Council in June 1991 the EC Heads of State and Governments expressed alarm at the stockpiling of conventional weapons in certain regions of the world.  The European Council stated its belief that far reaching international action was needed immediately to promote restraint and transparency in the transfers of conventional weapons and technologies for military use, in particular towards areas of tension.</P>
    <P>Since then, the EU member states, including Ireland, have taken a number of initiatives to promote transparency and restraint in arms transfers.  The UN Register of Conventional Arms was established by a UN General Assembly resolution in 1992, which was based on a joint EU-Japan initiative and was cosponsored by Ireland.  It took much effort, argument, debate and persuasion on the part of the EU and its member states to achieve this important development. The first returns under the register in 1993 were encouraging; over 80 states submitted returns.  The EU has encouraged those countries which failed to submit returns in 1993 to do so in 1994, and has also submitted suggestions to the Secretary-General to improve the level of information contained in the returns for future years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2199" /> Improved transparency in arms transfers is only one element in a strategy to deal with the threat posed by the uncontrolled proliferation of arms.  Measures to encourage restraint by countries which export or import arms are another important aspect.  At the regional level in Europe the CSCE has adopted <i>Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers.</i> This was also the result of an EU initiative. This document, which is politically binding, came into effect on 1 January 1994.  It is, in effect, a set of guidelines to encourage restraint in arms transfers, in particular to areas of conflict or potential conflict.  It encourages the CSCE states to introduce effective national control mechanisms with regard to arms transfers; to take account of legitimate security requirements and the objective of the least diversion of human and economic resources for armaments; and to take account of human rights compliance by arms importing states.</P>
    <P>At the UN General Assembly last year, the Tanáiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, proposed that the UN should elaborate a code of conduct for conventional arms transfers which would encourage states to exercise responsibility and restraint in their arms transfers and which would set out common principles to be observed in this area.  This would be similar to the CSCE principles, but would apply to the international community as a whole.  We are currently discussing this initiative with our partners in the EU, with a view to securing EU support for our efforts.  As was demonstrated in the case of the UN arms register, the full support of the EU. was a key factor in the speed with which the proposal was adopted by the UN.</P>
    <P>It would be misleading to suggest that the UN arms register and the UN code of conduct, which the Tanáiste has proposed, would be sufficient in themselves to put an end to the uncontrolled proliferation of arms.  These two measures taken together would, however, represent the first steps in an international regime in this area, to be built in future years.  Ireland will continue to advocate <Col N="2200" /> maximum restraint in arms transfers and we will intensify our efforts to this end.</P>
    <P>One category of weapons requires urgent attention.  The Government is extremely concerned at the death and suffering caused to civilians by antipersonnel mines which are widespread throughout the countryside in Afghanistan, Angola, Mozambique and Combodia, where I saw at first hand the devastating effect of these mines.  I am pleased that both Senators raised this issue in their contributions.  In additions, these devices have far reaching effects on the welfare, medical and infrastructural systems of the countries affected.  Antipersonnel mines, especially unmarked and undetected ones, also pose considerable problems for peacekeeping forces.  The consequences of the laying of mines persist long after the cessation of any hostilities which may have motivated their deployment in the first place.</P>
    <P>Ireland does not manufacture or permit the export of antipersonnel mines. Within the context of the wider question of promoting greater restraint in the manufacture, possession, transfer and sale of all conventional weapons, Ireland advocates that such restraint should also be applied to landmines.  Ireland is strongly supportive of the provisions of the UN convention known as the Inhumane Weapons Convention and is presently taking steps to ratify it.  Furthermore, Ireland is supportive of efforts to improve the convention by strengthening the Protocol which deals with landmines and intends to contribute actively to the review conference in 1995.  Ireland welcomes the decisions of some manufacturing countries to introduce moratoria on the export of landmines and calls on other producing countries to consider doing likewise.</P>
    <P>The Government notes with concern recent reports that companies engaged in the development of landmines have secured contracts for demining in Mozambique. The cost of demining is estimated to be 100 times the cost of laying mines.  That is a staggering statistic.  It is important to be sure that no company which profits from the manufacture of <Col N="2201" /> mines is involved in demining projects.  I assure Senator Henry and Senator Norris that I will continue to speak out on this issue and to raise it at every available forum.  As a result of my visit to Cambodia, the Government last March made available £300,000 to speed up the process of demining there.  This funding is to be channelled through Concern and will be used for removing mines in the Pursat region where Concern has a number of development projects.</P>
    <P>As set out in the motion before us, the United Nations is organising a major conference on population and development in Cairo from 5 to 13 September this year.  It follows two previous conferences on population which took place in Bucharest in 1974 and Mexico in 1984. The Cairo conference is one of several major conferences with a development theme to be organised in recent years, commencing with the Rio Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. The Cairo conference will be followed in March 1995 by the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen and by the International Conference on Women in Beijing later next year.</P>
    <P>The Cairo conference will provide an opportunity for the international community to consider the important issues of human population growth and distribution and their implications for our planet's economic and social development. At present, the growth rate of the world's populations is at an all-time high, with an increase of over 90 million people taking place each year.  By the year 2015 it is estimated that the world's population, which at present stands at 5.7 billion, may reach as high as eight billion.</P>
    <P>While such projected increases are in themselves alarming, the situation is exacerbated by their global distribution. Approximately 93 per cent of current population growth is occurring in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  While Europe has an average growth rate of just 0.3 per cent a year, Africa's population is increasing annually by 2.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The rapid rate of growth in population is placing enormous demands on those <Col N="2202" /> societies which are most vulnerable and least able to meet the challenges posed. These challenges are many and varied and include insufficient food supply, increased demands on water resources, greater pollution and poverty in ever-expanding urban centres, and severe pressures on already inadequate health and education systems.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the Cairo conference will take place.  In Cairo governments will attempts to agree on a comprehensive response to the challenges posed by population growth. Already there have been three meetings of the preparatory committee and attention is now focusing on the Draft Programme of Action to be adopted at Cairo.  This Draft Programme of Action will address the problems raised by population growth in the context of sustainable development.  The first substantive chapter of the text is entitled, &ldquo;Interrelationships Between Population, Sustained Economic Growth and Sustainable Development&rdquo;, and argues convincingly that these issues are inextricably linked.  To quote from the Draft Programme of Action: &ldquo;The everyday activities of all human beings, communities and countries are interrelated with population change, patterns and levels of use of natural resources, the state of the environment, and the pace and quality of economic and social development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Cairo conference will also deal with a number of other topics which are closely connected with population growth.  Gender equality, empowerment of women, health, population distribution and urbanisation, emigration and refugees, education, and research and technology will all be considered in the specific context of population and development.  This all encompassing approach, which is similar to that used at the Earth Summit in Rio, has been adopted because it is accepted that attempting to discuss population and development in isolation from these related issues would be a futile exercise.</P>
    <P>In many of these areas it is the developing countries which are taking the lead as <Col N="2203" /> they witness at first hand the problems posed by the demographic explosion. More and more countries now recognise the need for population programmes which include family planning components. These population policies are essentially a national responsibility but they deserve the support of the international community.</P>
    <P>In 1992, the Development Council of the European Community adopted a set of basic principles and implementing guidelines for population programmes. These principles, which Ireland fully supports, include non-coercion and non-discrimination, the observance of the rights of individuals and couples to choose the number and the spacing of their children; the need to integrate population policies and development policies, and attention to be paid to the needs of individuals, families and the wider community.</P>
    <P>Although substantial progress has been made at the meetings of the preparatory committee charged with preparing the draft programme of action, a number of issues remain to be resolved at Cairo.  One such issue, which is of great concern to Ireland, is that of abortion. We have made our constitutional and legal position on this subject clear to our EU partners and the Irish delegation at Cairo will seek to have language included in the final version of the programme of action which is consistent with our position.</P>
    <P>Last year, for the first time, Ireland contributed £50,000 to the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, and in 1994 we are increasing our contribution to £150,000.  The role of UNFPA is to provide assistance in the field of population, including family planning, awareness and education programmes in response to requests from developing countries.  These contributions are in response to the challenges posed by population growth and reflect the growing importance of the issue both within the European Union and in the international community generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2204" /> I have set out in some detail the approach the Government is taking with regard to the two specific subjects mentioned in the motion.  I have also sought to outline the broader context within which specific policies are being pursued at national and international level.  For our policies to be fully effective and to achieve maximum impact, we must not approach problems as though they existed in isolation; rather, we must have full regard for all of the relevant factors and trends, political and economic, social and cultural, which interact one upon the other.  Similarly, we must seek to mobilise the greatest possible support for our efforts, both nationally and internationally, if the desired results are to be achieved.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate in the Seanad.  As this House will recall, one of the early decisions of the Government was the establishment of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which was long overdue.  The experience to date is encouraging, with the joint committee providing the opportunity for an ongoing input from elected representatives to the foreign policy choices facing the Government. This evening's debate on the motion tabled by Senators Norris and Henry provides a welcome opportunity to hear the views of Members on these important issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister I welcome this motion proposed by Senator Norris and seconded by Senator Henry. It is an important motion and we should, as a sovereign independent State, have our own distinct and principled foreign policy.  Consistently over the years we have adopted such an approach to our foreign policy.</P>
      <P>Next year will be the 40th anniversary of Ireland's membership of the United Nations and it is true that we have a very proud record in that body where we have exercised an independent, outspoken, free voice at all times, especially on behalf of smaller nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that at all levels we should cherish and maintain our independence <Col N="2205" /> and our right to speak freely on issues of foreign policy.  This can be positively achieved through our membership of both the European Union and the United Nations.  We may not at all times be fully in agreement with the European Union. We should try at all times to present our separate and distinct views on issues.</P>
    <P>In the United Nations many years ago Ireland played a major part in formulating the multilateral disarmament instrument, the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  I understand that is due for renewal next year and I hope we will be active in supporting its continuation.</P>
    <P>In 1991, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev focused their attention on nuclear arms limitation and disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war.  This was a positive move and was the first genuine effort by those two major powers.</P>
    <P>The START Treaty, which was also signed in July of 1991 set ceilings on the production of these arms and was a positive development in providing for radical cuts.  START II is awaiting implementation by the Russian Parliament, but it is of importance.  People might say that the implementation of these treaties is outside our control but it is good to see some of the larger nations making progress toward nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago the world faced a potentially major international conflict between north Korea and the United States.  The intervention at the time of former US President, Mr. Carter, helped to avoid what could have been a major nuclear war.  This helps to highlight its ever present danger.  Proper inspection and control of these weapons was never more important.  We have to continue to oppose the build up and spread of these weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>The expenditure on arms and the build up of arms is a gross abuse of money that, in the main, comes from taxpayers throughout the world.  The world spends about 1 per cent of its money on development aid whereas a much higher figure goes towards the production of arms. This highlights the outlandish policies of <Col N="2206" /> different Governments and the strength of the people producing these arms.  They obviously have major lobbies in governments, particularly in the larger governments in Europe, the United States and throughout the world, where they lobby for production of and expenditure on arms.  We must make every effort to curtail the production and sale of these arms.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has been making efforts to control these arms.  A register was established &mdash; and has been in operation for a year &mdash; dealing with the transparency of the sales of these arms, which will be of benefit.  However, one of the categories excluded from this register is landmines.  This was mentioned by Senator Norris and by the Minister.  The injuries and deaths caused to civilians right across the areas where they are being used at present have already been described in detail.  It is important that landmines are included on the register so that efforts can be made to prevent their continued proliferation.  There is a vast waste of money at present on these weapons.</P>
    <P>Regarding the second part of the motion, I welcome the Minister's remarks that the Government will have a distinctive role and policy on this matter.  He mentioned that the Government will be seeking specific exclusions regarding the use of methods of birth control and in this respect advised that it would have a separate and distinctive approach towards abortion by endeavouring to ensure that abortion would not be used as a method of controlling population growth.</P>
    <P>Some comments were made regarding the Church.  There have many positive developments by the churches, and much good has derived from all of them regarding assistance to many of the poorer nations, where work was undertaken on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The motion as proposed is worthy of consideration and adoption by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is an appropriate evening for this debate to take place &mdash; just before <Col N="2207" /> the Director General of the United Nations Population Fund is to address the Overseas Development Aid Subcommittee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>It is also appropriate to have this debate at a time when two members of the FBI have been assigned to a mission in Moscow in an attempt to control the Mafia and the export of armaments from the former Soviets of the former USSR to countries where the build up of arms could result in them being sold to nations which have the money to buy them but do not know how to use them.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris suggested that statistics should not be used when addressing the subject of arms.  However, statistics are useful in this respect.  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute produced figures for 1992 which suggest that in the world in general, $921.5 billion was spent on armaments production.  It is relevant to world peace to suggest that the nations which spent most of this sum were those on the UN Security Council, Russia, China, the USA, the UK and France, who spent $624.3 billion.  In addition NATO member countries spent $89.3 billion, therefore, over $700 billion of this military spending took place in the NATO member countries and the five permanent member countries of the UN Security Council.</P>
      <P>This is an atrocious figure and anyone who believes that this money is being spent on the military within these countries is a fool.  The armaments produced in these countries are being sold throughout the world.  There is not a conflict at present which is not supported by the production of arms in these countries, especially the USA, which in 1992 spent over half of the total spent on armaments production by the five permanent member countries of the UN Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a country in the world in which there is conflict where it is not possible to find arms produced by so called civilised nations.  Something must be done about this, and it is no good to advise that this country can sign a <Col N="2208" /> document which states that this issue will be policed.  It will not be policed, as there is no way in which the arms companies will allow it.</P>
    <P>There is a correlation between arms spending and the matters to be considered by the Cairo Conference on population control.  Is population growth related to poverty, or is poverty related to population growth?  This issue must be addressed, not only at the Cairo Conference, but everywhere else.</P>
    <P>There was no problem with population growth in Africa when the Africans had Africa to themselves.  It was the intrusion of the so called civilised nations of Europe into Africa which changed the social systems on that Continent and the international status of its countries.  They also raped the Continent by attempting to introduce what they considered to be modern agriculture methods.  In consequence, there has been a total desertification in northern Africa, and it is growing at an enormous rate.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the measures taken to depopulate the continent, the problems of desertification will continue, so we must put back into Africa what we took out.  Luckily, the Irish did not take too much out, but we tried to change the social and religious fabric of the area and in doing so, we created problems.</P>
    <P>A book was published in the recent past entitled <i>Give them Bread, not Cake,</i> and it appears that this is what is meant by those who address the issue of population control.  It means let them starve a little bit slower than they are starving now. The people of the developed world, including Europeans, suggest that if the population is cut, those in the afflicted parts of the world will live a little better. It is pointless to blame the Vatican or the Muslim religion for this.  Eliminating Muslims or Catholics, or the ethics of Roman Catholicism or the Muslim religion will not make any significant difference to the problems of these countries.</P>
    <P>There must be a transference of resources from the northern to the southern world, and it must be ensured that in such a transfer, people can grow economically <Col N="2209" /> and socially and have a quality of life.  The Cairo Conference will provide an opportunity for the international community to consider the broad issues of human population increase including the situation where such increase is inhibiting the life styles or the lives of the people who live in the affected regions.</P>
    <P>There must be recognition that the problems should be addressed at national level.  There is no point, as happened in the past, for the people from the rich western or northern world to tell the countries where there is a huge population increase that condoms will resolve their problems.  Condoms will not resolve these problems.  They might inhibit the growth of population, but this is pointless if the northern world is destabilising the affected economies, supplying armaments and changing the system of living.</P>
    <P>The northern world goes into Rwanda where there is an attempted transfer from a rural society of cattle trade and growth to bringing people into the cities.  It will not work, because the population will be eliminated and the country will become a desert, like other areas of Africa, as the people will not be there and the land will not be capable of being brought back into production.</P>
    <P>The areas of the world where population increase is greatest are those where, generally, Europeans have raped and razed.  There is not a tree left in India at present, because agriculture has changed dramatically.</P>

      <P>The Senator has seen one tree.  With regard to Asia and Africa, spending cycles on arms must be addressed and it must be ensured that whatever is undertaken in terms of population control is not done merely to control population. Controlling population is very easy.  Senator Norris remarked that the gay community controls population by not having children.  That is not an answer to the issue; it is a facetious reply to a serious argument proposed in the House this evening by the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2210" /> I welcome the fact that this debate has taken place the evening before Dr. NafisSadik addresses the Overseas Development Aid Subcommittee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Presumably as many Members as are in attendance this evening will be able to attend the meeting of the subcommittee tomorrow to listen to her views before the Cairo Conference.</P>
    <P>Attempts should be made to try to force the member countries of NATO to eliminate the proliferation of arms in their countries. This House should also tell the five permanent member countries of the UN Security Council to stop this spending, because in doing so the House will have done the world a service.</P>

      <P>The need for Ireland to develop a strong, independent and principled foreign policy is the subject of this motion.  It is not sufficient, however, to develop a policy unless we can also pursue that policy and ensure that it comes to a satisfactory conclusion.  Next week may provide and historic opportunity to take a step in that direction so let us not pass it up.  For the first time in 27 years in Europe, and perhaps for the last time for many years to come, we have the chance of an Irish person becoming President of the European Commission yet we seem to be virtually indifferent to that possibility and are certainly not very aggressive in pursuing it.  I am concerned that the historic dimension of this opportunity is not fully appreciated and I fear that future generations of Irish people will consider our lack of zeal as bizarre and perhaps even unforgiveable.  I do not wish to mention individuals and, in speaking out as an Independent Senator, I wish to avoid adding to any partisan confrontation.  We should put aside questions of personality and political partisanship, <Col N="2211" /> and consider only the national interest.</P>
      <P>Three considerable benefits would flow through this country if an Irish person succeeded in becoming President of the European Commission.  First, having an Irish person in such an influential position would further the interests of Ireland within the European Union.  Let us not be in any doubt that Ireland would find it easier to get its point of view across in these very important matters if the Commission President was Irish.  Second, the status and profile of Ireland would be raised considerably.  For a country that depends so crucially on the outside world for trade and tourism, this would be a major benefit.  Third, and perhaps most importantly, is the effect on our national morale.  It would be an inspiration to our young people, to a new generation of young achievers, as well as being a source of pride to the entire nation.  That is something that can unite us, so let us unite and push this matter forward in the ten days are left for us to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can possibly oppose a strong, independent and principled foreign policy.  The problem arises in deciding what constitutes such a policy. What is a principled foreign policy in terms of the proliferation of arms?  I agree with everything said by the proposer and seconder of the motion, but I strongly oppose the embargo on arms sales to the government of Bosnia.  Where does that leave us in terms of principles?  It is no coincidence that the states which imposed that embargo have suddenly begun to seek a real solution in Bosnia having learned of an inflow of arms from Iran to the government of Bosnia.  That has helped greatly to concentrate their minds on the need for a rapid solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While one is in favour of principles, I am not sure that it gets us very far to remain at the level of cosmic reflection. <Col N="2212" /> I agree with Senator Norris about the horrors in East Timor.  On the other hand, if one were proposing the proliferation of arms to East Timor to resist the tyrannies there, that would be a different matter.  I want to draw attention to the problems involved in implementing principles because while we are all principled we happen to have different principles.  The same applies even more emphatically in the area of population. We all have principles about what we conceive of as population policy but they are very varying principles.  I stress the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; also.  What does an independent foreign policy in the area of population policy mean?</P>
    <P>Any fool can be independent, but to be intelligently independent we must be adequately informed.  Where do we get our information from on issues of population policy?  We have virturally no thinking about any type of population policy in terms of the inter-relationship between population and economic development, or population and environmental issues.  We have no third level department of population studies and though we may have one or two appointments in the area of population studies there is no professor of population studies.</P>
    <P>I have enormous sympathy for our officials and politicians who have to try to formulate an independent policy, given the lack of support here for thinking about population matters.  At best, we can be takers of other people's thinking. We may be intelligent takers of other people's thinking &mdash; and, in fact, the section on population in the Minister's address was a very good one &mdash; but it is clear from where the information is coming.  It is also clear that it has not been processed through independent analysis here.  Our officials and our Government need a much more systematic and sustained back-up in thinking about these matters than it can now get from our higher educational system or other areas. When one looks at the complexity of the issues now confronting policy makers at a global level, I think they are very badly served by the resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2213" /> Senator Norris referred to famine as an index of over-population, and most people would agree that is the case. However, when we look at famines whether in this country in the mid-19th century or in India much more recently, consensus interpretation is not necessarily that there was over-population, but that there was maldistribution of purchasing power in the area in which the famine occurred and frequently, food continued to be exported from those areas while people starved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that in all cases there was a very rapid expansion of population. In fact, the Irish famine of 1847 was a classic example of precisely that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  There is no necessary incompatibility between population increasing rapidly and there being sufficient food in an area when famine occurs.  It is the social structure that largely determines that.  I am not saying that rapid population growth cannot be a contributory factor in exacerbating problems but it cannot be a single-issue, simplistic interpretation of it.  That is why the complexity of these issues has to be confronted here although our officials and politicians do not have the back-up that they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where do we get our information on the bulk of international demographic developments?  Much of it comes from international organisations like the United Nations or the OECD.  In many cases the information is the best available but it is often surrounded by a penumbra of value judgments.  For instance, there is a United Nations publication called <i>The Progress of Nations</i>.  It is a worthwhile publication and I agree with a number of the value judgments that underlie its presentation, but they are value judgments and have not, as far as I know, been subjected to interrogation. They are not discussed at length but are presented as self-evident truths, and while they may well be truths for many <Col N="2214" /> of us, we should preserve our independence in evaluating them.</P>
    <P>When I support the motion for an independent foreign policy I strongly suggest that we try to develop our intellectual independence in the first instance to give us a basis from which we can evaluate with confidence proposals coming from elsewhere, rather than regurgitating chunks of other people's thinking and presenting them as best we can at that moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be one of the chief culprits of Professor Lee's tirade in taking huge chunks from a source I was not able to research.  I have not been able to travel the world to verify what I will say.  Nevertheless, I hold it to be true and therefore have no hesitation in expressing it.  I welcome this motion although it is unfortunate that the two issues are combined because each deserves separate debate in its own right.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate mostly on part (b) of the motion.  I have not doubt about the need for family planning in all areas of the world, particularly the developing world.  I am glad to hear from the Minister's speech that Ireland has contributed the generous sum of £150,000 for the promotion of family planning in the developing world.  When one contrasts this with the even more generous contribution of £300,000 for demining, one can put the whole issue into some kind of perspective.  The amount we are providing to make one small area of Cambodia safe is double what we are providing for family planning, which is paltry by comparison as it must be spread throughout the whole of the developing world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt that women are responsible for fetching most of the poor world's water, collecting most of its fuel, cooking its meals, cleaning its compounds, washing its clothes, shopping for its needs, looking after its old and its ill and bearing and caring for its children. Third World countries can produce their own food but have spent so much money, along with rich countries, on technology they do not need that they have to starve <Col N="2215" /> themselves to pay off their debts.  It is mostly women who do the work in getting that cash together.</P>
    <P>In Niger about 330 children per thousand live births die before the age of five. This means that a huge human resource goes to waste.  The resource which women bring to this world is being wasted because they are not given the opportunity to space their children.  Spaced children are happier and healthier children. If a mother has too many children, she is not able to replenish the vitamins and minerals in her body which she needs to pass on to her unborn children.  Unless women, particularly in poor countries where nutrition is not high, have the ability to space their families, their children will be less healthy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Kelly for sharing her time with me.  I welcome the motion tabled by Senator Norris.  The establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is probably one of the better things which has happened in the Oireachtas.  The Minister referred to this earlier.  It gives Members an opportunity to find out from visitors and ambassadors from other countries what is happening in other areas of the world.  We have a better opportunity today of knowing what is happening elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The global threat posed by the uncontrolled proliferation of the arms trade is probably the most annoying and worrying threat for the world at present.  Every country which has problems and in which a war is taking place seems to have massive numbers of arms.  In Bosnia, Somalia <Col N="2216" /> and even Northern Ireland, it seems easy to obtain large amounts of arms.  The countries which are supposed to be helping to stop this are the ones which are producing these arms.  It is sad to see that this is the situation.  These countries talk about doing something to stop wars throughout the world but are causing many of them.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a great record of work within the UN in trying to solve problems. The UN has helped bring peace to many countries.  Between 1945 and 1987 there were 23 UN peace-keeping operations. There have been 13 others since then.  By January 1992 an estimated 528,000 military police and civilian personnel had served under the UN.  Over 800 of them, from 43 countries, have died in the service of the UN.  The aggregate cost of these operations has been $ 8.3 billion dollars.  The unpaid arrears to these countries stand at over $ 800 million. This represents a debt by the UN to troop contributing countries.  Ireland is owned about £12 million for peace-keeping operations.  Such operations approved at present are estimated to cost close to £3 billion in a 12 month period while patterns of payment are unacceptably slow.</P>
    <P>At the end of the 1980s global defence expenditure had approached $1 trillion a year or $2 million a minute.  This was to bring peace throughout the world.  It is a sad reflection on the countries involved in the wars occurring at present that it is so easy to get arms.  These arms are imported by them and are used to kill and maim.  We should do anything we can to try to stop this.  The motion is timely.  We are on the right road and it is important that we keep our voice raised at UN level to see that something is done to stop the proliferation of arms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion, which is timely.  I wish to raise two issues to illustrate the need for Ireland to have a strong, independent and principled foreign policy.  The first has been raised here before, that is this country's approach to East Timor.  The second is our approach to the sanctions on Cuba.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2217" /> We must a have strong, independent voice and stance on the atrocities perpetrated by the Indonesian regime against the people of East Timor since it invaded that country in 1975.  Ireland must use every forum to bring international pressure to bear on Indonesia to stop the genocide.  Until recently there has been a conspiracy of silence by the Western world about the atrocities in that country.  As a neutral nation we must take leadership, stand independently and, if necessary, take issue with some of our friends in the Western world.  East Timor has had to endure the brutal killing of one third of its population.  Men, women and children have been annihilated. Ireland must use every opportunity and available platform unreservedly to condemn the destruction of the nation and people of East Timor and the open support for the Indonesian Government by prominent, powerful nations throughout the world.  These nations have continued a lucrative trade with Indonesia, including the sale of arms to its army by France, the US and the UK.</P>
    <P>Australia has provided military training for the Indonesian army.  These nations are accessories to genocide.  We must speak out independently to stop such trade, which is really a trade in death.  These arms have been used to kill and maim the Timorese people &mdash; to introduce a form of ethnic cleansing at its worst.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a contributor to peacekeeping in many parts of the world and a strong supporter of the UN, has a moral power which we should use to highlight and object to what is happening.  A solution to the plight of the people of East Timor will not be forthcoming until international pressure forces an end to all trading with Indonesia and full economic sanctions are imposed, similar to those imposed on Iraq and which proved so successful in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Indonesia became a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1991.  It bears a special responsibility to implement recommendations specified in that body's statements and resolutions.  Yet, with some minor exceptions, <Col N="2218" /> it has not done so.  Indeed, it has indicated that it does not feel bound to abide by the provisions of those resolutions. I will leave the last words on East Timor to Amnesty International which stated:</P>
    <P>When Governments pretend not to notice suffering, to whom can people like those of Indonesia and East Timor turn for help?  The United Nations? Alas, the deeper you delve, the redder the faces.  The cynicism of <i>realpolitik</i> extends even to the UN Commission on Human Rights, of which Indonesia is a member.  When Amnesty attended the Commission in Geneva to urge action on Indonesia and East Timor we were met only with embarrassment. The Governments to which we spoke repeated what they have been promising us for 30 years, that they will pursue a policy of quiet diplomacy. They might as well go fishing.</P>

This Government should get off the fence and support the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 47/19 entitled &ldquo;The Necessity of Ending the Economic, Commercial and Financial Embargo Imposed by the United States of America against Cuba&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is no logical reason for continuing this embargo.  The Soviet bloc has disintegrated, the Cold War is over and Russia is exploring the possibility of joining NATO.  Why must the ordinary people of Cuba continue to suffer the effects of an outdated economic embargo by the US as a result of which conditions are very bad in Cuba.  Everything is rationed and people have a boring, if just adequate, diet.  Many have no soap or detergents and sometimes no medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland must take an independent stand on this.  The UN General Assembly condemned the US blockade of Cuba and in 1993 the General Assembly adopted a <Col N="2219" /> resolution on the need to put an end to the blockade.  On that occasion, 88 countries voted with Cuba against the blockade, four voted against Cuba and 57 abstained.  Ireland abstained.  We should get off the fence and vote with Cuba. Some of those who voted with Cuba for the removal of the blockade are our EU partners, so participation in EU co-operation on foreign policy is not a reason for abstaining on the vote.</P>
    <P>The US blockade has been there for 32 years and during that time it stunted Cuba's growth.  While there may have been a case for an embargo during the worst stages of the Cold War, there is no justification for its continuation in 1994. With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, Cuba's main trading partners fell apart.  The former Soviet Union was its main trading partner up to that time.  Cuba is isolated from potential Western trading partners because of pressure from the US.  Will the Minister comment on how we will approach the next General Assembly vote on the removal of sanctions on Cuba, which I understand will take place before the end of this year?</P>

      <P>There is obviously a great deal of interest in this debate and many Senators wish to speak.  The Minister has also indicated that he would like to speak a second time, which is unusual in Private Members' Business but to which I think that the House will agree.

      <P>I also compliment you, on that decision, as very few debates have attracted such interest and diversity of contributions.  There are three distinct elements to this motion, two of which I can support without hesitation. However, I have some reservations on the third element.  Before dealing with the arms or population aspects, like Senator Quinn I will refer to the motion which proposes that Ireland should develop strong, independent and principled foreign policies.  Of course, we should develop strong, independent and principled foreign policies.  Could anybody in this or the other House argue that we should be unprincipled in any policy?  I think not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope any policy we adopt is principled, strong and independent.  I agree with Senator Lee that all too often, we borrow policies from either the Foreign Office or Foggy Bottom, rejig them a little and then pass them off as Irish particularly so in any area of foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>Several Senators have spoken about the situation in East Timor.  Could our policy here be regarded as independent, strong or principled?  It could not be regarded as any of those three things.  It is obscene.  We are prepared to sup with the people involved in genocide &mdash; people whom we call friends.  Our Australian, British and EU friends are all guilty of genocide because they supply the arms which kill the people of East Timor.  We do not have strong, independent or principled policies in this regard.</P>
      <P>A few years ago, I remember having a colourful row with a party colleague on the situation of the Khmer Rouge &mdash; on which the Minister of State present supported me &mdash; which was at that time occupying in a most perverse way the seat in the United Nations which the UN had dedicated to the Cambodian people.  Did we have the guts as a nation to say that this was an obscenity?  We did not.  We borrowed our policies from Foggy Bottom and the US State Department.  We looked like idiots when the Americans did a <i>volte-face</i> on that policy.  We should have been in the lead because we are a unique nation in that we are part of the developed world but are also among those who have been exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the arms trade, there can be very little doubt that this is the most unspeakable form of international commerce.  It is bizarre that countries which regard themselves as developed engage in this business.  The situation in conventional arms production has been exacerbated in recent years by the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the Soviet system. The destruction of the Warsaw Pact and the disintegration of the state economies of eastern Europe has led to prodigious amounts of arms being freely available to <Col N="2222" /> those who wish to engage in the international arms trade.</P>
    <P>The demise of the Soviet bloc has not been the only contributory factor.  The reality is that many of our neighbours, our partners in the EU, have well developed weaponry producing industries. The world's arms trade is supported by these nations.  One of the extraordinary things which has happened since the end of the Cold War is that the peace dividend, which was promised, has been blighted by the massive off-loading of weaponry from both eastern and western nations into the stock pits of those who trade in this form of destruction.</P>
    <P>Arms produced in neighbouring states, in EU member states, with whom we willingly consort, are used to slaughter people in other parts of this planet.  It is important that we have an independent and strong policy and that when we see an obscenity we point to it.  It does not matter whether it is a Bulgarian obscenity, a Romanian, a British obscenity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or a French obscenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a French obscenity or a US obscenity, we should be prepared to stand our ground and say, &ldquo;this is obscene&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I already referred to the genocide in East Timor.  This is an area where we need a strong foreign policy.  We need to be equally strong on what is happening in the other hot spots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the motion deals with population.  I paused &mdash; in the same terms expressed by Senator Lee &mdash; for some thought in this regard.  Whenever I hear a politician, a statesman or an expert from the western developed world turn his or her attention to the issue of population, I listen carefully.  All too often after the discussions and the agonising, they come to a conclusion that the growth of population in the Third World is a long-term threat to the planet.  The conclusion may not be worded in such politically incorrect language, but, <Col N="2223" /> nonetheless, all too often that is the conclusion.</P>
    <P>This form of Malthusian racist analysis sees the growth of population in the Third World as the basis of many of its problems and ultimately the planet's problems. This is an area where the developed world must tread very carefully.  The developed world must acknowledge that many of the resource problems which exist in the Third World arise not from over-population but from over-exploitation. We must be honest and willing to recognise that the over-exploitation by and large has been the sin of the developed world.  If there is a problem in the developing world, we have largely contributed to it; we the consumers and policy makers of the western world.</P>
    <P>The EU creates and operates policies which are genocidal.  We contribute to the maldistribution and the starvation, it is not because the men and women of Africa procreate and produce children. Our policies produce starvation and famine.  I welcome the broad canvass which the Minister of State has adopted today.  It is important that this conference does not have a small and narrow agenda; it must have a wide agenda.  The western and the developed world must be prepared to dig deep because the problems of famine, malnutrition, ill health and disease are in no small way derived from policies which the developed world has operated in the past and continues to operate.</P>
    <P>I welcome elements of the comments made by Senator Lee.  It is clear that any policy on world population should not be the dictation of one culture to another, and I believe those who tabled the motion would agree with that.  Any world policy on population should not be determined by a culture which has been exploitative and destructive throughout much of the history of mankind.  Policy in this area must be informed by data which is not simply regurgitated chunks of somebody else's thinking or ideologies.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Lee in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have also read material circulated by <Col N="2224" /> the UN and to agencies on this area and I am less than happy with it.  I do not believe a lot of the material has been value free; one cannot be value free in this area.  All too often it seems the UN and its subsidiary agencies have an agenda other than that which is immediately apparent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate.  Although I would like to contribute to both parts of the motion because of time constraints, I will concentrate on the second part.  I also read the report <i>The Progress of Nations</i>, which I received this week from the Irish National Committee for UNICEF.  I accept what Senator Lee said, that it is in itself flawed, but I believe the report accepts that.</P>
      <P>I was taken by the introduction to the report which stated:</P>
      <P>The day will come when the progress of nations will be judged not by their military or economic strength, nor by the splendour of their capital cities and public buildings, but by the well-being of their peoples: by their levels of health, nutrition and education; by their opportunities to earn a fair reward for their labours; by their ability to participate in the decisions that affect their lives; by the respect that is shown for their civil and political liberties; by the provision that is made for those who are vulnerable and disadvantaged; and by the protection that is afforded to the growing minds and bodies of their children.</P>
      <P>These are sentiments which we would all endorse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report acknowledges that it is a flawed publication because it uses statistics to measure and compare national achievements in social developments.  It said these are based on available statistics but that they may not show the whole truth.  This may arise from the fact that the majority of countries produce economic data regularly, but few produce social statistics to show what percentage of their children are malnourished, suffer from preventable diseases or disabilities <Col N="2225" /> human progress.  The report said it is essential that social statistics should also become the stuff of political debate, media coverage and public concern.  I agree with that.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the Cairo conference will deal with population growth and other topics closely connected to it, including gender equality, the empowerment of women, population distribution, urbanisation, etc.  Gender equality and the empowerment of women are important.  If women participated at all levels of decision making throughout the world, we would have a different world.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he said population policies are essentially a national responsibility but that they deserve the support of the international community.  I welcome our support, however small, to the UN population fund.  Education and awareness are important in these areas.  One third of the world's population is under the age of 15.  If each new couple decides to have only two children, enormous population growth will still occur.  Because this is a country with a small population, which must be unique in that we now have less than half the population we had in the first half of the 19th century, our view on these matters can be coloured by our experience.  While we may believe there is no problem elsewhere, World Bank figures indicate that when the world population eventually stabilises, it will be more than double today's figure.  Almost all political leaders have agreed that family planning should be made available to all couples by the end of the century which is now less than six years away. Meeting that goal would bring immeasurable benefits to the lives of millions of women and children.</P>
    <P>I agree with those Senators who said that we should not be lecturing to the developing world.  As family planning methods are not freely available to women who are GMS patients in this country, we certainly are not in a position to lecture anybody.  Having said that, we should be able to articulate our opinion <Col N="2226" /> and support policies which we believe are right.</P>
    <P>At present less than 2 per cent of governmental spending in the developing world and less than 2 per cent of all international aid is devoted to family planning programmes.  The size of military budgets and the amount of money devoted to arms is frightening.  According to the report <i>The Progress of Nations</i>, which I accept can be flawed, an estimated 120 million people in the developing world do not want to have any more children but do not have access to modern methods of family planning.</P>
    <P>If family planning services become universally available, it is accepted that the standard indicators of well being which are health, nutrition, education and progress for women, would show substantial improvements.  Education is the key to everything and the availability and accessibility of information for women is of fundamental importance.  Recent studies in 35 countries have shown the importance of knowing where to go for family planning services.</P>
    <P>In countries where over one third of women give birth before the age of 18, only 50 per cent know of sources of family planning.  In countries where less than 10 per cent of women give birth before the age of 18 the average is almost 97 per cent.  The availability of family planning services is a great force for transforming the lives of women in the developing world.  The number of children born to a woman has a fundamental impact on her health, energy, opportunities and on the future health and welfare of her children.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Progress of Nations</i> Margaret Cately-Carlson mentions the benefits that could be expected if family planning was widely available.  These include:</P>
    <P>A 50 per cent decline in maternal deaths in the developing world if women who wish no further pregnancies had access to reliable methods of family planning.  Half a million young women die every year from causes related to pregnancy and birth <Col N="2227" />&mdash; more in India in a week than in Europe in an entire year.</P>
    <P>A 30 per cent decline in child deaths &mdash; since most deaths under the age of five are the deaths of children born within two years of a previous birth or to mothers under 18 or over 35.</P>
    <P>A new chance for young girls: very young mothers, under the age of 18, run three times the risk of death of mothers aged 20-29; very few of them are able to continue in school, or develop their potential.</P>
    <P>A whole new pattern of family investment....  When women and families can devote their energies and resources to their existing children and to themselves, family nutrition and child care improve, and women have more time and energy to improve their own situations.</P>
    <P>All of the indicators of well being would improve if women had access to family planning.  Given the commitment of the world's political leaders at the 1990 world conference on children, I call on this Government to make a strong commitment to the policies which will be the subject of discussion at the international conference on population development in Cairo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this issue which has aroused great interest in the Seanad to the point that we do not have enough time and that is why I am happy to share my time with Senator Daly.  The problems of the developing countries derive to a large extent from the inequity created by the developed countries in pursuing their own selfish priorities as distinct from the need for global justice and equity throughout the world.  The scandal of arms proliferation has long <Col N="2228" /> been a major issue in the international arena.</P>
      <P>The late distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs, Frank Aiken, devoted much of his time to making members of the United Nations aware of the scandal and to winning support for a strong and independent position, promoted by Ireland, against the spread of all arms, both nuclear and conventional.  The era in which he lived was one in which the threat of nuclear destruction was a real one and the support which he received for the control of the spread of nuclear weapons has been one of the most significant achievements in Irish foreign policy.</P>
      <P>With the collapse of international communism and the end of the Cold War which was a feature of the world order for over 40 years, the challenge today is the elimination of arms sales and supplies by the major powers, for their own profit, to warring factions in many of the developing countries throughout the world.  These conflicts are in many ways the consequences of an era of colonial domination of these developing countries.</P>
      <P>Tribal conflicts within areas that were designated as states or territories by the colonial powers have regrettably been a constant source of tension.  We were not satisfied just to create the problem by designating territorial areas which have nothing to do with natural tribal distinctions. We then decided to fuel the conflicts by supplying arms to these warring factions in the most unprincipled example of selfishness that this universe has witnessed.</P>
      <P>The Lomé convention was perhaps the only occasion on which former colonial powers entered into an era of co-operation. I was privileged to be one of three Irish Ministers for Foreign Affairs to be directly involved in that development between the European Community.  The colonial powers created the problems and then fuelled the consequences of conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship which we, as developed countries, now have with developing countries seems to focus on the profit which can be made from them, <Col N="2229" /> particularly in the supply of arms from our major armament industry in Europe and elsewhere.  These regional conflicts could not be sustained for any appreciable period were it not for the unprincipled and ruthless supply of armaments from the developing countries to the warring factions.</P>
    <P>The profit was and is made by the armaments industries in the powerful nations.  The price is still being paid today by the unfortunate people of the impoverished countries.  For that reason, it is essential that there be a new regime of control, penalty and sanction on nations supplying arms to these impoverished nations which fuel internecine conflict and human suffering on a scale that is a scandalous indictment of the profit motive of the powerful developed countries.</P>
    <P>This unprincipled profit motive has developed to a point that in some instances the same country is supplying different sides in these tribal conflicts. The world holds up its hands in horror at the consequences as if the problem derived from the regions of conflict themselves rather than from the greed and profit motive of those supplying the arms for their own narrow selfish purposes.</P>
    <P>Ireland can and must take a lead role in proposing the strictest control and sanctions for the rich and powerful nations who supply arms to emerging countries to feed the profit motive of their own powerful armaments industries.  Our voice must be constantly heard against the scandal, as it was in the time of Frank Aiken, until such time as such sanctions and penalties are imposed on those who feed off the tragedies of others.  The young people of this generation whether they be in Africa, Asia or Europe have a right at least to expect that the world order we pass on is one based on equity and justice and not on selfishness and profit.</P>
    <P>The international banking system which encourages numbered accounts and safe shelters for profit creamed off the suffering of unfortunate human beings oppressed by tyrants and dictators throughout the world must be controlled <Col N="2230" /> and regulated in the interest of world peace and justice.  As long as oppressors and tyrants can hide their ill-gotten gains in the safe vaults of the western banking system, we will not only be tolerating man's inhumanity to man, we will be actively encouraging it.</P>
    <P>There is an understandable tendency to examine population control in all its forms as a means of easing the poverty and suffering of those impoverished people.  I agree but I wish powerful nations had the same commitment to dismantling the barriers of international trade which have long since limited the opportunities for normal development in these poorer countries.  For instance the priority in the European Community for some time has been to maintain price levels as high as possible by limiting the supply of food and, in many cases, even reducing the capacity to supply much needed food to the starving people in the world.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to rationalise a global policy which restricts production for the sake of maintaining price levels while countless millions are dying from malnutrition, and starvation.  It must be possible for the international community of nations to find a better way of maintaining vital food supplies and, at the same time, ensuring an equity in the world order.  This issue must also be addressed by the UN.</P>
    <P>Enlightened family planning has a major part to play in this issue.  Of itself it cannot and will not deal with the problems of ill health and poverty in impoverished countries.  Sometimes the population control programmes even suggest abortion programmes to frustrate the normal function of the human condition in begetting and giving birth to the next generation of humanity.  What right does this generation have, exclusively of all of the generations that have peopled the earth in the ever changing evolution of humanity, to determine that, for the first time, the unborn should have their lives terminated before they too can realise their right to life with dignity?</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate these issues and I hope that the views <Col N="2231" /> expressed and the enlightened statements made by the Minister will be heard confidently and consistently no matter what embarrassment it may cause our associates in the EU or elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will have the opportunity to discuss this issue again in view of the forthcoming summit.  We will have representation there and, hopefully, the Minister of State will have an opportunity to report back on what transpires. I had the opportunity to be present at the Rio summit and I recently received a copy of the &ldquo;Agenda for Change&rdquo;&mdash; a plain language version of &ldquo;Agenda 21&rdquo;&mdash; which I would suggest is compulsory reading for those interested in this area.  It ought to be made available in schools and other educational institutions.</P>
      <P>We might differ about the statistics in these UN publications but they give a clear indication of the present state of affairs.  The world population in 1993 was about 5.5 billion; it is expected to be about 8 billion by 2020 and in the region of 10 billion by the year 2025.  Development strategies must be put in place to deal with that projected increase.  Development means alleviating poverty; securing livelihoods for people; ensuring that they have access to health care and a decent quality of life; improving the status of women; providing security of food supplies; and providing such essential services as water and sewerage; education and family welfare.  Development also means creating and maintaining employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these matters must be dealt with.  I agree fully with the Minister of State in saying that they have to be tackled effectively and that that can only be done in a concerted international way.  In the developing world, one person in three lacks safe drinking water and sanitation. The statistics are alarming; at least 15 million children a year die from preventable causes &mdash; acute infections and malnutrition.  As we all know, young people in particular are vulnerable to drug abuse.  Most women in developing <Col N="2232" /> countries lack the means to improve their health and face increasing levels of poverty.</P>
    <P>Even with the development of vaccines it is alarming that millions of people in the world today still suffer from diseases such as polio, cholera, TB, leprosy and malaria.  Many of these diseases are due to the lack of basic housing and water facilities.  I saw this at first hand when, as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, I had the opportunity to visit some of the under developed countries.  HIV is expected to infect 30 to 40 million people by the year 2000.  More and more people are crowding into our cities.  Urban development has outstripped society's capacity to deal with it.</P>
    <P>With the increase in urban populations, it is estimated that by the year 2000 half of the world's population will be living in cities, and that the growing quantities of garbage and sewage will increase four to five fold by the year 2020. These are alarming statistics.</P>
    <P>I do not have the time this evening to deal with the nuclear weapons issue but there is a danger of toxic waste and pollutants damaging our environment at a threatening and alarming pace.  There is no international policy to deal with some of these issues at present and the result will be that we will have further battles. The battles will not involve arms or nuclear weapons but will involve food as we have seen, tragically, in the case of Somalia.  This problem demands a huge international effort and certainly demands that we have more time at our disposal to discuss it further.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator O'Kennedy for giving me the opportunity to speak on the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senators Norris and Henry for tabling this motion.  Interestingly, we have heard a good deal of straight talking but we have also witnessed much side stepping and jigging and a certain inadequacy to address the issues directly.  Normally I am complimentary of the Minister because, generally, he does a good job and I had <Col N="2233" /> hoped that when he came to the House this evening we would have had a specific statement of policy in relation to the population conference in Cairo.  The Minister outlined the problems and the difficulties, and the responsibilities of the EU and the global community, but we have got nothing specific as to what the Irish position will be at this conference.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that in 1992 the Development Council of the EU adopted the basic principles which Ireland fully supports.  He went on to outline some of those principles, which are safe issues:</P>
      <P>Non-coercion and non-discrimination, the observance of the rights of individuals and couples to choose the number and the spacing of their children; the need to integrate population policies and development policies, and attention to be paid to the needs of individuals, families and the wider community.</P>
      <P>In his response I hope the Minister will outline specifically what proposals Ireland &mdash; on its own and not as part of the EU &mdash; will be putting forward at the conference in Cairo.  We are shilly-shallying on this issue because of the concern we have for our own political skins in our respective constituencies, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Catholic ethos on contraception and family planning.  The Minister goes on to say that last year, for the first time, Ireland contributed £50,000 to the UN population fund and that in 1994 our contribution will be £150,000, moneys which will go toward family planning and awareness and education programmes. I would like to know specifically if the Government is prepared to back family planning programmes that will promote artificial family planning methods or just natural family planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to know the specifics of what is proposed because it is not good enough to side step on this issue.  It is time we stopped being childish and politically sensitive about a basic issue that affects many people.  Many of us in this House will not reflect the realities of the majority of ordinary people.  It is fine for <Col N="2234" /> the Minister to come to the House and talk on these issues but what about the reality of access to and the availability of contraceptives in the Third World? People must first be educated in family planning matters but they must then have access to contraceptives.  I would like to hear the view the Department will express on that matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issues of arms and nuclear proliferation the Minister is more detailed and specific.  Politically he can afford to be; the issue is one about which Ireland can hold its head high.  We do not manufacture arms and we do not supply arms to the Third World.  Our record is clean so we can afford to take the moral high ground.  We are, however, shy and afraid to speak on the other fundamental issue.  Ireland should have a specific view and I hope the Minister will give it in his response to the various opinions that have been expressed.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 200 million landmines hidden across the Third World, in the areas of greatest poverty in underdeveloped countries.  While it takes $3-10 to buy a landmine, it takes $100-300 to remove it.  It is a matter of fundamental human rights and an issue that must be addressed.  The Minister raised it at EU level and other fora at which he spoke but it should be dealt with quickly.  The poorest people are afraid to till and do basic work on their own lands because they fear that they will never return or require the amputation of a limb.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me time to contribute.  There is much more I would like to say and I hope I will have an opportunity to do so in the future.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn produced an issue out of the hat regarding the presidency of the European Commission.  Perhaps I could dispose of it by telling the Senator that he must be under the mistaken impression that the Government has the right to produce a president of the Commission from a hat.  That is simply far from the truth.  No Irish name has the unanimous support of the European Union and I remind the House that this is required to become president of the European Commission.  In today's <i>Financial Times,</i> I note that the British have produced seven names as possible candidates for the position, but there is no Irish name among them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator appears to be an expert on everything.  A number of issues were raised to which I wish to refer before I deal with the population aspect of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris and others raised East Timor.  He is aware that I have had an active involvement and interest in this matter and the whole area of human rights.  The question of sanctions against <Col N="2236" /> Indonesia and arms supplies was raised. The Tánaiste told the House on April 20 that Ireland would not be in a position to introduce sanctions against Indonesia unilaterally.  He pointed out that it would be a matter for the United Nations under Chapter VII of the charter or the European Union under Article 228(A) of the Treaty to impose sanctions.  The House is no doubt aware that dialogue is currently taking place between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UN Secretary General.  We do not believe that there would be sufficient agreement within the United Nations and the EU to impose sanctions.</P>
    <P>However, I assure the House that the Tánaiste and I raise this issue at every possible opportunity, especially at EU level.  I raised it on a number of occasions with my Portuguese counterpart.  Concerns were also expressed when the Tánaiste addressed the House in April arising from the report that some EU member states were supplying arms to Indonesia.  He indicated at that time his intention to take up the matter with the Governments concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the embargo on Cuba, we felt the situation would be better addressed on a bilateral basis between Cuba and the United States, rather than as the subject of a public censure of a country with which we have close and important bilateral relations.  It is time for relations between Cuba and the US to improve.  We will examine any draft resolution put forward at the forthcoming UN General Assembly and decide our position in the light of circumstances.  A sense of balance must always be maintained. We are aware that the Cuban Government has made a number of economic reforms, but, in the political sphere, it maintains its monopoly of power. There are disturbing reports from Amnesty International on the continuing human rights abuses.  However, I appreciate the support for progress on this matter and I will monitor developments closely at the UN.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright and others raised the question of the extension of the nuclear non proliferation treaty next year.  As I <Col N="2237" /> indicated in my opening statement, the Government attaches great importance to this matter.  It favours an indefinite and unconditional extension of the treaty.  At the recent meeting of the European Council in Corfu, an EU joint action on preparation of the 1995 review and extension conference was agreed.  The Government strongly supported this move.  One of the priorities of our disarmament policy is to work for further strengthening of the non proliferation regime.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the subject of desertification.  This important issue was addressed by the United Nations' conference on environmental development in 1992.  Arising from that conference, international discussion has proceeded with a view to concluding an international convention to deal with the effect of desertification.  An agreement on the text of the convention was recently reached, which will be open for signature later this year.</P>
    <P>The debate on population was most helpful.  It was supportive in the main of the Government position and showed an understanding of a most complex issue. In relation to Senator Norris's preliminary comments, I reiterate the importance of the conference in meeting the challenge arising from the rapid growth in population, particularly in developing countries.  My speech is clear regarding the challenge facing us.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Henry's view on the need to improve the status of women in developing countries.  Women must be given access to training and education, which are crucial factors in ensuring equality.  As the Senator correctly pointed out, I was Minister of State for Women's Affairs on my first visit to Tanzania, to oversee our bilateral programme. As I said to many Oireachtas Members, I was greatly impressed by the emphasis on equality and the role of women in the developing world in the programme.  They are centrally involved in education, health and particularly agriculture. We place an emphasis on the promotion of the role of women in addressing many of the central areas. <Col N="2238" /> This is an important point and I support Senator Henry's views.</P>
    <P>In relation to family planning, I mentioned our contribution to UN FPA, which provides assistance on request in the field of population, including family planning, awareness and education. Senator Taylor-Quinn was the only Senator who perhaps was critical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have the specifics, Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I found a lack of understanding of the complexity of this issue. Many Senators pointed out the inter-linkage and interrelationship between population growth, poverty, to which Senators O'Kennedy and Lanigan referred, food supplies, water resources and the environment.  These matters are covered in my opening statement.  The facts are clear.  Most Senators understand the relationship between these complex issues.  I addressed the Seanad on that basis and I appreciate those Senators who recognised what I said.  As Senator Henry pointed out, the broader agenda includes gender equality, empowerment of women and health.  It has been an important debate and afforded me an opportunity to address the House.</P>
      <P>When I talked about the important role we play in the European Union I referred to the 1992 development council of the European Community adopting basic principles and implementing guidelines for population programmes.  The principles, which we support, are: non coercion and non discrimination; observance of the rights of individuals and couples to choose the numbers and spacing of their children; the need to integrate population policies and development policies; and attention to be paid to the needs of individuals, families and the wider community.  We contribute at many fora but it must be obvious that it is important for us to have an input within the European Union.  We have played our role there and I have outlined our position within that forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Seanad is better informed of our position prior to our participation <Col N="2239" /> in the Cairo conference.  I appreciate the understanding of our policy that has been expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his two contributions and to Senators for their participation.</P>
      <P>It is horrifying to realise that the three greatest arms suppliers to Indonesia are also the three greatest defaulters in contributing to the United Nations budget. They refuse to pay the bills for the peacekeeping forces provided so honourably by countries such as ours.</P>
      <P>I was reminded about the problem of landmines when I was in a doctor's office in New York a few weeks ago.  I speed read through an American Red Cross book &mdash; which I hope will become available here &mdash; on the subject.  It was horrifying material.  I can remember the argument but I cannot remember the exact figures.  However, I remember reading in it that 27 per cent of Italy's exports are arms.  The report also detailed the discovery that it is economically and strategically better to produce landmines that maim rather than kill because they represent such a drag on the population.  That is a revolting morality.  Even Sweden appears to be involved through the Nobel company. Imagine the irony of a group that produced the Nobel Foundation which awards prizes for peace also manufacturing these landmines.</P>
      <P>In less than 30 years the population of the planet will be five times what it was when the century began and 95 per cent of this growth is in developing countries. That is a problem.  It does not mean we will be patronising to these people. Nobody here has been patronising. However, it means that we must be careful. The population of the world was 2.5 billion in 1950, it was 5 billion in 1987 and will pass 6 billion by the end of the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred earlier to the article by Professor McNulty, professor of food and agricultural engineering at University College Dublin.  He started his article by saying that in 1984-85 people were <Col N="2240" /> shocked by the fact that there was a famine in Ethiopia while the granaries of Europe were full.  Everybody assumed it was possible to feed the world.  However, the professor began to realise that there was a serious imbalance between our capacity for food production and the enormous geometric increase in global population.  He makes a very sensitive plea to the Irish Government on the question of world population.</P>
    <P>The international conference on population and development which will be held in Cairo from 5 to 13 September was set up under the ECOSOC resolution 1989/1991 in 1989.  In 1974 at the world population conference many of the underdeveloped or developing countries believed that development was the best contraceptive.  However, by the next conference in 1984 these developing countries, which we were urged not to patronise, had come to the conclusion that family planning programmes to support and improve maternal and child health and reduce population growth were essential.  The conference in Cairo represents the next step in this process. That is why it is so important.  People from developing countries as well as those from developed countries recognise that the process of sustainable development is made much more difficult, if not impossible, by the high rates of population growth which prevail when family planning services are not widely available.</P>
    <P>Nobody disputes the fact that people born in the west do far more ecological damage because of their high consumption. However, that does not mean that we can idly sit by and encourage people in developing countries to put themselves under threat of famine.  We know there will be famine.  I ask those people who quote slogans &mdash; what will they feed people in developing countries with?  Will they feed them with editorials from the <i>Sunday Business Post?</i></P>
    <P>There were three preparatory conferences before the Cairo conference. The most important was PrepCom III to agree the final ICPD document.  The draft document was the result of input <Col N="2241" /> by experts, governments and a series of United Nations meetings.  After protracted negotiation the vast majority of countries supported and approved the document, while a few countries headed by the Vatican which has member state status in the UN &mdash; I do not think it is entitled to that status &mdash; did not agree on certain definitions.  Consensus could not be reached on several areas including sexual and reproductive health, family planning, fertility regulation, safe motherhood, elimination of unsafe abortion and the reproductive and sexual health needs of adolescents.  Considering the Vatican's record in these areas any international body that took heed of the position of that unrepresentative and undemocratic group would be very foolish. I make no apology for saying that it is right and appropriate that an international body should look for the elimination of unsafe abortion.  What does the Vatican want?  Unsafe backstreet abortion to punish people?  We had that in this country and we do not need it any more.</P>
    <P>There has been consistent lobbying at a high level by the Vatican and it has been able to influence the positions of some members countries, particularly Latin American countries such as Guatemala, Ecuador, Argentina, Honduras and Benin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of our obligation under the Wildlife Act of 1976 to conserve wildlife, there is a need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to consider providing the necessary funding for the reintroduction of game and habitat development grants.  I thank the Minister for attending and I ask him and the Department to look at the possibility of reintroducing these grants or perhaps a new scheme to replace the one which was discontinued in 1983.  The scheme applied to the planting of trees, the creation of ponds, the preservation of existing habitats, release programmes for game birds such as mallard and grey <Col N="2243" /> partridge, the purchase of habitats which may possess special potential for conservation and other related matters.</P>
      <P>In the past the grant system was operated through regional game councils which have approximately 22,000 members throughout the country.  They contribute some £600,000 to the Exchequer through firearms certificates and spend considerable sums of money breeding game birds, rehabilitating and developing woodlands and spinneys, controlling predators, etc.</P>
      <P>While the councils are primarily concerned with ensuring a good stock of game birds such as mallards, pheasants and partridge, there is considerable benefit to the general rural environment.  The presence of woodland, copses, ponds and bird life adds to the visual attraction of the countryside and the environment.  An environment suited to game birds will also attract a wide variety of other species, from the more common such as thrushes, sparrows, wrens and finches to the less common such as barn owls, nightjars and redwings.  Hundreds of insect species also thrive in these environments.</P>
      <P>It is beneficial to the countryside that money is available for the development of these habitats.  It is not only of benefit to people involved in regional game councils but to the population of the countryside as a whole.</P>
      <P>About two weeks ago, while still Mayor of Limerick, I helped release mallards into a wetland area close to the heart of Limerick city called Westfields. It is being preserved as part of Limerick Corporation's overall planning in that area.  A new bridge across the Shannon was built there some years ago, and a new link road connecting the west &mdash; Galway, Ennis and Shannon &mdash; with the Kerry and Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wildlife preserve is beside that road and urban people have an opportunity to appreciate wildlife in its natural habitat, since it is a stone's throw from that busy road and a ten minute walk from the city centre.  The mallard we released were bred by members of a local gun club at their own expense.  They seemed to settle nicely into their new environment, although one tried to walk <Col N="2244" /> towards the road but turned back.  The experts present said the ducks would keep away from the road and stay in the water to find the habitat suited to them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to convey to his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the need to make grants available again for this purpose. They were in force up to 1983 and then discontinued.  There is a good case for reintroducing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Sullivan in her quest for additional funding and activity by the Department to develop wildlife in our countryside. We are in a unique position now because the new concept of setaside means that a substantial amount of our good land is, unfortunately and regrettably, left idle and farmers are paid for this.  Extensification grants provide that farmers are paid to cut down production, which also leaves more land available for the development of wildlife.</P>
      <P>This may help to restore some of the game birds which previously thrived in these conditions but which have become extinct because of extra fertilisation and over stocking.  The REPS scheme was recently announced by the Department and will also help create an environment for the development of wildlife throughout the country.  It is, therefore, a pleasure to support the motion tabled by Senator O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>In my part of the country, the corncrake is fast becoming extinct because of farming developments over the last 20 years, such as the early cutting of silage. The corncrake did survive in the Shannon valley but because of the heavy flooding last year, many of the nests were wiped out.  The partridge was also common in south Roscommon when I was young but is not seen any more.  Grouse, woodcock and mallards have also declined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much work is necessary to restore those birds and rehabilitate the wildlife eliminated because of farming practices. Farmers were encouraged to increase production and develop their farms and much wildlife has been wiped out as a result.  The setaside, extensification and REPS schemes give an opportunity to rehabilitate rural Ireland and create an <Col N="2245" /> environment where the birds can be reintroduced and regarded as a protected species until their numbers grow.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, asked me to express his regret at his inability to be present to respond to Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Naughten.  I will read the following statement on his behalf and as someone who served as Minister of State in this area for some months I am pleased to do so.</P>
      <P>I understand the grants referred to by the Senator were first introduced in 1961 and withdrawn in 1983 because they were not effective in achieving their objective of maintaining game stocks and ensuring their survival.  Since assuming responsibility for the formulation of policy for heritage, including wildlife, the Minister's first priority has been to put in place the necessary structures and legislation to protect our heritage.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council Bill, 1994, was recently published and will be receiving its Second Reading in this House tomorrow. That will provide for the establishment of a statutory corporation with functions to advise on all aspects of heritage, as well as having powers to cooperate with and provide assistance to any person or group in respect of proposals in the interests of our heritage.</P>
      <P>The council will have a standing committee on wildlife, I will be looking to that committee to consider in depth what is required to protect our habitats and to come forward with ideas of how this objective can best be achieved.  It is intended that any support measures will form part of an integrated programme and will not be dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Heritage Council Bill, 1994, is part of a package of legislative proposals the Minister is bringing before the Oireachtas.  Last week there was an interesting Report Stage debate in this House on the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1993.  Apart from the Heritage Council Bill, the Department is working on a number of other measures, including a Bill on the National Museum <Col N="2246" /> and National Library, an amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976, and a Bill on parks and heritage areas.</P>
    <P>What Senator O'Sullivan is trying to achieve is broadly in line with the Minister's objectives.  The Minister hopes she may acknowledge the wisdom of approaching the protection of our heritage in the structured and orderly way he is adopting.</P>

      <P>Health boards have experienced major difficulties in providing funding for nursing homes as required under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  My motion calls on the Minister for Health to provide adequate funding to health boards to meet their commitments under the Act. The nub of the problem as that the Minister and the Department have failed to treat the scheme as demand led.</P>
      <P>The scheme was introduced in November 1993 by the Minister but the Government failed to provide funding for it.  There is little point introducing a scheme and not funding it because that merely misleads the public and those who provide the services for older or underprivileged people who need nursing home facilities.  The Western Health Board area received £424,000 for this scheme in 1994.  The estimated cost of the scheme to the health board this year is £1.49 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, is not here.  There is little point in tabling and discussing motions in this House when the Minister responsible fails to attend.  It is a slight on this House. I understand those points were made earlier today, but I reiterate them.  The Seanad must examine this situation where Ministers can ignore motions relevant to their Departments.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt, who is here tonight.  However, I want answers from the Minister for Health.  I want to know what he is prepared <Col N="2247" /> to do to meet his obligations under this Act.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with elderly people in nursing homes, some of whom went in on the clear understanding, as a result of a press release, that they would qualify for funding from the Department of Health.  However, the nursing homes are not receiving that funding.  As a result, these people and their relatives are concerned about their future.  I know people in those homes who do not know when they will be told to leave because the health board is not able to meet the bills due to lack of funding.  Relatives are concerned because they do not know when they will get a telephone call asking them to remove their loved one from those nursing homes to other accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that the Minister and the Government should introduce a scheme without providing funding for it.  There is no point in the Minister saying there was a miscalculation.  Anyone could have told him that.  When the Bill was going through the Houses in 1990, I said that its one flaw was that it did not provide for funding.  The chickens are now coming home to roost.  The Minister has no alternative but to provide funding for this scheme, which must be treated as a demand led scheme.  There is no point in the Minister telling a health board that he will give it only a certain amount of money under one heading.  Every £100,000 given to health boards is earmarked for a project and the chief executive officers cannot borrow money except within defined limits laid down under section 30 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister has ignored this weaker section of the community and left it in limbo, so that people do not know how long they will be kept in nursing homes.  Every nursing home in the west is experiencing extreme difficulties.  Some 42 nursing homes are owed £66,000 for the month of April. The May bills have also not been paid because of a lack of funding from the Minister for Health and the Government. This must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>As Senator Finneran knows, the Western Health Board applied years ago for homes for the aged in Strokestown, Roscommon <Col N="2248" /> and Ballinasloe.  However, they have not been funded by the Department of Health.  Counties Mayo and Galway were more lucky because those areas were given a number of homes for the aged.  In the absence of homes for the aged, we have no option but to provide assistance under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, for people who cannot get into those homes.  The Western Health Board applied for homes in these three towns, but it has not received funding for them.  If it had, it would not be in the difficult situation it is in today.</P>
    <P>In the Second Stage debate on the Health (Nursing Homes) Bill, which took place on Thursday, 9 November 1989, Deputy Howlin said to the Minister for Health that:</P>
    <P>The Minister has, by his policy, deprived health boards of adequate resources and the consequence of that has been that in every health board region geriatric and district hospitals have been closed and the number of public beds available to the elderly has diminished year after year.</P>
    <P>This has not changed.  The Minister is obliged to provide funding to the health boards under this Act.  There is no point in the Minister telling the health boards that he has given them some money, but they must get more from savings.  That is unacceptable.  I call on the Minister to make the necessary funds available to all the health boards so that they can meet their obligations and to treat this as a demand led scheme.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Naughten for allowing me to share his time to make a few brief comments on the crisis in the implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  I congratulate Senator Naughten on his appointment as chairman of the Western Health Board and wish him well during his term of office.  He is a long serving and diligent member of the Western Health Board.  I have no doubt he will do a good job as chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, was aspirational.  I spoke about that in this House at the time.  One is on shaky ground in introducing an Act without <Col N="2249" /> knowing the costs for a year.  If an Act provided for any person to become a patient of a private nursing home and to apply to the relevant health board for subvention, and the means test was positive, the health board would be obliged to make a subvention.  That aspiration would have the support of public representatives, the Houses of the Oireachtas or local councils throughout in the world.  However, such legislation also creates problems for any Government or Minister.  An extension of the prescribed relatives allowance and the carer's allowance or a variation of those two allowances would have been more helpful than introducing legislation to cover private hospitalisation of elderly people who needed full time care.  The provision of extra beds in homes for the aged could also have been an answer.</P>
    <P>The 1990 legislation is now being implemented by the health boards. However, its costs are handed back to the Department of Health, which may not have realised the full cost of the legislation. Any open ended legislation will create complications such as those in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. However, we have a responsibility to implement this legislation.</P>
    <P>Many families, especially those who have already got places in nursing homes for their elderly relatives, have experienced trauma as a result of the non-implementation of the Act.  Many of them are now at crisis point and a direct response is necessary.  I ask the Minister immediately to honour the bills that have been sent to the health board.  Otherwise we will put the people who run the nursing homes out of business because they are running on a pretty tight schedule as they are.  We are also causing terrible problems for families who have got a place for their relatives.  We cannot allow that to happen.  This is too serious a matter to allow it to continue.  If some review is needed in the future, so be it, but the Minister should act now on the outstanding bills.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I call on the Minister tonight to honour the invoices that are sent from the Western Health Board in particular.  If there are problems with the Act or its implementation let us discuss <Col N="2250" /> them, but let us deal with the present problems and take that worry away from the families and the nursing home owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Naughten and Senator Finneran for speaking on this issue.  We are all from the west here, including you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach. I am anxious to reply to the points made on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who unfortunately could not be here this evening.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which the Minister for Health was pleased to bring into effect on 1 September 1993, has two principal objectives. First, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act and, second, to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.</P>
      <P>A person applying for a subvention is assessed on his or her level of dependency and means to determine whether he or she qualifies for a subvention.  The dependency of the person is assessed to establish whether the person applying for subvention needs nursing home care and if so, the level of care required.  There are three maximum rates of subvention payable in accordance with the three levels of dependency which are eligible for subvention.</P>
      <P>If an individual falls within these levels of dependency, a means test is then applied to determine whether the person qualifies for a subvention payment.  The assessment of means takes into account the income of the person and the value of his or her assets in determining how much the person can contribute towards the cost of nursing care.  Based on the assessment of the person's dependency and means, a health board determines whether the person qualifies for a subvention payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum subvention rates payable under the new scheme are £70, £95 or £120 per week depending on the level of dependency of the person applying for a subvention.  These rates represent a <Col N="2251" /> substantial contribution towards the costs of care in a nursing home and are a major improvement on the situation which existed prior to the implementation of the nursing homes Act when most persons in nursing homes were receiving no subvention. The implementation of the Act is an important step in honouring the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>A total of £9 million has so far been made available for the implementation of the nursing homes Act.  Funding was allocated to health boards on the basis of the size of the nursing home sector and expected demand under the new subvention scheme.  It would appear that demand in the Western Health Board area for nursing home subvention has been higher then expected.  Discussions have taken place between officials of the Department of Health and the Western Health Board to establish the extent of the problems facing the board.  The Department of Health is monitoring the situation closely.  Senators can be assured that the board will continue to meet its statutory obligations under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has been in contact with the health boards to establish the extent to which the boards are up to date in payments due in respect of subvention approved under the Act.  All of the health boards with the exception of the Western Health Board have paid invoices for subvention from nursing home proprietors up to 31 May, with the exception of some homes which have yet to provide tax clearance certificates or who are having difficulties with registration. In the case of the Western Health Board, arrangements are being made to have all outstanding invoices cleared as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the operation of the Act must be consistent with the health strategy.  The elderly should for as long as possible be maintained in dignity and independence in their own homes.  The health boards' primary obligation is to support individuals and families in achieving this very desirable objective. <Col N="2252" /> The scheme is not designed to encourage institutional care as a first option.  It is designed to help those whose level of dependency cannot be accommodated other than in a nursing home or similar facility.  It would be regrettable if the Act were to achieve an outcome other than that which was intended.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is aware that the Health (Nursing Homes) Act will not be implemented without a few problems arising.  I very much appreciate what the Senators have said with regard to the Act and the early stages of implementing it. The Department of Health set up an implementation group which includes representatives of the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association as well as members of the Federation of Catholic Voluntary Nursing Homes, the National Council for the Elderly, the health boards and officials of the Department.  The purpose of the group is to highlight problems at an early stage and to resolve them in a way which meets the concerns of all parties.  The group has met on over eight occasions and has reported good progress in all areas of implementation.</P>
    <P>Private and voluntary nursing homes fulfil an important role in providing high quality care for our dependent elderly population.  The nursing homes Act is strengthening the bonds of partnership between public health services and private nursing homes so that they can provide the best care and facilities for the elderly who need residential care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked whether adequate funding would be provided for this scheme and whether it would be treated as a demand led scheme.  Regrettably the reply does not answer that.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State present, I know he is reading a prepared reply.  We spoke about this issue this morning.  Someone from the Department of Health who would be able to answer that question should be here. I regret very much that the question is not answered.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 July 1994.</P>
