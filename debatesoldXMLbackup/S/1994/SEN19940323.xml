      <P>I have notice from Senator Naughten that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the total amount of moneys owing to farmers for 1993 under the following headings: ewe subsidy, headage payments, suckler cow scheme, beef premium, extensification grants and the equine payment scheme for the horse industry; and to further outline the reason for the totally unacceptable delay in payments and when payment will be made.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> I ask the Leader to make time available today, even at the end of business, to discuss the events at Ballinderry Hospital, near Mullingar.  All Members would agree it is outrageous that an Irish bank should have equipment seized less than a month before a Supreme Court case is to be heard, which could reverse the entire situation.  It is outrageous that the VHI, a State body, has abused its dominant position to bring things to this stage.  Both ACC and VHI have a case to answer, a case which they have refused to answer up to now.  Their action has outraged the Irish public and this House in a manner that has not happened for a long time.  I ask the Leader to make time available today.  Otherwise, I will seek to raise the matter under Standing Order 29.  However, I suspect the Leader wishes to have time made available for it to be discussed by all Members today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call to discuss this matter.  It is extraordinary that a hospital should have vital equipment removed from it.  The matter is <i>sub judice</i> at the moment and to date the hospital appears to be winning.</P>

      <P>I give my total support to the call to discuss the hospital at Ballinderry. This has caused great shock to the people in Mullingar.  The hospital has been a major employer in the town over the years and it has made a magnificent contribution to the medi-care system in the Midlands, as the Cathaoirleach is aware.  The nuns do excellent work there. I support the call for a debate as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I endorse the last point. Yesterday, we spoke of world sporting events and lady riders are often number one in this field.  I am sure Senator Henry will be pleased about that.  Bringing the World Equestrian Games to Ireland will be great for the country and is a fantastic achievement for all concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue raised by Senator Manning &mdash; the hospital in Mullingar &mdash; I will raise that concern.  There is legal action pending and the matter may be <i>sub judice.</i>  I will advise Senators on this aspect of the matter during the day.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual Social Welfare Bill <Col N="1468" /> is the most important piece of legislation to be debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas each year.  The measures in the Bill affect 822,000 social welfare recipients and their 627,000 dependants, accounting for over 40 per cent of the entire population.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill before the Seanad today is to give legal effect to the increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget and to provide for other improvements to strengthen the social welfare code for families, workers, carers, lone parents and others who rely on social welfare.  The total cost of these improvements in a full year is £168 million.</P>
      <P>I introduced an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage in the other House to provide a legal basis for my Department to enter into contracts and joint ventures with various bodies for the provision of skills, including technical skills, and services overseas.  This new provision is contained in section 33 of the Bill as amended by the Select Committee on Social Affairs.</P>
      <P>The various skills which have been developed within my Department have resulted in numerous approaches from public and private organisations overseas seeking support on a consultancy basis. Over the past number of years, many groups from all over the world have visited Ireland to study how my Department operates.  In the past month alone delegations from Poland, Russia and Slovakia have been here and a group from the Republic of Albania is scheduled to visit within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In what I hope will set a new trend for Government Departments, my Department is to use our social welfare business expertise on a commercial basis.  This is a new and exciting venture in public administration.  With the opening up of eastern European countries many opportunities are presenting themselves.  My Department is well positioned to maximise these opportunities in the development of new markets, which is an essential component of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  This new role reflects the Government's determination <Col N="1469" /> to develop joint ventures between public and private sectors and to create commercial units within Departments which will develop and market the considerable expertise within the Civil Service, thereby bringing returns to the taxpayer in terms of business opportunities and jobs for young people.</P>
    <P>For example, my Department is currently working with the Digital Equipment Corporation, our main computer supplier, to identify opportunities for marketing specialist products and services from Ireland to social welfare authorities in other countries.  A number of approaches have been made from interested parties and these are being pursued.  In addition, my Department is in discussion with European Union officials with a view to providing social welfare expertise for the emerging states.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised within the EU and the developing states that we have a considerable expertise in the social security area.  The challenge is to translate that high level of expertise into the creation of skilled jobs for Irish people while at the same time assisting these developing countries to make the successful transition to a modern European state.</P>
    <P>I now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Sections 3 and 4 provide for increases in the weekly rates of social insurance and social assistance payments with effect form July 1994.  Those increases will more than maintain the real value of social welfare payments given the anticipated rate of inflation over the next year.  The increases will give an extra 10 per cent for 112,000 people getting disability benefit or unemployment benefit, an extra 6 per cent for 185,000 people on the lowest payments such as unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance which will bring those rates up to the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and an extra 3 per cent for over 822,000 people and their 627,000 dependants, including pensioners, widows and lone parents.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also provides for an extra increase for some 1,100 invalidity pensioners <Col N="1470" /> who have attained 66 years of age.  From July 1994, they will have their weekly pension boosted by an extra £10.20 a week for a single person, bringing to £71 the new weekly payment.  A married couple currently getting £100.90 will receive £112.30, an increase of £11.40 a week.  This is a significant improvement for those who are among the most vulnerable in our society and is in line with the recommendation of the National Pensions Board.  This is an extra measure, introduced since the budget and it will be especially welcomed by invalidity pensioners who have passed the age of 66 years.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives an increase in child benefit for 270,000 children.  It provides for an increase from £20 to £25 in the monthly rate for the third child and from £23 to £25 for subsequent children.  These new rates will come into payment from the first Tuesday in September 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for further improvements in the rates of family income supplement. This supplement, more than ever, is giving much needed support to workers trying to bring up families on low pay.  Take-up under the scheme has shown a dramatic increase of almost 25 per cent on this time last year.  There are now 9,600 families getting family income supplement and over 30,000 children benefiting from this payment.  It is clear that the substantial improvements brought into effect last year are now having an impact on take-up under the scheme.  We made a special effort last year to improve the situation and this has been reflected in the increased take-up.</P>
    <P>The weekly income thresholds below which families can qualify for family income supplement are being increased by £10 at each threshold point.  The effect of this is to give family income supplement recipients an additional £6 per week in their weekly payment from July 1994 as will as bringing extra families into eligibility for the payment.</P>
    <P>As a special contribution towards job maintenance and the creation of extra employment, we are introducing a package of measures to support jobs in hard pressed labour intensive sectors, such as <Col N="1471" /> clothing manufacturing and footwear and services, and to help those at work on low pay.  These measures include PRSI reliefs for employers and levy exemptions which will amount to a cash injection of some £89 million in support for jobs in labour intensive sectors.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 to 10 provide for a number of important PRSI restructuring measures which will being about significant changes in PRSI contributions and income levies directed at supporting jobs in labour intensive industries and those at work on low pay.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the PRSI package are, first, a reduced rate of employer's PRSI contribution of 9 per cent, down from 12.2 per cent, which will apply across all sectors of employment where the employee earns £173 or less a week &mdash; the cost of this concession is about £31 million this year.  In order to offset some of this cost, the contribution ceiling on the employer's contribution has been raised to £25,800 instead of £22,200.  This will contribute an estimated £3 million this year bringing the net cost of these PRSI changes to £28 million in 1994.  The full year investment in this concession is £46 million.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a new employer's PRSI exemption scheme will operate on a similar basis to the successful 1993-94 scheme which generated some 3,770 jobs over the past two years.  Under the new scheme, employers who take on additional employees from the live register between 6 April 1994 and 5 April 1995 will not have to pay the employer's share of PRSI contributions in respect of those employees during the two year period 6 April 1994 to 5 April 1996, provided the employees concerned represent a net increase in the number of employees in their employment over that applying on 21 February 1994.  The value of this concession to an employer is considerable; it can be worth £1,268 a year in respect of a new employee with earnings of £200 per week.</P>
    <P>The health contribution and the employment and training levy for low paid workers will be waived.  Up to now <Col N="1472" /> they have been responsible for paying these levies on behalf of employees who are medical card holders.  These levies amount to 2.25 per cent resulting in an employer's PRSI contribution of 14.45 per cent in some cases.  It is estimated that 100,000 workers have medical cards so the measure will represent a significant benefit &mdash; up to £200 per employee &mdash; for their employers.  This move will not only reduce PRSI costs but will also simplify administration of the system for all 125,000 employers.  This measure is in line with the advice of the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems in its interim report delivered before Christmas 1993. The waiving of these levies, provided for in sections 34 and 35 of the Bill, is not confined to people with medical cards, but it will also provide a boost to the take home pay of all lower paid employees and self-employed people who do not have medical cards.  From 6 April 1994, employees who earn £173 or less per week and self-employed people whose annual income is £9,000 or less will no longer be liable to pay the 2.25 per cent levies.</P>
    <P>I will keep the possibility of further concessions on PRSI under review.  The current sound financial state of the social insurance fund is one of the factors which has allowed me to make the present concession. This is in part due to the continued success of our efforts to reduce black economy working.  The value of these activities is clear in that they improve receipts to the fund and they allow rates for the legitimate economy to be set at the lowest possible level.  Having regard to the primary objective of the Social Insurance Fund, which is to provide pensions and benefits for workers, I hope to continue down the road of shaping the PRSI system so as to encourage employment.</P>
    <P>The legislative basis for the introduction of the new survivors pension scheme is contained in sections 11 and 14 of the Bill.  For the first time in the history of the State we are introducing a contributory pension for widowers which will put widows and widowers on equal terms <Col N="1473" /> in relation to survivor's pension provision. This new pension is a huge breakthrough in the development of our social insurance system and it puts Ireland foremost among our European Union counterparts in providing equal treatment for men and women who become widowed.</P>
    <P>Over 9,000 widowed men and their families will benefit for the first time under the new arrangements which will come into effect from next October. Under those arrangements, men and women who are widowed will be able to qualify for a contributory pension on the same basis on their own behalf or their late spouse's PRSI record and subject to the same contribution conditions.  The cost of the new survivor's pension is about £6 million this year and up to £27 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>There are currently over 85,500 widows receiving a contributory pension at an annual cost of £2 million.  I want to make it clear that their situation will not be changed in any way by the introduction of this new &ldquo;equal treatment&rdquo; measure.  This progressive move is a practical recognition of our changing family structure.  Given our young population increasingly both spouses are participating in the workforce.  In these circumstances, a surviving spouse &mdash; whether a woman or a man &mdash; with the responsibility of a young family is clearly in need of income support.</P>
    <P>Sections 15, 16, 18 and 30 provide for improvements to the means tests for social assistance schemes.  Section 15 deals with improvements in the lone parent's allowance in the case of lone parents with income from employment or self-employment. The current earning disregard of £6 for each child is being replaced by a flat rate disregard which will be prescribed in regulations.  The new disregard will be set at £30 a week, inclusive of the initial means disregard of £6. In addition, where earnings exceed the new disregards, the amount of lone parent's allowance payable will be reduced by £1 for each £2 earned, instead of the current £1 for £1 arrangement.  These improvements in the means test will <Col N="1474" /> mean that a lone parent with one child earning £80 per week will be better off in their lone parent's allowance to the extent of £18.90 a week.  The changes will come into effect from 21 July 1994.  This is an important development.  Senators will note that a lone parent will be able to earn £2 and be reduced by only £1 or £30 and be reduced by only £15.  This is a major change in the system and, in conjunction with the new £30 per week disregard, it will encourage lone parents to join the workforce.  This provision will be welcomed by them.</P>
    <P>Section 16 improves the existing provisions for the assessment of means for carer's allowance in the case of a carer where the spouse is in employment or self-employment.  For the first time, a prescribed amount of earnings will be disregarded in the assessment of means. The earnings disregard will be set at £100 a week.  This section also increases the initial means disregard from £2 to £6. These improvements will come into effect from 28 July 1994 and will ensure that an additional 500 carers will get the allowance for the first time and a further 350 existing carers will get increases in their weekly payments.  For example, a full-time carer with a spouse earning £160 a week, who would not previously have been entitled to any payment, will now receive a weekly carer's allowane of £34.</P>
    <P>Section 18 introduces a number of improvements to the current arrangements for the assessments of means for the purpose of various social assistance schemes.  These include disregarding of the maintenance element of higher education grants for the purpose of the third level allowance scheme; disregarding mobility allowances or rehabilitation training allowances for all social assistance payments; exempting child benefit payments received from another EU member state; extending the exemption of home help income so as to include employment by an agency approved by a health board; and taking regulatory powers to exempt income derived from prescribed activities.  What I have in mind here is exempting certain traditional <Col N="1475" /> activities such as seaweed collection along the western seaboard.  This is important because a major factory is located in that area and there is a possibility of building a second one.  The income from the collection of seaweed is taken into consideration.  This gives me the regulatory power to exempt income from certain prescribed activities.</P>
    <P>Section 30 brings the provisions for the rounding of means in the case of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme into line with those applying to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for changes in the maternity benefit scheme arising from recent developments here and abroad. Maternity benefit will now be payable in the case of a still-birth after 24 weeks of the pregnancy; the current duration is 28 weeks.  In addition, this section provides that the rate of maternity benefit payable may not be less than the rate of disability benefit which the claimant would have received if entitled to it.  This brings Ireland into line with EC Directive 92/85 on the protection of pregnant workers.</P>
    <P>Section 19 will exempt people engaged in casual employment from the condition of having to have sustained a substantial loss of employment before qualifying for unemployment benefit.  The precise definition of casual employment for the purposes of the exemption will be set out in regulations which I propose to make as soon as the Bill is enacted.  This section also provides for improved arrangements governing the linking of claims for unemployment benefit.  Senators will be aware of my commitment to review this matter as one of the issues remaining from the measures introduced in 1992.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for the discontinuance of pay-related benefit payable with unemployment benefit in the case of any new claim made after 20 July 1994 and also increases the weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the weekly rate of pay-related benefit from £80 to £97.50.</P>
    <P>The personal rates of disability benefit and unemployment benefit have been <Col N="1476" /> singled out this year for an overall increase of 10 per cent, or £5.40 a week, which puts them on a par with the new long term rate of unemployment assistance, which is £61.00 a week.  This special additional increase in the basic personal rates arises from the decision of the Government to discontinue pay-related benefit payable with unemployment benefit in the case of new claims with effect from next April.  The savings from that measure are being devoted in full towards this special increase which will also apply to disability benefit from which pay-related benefit was discontinued in 1992. I should mention that, in addition to utilising the available savings, this special additional increase will cost £2.7 million this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a saving of approximately £21 million but this is being ploughed back into the basic rates. I always said this should happen when pay-related benefit finally went.  The report of the Commission on Social Welfare recommended the phasing out of pay-related benefit over time, and it has been reduced consistently over time.  At this stage the balance is being removed but is being used to pay increases in basic rates, hence the 10 per cent increase in unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  To provide for this increase, £2.7 million this year will be required in addition to the savings of approximately £21 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 20 allows injury benefit and unemployability supplement, payable under the occupational injuries benefit scheme, to be integrated with disability benefit.  No one will lose out on their entitlements as a result.  People who would have qualified for injury benefit or unemployability supplement arising from an occupational accident or disease will instead be entitled to disability benefit. In their case, the normal contribution conditions for disability benefit will not apply and their rate of payment will be at the full rate in all cases.  This integration <Col N="1477" /> measure will result in significant streamlining and easier administration.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for an increase from £5 to £10 in the minimum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to single people whose means are assessed under the benefit and privilege rules.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for an increase to be paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in respect of a person aged 18 or over for a period of three months after completing or leaving second level education.</P>
    <P>Sections 24 and 25 give power to the Minister to make regulations to enable participants in special schemes for the unemployed or &ldquo;second chance education&rdquo; initiatives to retain secondary benefit entitlements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, such as rent or mortgage interest supplements. The retention of secondary benefits has proved an important factor in encouraging long term unemployed people to participate in schemes of that nature.</P>
    <P>Section 26 gives legislative effect across all social welfare schemes to the six weeks after death payment of the adult dependant allowance, where appropriate.  This is a substantial expansion of this payment and I am sure it will be welcomed by Senators.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides that the limit imposed on couples, one of whom is in receipt of a pre-retirement allowance and the other in receipt of another single welfare payment, will not apply to those in receipt of the pre-retirement allowance on 2 April 1993, when the limiting arrangements came into force.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 extend to contractors and subcontractors a number of existing provisions relating to the production of records for inspection by social welfare inspectors and the liability in certain circumstances to repay social welfare payments irregularly received by their employees.  Section 28 also gives statutory authority to social welfare inspectors to investigate claims made by people resident in this country who are seeking payments from another EU member state, provided the other member state has <Col N="1478" /> requested the investigation.  The same arrangements will apply in relation to countries with which Ireland has concluded a bilateral social security agreement. It facilitates countries with whom we have such agreements if our inspectors can inquire about conditions or circumstances relating to clients of theirs and it saves them considerable administrative costs.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for regulatory powers under which entitlement to certain occupational injuries benefits may be extended to categories of workers not covered at present for those benefits.  It is my intention to use the regulatory powers in this section to extend occupational injuries benefits to workers the nature of whose work may require them to become subcontractors and thereby insured for PRSI pensions only, rather than remain as workers insured for the full range of social insurance benefits. Changes in working arrangements in the construction industry will receive particular attention.  Over recent years the status of many workers, such as carpenters and others, has been changed from that of employee to contractor or subcontractor.  This puts them into the self employed category as far as social welfare is concerned.  They have limited cover for widows and orphans and other pensions.  They are not covered for occupational injuries.  This is a bad arrangement for people working on sites.  I want to make arrangements to cover them and to have the power by regulation to look at other areas where this is a particular difficulty.  This will be done after the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for a number of consequential amendments to the 1993 Consolidation Act arising from the introduction of a standard rate of child dependant increases from July 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 33 provides a legal basis for my Department to enter into contracts and joint ventures with various bodies for the provision of technical skills and services overseas as I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 and 35 provide for consequential amendments to the Health Contributions Act, 1979, and the Youth <Col N="1479" /> Employment Agency Act, 1981, arising from the PRSI restructuring referred to above.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to bring some further developments to the attention of Senators.  The amount of £45 per week which is deducted from the earnings of a working spouse is designed to cover the expenses associated with being at work.  An additional amount of about £10 per week may also be allowed for travelling expenses.  The £45 disregard recognises the fact that the household does not benefit from the full net income of a working spouse because of such expenses.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the need for equity of treatment as between claimants whose spouses are in different work situations, that is, both full-time and part-time work, and to meet the changing pattern of employment today, local offices of my Department were advised that the working allowance should be tailored to the actual number of days worked.  The £45 weekly disregard allowance from spouse's earnings was converted to a daily rate of £7.50.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the disregard from earnings is to cover expenses associated with being in employment such as the cost of lunches and so on.  A person who works for less than a full week would not incur the same level of expenses daily as a person working full-time but would, nevertheless, require a minimum amount of disregard to meet such expenses.  In order to improve the position of those who work just a few days a week I now propose to introduce a minimum amount of £30 disregard from earnings for a spouse working for three days or less each week, instead of the present £7.50 daily disregard.  A spouse working four or more days per week would get the full £45 weekly disregard from earnings.</P>
    <P>In the case of a spouse working one day per week the improvement means an increase in the disregard from £7.50 to £30.  This will significantly improve the position for those spouses who work part-time while introducing greater equity in <Col N="1480" /> the treatment of households with different employment situations.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware from recent media coverage of my concern about the effects on Irish emigrants to the United Kingdom and on the rights of Irish people living there of the UK Government's proposal to introduce a residence test for people seeking certain social welfare payments in the UK.  Earlier this month I met with the British Secretary of State for Social Security, Mr. Peter Lilley, in London to discuss the proposal and its implications for Irish people generally.  I received his assurance that the proposed new residence test was not intended to interfere with the traditional working arrangements and patterns of migration between the two countries.  I welcome very much the Secretary of State's assurance in this regard and look forward to a satisfactory outcome to the matter.</P>
    <P>In that connection it was agreed that a high level group of officials from both Departments would meet to agree a formula which would ensure that there is no negative impact on the traditional working arrangements and patterns of migration between the two countries. Those meetings are continuing this week.</P>
    <P>The students' summer job scheme, which I introduced for the first time last year, will run again this year but with a number of important improvements. Last year's scheme proved to be a major success despite the short time available to get it off the ground.  It was a very positive initiative which unearthed a large reservoir of community based jobs, a significant number of which were successfully completed by participating students.  The scheme last year was of great benefit both to the students who participated and to the local communities who provided the jobs.  Almost 6,000 students were approved to participate and approximately 4,600 of them took up the opportunities offered.  The number of sponsors approved last year was 2,125 and they offered 9,083 jobs to eligible students.</P>
    <P>I am improving this year's scheme by increasing the weekly rate to £45 this year compared with £40 last year.  This will <Col N="1481" /> enable participating students to earn a total of £540 over the period of the scheme, which is £140 more than last year.  Senators will remember that the £40 last year related to 16 hours of work a week for ten weeks with voluntary or community organisations.  Instead of applying the normal budgetary increase of 3 per cent, which would bring the rate to £42, I am increasing it to £45.  I am also extending the duration of the scheme to 12 weeks this year compared to ten weeks last year and extending the period during which the work under the scheme may be carried out from the beginning of June to the end of September, which is a month longer than last year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be introducing another students' summer jobs scheme this year with improvements which I know will enhance the scheme for both students and sponsors.  I expect that participation will be substantially higher than last year for the benefit of both students and their local communities.</P>
    <P>This Bill continues the long standing process of maintaining and safeguarding the position of those who depend on social welfare.  In line with the programme for Government the real value of social welfare payments is being maintained. The general increases this year are above the expected rate of inflation and well above the rate of inflation last year.  The additional increases, which will benefit 20 per cent of people on social welfare, will significantly boost incomes for these people.  The increases apply to 40 per cent of the population as a whole.</P>
    <P>Pensioners' incomes are protected and the additional increases for invalidity pensioners, improvements for carers and the &ldquo;free schemes&rdquo; extensions announced earlier will all contribute substantially to improving the position for pensioners.  The introduction of the new survivor's pension marks a major breakthrough in social security provision in this country and the PRSI changes will directly support the creation of new jobs and help workers on low pay.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive debate on the measures proposed in the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Col N="1482" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his commitment to social welfare, the introduction of this Bill to the House and the points which he made in his speech, many of which are very relevant.</P>
      <P>However, questions are being asked by the PAYE sector as regards payment of PRSI.  While the Minister is talking about summer jobs schemes for students, there is a thinking in the community, whether we like it or not, that there is no easy answer to the issue which we should be discussing.  The Minister is even admitting in his speech that we are just trying to keep benefits in line with inflation and creating a situation where we are taking from some to give to others because of the cost of social welfare.  It is increasing by another £168 million this year, which is a great deal of money.  Over £11 million is spent every day, which is serious for the taxpayer, of whom there are now fewer and fewer, particularly in the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>There was not enough emphasis in the Minister's speech on what is happening as regards the PRSI payments.  PAYE workers are losing a large amount of money and there was an impression in the speech that as part of the EU regulations each person would be getting the same. I have always said &mdash; and I make no apologies for it &mdash; that we should regulate more the amount of money which is paid to each person.  Whether people are on unemployment assistance, invalidity pension, disability pension or old age pension, everybody should get the same amount except those in receipt of the carer's allowance and those over 80 years.  That is probably coming about slowly.  Unfortunately, the amount of money paid every week, not by just employees but employers, who have to pay 12.2 per cent for every employee earning over £180, is being slowly deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are regulations in other parts of the European Union stating that everybody should get the same.  That is what equality is about and it is evidenced by what happened with widowers.  In the past we argued the widowers' case and <Col N="1483" /> at last we got a result.  While people in Government might take credit for granting equal recognition, the fact is that the equality legislation had to be implemented.  If it had not been implemented the widowers could have taken a case to the European courts.  I see no reason why anybody should take the credit now that widows and widowers are being treated equally.  I congratulate the Minister for doing this after such a long period, but it was done unfortunately because of bad publicity in recent years.</P>
    <P>I worry about the impression in the Minister's speech that some social welfare recipients will get a 10 per cent increase.  There is a tightening up in the Department of Social Welfare in many areas, particularly that of disability benefit. I have brought many cases about which I am concerned to the attention of the Junior Minister.  The Minister said that everybody will be better off, but that is not true, as I have already said, with regard to the PAYE sector and PRSI payments.  I make the same point with regard to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are now graduated disability benefits, of which there is no mention in the speech.  There is also no mention of the people who are being questioned and investigated by the State and the State's doctors to ascertain whether they are entitled to disability benefit.  After long and expensive arguments between doctors and consultants, it has been proved that these people are entitled to disability benefit; but because of the graduated allowance which was introduced as part of the dirty dozen reductions many people are not getting the full allowance.</P>
    <P>I brought a case to the attention of the Junior Minister, and I mention it to the Minister now, because we will be bringing it up on Committee Stage.  It involves a person who was first on unemployment assistance and then disability benefit.  He was questioned by the State on the basis of arguments made by the State that he was not entitled to disability benefit. After two years and at enormous cost to <Col N="1484" /> the State, his consultants proved he was entitled to disability benefit; but because he was not receiving benefit or credit benefit in the previous two years, he is now only on graduated disability benefit.</P>
    <P>We should not give the impression that everybody is being treated in the same way because they are not.  The Minister will not deny that there is a policy in the Department of Social Welfare to investigate every case where money is paid where it should not be paid.  I am not saying such a policy should not exist, because one is dealing with a black economy. However, people were investigated by the State and after the State admitted it had been wrong, a husband, wife and three children were left to live on a graduated disability benefit of £72 a week.  I emphasis this particular case, but it is one of many and I am not getting any answers.</P>
    <P>It baffles and frightens me to think that the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister in particular are prepared to take the glory and say that people are better off now.  That may be the overall impression, but whether we like it or not, it is a fact of life that a husband, wife and three children are being asked by the Department of Social Welfare to live on £72.60 a week.  I defy anybody to question me on that.  This man has to go to the community welfare officer every week for more money.  While the investigation was in progress he was not prepared to go to the community welfare officer because he felt he was within his rights.</P>
    <P>I do not see any logic in having the Department of Social Welfare pay out a certain amount of money for welfare and the Department of Health pay out a supplement for other social problems such housing and allocations for rent.  That is an area which the Minister should examine. One Department should take total responsibility for all problems relevant to health and social welfare and no other Department should be involved.  The Minister spoke proudly of his involvement in discussions to establish joint ventures with social welfare staff and I agree with this.  The Minister in particular and <Col N="1485" /> his Department have built a structure of which many countries in Europe are conscious.  When one considers the amount of money being spent in other parts of our social structure, one has to ask if one Department should be in charge of all contributions or spending in the area of social problems.  This is an issue which the Minister did not mention.</P>
    <P>Sadly, no one is prepared to say that this country is on top of the social welfare problem.  More money is spent on social welfare every day and, as the Minister said, an extra £168 million will be spent this year.  There has been a reduction in unemployment in other countries.  It was evident in Great Britain in the last few months, but it is quite the opposite here. If there is a reduction in unemployment on any scale I would like to be informed of it because the impression outside the doors of this building is that there is no reduction.</P>
    <P>People are not prepared to employ and I defy anybody who would say a reduction for employers from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent for employees earning £180 a week is an incentive to create employment.  I would like the real figures for job creation over the last two years because it does not seem to be working. The area should be seriously examined because we do not seem to be gaining. We are now being questioned by EU Commissioners about spending on FÁS schemes and job creation.  Job creation presents a serious problem and we should not be slapping ourselves on the back and taking credit when the situation is in fact deteriorating and an extra £168 million has to be spent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases and I will always welcome them.  I welcome the fact that the report on social welfare is now being implemented and that we finally recognise that a basic rate has to be paid, something long overdue.  At the same time let us not give the impression for a moment that we have solved the problem, that we can say that people are doing better and are better off.  All of us, especially the well off, have a duty to look after the less well off.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> When I read the last part of the Minister's statement in regard to our students I wondered whether in creating these schemes we are taking opportunities away from the long term unemployed.  It is only creating a situation where people do not employ a person in the normal way &mdash; they take on somebody for 16 hours a week for 12 weeks at £45 per week.  We need to be very careful there. Nobody can deny that many people, young people in particular, are employed on FÁS schemes.  Many greedy employers avail of the opportunity to take these people on a 12 week basis and get payment from one Department or the other.  We are creating a false economy, we are giving the impression that people are working when in fact they are being paid by the State and greedy employers are gaining from their work.  This is a very sad reflection on us.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement has been increased by 25 per cent this year, which is long overdue.  We must recognise that this area is relevant to creating proper long term work, particularly for people with families.  If the family income supplement was advertised properly we could create many jobs because many people are not aware that they are entitled to these benefits.  The employer is asked to give information about the amount paid to people on family income supplement.  I am not saying that this is wrong, but the State should not cause undue embarrassment to the family receiving the supplement.  The present system of collection should be changed. I see no reason why PRSI or any other benefits which have to be collected on behalf of that employee should not be deducted from the amount the employer is paying to the State so the family in question will not be embarrassed by having to go elsewhere to collect the family income supplement.  The present system of payment is not logical.</P>
    <P>I wish to get some information from the Minister's officials in regard to the cost of implementing that particular scheme, not the amount of money paid out in family income supplement but what it costs per family to supply the <Col N="1487" /> books and the amount paid to the Post Office for administering the scheme. That is a very important point.  We will bring that up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister is talking about the low paid worker, particularly in our clothing and manufacturing and footwear services. When the Minister, Deputy Ahern, brought in VAT in these areas in the budget, it was argued that the low paid worker would be affected.  Now it is coming home to roost with job losses and with the migration, as the Minister calls it, between one country and another.  I did not know we were cotton pickers.  We should not be talking about migration between Britain or any other country and here.  The fact that the Minister is prepared to speak about the migration of workers between Britain and Ireland reflects badly on the Government.  We must never give the impression that Irish people have to go to Britain to get involved in cotton picking or in building when the British economy is right.  We are proud of the fact that our emigrants when they go to other countries are not recognised as a particular type of person doing a particular type of work.  The word &ldquo;migration&rdquo; gives the impression that they are needed for particular types of work and I resent that.</P>
    <P>In regard to emigration, jobs in the clothing industry have been lost to Ireland because of the VAT charges which were implemented two years ago. Is it not true to say that particular manufacturing organisations that were set up in Ireland have moved to Britain and set up there at a lesser cost?  In the labour intensive areas of clothing and shoe manufacturing we are now prepared to take less PRSI and lower levies from employers.  It has now been proved that the measures introduced in that budget were of no help in creating and holding jobs in the clothing manufacturing area. Have we made money from the increases in VAT and charges on the clothing industry?  The question must be asked, as we are talking about £89 million.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about the labour intensive industries, the building industry and <Col N="1488" /> the black economy.  I have been very conscious of that for many years and the Minister has tried to bring in schemes to make sure everybody is protected.  The Minister is talking about the self-employed, people working in areas which are contracted out, such as carpenters, masons and others.  The Minister is worried that they are not covered under all the schemes.  We need to be very careful that we do not create a disincentive to work.  There is always an incentive to work in the black economy.  All the schemes and regulations that we implement do not make it easier for people to work for themselves; they make it more difficult.  If it is not the Department of Social Welfare or the Revenue Commissioners, somebody else is involved.</P>
    <P>It was shown that a person who was prepared to start up a business for themselves had to visit 11 or 12 different agencies, and we must learn from that.  The Minister is putting a strong emphasis on people who want to work for themselves or who have to work for themselves because of the structures which have been set up in the construction industry, because they will not get work otherwise. People are employed as subcontractors. That started on a large scale when Margaret Thatcher was in power in Britain and it is now being done here.  The Minister should not create a situation where they are encouraged to work in the black economy.  I notice the Minister is putting the responsibility on employers to pay back any social welfare money claimed by any of their employees while working. I see nothing wrong with that.  However, if we are creating benefits for the protection of spouses and families in certain categories we would want to look more closely at that.  The Minister did this for part-time fishermen and I see no reason it cannot be implemented for people in the construction industry or other sectors. What goes for one should go for all.</P>
    <P>Serious questions can be asked as to whether we are treating everybody equally because I do not think we are. From a political party point of view we seem to be protecting people in certain <Col N="1489" /> relevant areas.  The Minister is prepared to give benefits to people who gather seaweed for the seaweed factories which he is not prepared to give to people in other areas.  That is why, on Committee Stage, we should discuss whether everybody should be entitled to the same benefits.</P>
    <P>I was at a conference on loan sharks in Cork attended by the Minister and his Minister of State.  I was surprised at the statements made by the Minister of State about authorities not caring properly for less well off people; I thought he went too far.  It would be irresponsible of me not to say that because a lot of publicity was given to those remarks.  The facts are that local authorities are caring for the less well off and the proof is there, particularly in my own local authority.  I recently investigated cases of people who are in the hands of loan sharks, and every effort is made to help them.  I have abundant proof of that.  I resented the Minister of State's remarks which I never expected to hear from someone in the Department of Social Welfare.  The Minister knows local authorities are looking after disadvantaged people, although the prevailing situation was not reflected in media coverage of the Minister of State's remarks.  As Opposition spokesman on Social Welfare, I thought those remarks were very unfair and if the Minister of State was in the House I would say the same thing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on changes in benefits for widowers which are long overdue.  At long last we have recognised that all widowed persons are equal and entitled to the same benefits.  Over the past 40 years very little recognition was given to widows but none at all was given to widowers.  We are now, rightly, giving allowances to people like carers who look after the elderly at home.  This reflects a changing attitude which is very welcome and is the result of long arguments over the years.</P>
    <P>While the lone parent's allowance is welcome, let us not create a situation where we are taking from one group to give to another.  People should not suffer because some have benefits and others <Col N="1490" /> do not.  The Minister must be careful of this because lone parents are now entitled to earn up to £30 per week extra although they could lose £15.  We must examine whether that system would take from other areas of benefit.  For example, would an employer hire one category of worker rather than another because of unequal income levels?  We cannot achieve equality where people can work for varying levels of income.  While we mean well in dealing with lone parents, carers, widows and widowers, we must not create a society of greedy employers. I will elaborate on that on Committee Stage I would welcome the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>Are all payments due on 28 July 1994? If so, they might not be paid until August. I remember when Budget increases were paid in March, that was changed to May/June and now it is 28 July.  That is a long way into the year before people get their benefits.  Something similar happened to the benefits paid at Christmas. At one time the payment was 100 per cent, then it was reduced to 70 per cent and some people were not entitled to it at all.</P>
    <P>While I congratulate the Minister on social welfare improvements and the percentage increases in certain categories, a more important question needs to be asked.  Should we tell the PAYE workers that PRSI means nothing, that it is just a payment?  Why not introduce one tax? PRSI will no longer be paid to employees; it is being taken from them and given to the long term unemployed. I am not saying we should not be doing that, but let us not create the false impression that the pay related insurance scheme is still relevant.  It is not, because one no longer receives any benefits from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year, and I agree with him.  I view this Bill, and the role of social welfare, as protecting those who are vulnerable in society as well as ensuring that we create an environment that <Col N="1491" /> promotes job creation and the Minister has identified how this Bill fulfils both those requirements.  I wish to comment on a number of issues arising from the Minister's speech.  The first one &mdash; which is an interesting innovation &mdash; is the question of joint ventures, selling our expertise and acknowledging the expertise of our Civil Service.  It is worth putting on record that we have a very capable Civil Service whose skills are now being marketed.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that a group from the Republic of Albania is scheduled to visit here in the next few weeks.  I visited Albania a month ago and if ever a country was in need of all the assistance and advice it can get, Albania would fulfil those requirements.  I do not know what the cost of selling these services will be or what price we will charge.  During my visit to the Parliament in Tirana I saw that the Government is making great strides in developing and nurturing democracy in very difficult circumstances.  The difficulty for the new democratic government carrying out its work is seen in the fact that it is unusual for Members of Parliament to have copies of the Bills being discussed.  Members seldom receive copies of legislation or edicts from the President because of the shortage of paper.  They do not have paper to print the Bills.  They also have no way of recording the business of Parliament and circulating it to members.  I ask the Minister when selling our services, to be aware of the problems of emerging democracies and their need for our support.  If that support must initially be given at a low, or at no cost, I urge the Minister to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of social welfare is to protect the vulnerable.  I will now discuss the aspects of the Bill with that purpose. The Minister has announced an extra 12 per cent for recipients of disability or unemployment benefit.  That is a huge increase.  Even the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has not seen such increases for those lucky enough to be employed.  There is a 6 per cent increase for 185,000 people on the lowest welfare <Col N="1492" /> payments, such as unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. That is in line with the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Last year there was a disagreement between myself and another Member of the House when we discussed the supplementary welfare allowance.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the tremendous work being done by the community welfare officers who administer the supplementary allowance scheme.  They are very compassionate and helpful.  They have a lot of discretion in deciding what the priorities are, and they do so very well.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for increases of £10.20 per week for single persons on invalidity pensions; there is an increase of £11.40 per week for a married couple currently in receipt of £100.90.  These increases reinforce the primary role of the Minister and his Department to protect the most vulnerable in our society. Child benefit has again been increased. It is easy to take such increases for granted.  We now expect them and if they are not made there will be a huge outcry of criticism.  I remember when there were no increases in child benefit for a number of years because of the need to improve the financial position of the country at the time.  Instead of taking such increases for granted or criticising them, the increases should be acknowledged.  They are important to the women who are in receipt of child benefit.</P>
    <P>During the debate last year on the effects of the budget on social welfare, the Minister of State said that the uptake of family income supplement, which is a support for those on low incomes, was not as great as expected.  I am heartened that, because of the initiatives of the Minister over the last 12 months, there has been an increase of almost 25 per cent in the uptake of family income supplement which is an important support for low paid workers.</P>
    <P>The other function of this Bill is to promote job creation.  This Bill goes a long way to help to promote employment. I welcome the reduction in <Col N="1493" /> employers' PRSI and the Minister's reference to improving and protecting the position of those in labour intensive industries.  I have argued in my party and debates in general for the need to pay particular attention to labour intensive industries.  It is baffling to me and the community that we should subsidise machinery and penalise people.  That was how the issue was perceived.  We need to attract multinational corporations to this country.  We cannot stand alone and presume that we can solve our unemployment problem by encouraging indigenous industry.  I never could understand why there appeared to be a tax on people.  I am heartened that the PRSI reliefs will apply to labour intensive industries and to those on low pay.</P>
    <P>Another provision in this Bill which helps job creation is the employer PRSI exemption scheme.  The Minister said this has generated 3,770 jobs in the last two years.  Such statistics are seldom quoted. Usually the negative effects of social welfare and taxation hit the headlines.  This scheme is quietly working and the changes the Minister has announced in this Bill will greatly increase that figure.  The Minister has obviously heeded the opinions of others and the recommendations of the committee set up to integrate the tax and social welfare systems. I received numerous complaints that there was a disincentive to employ certain categories of workers, particularly medical card holders.  I welcome the changes in the employers' PRSI contribution which will represent a significant benefit of up to £200 per employee to employers of the 100,000 workers who have medical cards.</P>
    <P>The thrust of this Bill is to integrate the tax and social welfare systems.  Senator Cregan has referred in this and previous debates to the fact that we cannot have a social welfare system which is seen to be a disincentive to work.  The direction taken by this and last year's Bill towards integrating the tax and social welfare systems can only be seen as an incentive to work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> Last year I welcomed the changes for the construction industry.  The Minister said today that he is in a position to make improvements in social welfare due to the current sound financial state of the social insurance fund.  It is no accident that this fund is in a sound financial state. For many years an enormous labour force worked in the black economy.  That benefited nobody, certainly not the employees.  This loss to the State meant that those who were working and paying their contributions and entitlements were also losing out.  It could even be said that the only ones who benefited from it were employers.  However, they will not have benefited in the long run because presumably the Minister will pursue any firm whom he feels have operated in the black economy in the past.  It is grossly unfair for any company who tenders for work on the basis of paying their proper entitlements, tax and social welfare insurance to lose out, either because of a technicality or out and out dishonesty on the part of other companies who do not make those contributions.  The social welfare measures identified last year, which are also mentioned in the Minister's Second Stage speech, will see a bringing in of additional firms into the social insurance fund.  If they are not brought into the fund, they do not deserve to operate in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan referred to the new survivor's pension.  I am also pleased that the Minister has extended this contributory pension to widowers.  I am not in favour of discrimination in any form.  It is unacceptable and unfair to discriminate against any section of society by virtue of their gender.  Nevertheless, I welcome the introduction of the widower's pension.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that &ldquo;there are currently 85,500 widows receiving a contributory pension at an annual cost of £282 million&rdquo; and they will see no change in their entitlements.  That effectively means there will be no means testing.  There may have been a suggestion or fear that the widows pension would be means tested after the budget. The Minister has categorically assured <Col N="1495" /> the House that this will not be the case. At a time when families are most vulnerable it is not good enough just to make the right sounds.  The family should be recognised and supported and this aspect of the budget certainly does that.</P>
    <P>The sections relating to improvements to means tests not only looks after those who need protection but also specifically encourages lone parents to either go back into education or into the workforce.  I acknowledge the role the Department of Social Welfare plays in supporting lone parents and their children.  That support and maintenance must continue as long as it is needed.  However, absentee fathers who can support and maintain their families are currently not, and are not seen to be, pursued by the State. Unless a wife or husband takes their spouse to court for maintenance the State takes no part in making absentee spouses &mdash; mainly fathers &mdash; support their children. Either this or some other Government will have to bite the bullet on this issue at some stage.</P>
    <P>I recently brought in a lone parent to see an official adviser in a Government Department.  When asked if the father of the child was supporting her, she said that he was not.  Indeed, she said that she would not even take money from him if he offered it to her.  The perception that a person has no responsibility after fathering a child must be changed.  The only way that can be done effectively in the long term is to make moves towards making parents, and ultimately that means fathers, responsible for their children.</P>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that the carer's allowance should be dealt with by the Department of Health.  Both the Minister and his Department have implemented the scheme up to now and have taken the criticism and flak associated with its shortcomings.  While no one could claim that £34 a week is a huge amount to receive &mdash; it is not &mdash; the changes in the budget, and especially the increase in the amount which can be disregarded as income, means that many more people will qualify and be able to <Col N="1496" /> avail of the carer's allowance.  It is an acknowledgement and recognition of the tremendous work done by those who willingly give up either any opportunity they may have to further their careers or their leisure time to look after their family. The amount of money it would cost to the State to provide the kind of care for elderly or handicapped members of a family in need of hospitalisation or residential care would be astronomical and would increase the health budget dramatically.  The low cost associated with the carer's allowance gives a tremendous service to the State.  I urge the Minister, whenever the opportunity provides itself, to increase this allowance each year.  The carer's allowance should eventually be administered by the Department of Health; it is currently being done by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has made changes in maternity benefit, especially in cases of stillbirths.  There was a Bill initiated in this House by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, which for the first time introduced a register of stillbirths.  The criteria laid down for the registering of stillbirths was either for the foetus to be 24 weeks old or to weigh 500 grammes. The Minister has acknowledged these changes by paying the maternity benefit to those who suffer this terrible loss.</P>
    <P>There are changes in various benefits which the Minister said he will be bringing under the one area.  The various booklets issued by the Department of Social Welfare are confusing.  There is much uncertainty about people's entitlements, which scheme they are entitled to and what elements of social welfare they can benefit from.  The more we move towards the integration of the social welfare system under a smaller number of headings, the better.  Certainly, the Minister has stated that this is his intention.</P>
    <P>The extension of the provision for supplementary welfare to three months for school leavers is also welcome.  The Minister referred to sections 24 and 25, which are an incentive for people to get back into second chance education.  It has been <Col N="1497" /> widely proven that there is a strong link between leaving school early and being unemployed.  The chances of a large number of those on long term unemployment getting back into the workforce can only improve by returning to second chance education.  The Minister has turned the social welfare code on its head by facilitating those who wish to go back into second chance or third level education without losing their social welfare benefits.  They would not be able to do so otherwise.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the changes in the extension of the provision for social welfare inspectors to inspect records so as to ensure a reduction and the eventual elimination of people working in the black economy.  This is not simply a case of &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; trying to catch people who have evaded the system.  The community will benefit from the elimination of the black economy.  The Minister said that the healthy state of the social insurance fund meant he could improve many social welfare benefits.  The elimination of the black economy will mean that those who are entitled to benefits will receive them because more firms will be brought into the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the working spouse's allowance.  Perhaps this is not the Department of Social Welfare's responsibility, but that of the Department of Finance.  The measure whereby £45 a week will be disallowed before affecting the social welfare entitlement is good.  I thought the Minister was going to say that those who worked fewer than five days a week would be substantially hit and that their situation would disimprove. However, as he pointed out, he will increase the amount to £30 for those who work three days or less per week.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that if two spouses with children go to work &mdash; many of them are lucky to have jobs, even if it is only part-time &mdash; there are substantial costs for child minders.  A recent report showed this is an area fraught with dangers and worries for spouses.  When couples with young children go to work they want to ensure they leave their children with the best carers.  Such care is not <Col N="1498" /> free or cheap.  There are child minding facilities for the small number who are most in need in our society.</P>
    <P>Unless there is recognition of the amount which couples must pay to have their children looked after, there is a disincentive for women to go to work, because by the time they pay tax and meet the costs of travel, lunches, child minding, etc. there is little take home pay left.  People do not go to work because they greatly enjoy it, but because they need the money to pay mortgages, etc. This allowance must be increased or an allowance for the amount of money people pay for child minding must be included in the tax system.</P>
    <P>I disagree with a point Senator Cregan made about cotton picking.  I congratulate the Minister for meeting his British counterpart to ensure that the position of Irish emigrants is protected. There would have been a need to criticise the Minister if he had done nothing. However, he met his British counterpart to ensure the protection of Irish emigrants. There has always been a good relationship between the UK and Ireland in terms of the workforce.  It would be wrong to pretend it does not exist and to place Irish emigrants in a disadvantaged position in the UK.  The Minister would have been criticised and found wanting if he had not taken the initiative.  I congratulate him for clarifying the position and for ensuring that Irish people who seek work in the UK are not disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>People often ask what last year's crisis was about.  Last year's crisis was a suggestion by the Opposition that students should work for the dole.  A number of students participated in the scheme and, as the Minister said, a number of communities benefited from it.  Not only were the students pleased to participate in the scheme, but I have been told that it looks good on a <i>curriculum vitae.</i>  These students are participating in the schemes in order to use their experience in the community and they are also being paid. The Minister has indicated its success, particularly when we were told last year <Col N="1499" /> that there would not be enough places or that students would lose their dole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the recognition implicit in this Bill that the PRSI system has a role to play in the creation of jobs.  Senator McGennis and Senator Cregan referred to this when they mentioned that the PRSI system is a disincentive to work.  The importance of that role is greatly underestimated and the steps taken in this Bill are too little and too timid to have any significant impact on employment and job creation.</P>
      <P>There are two positive measures in this legislation.  Employers contributions have been reduced for people earning under £175 a week.  The rate decreases from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent.  There is also a new scheme to exempt employers from PRSI for two years in respect of extra employees they take on from the live register.  We must welcome each little crumb, but these are nothing but crumbs in the face of the problems we are trying to address.</P>
      <P>If we want to increase the number of jobs significantly in the short term, we must price the lower paid into work.  We must face the fact that we want more lower paid jobs.  It is not fashionable to say that, but it is the truth.  We must create a situation in which relatively low paid jobs will be more attractive than being unemployed, so that people will be given an incentive to accept such work. At the same time we want to create a situation where an employer will find it attractive to take on low paid people.  In other words, the cost of taking on a person offers the employer an advantage in terms of an employee's value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we have the reverse of that intention.  When people come off the live register and go to work they have to be paid significantly more than the social welfare benefits to make it worth their while.  A large part of the reason for that is that the employees pay PRSI on the first pound they earn and they pay tax on <Col N="1501" /> each pound.  PRSI is a tax like any other. There is no logic in that system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have tax free allowances on income tax on the principle that one should be able to earn a basic minimum before the State takes its slice, but that is not the case with PRSI.</P>
      <P>The same thing happens on the employer's side.  On the first pound the employer has had to pay 12.2 per cent, which is now being reduced to 9 per cent but only for those whose wages do not exceed £173 per week.  That rate does not apply to the first £173 per week for everyone; it applies only to those below that threshold.  That will create a vicious poverty trap when this arrangement is implemented.  Even if the employer's rate is 9 per cent that still means more than 15 per cent of the wages going on PRSI at the lowest levels.  That is what I mean by pricing people out of work.  At the levels we are talking about, that 15 per cent is the difference between a job being created and a person staying unemployed. I have called before for the total exemption from PRSI of the first slice of all income on the employer's side and on the employee's side.  I understand the cost would be around £14 million for each £1,000 of income exempted.  Where are we going to get that money?</P>
      <P>I made a promise when I came into this House that I was not going to make proposals for reducing benefits without making a proposal as to how we could pay for them.  The money could be raised elsewhere in the system, notably by abolishing the ceiling on PRSI, in other words, turning the system on its head and putting the exemptions at the bottom rather than at the top.  However, we are rapidly eroding our ability to take that option.  Year after year we raise the PRSI at the top end, not for the purpose of reforming the system and creating jobs but just to raise a little revenue in the laziest possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the ceiling on the employer's side is increased by £4,500 which means that for every employee earning £26,000 <Col N="1502" /> a year the employer will have to pay an extra £549.  That extra tax &mdash; and I use the term &ldquo;tax&rdquo; advisedly &mdash; has to be paid irrespective of whether the profits are there to cover it.  This is an increase in the costs of the business itself.  For some companies that will be a significant increase in costs and I have no doubt that jobs will be lost as a result.  Every time we sneakily raise these ceilings we increase the cost on business and, more importantly, we reduce our ability to take the one big step we have to take, which is to fund exemptions at the low end of the scale by raising the ceiling at the other.  In doing so we must call into question the seriousness of our intent to tackle the jobs crisis.</P>
    <P>It is surely not rational to set job creation as the main national objective while at the same time systematically pricing people out of work.  It is time we stopped such madness.  I will sound a little like the ancient Roman senator who said <i>delenda est Carthago</i>&mdash; Carthage must be destroyed &mdash; and who kept saying it until Carthage eventually was destroyed.  I will repeat for the Minister an incident I spoke about before.  I met an American industrialist in America two months ago who was on the board of a large number of companies.  On finding out that I came from Ireland he turned to the others at the table and told them what a wonderful country Ireland was and how great it was to holiday and play golf in Ireland, and he told them they must go there.</P>
    <P>However, he advised them that whatever they did they should not invest in anything that creates jobs in Ireland.  He said he was on the board of many companies and he had set himself a target of never encouraging any of the companies to invest in jobs in Ireland.  I was jolted and asked him why.  He replied that a company with which he was involved had invested in Ireland and when it went to close the factory it was almost impossible to do so.  The Prime Minister was in touch with the chairman, the industrial development authorities, the trade unions and the nation as a whole could not understand why they wanted to close <Col N="1503" /> the factory.  He said we did not seem to understand that people who are going to invest in Ireland are taking risks and that we have to take the opportunity to make it more attractive to create jobs there than elsewhere.  We must remember when we take steps to protect people who are in work that sometimes those steps work against the interests of those who are out of work.  Let us take that into account.  One of our objectives should be to get those who are out of work back into work even if, on occasion, it is not in the interests of those who are at work. I add that as a reminder to the Minister although it is not directly related to the matter under discussion.  As regards job creation the Minister has taken steps in the right direction but has not gone far enough.  We must turn this system on its head in order to achieve this goal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The PRSI contributions system militates against employment. From a local point of view, beginning in the mid-1980s, we pressed our local authority to employ more people and it was pointed out to us that the costs of employing persons, even for ordinary road work, was high.  We prepared a document which was submitted to the Department of Social Welfare asking for co-operation between it and the Department of Finance on the question of payment pointing out that to re-employ people would cost very little on top of what they would be receiving on social welfare.  We were always advised that the cost of employing a person is prohibitive. The same happened recently when the council agreed to take on an additional 300 or 400 workers for 13 weeks in the next couple of months to do maintenance work on the roads.  We were again told that it could not continue because of the high cost of employing people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise the taxation of unemployment benefit, the greatest injustice ever perpetrated by any Government.  I regard it as worse by far than the decision of a previous Government to tax children's clothes and footwear. The taxation of social welfare <Col N="1504" /> payments is an attack of an unprecedented nature on the less well off.  The Finance Act, 1992, included a provision for tax on disability benefit and injury benefit and it is now proposed that unemployment benefit will be reckonable for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an example of the impact this will have on the unemployed and those on disability benefit. A person receiving a single person's tax allowance of £2,175, plus the PAYE allowance of £800 and the PRSI allowance of £286 has a total tax free allowance of £3,261.  The most recent tax free allowance certificate issued to that person showed that because he received disability benefit for a number of weeks in 1993, totalling £852, his tax allowance was reduced by that amount.</P>
    <P>That is the most savage assault on a working class person in the history of the State because his tax free allowance has been reduced to £46.33 per week.  I found it difficult to persuade that person to remain in employment.  How can the Minister speak of equity in the face of such a savage gesture?  If that is how this measure will be applied, workers who once received unemployment benefit will not know what has happened when they go back to work.  What will happen to people who may be made redundant in the coming year?  This provision must be changed and the sooner people are alerted to it the better.</P>
    <P>The decision to discontinue pay-related benefit for new claimants has been made despite the fact that PAYE workers pay such a high rate of social insurance.  If workers are paying PRSI why should they not be paid pay-related benefit?  Soon they will no longer benefit but they will continue to pay the high rate.</P>
    <P>Indisputable figures indicate that the tax take from recipients of disability and unemployment benefits for this year will be £50 million.  This State gave a tax amnesty to wealthy tax cheats who defrauded the system while taking £50 million from those on social welfare. How can this be justified?  Such an injustice <Col N="1505" /> has never been perpetrated in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Any tinkering with the system will not make up for the loss that will be suffered. The taxation of unemployment and disability benefits will hit those on low incomes, reducing their living standards and making it more difficult for them to make ends meet.  It is another example of twisting the financial screws on those on the lower end of the scale while more concessions are granted to the well off.</P>
    <P>The budget and this Bill represent a nail in the coffin for the insurance based social welfare system.  The pay-related benefits were once the outstanding feature of the Irish social welfare system but they have been systematically whittled away and are now being abolished.  The introduction of pay-related benefit gave security to those who were unemployed due to illness because they received 80 to 90 per cent of their pay during that time and sustained a reasonable standard of living.  However, under this Bill they can no longer do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to divert attention from this further cutback by focusing on the 10 per cent increase in disability and unemployment benefits &mdash; an increase of £5.40 per week.  However, the abolition of pay-related benefit for all new claimants will mean a loss of up to £16.80 per week.  Those unfortunate enough to lose their jobs this year will find themselves over £11 per week worse off.  It is difficult to understand this worsening of the living standard of those unfortunate enough to be made unemployed.</P>
    <P>Workers are expected to continue to make pay related contributions but are no longer to receive pay-related benefits. This represents a unilateral change to the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>Another matter of increasing concern to a growing number of women is the refusal of the Government to pay arrears for transitional payments to which the women are entitled under rulings of the European Court.  Last week there was a large contingent of people from Cork outside Leinster House.  They would not have come all that way to parade outside this establishment if they did not feel they <Col N="1506" /> were justifiably entitled to payments they were not receiving.  The claims were in respect of the alleviation payments introduced in 1986 but paid only to men.  In March 1991 the European Court ruled in favour of two Irish women who had taken a case to that court.  The matter was then referred back to the Irish Supreme Court. Before the court could consider the matter the Department settled the case but the position is not clear.  People are having to resort to the legal profession to get their legal entitlements.  That is not satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline overall principles in the context of this Bill which implements the social welfare aspects of the budget.  Given the setting up of the National Economic and Social Forum there has been widespread debate on the direction the social welfare system should take.  In many ways we have inherited a mixed system.  There is a mixture of universal payments, such as child benefit, means tested payments, such as unemployment assistance, and insurance based payments, such as unemployment benefit <Col N="1507" /> and disability benefit.  It is important to have a general debate about the direction in which we are proceeding.  Obviously, it is necessary to retain a certain amount of the mix, as do other countries, because we must cater for the various different strands in society.  It is also important to debate the type of issues and choices we need to make in developing the system, particularly given that there is widespread poverty, a high level of unemployment and a large percentage of the population dependent on the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>It is important that what is generally known as the third strand has been included, particularly in the context of the National Economic and Social Forum.  This is widening the debate and focusing on issues such as how we prioritise the quite large section of public spending that must inevitably go into the social welfare budget.  I welcome the broadening of the debate.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Government initiative on strategic management in the public sector.  This was announced recently and will involve all Departments in the production of an action orientated statement of strategy and setting out objectives which will try to achieve priority needs and most effective results.  This will ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money.  It is important to have this general discussion on how the social welfare budget is spent.  In that context, this debate is most welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most important basic aspect is that we should provide an adequate income for everybody dependent on social welfare.  We have made quite an amount of progress in that direction in recent years, particularly in relation to the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  We have moved quite considerably in terms of basic income for people on social welfare, particularly given the new changes announced in the budget.  For example, the 10 per cent increase in disability and unemployment benefit, the 6 per cent increase in unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare, and the various <Col N="1508" /> other increases are above the level of inflation and also bring people who were previously below the priority rate up to that level.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that we are making good progress in relation to adequacy of income in the social welfare system.  In that context, the increases in child benefit, both last year and this year, are to be strongly welcomed.  Studies have indicated that families, and large families in particular, are in danger of falling below the poverty line.  There was a general substantial increase in child benefit last year, which benefited all families, but this year there is an emphasis on bigger families with a larger increase on the third child plus.  This is in line with the aim to provide an adequate income for everybody in society.  It is the goal towards which we must strive.  We must also aim to have more simplicity and transparency in the system so that it is as coherent as possible to the general public.  While the debate in the National Economic and Social Forum is under way, it has not reached any conclusions. The interaction between that and the debate in the Department is ongoing and we need to focus on that in the near future.</P>
    <P>The points made by Senator Quinn are well made in the sense that for a long time there were disincentives for people to go to work.  However, there have been changes.  The PRSI aspects in particular have helped in a major way, as have the removal of the levies on people who earn under £9,000 per year.  While we should take account of Senator Quinn's points, we must acknowledge that there has been substantial improvement in that area. The Minister referred to the fact that 3,770 jobs were created last year as a result of the employer's exemption from PRSI for new workers.  This trend has been continued in this year's budget.  The reduced PRSI for those on incomes of under £170 per week will also have major beneficial effects for people in that poverty trap, those on the borderline who have jobs compared to their income when they were unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> In relation to the creation of employment, the House recently discussed changes by the Department of Enterprise and Employment regarding small businesses. Many measures were taken in the budget to help small businesses; they addressed the points raised by Senator Quinn regarding the problems of employers taking on workers.  It is most important that we protect the employee.  Senator Quinn spoke about the protection of employers where they may run into difficulties but it is essential that employees in unstable employment are also protected. There must be a balance.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have referred to taxing and spending. On the one hand demands are made for increases in social welfare payments while, on the other, we are accused of taxing and spending.  <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> published figures some weeks ago of when the Progressive Democrats were last in Government.  There was a substantial increase, both in the tax take and Government spending in the 1990-92 period.  When Opposition parties accuse the Government of taxing and spending, they should examine their own records and demands.</P>
    <P>As regards the Democratic Left Member's contribution, the Democratic Left document of January 1994 contains three specific references to the principle of taxing all income.  That party states unequivocally that this includes social welfare benefits.  If the party's policy is to tax all income, including social welfare benefits, there is not much point criticising the taxing of unemployment and disability benefit in this House.  It should also be noted that the taxation of these benefits will largely be confined in practice to stopping refunds rather than taking taxable income.</P>
    <P>Both unemployment and disability benefit are increased by 10 per cent in this budget so there is a direct counteraction of the effect on people in receipt of these benefits.  The Minister made it clear that there is a transfer in that situation. Where money is being taken on the one hand, it is being put directly <Col N="1510" /> back into the same benefits on the other. Those points should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the family income supplement.  The Minister pointed out that there was a 25 per cent increase last year in the take up of this scheme.  This is welcome because over the years as a public representative, in common with many other public representatives, I indicated that while many families were entitled to the supplement, the take up was very low.  The sizable increase last year is to be welcomed.  It should be noted that this year there is an increase of £6 per week in the amount families will receive in family income supplement. There is also an increase in the threshold so that more families will qualify. This relates to the question of the integration of people on social welfare into the workforce.  The family income supplement is a way of counteracting the taxes paid and possible benefits lost, for example medical cards, by low income families.  The substantial increases in family income supplement in terms of benefit and access is therefore to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the improvement in the income disregard for part-time working spouses, there are many women who are in part-time work.  It is a change in society to which the social welfare system must respond as the security of a permanent full-time job does not exist for many people today, and this process has started in this budget.</P>
    <P>The changes regarding construction workers mean that many workers who were formerly employees are now treated as self-employed.  Account has been taken of this in the Bill so that they are now included for benefits which were not available to them previously.</P>
    <P>Las year 4,600 were employed under the student employment scheme.  It has proved effective, despite the many doubts which were expressed when it was announced.  It is being improved this year with an increase in the weekly payment and with an extension of the duration of the scheme &mdash; to include June 1994 to the later summer months &mdash; and in the length of time a student can stay on the scheme. <Col N="1511" /> The scheme will benefit more students this year and should provide a welcome opportunity to many students who have difficulty meeting their financial requirements and surviving their student years.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the Opposition cast doubts as to the feasibility of the scheme when it was introduced but it has proved effective and the Minister and Minister of State are to be congratulated for persisting with the implementation of the scheme and improving it this year.</P>
    <P>This Bill ensures that people on social welfare have an adequate income which protects them against inflation.  In addition, the anomalies in the system will continue to be ironed out.  There is still room for progress in this area because any social welfare system is inevitably complicated, especially when there are high levels of unemployment and high dependency levels.</P>
    <P>However, the measures taken in the budget and the provisions in this Bill represent a move towards rationalising the system in the context of changes taking place in society, and this is the way matters should proceed.</P>
    <P>It is important that child benefits have been maintained and improved upon because they are a central aspect of the social welfare system which helps to keep families out of the poverty trap.  It is essential therefore that the improvement in child benefits continues.</P>
    <P>The deliberations of the NESC will be central to the ongoing debate in the years ahead regarding the development of the social welfare system.  There is already a focus on the need to target the system and to improve it, but the general debate, which I expect will take place in the next year, will concentrate on the need to target.  In this respect I expect the social welfare system to continue to provide opportunities and safeguards for those who are not, unfortunately, in employment or for those who are in retirement and on pension and who have contributed over the years to employment in society.</P>
    <P>The system is being streamlined, changed and improved in a way that is beneficial and will facilitate people to <Col N="1512" /> move from social welfare to employment. This is a central aspect of what we expect from the social welfare system.  We do not want to have people stuck on social welfare without having the facility to move into employment should the opportunity arise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment her on the many measures she is introducing to help those on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Regarding the VTOS programme and the Youthreach scheme, I note that the VTOS programme caters for those over the age of 21 years who are long-term unemployed and who wish to participate in programmes, especially those organised by the vocational education committees. Those participating in this programme can retain their allowance and may, in addition, obtain meal and travel allowances.  However, there should be an incentive of £10 or £15 per week payable to those who are prepared leave their homes and enter the workplace in order to participate in this programme to better themselves.</P>
      <P>The provision of £15,000 in respect of capital costs for these two programmes is marginal and inadequate.  It makes it difficult for vocational education committees to organise and implement them. I ask the Minister to liaise with her colleague in the Department of Education to ensure that more capital is provided for these programmes, especially the VTOS programme which is meaningful and worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not, part-time work will become the norm.  There are thousands of teachers working part-time at present.  I have already taken up their case with the Minister for Education. These teachers have no pension rights.  I appeal to the Minister to consider providing pensions for part-time teachers, on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to those available to full-time teachers.  This important issue must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome any improvement in the carer's allowance.  Any working person who is prepared to leave her job should <Col N="1513" /> be given a full carer's allowance regardless of what her husband is earning or the income of the household.  A person leaving a job would create a vacancy and they would also take a great burden off the hospitals by providing good care for the person needing care.</P>
    <P>There are people who would be prepared to leave their jobs if they were allowed the maximum carer's allowance to take care of relatives or friends.  It would be a good measure for the Minister to consider and if she implemented it she would be remembered by many people around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minster of State, Deputy Burton, and the Bill to the House.  I am always delighted to see the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister of State in the House because they take a great interest in their Department and they take great pride in improvements introduced.  They are also receptive to suggestions about improvements and their officials are helpful.</P>
      <P>It is good to see that an industry has been set up in the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department and Digital have set up a services section and they are selling their knowledge on how to set up social welfare schemes, etc., to many countries, including Poland, Russia, Slovakia and Albania.  Many countries in eastern European will be developing systems and we should send officials there or bring people here on courses.</P>
      <P>We should have pride in how schemes are administered.  As Senator McGennis said, those working in the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; I often come in contact with them because of patients' problems &mdash; and agencies dealing with such matters have a good attitude.  I welcome this and I hope it will spread to Senator Sherlock's area so that he will not face the problems he is experiencing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be realistic and accept that unemployment will remain at a high level.  We must look at how the unemployed are treated.  It is important to recognise that as well as a lack of money <Col N="1514" /> unemployment causes other problems, including major psychological problems. The Department has become more flexible regarding vocational training schemes, voluntary, part-time work, etc. and this is an important step.  While poverty is the main problem when it comes to unemployment, appalling psychological effects begin when a person realises they may become unemployed.  Doctors will say that in areas where people are worried about a factory closure, the increase in the number of patients is considerable.</P>
    <P>Dr. Christopher Whelan has written a good article on poverty, unemployment and psychological distress in Ireland and I recommend that Senators read it.  He gave a general health questionnaire to employed and unemployed people and he weighted them by age, sex, etc.  More than one in three unemployed people showed signs of grave psychological stress compared to one in 14 employed people.  This affects the family of the unemployed person, particularly the wife if they have less money because women usually manage the family finances.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and his officials to be flexible.  Only a small sum of money would be involved in allowing a person to do some work.  Improvements have been made in regard to spouses and the £45 allowance.  Some people may work only three days each week.  Money is important but the fact that a family member has a job to go to three mornings each week is significant because it affects children and other family members.  As a previous speaker said, part-time work may become the norm.  Again, I urge flexibility regarding the removal of allowances.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see changes in attitude to education but many more changes are needed.  I do not accept that these changes will lead to meaningful jobs.  I hope they will but any training is worthwhile. The more skills one has the better. Sadly, because of modern technology, skills go out of date quickly.  A few years ago sewing blazers may have been terrific but now donkey jackets are in.  Skills have to be continually upgraded.  The absence of an immediate job should not weigh <Col N="1515" /> too heavily on people who are training.  I praise any efforts to make unemployment agencies into one stop shops, where people can be encouraged to do voluntary work, take part-time jobs or avail of educational opportunities.  The philosophy of the Department appears to be changing and this cannot but be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The physical effects of unemployment are as bad as the psychological ones.  The mortality rate for unemployed men is 36 per cent higher than for employed men of the same age and class; the corresponding figure for women is not as bad &mdash; 21 per cent.  These are British figures but I have no reason to believe the figures are different here.  If one examines the incidence of illness among those in social classes one to five and the unemployed, one can be sure that higher rates of illness exist among the unemployed.  There are higher rates of injury, poisoning, diseases of the respiratory system, circulation and the heart, and cancer the further down the socio-economic scale one goes, particularly among the unemployed.  As I pointed out in the debate on still-births, the incidence of such births is higher among the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with injury benefit and unemployability supplement.  I am not criticising what is being done here but a major effort must be made by the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Enterprise and Employment to deal with the problem of industrial accidents.  If this were done, costs would be reduced enormously.  Our rate of industrial accidents and occupational injuries is twice that in Great Britain.  This is not because they have better training programmes but because in many areas we are lax about safety.  It is interesting that the figures in Northern Ireland are much the same as ours.  The problem may be an all Ireland one and may have to be tackled in that context.  If the Minister deals with this problem, costs will be reduced.  It is extremely important that this be done.</P>
    <P>I am glad the working spouse allowance has been increased but I hope there will be flexibility when it is applied, not <Col N="1516" /> just because of the financial benefit it provides but because of the beneficial effect it will have on the whole household when one of its members has a job of some importance.  I am glad the lone parent's allowance has been increased. As President of Cherish I am involved with lone parents.  It costs much less to keep a toddler than a teenager.  Only about 12 per cent of single mothers receive long term social welfare payments. We must keep a close eye on this 12 per cent because the others, due to changes which have been made, their own abilities and family help, have managed to get out of this incredible poverty trap and into jobs and further training. We must look carefully at what is happening to the teenage children of this 12 per cent.  People are far too anxious to forget about the children of single mothers once they are in school and think that all the problems are then solved. They are not.  Women of teenage children often contact me about school books. Community welfare officers do the best they can but have only a limited amount of money.  For women with children who could do well, it is very hard if at that stage their situation becomes difficult.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of maternity benefit to women who have still-births after 24 weeks of pregnancy.  Such births cause great distress.  This extension is very worthwhile.  Child care is very important.  Major tomes on child care are being published but it would make an enormous difference if public child care facilities were provided for people who are trying to go on training courses or take lower paid jobs.  It would be impossible for them to take such jobs if most of their earnings went on paying for child care.  I urge the Minister &mdash; I know she has this interest at heart &mdash; to consider this, even though it is not within her area of responsibility.  I hope I will not be like Senator Quinn who quoted a Roman senator who said every year that Carthage must fall until it eventually fell, because I may not be here long enough to see progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The disabled person's maintenance allowance is the only one still paid by the <Col N="1517" /> Department of Health.  I do not agree with Senator McGennis's suggestion that the carer's allowance should be transferred to that Department.  The officials in the Department of Social Welfare should be happy that people are pleased they are treated equitably.  This is important. The eight health boards are inclined to interpret issues in different ways. When responsibility for paying disabled persons maintenance allowance is transferred to the Department of Social Welfare, a cause for complaint by recipients will be removed.  I would not like to see this situation replaced by one in which carers are complaining.  I urge the Minister to transfer responsibility for the payment of this allowance to her Department as soon as possible.  The forum for people with disabilities constantly contacts me about this problem.  Many of these people are very able.  They have their wits about them and want to use their money in the best possible way.  They resent the way they are sometimes treated.</P>
    <P>Any changes in PRSI rates are important. I am speaking as an employer as well as an employee.  I am sure there is a good reason for the retention of the upper ceiling but I do not know what it is.  The Minister may tell us later.  It would be beneficial if we could raise money by removing the ceiling and use it to raise the exemption limits to ensure that fewer people on lower incomes are liable for PRSI.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of the Department of Social Welfare has improved greatly.  If the Minister wishes I could give her plenty of documentation about the psychological distress caused by unemployment, which leads to physical illness and costs an enormous amount of money. This is never adequately considered when estimating what unemployment costs Departments other than Social Welfare. I hope the change of philosophy within the Department continues so that we can provide more people with part time, contract, temporary and other jobs.  While the financial benefits may not be great, the psychological benefits for those people will be enormous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Having read the Bill and studied it in depth, I welcome its thrust. The Commission on Social Welfare recommended certain payments across the board.  To date we have paid 83 per cent of the rates it recommended.  This is an excellent achievement.  We have high unemployment and large dependency on social welfare.  Most of the Bill's provisions are welcome and further provisions of this nature must be encouraged in the foreseeable future.  I refer specifically to the PRSI exemption scheme and reductions in employers PRSI.  At last we have realised that high taxes mean fewer jobs.  We must encourage greater employment and make it profitable for people to take jobs in the lower paid sector.  It must always be profitable for people to work.  This scheme is worthwhile. I hope this is the philosophy of this Government.  It is percolating down from all Departments, which is why there is provision in the Bill for PRSI exemptions.</P>
      <P>For too long in the past pressure was mounted by lobby groups for increased social welfare.  However, over the long term this has put more people out of work than into work.  At long last we have come to accept the principle that high taxes and levies on work are no longer acceptable.  Individuals and lobby groups have now realised the folly of the thinking of the past.  It is welcome that this Bill should acknowledge that and bring about change.  I hope that this is not short term but is the philosophy which will be continued for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A husband or wife who goes to work are taxed to such an extent that it is possibly not profitable for either of them to work.  That is the reality of the situation. At times we deny that the social welfare code has encouraged people not to work.  Our taxation code has also encouraged people not to work.  These points must be emphasised because this is the most positive step in a Social Welfare Bill in a long time.  The provisions for widows, widowers, equal treatment and so on are very welcome.  They have been made possible by tight fiscal management <Col N="1519" /> over the last number of years without which Exchequer funding would not be available to fund these positive provisions.</P>
    <P>The one stop shops have already been mentioned.  We should look at the whole area of social welfare, job creation and taxation.  I see no reason why a person has to go to a social welfare office to collect their payments, a revenue office to pay tax and a FÁS office to find employment.  There should be one stop shops where everybody, whether or not they are unemployed, can seek advice or receive or make their payments.  It is disheartening to see people strolling down to the dole office and others to the FÁS office.  It would be a positive step to amalgamate all these units.  Many people still feel embarrassed about walking into a social welfare office and this would break that psychological barrier and show that they are also contributing to our society.</P>
    <P>With regard to the student work scheme, last year many people in this Chamber expressed the view that it was not acceptable for students to have to work for their dole.  I come from a city which has a large student population. Therefore I regard this as a positive step which must be encouraged.  Once again it is a change in the philosophy and a recognition that people must be encouraged to work on a voluntary basis in the community.  Nobody can stand up here and say that the student work scheme is not acceptable to the vast majority of people.  It is a welcome provision and must be encouraged and expanded, if possible.  Many voluntary bodies have stated that they achieved an enormous amount last year because of the scheme. The extension of the time frame and the fact that it is now more streamlined means that it will be an even greater success this year.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Women's Rights Committee I am very concerned about child care.  To date we do not have a proper child care system in place.  We have <i>ad hoc</i> committees which are grant aided by the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="1520" /> and schemes are set up to look after the children of lone parents and so on. However, this will have to be addressed very soon because lone parents cannot afford to go out to work because they have to pay somebody to mind their children. Addressing the issue means setting up a proper child care system whereby those on social welfare and lone parents would have a facility whereby their children would be taken care of while they contributed in the work place.</P>
    <P>Other countries have excellent child care facilities.  I was impressed by the Australian model, which I studied, where public child care facilities also cater for children whose parents can afford to pay. They are integrated, which is very important.  We must no longer say to people on social welfare that it is not acceptable to be on social welfare.  We are going to have an economy where for the foreseeable future a large percentage of our population will be dependent on social welfare.  We must educate them for that and encourage them to take whatever active role they can in our community. There are always those who claim that the average person on the dole does not want to work and that that is why they are dependent on social welfare.  To a certain extent one can agree with that point of view.  However, that situation arises because of the social welfare systems in the past and the taxation on work. I hope that situation will be addressed over the next three or four years.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a flexible system whereby we take away the bureaucracy and the red tape when it comes to employing people.  I am involved in business and one might have a large order to produce furniture, build houses or whatever.  However, due to the red tape and bureaucracy involved, the employer will be reluctant to take people on.  It is too difficult to employ people for a short term who have to be let go when the contract is completed.  If we are to seriously address the whole situation people must become more flexible.  We have already discussed training people for work under the National Development Plan.  We must train people to be <Col N="1521" /> flexible in work and to adapt to whatever work arises.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about people being encouraged to stay at home.  Young people today, again due to our social welfare system, are encouraged to find apartments and move out of the home environment.  This is very regrettable. For example, the lone parent situation, which is prevalent in modern society, means that people are forced because of economic necessity to leave the home. Young girls can be very vulnerable after a pregnancy and should be encouraged to stay in the home environment rather than being forced by economic necessity to move out and receive rent allowance. That has been addressed to a certain extent but must be positively looked at again in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Bill is quite welcome right across the House.  There are other provisions in it such as the addressing of the stillbirth system, maternity leave and so on which are very welcome.  This issue affects only a small minority but shows the caring social outlook of this Government.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to next year's Bill, which I hope will adopt some of the issues I raised here today.  I hope that I will be standing here this time next year commending that Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to discuss this legislation.  This Bill provides for increases from July 1994 in rates of social welfare payments.  It introduces a survivor's pension and provides for other miscellaneous changes in the social welfare code.  We all agree that social welfare is a major achievement of modern societies. The Government is usually strongly supported in this by public opinion.  A recent European study highlighted the almost unanimous support for a high level of social protection.  The Progressive Democrats believe that social welfare recipients should be given the best protection society can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare is a major component of social cohesion and solidarity.  However, social welfare and social protection systems <Col N="1522" /> are faced with growing pressures owing to a large number of factors such as the evolution of the labour market and rising unemployment; demographic trends, particularly the ageing population; changes in family structure, particularly increases in single parent families; the growing instances of poverty and social exclusion resulting from these trends and a massive increase in the demand for a range of social services, including a comprehensive welfare service and health care system.  At the same time low rates of economic activity, budget deficits and compelling claims on public expenditure have raised the question: can we continue to pay the social welfare bill and if so for how long more?</P>
    <P>The future of the social welfare state is at a crossroads.  We have already seen major cutbacks in health spending; and very soon in this country the policy makers in both Fianna Fáil and Labour will realise that the current projected expenditure on social welfare cannot go on indefinitely.  Up to now we have focused on giving increases across a wide range of social welfare schemes in order to keep pace with or possibly stay ahead of inflation.  Recently we have tried to introduce some incentives for people in order to get them back into the work place.</P>
    <P>Today 1.4 million of our population are being maintained on social welfare payments.  This leads to poverty and marginalisation, which is nothing new.  Many of our people experience poverty and social exclusion on an ongoing basis. Social exclusion does not mean only insufficient income: it goes beyond participation in working life and manifests itself in areas such as housing, education, health and access to other services such as legal aid.  Persistent unemployment, especially long term unemployment, the impact of industrial change on poorly skilled workers, the evolution of new family structures and the decline in traditional forms of solidarity all cause a severe lagging behind in the general progress of society.</P>
    <P>Growing resentment at being excluded from sharing the wealth and opportunities <Col N="1523" /> within the country heightens the risk of people being driven to desperation. It causes disruptive behaviour and violence and also leads people to addiction to drugs and alcohol.  Insecurity generates fear of the future, often leading to further erratic behaviour.  The opposite to despair is hope, which is a belief in oneself and a belief in one's future.  There is nothing in this Bill which can send out a ray of hope to those who find themselves excluded from sharing in the wealth and opportunities of this country.</P>
    <P>At present in Ireland the unemployment level is critical.  Public funds are severely limited.  The geographical distribution of social exclusion is extensive and family structure, particularly the increasing number of one parent families, provides less of a safety net than in the past.  The consequences of all of this are very clear.  If the aim of our social policy is to assist individuals to take care of themselves, to remove people from the dependency culture and, as far as possible, to perform a useful role in society, only new and innovative combinations of work and welfare are likely to achieve that goal for those vulnerable people. There is nothing in this Bill nor in any utterances from the Minister or his Department that tell us what the philosophy is in relation to future social policy in this country.</P>
    <P>The central implication of both the rising demand for social services and the need to combat the exclusion of weak groups is that income maintenance can no longer be the only objective of social policy.  There is a growing consensus that all citizens should have a guarantee of resources, but social policies now have to take on the more ambitious object of helping people to find their place in society.  The main route, but not the only one, is paid work and that is why employment policies and social policies should be more closely linked.  Consideration must be given to more generalised mainstream policies aimed at integration and a spread throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> We need better adaptation of social programmes to avoid poverty and unemployment traps.  Unemployment compensation should be linked to training, job creation and incentives to work.  We need more equal opportunity.  Further measures are needed to take account of women's skills and needs in the labour market and in society generally.  We need more flexible pension arrangements to enable variable retirement ages and the combination of retirement and working income.  Further measures are also needed to integrate disabled people into mainstream society.  Much more needs to be done at every level, including education, better training and equal opportunities for men and women and social protection in our housing and health services.</P>
    <P>The greatest challenge to the welfare state in the short run seems to be the serious financial difficulties it has to face as a result of the demographic changes which are going to occur in this country. It is well known that over the coming decades there will be a considerable shift in the demographic structure of our population and an increasing number of older people will have to rely on the support of a shrinking number of people in the working age group.  By the year 2020 the ratio of people aged 65 years or over to those in the working age group will have increased by approximately 50 per cent.  This raises the issue of whether we can afford the additional estimated 9 per cent of gross domestic product which will be required in financing old age pensions and in the payment of unemployment benefit to approximately 450,000 people, which is what our unemployment rate is expected to reach by that year.</P>
    <P>There will be no easy options in the face of this fundamental change in our society.  Available resources will have to be shared between the old and the young and Governments are going to have to make difficult choices.  Some of these choices will involve the distributional conflict between the generations and we may have to promote private social security provisions.  This will have to be done <Col N="1525" /> to the extent of a reduced public provision, which will be hugely unpopular. It may be even necessary to extend the length of people's working lives rather than having to shorten it.  Nobody in the political arena is publicly prepared to face the difficulties ahead of this country in relation to social welfare provision.</P>
    <P>When do we as politicians get an opportunity to talk about social welfare provisions, the demographic changes that are going to take place and the choices that we as a people and as taxpayers are going to have to make?  Apart from a short debate on the Estimates and this debate on the Social Welfare Bill once a year, there are rarely other opportunities for Deputies or Senators to get together and talk about matters affecting social welfare.  The manner in which social welfare issues are dealt with by the Oireachtas is totally unsatisfactory. Given that the Department of Social Welfare spend almost £4 billion a year on social welfare payments, it is disgrace that we afford such little time for debate in this House.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Social Affairs should spend much more time on matters relating to social welfare and on examining the consequences of our social welfare policy.  The committee should have the ESRI working with it, which could act in the first instance as a research group to the committee and, second, as an outside independent group working on a consultative basis with members of the committee.  This committee could receive submissions from voluntary organisations and from the many people working with social welfare recipients and other deprived groups in our society. Many of these groups put much time and effort into preparing very detailed and worthwhile submissions but unfortunately feel they do not get very far.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for an increase in the high rate of child benefit. I welcome this increase because child benefit affects families with a large number of children and any improvement in child benefit is to be greatly welcomed. I support the view that the system of child dependent allowances in our social <Col N="1526" /> welfare system creates inequities between those families who are on social welfare and those families supported by low paid employment.  The best way of moving forward to eliminate these inequities is to promote the development at the highest possible rate of the child benefit system with a view to eliminating child dependent allowances and eventually incorporating a much improved child benefit system within the overall tax system.  This would eventually lead to the elimination of child additions to the income tax exemption limits and the elimination of the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>The system of child income support should be integrated in a way that would reduce the potential for unemployment and poverty traps and, added to the maintenance of the real value of social welfare benefits in general, would represent a socially responsible attempt to combine the overriding concern to promote employment growth with an effective strategy to secure the income position of the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for the restructuring of rates of PRSI contributions by employers.  The Progressive Democrats' priority is to increase sustainable employment and reduce unemployment. From studying certain key characteristics of the labour market we believe that reducing the cost of employing lower paid employees relative to the cost of production would make the most direct contribution to reducing unemployment. The structure of the present PRSI system means that it is regressive, increasing the cost of low paid labour more than high paid labour.  This follows from a contribution rate of PRSI from a flat rate up to a certain ceiling beyond which no further deductions are made.</P>
    <P>Any tax that makes the greatest impact on unskilled labour has two distinct disadvantages in seeking to reduce unemployment. Workers classified as unskilled are over represented on the live register. Such workers are potential employees in cost sensitive areas.  Employers in this area have to compete primarily on cost and any reduction in employer's liability <Col N="1527" /> for PRSI is to be welcomed.  The reduction envisaged in this section will do very little to promote employment or eliminate unemployment traps.  There is nothing in the provision that will make the transition from unemployment to low paid work any easier.  Unemployed people still perceive paid employment as a risk because it involves a reassessment of other means tested benefits such as medical card and rent allowance.  People are very concerned about this and are afraid to make the transition.  They feel that where they are they have a crutch and that they will lose this crutch if they move out of that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of a new survivor's pension scheme which provides for equal treatment for widows and widowers.  This new scheme has a number of shortcomings which my party has already highlighted and which I propose to continue highlighting here today. Under the new scheme widowers will qualify for a survivor's pension under the same conditions as currently apply in the case of widow's contributory pensions. The existing widow's contributory pension and the survivor's benefit schemes are incorporated into this new scheme.</P>
    <P>However, lifelong partners of men and women who are not married to each other but are cohabiting are excluded.  The Social Welfare Act, 1991 provided that in calculating the amount of certain social welfare allowances payable to any person, a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as husband and wife should have their needs and means aggregated and regarded as the needs and means of the claimant for certain social welfare means tested benefits.  I find it disturbing that one piece of social welfare legislation acknowledges the cohabiting situation, yet this piece of legislation which seeks to extend certain provisions to survivors ignores these very same people.  I put it to the Minister that he cannot have it both ways.  If he recognises men and women who are not married as a couple living together as man and wife, then on the death of one the surviving partner <Col N="1528" /> should have the same rights as any other couple.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this anomaly which has developed as a result of provisions brought forward in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke in his speech of what he is doing in relation to equality of treatment between men and women in the social welfare code.  This is one area where he is not living up to that brief. He is ignoring the fact that thousands of women in Ireland today are owed millions of pounds because of the Government's failure to implement an EU directive adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1979.  The Social Welfare (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1985 was to provide for the removal of discrimination in certain areas and I call on the Minister to ensure that all money outstanding to married women as a result of the changes to implement the principle of equality of treatment between men and women in matters of social welfare now be paid.</P>
    <P>I know that many women have received payment in this area.  Many of them have had to resort to solicitors in order to get the money due to them, but I know that many cases are still being taken against the Department.  I cannot understand why when this money is due to these women they have to go to the trouble of taking the Department to court in order to get what is their right.  I understand that cases are coming to court very shortly in relation to this matter and that they are very similar to cases which have already been settled.  The Minister should not force these people to undertake these proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill provides for a number of improvements in the provision for the assessment of means for social assistance payments.  Many changes have been made in relation to the calculation of means for various schemes but the Minister has ignored the fact that the means test needs to be completely overhauled. At present benefits and privileges are currently assessed as means under the unemployment assistance and the lone parents allowance schemes including supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that benefits and privileges should apply only in the case of single adults without dependants who are under 25 years of age and living in the parental home.  I know that a minimum of £10 will be paid as a result of the provisions of this Bill; however I believe and so does my party that it is the single biggest contributor to the growth in payment of rent supplement to single people. Senator Kelleher has also referred to this. Many young people are leaving home and moving into accommodation so as to claim the full unemployment assistance rate and they are also getting rent allowances up to £40 per week in some cases. This system is totally wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make some positive response in regard to this area of means testing.  We should not be encouraging young people to move out of their homes if they do not want to.  They should be given a choice, but many young people move out into substandard accommodation which the health board is effectively paying for.  They are doing this in order to receive their full social welfare assistance payments.  This matter should be looked at because if they want to move out, that is fair enough, but the system should not be driving them out.</P>
    <P>Another area which has been of contention for many years and which has not been addressed is the area of substitute payments.  At present outside of the Eastern Health Board area, claimants for unemployment assistance and other social assistance payments have to go through two means tests, one for the dependant's payment and a second means test for supplementary welfare allowance, which is a substitute payment while they are waiting for the payment from the Department.  It is not acceptable that a person should have to make two separate applications in two different offices when eventually the money is going to be paid out from the Department of Social Welfare.  At present 40 per cent of all expenditure on supplementary welfare allowance is a direct result of substitute payments and it is causing considerable aggravation, both within <Col N="1530" /> the heath boards and outside by clients looking for social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I will not have time to finish my speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told by people having to attend the Department of Social Welfare for one means test that they are then directed back to the health board for a substitute payment where they have to go through another means test.  This causes them much aggravation. I can understand how people get extremely difficult and get extremely annoyed with health board officials because they feel that they are entitled to this payment and they should not have to go through the two means tests.</P>
      <P>Because of changes in the contribution conditions for disability benefit and invalidity pension, an increasing number of people now find themselves with no entitlements to social welfare sickness payment.  These people initially are becoming long term recipients of supplementary welfare allowance, or where their illness is likely to continue they find themselves on the health board's disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme. Despite the fact that the Commission on Social Welfare recommended that all income maintenance schemes be administered by the Department of Social Welfare, this has not happened and I wish to ask the Minister about this.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, vigorous remedial action is needed to help those who feel that they are socially excluded and marginalised. We politicians have a duty to produce a long term strategy to limit poverty and social exclusion and to promote full social integration of all our people. There will have to be major changes in social welfare policies, education and training and regretfully this Bill does not deal in any way with any of these major issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton) Joan Burton">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start by making some general comments about this year's Social Welfare Bill <Col N="1531" /> which introduces a number of major reforms.  I must say, particularly to Senator Honan, that when the Progressive Democrats were in office, not too long ago, major changes often amounted to major cutbacks.  We are entitled to look at the record of her party when recently in office.  Nonetheless, some of her comments were very interesting.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare, one of the areas for which I have responsibility is the integration of tax and social welfare.  I set up an expert working group not to produce a long report but a series of implementable changes which could be introduced on a phased basis.  At this stage we have lots of reports on different features of Irish social structures many of which, unfortunately, end up gathering dust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this year's Social Welfare Bill I am pleased with the work of that expert group which comprises people from industry, the trade unions, the academic sector and organisations such as the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Social Services Board.  It represents those involved in the practical end of social welfare and those who have to live on a social welfare income.  A number of suggestions were made which have been acted upon in the Bill.  One of the most important areas is that of lone parents.  As a consequence of the recommendations of the working group, section 15 provides for a significant relaxation in the provision of means assessment for a loan parent's allowance.  This represents a progressive step and relates to a question raised in different ways by a number of Senators &mdash; how do you offer encouragement and support to people to take up opportunities for relatively low paid, part-time work?  The Bill replaces the existing child related earnings disregard of £6 per week with a flat rate disregard of £30 per week.  When the person's earnings exceed this amount the allowance will be reduced by £1 for each £2 of earnings, compared to the £1 for £1 rate which existed before.  That means there is a substantial relaxation of the means <Col N="1532" /> test for lone parents.  In other words, lone parents can now take on greater job opportunities without putting at risk their lone parent's benefit which is obviously so important.  It is also a practical way of recognising the cost of child care which is an important issue for lone parents. Over the next year it should mean that a substantially greater number of lone parents will be able to avail of work opportunities, full-time or part-time.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the working group concerned employers being responsible for levies on employees who have medical cards.  This measure has been widely welcomed both by employers and employees, and quite a number of people are affected by it.  This measure is in addition to the reduction in PRSI rates for people below the £9,000 level.  Statistics show that many people's earnings are below this level.  During the next year, these two measures, together with the extension of PRSI exemptions for employers taking on new and additional employees, will give a substantial boost to employment.  I am confident that, at the end of the year when the effect of these measures is demonstrated, we will be able to offer similar additional measures in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>We must make the social welfare system more friendly towards people attempting to return to the workforce on either a full or part-time basis.  Part of the problem with our social welfare system &mdash; which is so important as a concept of universal social protection for Irish society &mdash; is that the welfare state model we inherited related to a time when full employment was the norm.  It was a time when people often took up employment between 16 and 18 years of age, stayed with the same employer for the rest of their lives and then claimed their rightful social welfare pension based on a lifetime's contributions.  Unfortunately, the labour market is changing rapidly.  The European Union now describes typical employment as those on part-time or contract work, and in casual or on-call employment.  That is an increasing feature of the labour market. <Col N="1533" /> The social welfare system will have to be changed in a sensitive way to take account of these changes.</P>
    <P>We also have to look at the question of the social insurance system.  This Government is rightly committed to the maintenance of the social insurance system.  This Bill contains a number of significant extensions of the principle of social insurance without extra cost to either employers or employees.  At the same time we must look at the problem of part-time workers.  Some years ago, a general social reform relating to part-time employees having social insurance coverage on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, was welcomed by all parties but is now causing problems for on-call employees and other casual workers.  The Bill relaxes conditions relating to the substantial loss of employment rule, a point many Senators have raised both in this House and with  personally because of problems their constituents were experiencing.</P>
    <P>The question of providing income maintenance for certain groups of people needs to be examined.  Senator Honan referred to child benefit and I will have to study her remarks because I was not able to catch their full impact.  She may have been suggesting the amalgamation of child dependant allowances and child benefit into one payment which, I think she was implying, should then be taxed. I would have to study the full text of her remarks, although I think that is what she was suggesting.</P>
    <P>Suggestions like this are made &mdash; as in the case of the residential property tax and calls for its reform &mdash; and when the reform is introduced the parties, such as Senator Honan's party, which make such suggestions, rapidly run away from the idea.  However, I will study in detail the text of her proposals on possible changes in child benefit via the amalgamation of child dependant allowances and child benefit.</P>
    <P>In its last two budgets the Government substantially increased child benefit.  The recent ERSI report on poverty in Ireland, which is a summary of work done since the 1987 survey, strongly suggests that one of the best ways of assisting poor <Col N="1534" /> families is to increase child benefit.  This is precisely what the Government has done in this year's and last year's Social Welfare Bills.</P>
    <P>We might look at the same system for people with disabilities.  The Combat Poverty Agency carried out detailed research into the cost of living for disabled people.  Disabled people face additional living costs to those of able bodied people.  We must look at the question of the Department of Social Welfare taking over the payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance.  That and other developments in the social welfare system are currently being examined by the Department and a great deal of work has been done on that study.  We should also look at the question of the basic income needs of disabled people which are in excess of the ordinary income needs of able bodied people.  That examination is under way in the Department at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan voiced a query about disability benefit.  Over 200,000 claims for disability benefit are made each year. The number of appeals in 1992 was just over 4,000.  About 19 per cent of appeals are successful and 13 per cent of appeals are partially successful.  Senator Cregan also said that the introduction of the widower's pension or the survivor's pension for men was the result of a European Union requirement.  The European Union does not require us to introduce such a pension.  The pension was part of the Government's policy on equality of treatment.  Over 4,000 widowers will benefit from this measure.  It is a progressive social measure which shows that the principle of equality must work both ways and not simply in favour of women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Senator Cregan also referred to a contribution I made to the recent seminar on debt in the Lough parish centre in Cork.  I have a copy of my statement to the conference.  I do not know if Senator Cregan was in the audience but the case to which I referred <Col N="1535" /> was in a scientific report carried out by an independent firm of consultants which was presented to the conference.</P>
      <P>The report gave the example of an unfortunate lady who had got into trouble with her rent.  She had substantial rent arrears and the corporation or council to which the rent was owed would not take a partial payment.  I did not refer to either Cork County Council or Cork Corporation.  I told the conference that in travelling around the country I have the great privilege of meeting substantial numbers of people who work with community organisations and deal with problems such as debt and money lending.  I said that the problem of dealing with local authority rent arrears is very important for those who get into arrears. National statistics show that many local authorities are owed substantial amounts of money in rent.  I told the conference that the only local authorities about which I could speak from personal experience were the Dublin local authorities. The policy of collecting the rent the day before the social welfare payment is due &mdash; this unfortunately applies in parts of Dublin &mdash; can be part of the reason people get into debt.  Some local authorities will not accept part payment of arrears.  If a person is short in payment of rent the local authority will not accept a short payment.  That means that, in some cases, the problem of debt builds up to substantial proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the local representative intervenes most local authorities are quite accommodating in reaching an agreement with the tenant.  However, it should not reach that point.  The local authority rent collection system should be sufficiently flexible and responsive to the needs of tenants, particularly those on social welfare income, that it does everything possible to encourage the tenants to pay all or part of their rent.  My Department is introducing a system of household budgeting &mdash; which is meeting with substantial public popularity &mdash; which will allow people to nominate part or full payment of their rent and or other bills from their social welfare payments.  In an <Col N="1536" /> age of computerisation local authority rent collection procedures must be made as modern and as sensitive as possible to the needs of the local authority customers.</P>
    <P>I repeat, the case I quoted to the conference is from a consultant's report which was before the conference and which was not queried.  I made no specific reference to Cork Corporation.  I referred to the general problem of rent collection in local authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan also asked about the cost of administering the family income supplement.  I have taken a very detailed interest in family income supplement since I came into office.  Since September of last year, due to administrative work in the Department of Social Welfare with employers, we have increased the take up of family income supplement by 25 per cent.  In addition, we have included further improvements in this year's Social Welfare Bill which make it an attractive payment for families on low income, particularly those with more than two or three children.  It is an area that could see substantial additional improvements. The current cost of administration is about £700,000.  The scheme could be substantially improved and the expert working group, to which I referred, is currently working on that aspect.</P>
    <P>Later in the year, through work on the Department of Social Welfare's administrative and computer systems, we hope to be able to identify those families which may be entitled to benefit from family income supplement.  We will write to those families to notify them that the benefit exists and suggest that they avail of it.  The take-up rate for the benefit is below what it ought to be.  I am confident that this time next year we will be able to report that the 25 per cent increase of last September to December, which was based on the first trawl of the administrative records of the Department of Social Welfare, will have been surpassed this year.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis mentioned the black economy and the question of fraud in the social welfare system.  This year the Department of Social Welfare anticipates <Col N="1537" /> about 10,000 visits to and investigations of employers to ensure that all employees are complying with social welfare requirements.  This will have two effects: it will identify those people who are working and claiming and, if one employer in a town or village can operate through the black economy and another employer is operating legitimately and the employees are contributing their share of tax and social insurance, the legitimate employer is at a considerable commercial disadvantage.  In terms of competition alone, we must address this problem.  The Department of Social Welfare is devoting considerable additional resources to this matter.  I am an accountant by profession.  Since my appointment the Department has employed four professional accountants.  The Department is also in the process of creating a professional audit structure on employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>More professional people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal that can be done practically to identify those employers and employees who may be escaping their obligations.  If an employee is avoiding the social welfare system, the day will come when they may no longer be employed and will have no entitlements.  Everybody in this House would be aware of sad cases like this where people who may have worked in the black economy may end up with no entitlements, particularly as they grow older.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare has been sponsoring the VTOS and the return to education initiatives in conjunction with the Department of Education. There are now 4,500 people in both full time second and third level educational courses.  The possibilities for participation and numbers are substantially higher.  Indeed, the Department anticipates the numbers will increase by several thousand over the next couple of years. The one aspect that the ERSI study on poverty, which was published last week, constantly shows is that those who have both second and further educational <Col N="1538" /> qualifications have a better chance of getting employment over their lifetime than somebody who leaves school early. Giving people as much access as possible to education and training, in terms of access to the labour market, is critical to improving their chances of getting employment.  There are currently 4,500 people so employed.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh referred to the costs of VTOS courses to the vocational education committee and I will take his points up with the Minister for Education. Another item raised by a number of Senators, most specifically by Senator Sherlock, was the operation of the community welfare officer system.  The Department of Social Welfare is anticipating a number of developments in this area.  Substantial investment is taking place in expanded computer facilities which should enable most interim payments to be dealt with directly by the Department of Social Welfare over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher referred to the one-stop shop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why it should not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Member would agree that a system which makes a person go from their local social welfare office to the community welfare officer and then to the FÁS office should be ended; there should be a one-stop shop.  I would hope that most interim payments would be brought directly within the ambit of the Department of Social Welfare on a countrywide basis within the next couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special needs payments were also mentioned by Senator Sherlock and Senator Henry.  There is currently sitting under the chairmanship of the Department of Social Welfare a committee consisting of members of both this Department and the health boards on improving the community welfare officer structure for special needs payments.  The amount of detailed information which until now has been available to the Department on this area has been limited.  In the past year <Col N="1539" /> we have been in receipt of increasing amounts of information which will enable us to identify the recipients of special needs payments, the amounts of money they are getting and what types of payments they are receiving.  That sort of detailed information has not, unfortunately, been available to the Department until recently.  It is now becoming available.</P>
    <P>Many Senators made the point that many young people were leaving home to take advantage of a rent allowance and a full social welfare payment.  The results of a national survey of the incidence and extent of this practice should be available later in the year, which will enable us to make some decisions.  It is not universally accepted that this is the principal reason young people are leaving home, although most public representatives are aware of it as causing a problem.  Public representatives from County Cork have mentioned it as a feature of life among young people there.  Some proposals for change or amendment which will substantially improve the situation could then be put forward.</P>
    <P>This year we have also, as promised, published guidelines on special needs payments.  Previously, these guidelines were not published.  They are now available in a leaflet from the Department of Social Welfare.  The new system of referring those with fuel, ESB and gas company debts has been in operation for four months.  We are awaiting detailed information on the workings of the new system.  Senator Sherlock highlighted the fact that the outcome after going to a community welfare officer is often not the same for any two people.  How the community welfare officer exercises his discretion is not always understood by the person seeking assistance from them. I hope substantial improvements will be made to that system within the next year.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the staff in the Department of Social Welfare having improved substantially over the years.  I accept that compliment on behalf of the staff.  The aim of the Department is to provide information to people about <Col N="1540" /> their rights and, where people have an established right to something, to deliver that right with all the dignity that person deserves, whether in receipt of a pension, an allowance or a benefit.  Many of these improvements were made possible by the extra resources made available to the Department, not only in terms of computerisation but also in the training programme which the Department has given to its staff.  This year the Department is sponsoring a training course for community welfare officers which we hope will be the beginning of a systematic improvement in the delivery of their system.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the recently published ERSI report, which was based on the 1987 household survey.  This survey has been important in informing policy as far as poverty, social welfare and other issues are concerned.  One of the commitments we made was to revamp that survey this year.  While the general principles of the 1987 data are relevant, we need to review the current position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have to.  There are 300,000 unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondary benefits, which would not have been an important feature of the 1987 survey, would now seem to have a greater prominence.  For example, there is the question of losing one's medical card if one takes up employment.  I am pleased to say that we have set aside £150,000 in the budget this year to redo that survey, which will be carried out by the Department of Social Welfare in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI.  The final detailed negotiations are now underway. In addition, Ireland will be participating in a European panel survey about income issues which will question a substantial number of the population.  This will take place on an annual basis.  In future we will have more detailed information on which to base policy, rather than basing it on hearsay and mythology, which tends to happen in regard to social welfare issues.  For example, one hears about a <Col N="1541" /> particular instance which is often exaggerated out of all proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESRI publication referred to the importance of child benefit and access to education in relation to improving the life chances of poor people.  The survey also questioned an area based approach to poverty.  The large areas of unemployment in the centre of Dublin city and in the suburbs, in parts of Cork city and <Col N="1542" /> Limerick, and the problems which exist in some poverty stricken urban areas require special targeted attention.  A new factor which may emerge from redoing the survey this year is that in some areas, particularly in our large cities, there is a danger that generations of families risk unemployment.  The Government must tackle this problem as a priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section outlines different dates for payment increases. The dates for the various increases in payments go from 21 July to 29 July.  Why is there a difference?  I can understand that there could be a difference of six days in the payment of the increase, but I do not understand why there should be a difference of seven or eight days. Would the Minister explain that?  If the increases in some of the contributory pensions and allowances are being held back until 29 July, what on average would be the saving to the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The dates are the normal dates when the payments fall to be made.  The difference is that some payments are made a week in advance and others a week in arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator asked about advancing all payments to April.  The extra cost of <Col N="1543" /> doing that would be £30 million this year. I appreciate that this is desirable but my first objective is to have the rates increased so that those rates are fixed from a given day forward.  If the Senator was in my position he would also seek that first, although it would be desirable to bring the increases further forward over time.  The implementation dates were later in previous years but they have now been returned to July.</P>
    <P>The full year value of the increases for pensioners, widows, widowers, etc., is £168 million.  We tend to concentrate on that in the first instance but the cost of bringing the payments forward this year would be £30 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand most of what the Minister said.  I did not ask about the £30 million saving in the year, I was inquiring about the saving in the week. The increases in unemployment benefit will be paid on 21 July 1994.  Increases in death benefit, old age contributory pensions, survivor's benefit, widow's contributory and non-contributory pensions and orphan's contributory allowances will be paid on 29 July; a difference of eight days.  If a payment is to be made on 29 July there must also be one on 22 July.  Why can the increase not be given then?  Since people on unemployment benefit receive their increases on 21 July, why can the others not receive an increase in the same week?</P>
      <P>Increases in disability benefit, injury benefit, and disablement pension will be made on 25 July.  Their increase is obviously in the same week as 21 July but I cannot understand the reason for a difference of eight days between increases.  Are we making a saving by denying people who could be in need of an increase at the earlier date of 22 July? Why can they not receive the increase when other people on social welfare are receiving theirs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always said that everyone should receive the same allowance and be paid at the same time.  There is no reason these people should not be given the increase on 22 July.  There should not be an eight <Col N="1544" /> day difference between dates on which increased payments are made, especially to people on the poverty line.</P>

      <P>Section 3 (2) (a) relates to the increases in unemployment benefit on 21 July.  Section 3 (2) (c) relates to retirement pension, invalidity pension and deserted wife's benefit, increases for which will be paid on 28 July.  There seems to be a difference there but the payments are actually the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the reason they are the same is that the short-term payments are made a week in arrears while the long-term payments are made a week in advance.  The payments are in respect of the same week.  That is the way the two systems operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the reason for that because the difference is seven days. However my difficulty is with section 3 (2) (d), under which increases are made on 29 July.  If these increases are in advance, unlike the short term payments, the increase should be given on 22 July. Why is it not being given on that date? What is the saving to the State by not paying it on that date?  The people affected by paragraph (d) are not being given an increase on 22 July, even though their payments are a week in advance and others are a week in arrears.  Could those increases not have been made on 22 July?</P>
      <P>I am not questioning the increases on 28 July.  The Department is entitled to do that and it is a good tactical and financial move.  I appreciate that the Minister wants to obtain the money first and then decide what day payments should be made.  However, there is a difference of eight days between the increases given on 21 July and 29 July.  Why can that increase not be given on the 22 July? What saving is made by deferring the increase for a week?</P>

      <P>Senator Cregan mentioned paragraph (d), which refers to widow's <Col N="1545" /> contributory pension and orphan's contributory allowance.  Their day of payment is different to that for retirement and other pensions.  The reason is that post offices would be cluttered if all the payments were on the same day and the volume would be unmanageable.  There is no other reason for the payments being made on different days.  Essentially, the increases are being given in the last week in July.  If everything was to be put forward by a week, some would still be paid a week before others but the cost this year would be one-fifty second part of the total increases.  One would divide the total by the number of weeks &mdash; I will get the figure for the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says all payments cannot be made on one day from post offices and Garda barracks.  I am not asking for that.  Increases in unemployment benefit are being made on 21 July; the previous day for payment was 14 July.  Paragraph (d) refers to old age contributory pension, survivor's benefit, widow's contributory pensions and orphan's contributory allowance.  Such payments will be made on 15 July. Increases to those payments could be made on 22 July if they can be made on 29 July.</P>
      <P>The people affected are at a disadvantage compared to those in the other categories.  They are losing a week's increase.  All the other increases are being made within one week &mdash; between 21 and 28 July.  Those affected by this paragraph could and should have their increase on 22 July because everyone else will receive an increase in that week &mdash; on 21 July, 25 July or 28 July.  Those being paid increases on 29 July are losing a week's increase and that is unfair.  This matter should be examined.</P>

      <P>The 29th would be the equivalent day if one takes the 365 days from the last increase the previous year and on the other matter, it is 365 days from that increase.  There is no difference in that sense.  Section 4 deals with assistance and the same point arises.  The short term payments are paid in arrears. <Col N="1546" /> Consequently, given that unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are two short term payments, they will be paid in arrears&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but we are entitled to speak to the section.  If I do that and the clarification is insufficient, I am entitled to question it again and I intend to do that.  There is an inherent unfairness here and everybody can see it. This problem arises in section 4 and I intend to speak on that also if I do not get a satisfactory answer.</P>
      <P>Is it necessary to be unfair to the people covered by paragraph (d), those on old age contributory pensions, survivor's benefit, widow's contributory pensions and orphan's contributory allowances? We should not be unfair to these people. They should have received consideration before others covered in the same section.  The Minister said the date is relevant to the 365 days since the previous increase.  How could that be when other payments have been delayed this year, such as child related benefits which will not be paid until September?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difference of eight days or more here and given the postal problems, there could be a difference of ten days or more.  People are not being paid in time because of the postal problems.  Can the <Col N="1547" /> Minister imagine a situation where a person on unemployment benefit receives an increase on the 21st but his cousin next door, who is due payment on the 22nd, does not?  People due to be paid on the 25 and 28 July will receive increases but some may have to wait from 15 July until 29 July, a two week period, to get their increase.  This is wrong.  There is an inherent unfairness here.  Why did the Department not consider paying an increase on 22nd July, having paid an increase to others on 21 July?  If I receive a satisfactory answer which is fair to the less well off, I will agree to this section. I am entitled to a satisfactory reply but I am not getting it.  There is a nine day difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a limit on the extent to which I can go on explaining this matter.  These are the equivalent dates for these payments.  I explained that short-term payments are made in arrears while the others are made in advance. Consequently, there is no discrimination. It is the normal procedure each year that increases are paid on the different days of payment.  In this instance, it arises in the last week of the month, on the date on which the payment should be made.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is very important because it gives substantial increases.  Its total effect will mean that a couple on disability benefit or unemployment benefit, with two children, will now receive £124 a week, representing a 6.6 per cent increase.  A couple on disability benefit or unemployment benefit, with four children, will get £150.40 a week, an increase of 5.7 per cent.  A couple on invalidity pension, with two children, where the claimant is over the age of 66, will get £142.70 a week, an increase of £12 or 9.18 per cent. These figures illustrate the point, and my remarks also apply to section 4.  This is an important section and the cost of the social insurance and the occupational injuries benefit increases is £83 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to show disrespect to the Minister but I wish to <Col N="1548" /> clarify the point.  He said that everything is paid on the last pay day of July.  In that case, the Bill is incorrect because 20 and 21 July are not the last pay days in July. There are a further seven days.  If everything is relevant to the last pay week of July, then payments on 20 and 21 July should not be paid; we are being unfair to this group who will be paid on 29 July. There is no reason they cannot be paid. Why did the Minister not save the State a great deal of money by bringing payments due on 21 July forward to 28 July, and payments due on 20 July forward to 27 July?  Everybody would then have been treated the same.  However, the Minister did not do that.  One group will be paid on 29 July and that is most unfair. This cannot go unnoticed and others should also point it out.  We are talking about people who are more in need, than those who are receiving payments on 21, 25 and 28 July.  Why can these people not be paid on 22 July?  The same point arises on section 4.  The Minister said the increases are paid in the final days of July but that is not so because 20 or 21 July are not the final days of the month.  I cannot understand the situation; it is unfair.  Others agree with me and if the Minister examines it once more he will see that it is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the date in the Bill is 21 July, and because short-term payments are made in arrears, both would be paid on 28 July.  They are both equal in that sense; this is basically the point. I accept the Senator's general point in relation to early payments.  However, he recognises my point about the annual allocation of moneys.  If the Senator was in my position, he would opt for the higher rates of increases, such as the 6.6 per cent and the 10 per cent.  Having done that, he might then find there was no money to proceed with the £30 million needed to advance it further.  We will keep the situation under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. I have met cute operators in the Cabinet and I will not take from the Minister. However, I ask him to tell someone who <Col N="1549" /> is receiving the orphan's contributory allowance that he will not receive his increase until a full nine days &mdash; and if the post is late, 11 days &mdash; after someone else has already received their increase. It is all very well to speak of one being paid in advance and the other in arrears, but how is this to be explained to the people concerned?</P>
      <P>Bills such as this do not allow for the way ordinary people think and this measure gives an advantage to the Department of Social Welfare and a disadvantage to those who are less well off.  If an increase is provided on the 21st of the month, then it should be effective for the full week within which that date falls and this should apply in respect of similar increases provided under other benefits. As it is presently constituted, the measure is unfair.  However, I agree to the section.</P>

      <P>Section 4 (2) (b) states that the section will come into operation &ldquo;in so far as it relates to supplementary allowance, on the 25th day of July, 1994.&rdquo; The Minister of State discussed on Committee Stage, as the Minister and other Ministers for Health have discussed previously, the possibility of combining supplementary benefit with supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that people have difficulties from time to time with supplementary welfare officers in various parts of the country, such as the part of Cork city where I live.  May I ask the Minister if it is now recognised that all allowances, whether it be supplementary benefit, supplementary welfare or rent allowance, should be under the Department of Social Welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot but speak well of the social welfare officers who operate in my part of Cork city, but their task is made difficult <Col N="1550" /> under the present structures.  There is a strong argument to be made, referred to by the Minister of State on Committee Stage, for a restructuring to allow for the inclusion of all benefits under the one Department.  In this respect is the Department of Social Welfare under its present structures fully in control of the problems in society which apply to its area of responsibility?</P>
    <P>The social welfare officers deal directly with the less well off and those who find it difficult to compete, to live and to handle matters generally.  In this respect I referred on Committee Stage to the points raised by the Minister of State at the recent conference on debt at the Lough parish centre in Cork.  She responded to my remarks on Second Stage, but regrettably I did not have the opportunity to comment.  However, the point at issue is relevant to social welfare and supplementary welfare as there is a general impression that there is generally no cohesive approach by the various relevant authorities who contribute to the less well off in society.</P>
    <P>The Minister, unfairly, made a strong argument against local authorities.  As a former Lord Mayor of Cork city, I investigated my local authority and was aggrieved that the Minister gave the impression that unfair tactics were employed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    </Speaker>
    <P>Auditor's reports on local authorities &mdash; and I speak to you, Sir, as a member of a local authority yourself &mdash; are pressing authorities to recoup moneys owed to them.  While one Minister of State has one view on local authorities, others are pressing them to collect moneys owed to them.  In view of this confusion it is <Col N="1551" /> important to clarify the facts and to have one policy for dealing with those who cannot deal with themselves.  As matters stand, one Minister says one thing, another Minister says another and the impression is therefore given that people are not being looked after, which is not true.  The opposite is the case.  For example, Cork city alone is owed in the region of £800,000, which is a serious matter.</P>

      <P>The Senator has raised a number of points which he also addressed on Second Stage.  He mentioned the role of the Department of Social Welfare, how broad this role should be and what it should encompass, especially in relation to the disabled person's maintenance allowance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>I believe &mdash; and my colleague, the Minister for Health, is in agreement &mdash; that it would be better to have the disabled person's maintenance allowance within the Department of Social Welfare as it is a payment which is the last line of defence and it covers an area where there must be discretion.  In this regard Senator McGennis spoke of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and the community welfare officers and congratulated the officers on the work they undertake.  While there are community welfare officers who are difficult or who have a bad moment, they undertake a difficult job well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This favourable view of community welfare officers is prevalent and was reflected in the contributions to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most cost effective way to address this issue would be to have it dealt with by one Department and I do not differ from the Senator's views on this point. However, there is a great deal of streamlining and organisation to take place in order to arrive at this point.  In this respect we are endeavouring to improve <Col N="1552" /> and streamline the delivery of the supplementary welfare allowances in consultation with the health boards.</P>
    <P>This programme is under the auspices of the health boards at present.  This presents a difficulty for us, because we pay the final sum but we do not administer it.  If questions are raised in the Dáil or the Seanad on this issue, we answer them; yet we do not control the administration of the programme.  I find this especially frustrating.  I have no objection to answering for measures which we implement; however, the administration of this programme is not within the Department of Social Welfare and consequently we are dealing with it at arm's length.</P>
    <P>The supervisors among the community welfare officers have been co-operating with my Department recently to streamline the methods in an attempt to secure as uniform an approach as possible throughout the country and they are making considerable progress in this area.  In addition, the computerisation needs must be met and the Senator will find in our Estimates this year that there is a considerable increase in the computerisation allowances, because we are endeavouring to build up a system that will deal with all these short term payments as efficiently as we can deal with the longer term payments.  My priority is to have the entire system streamlined to ensure that a better service may be provided and, following on that, we will consider how we can relate with the health boards regarding the disabled person's maintenance allowance and the supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>The Senator has raised an interesting general point regarding this issue, because if the co-ordination which people continually speak of is to be achieved, it would be better to have more of these allowances and benefits within a single Department.  This is a matter which can be considered further in the future.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to Cork and the money lending programme which I launched there.  One of the aspects I noted on that occasion, which the media did not take up, was that we had had <Col N="1553" /> especially good co-operation from the local authority.  The Minister of State said some local authorities are reluctant to become involved in the system.  I understand this reluctance because it affects rent collectors and their volume of work in the future.  Local authorities must work that out in accordance with their circumstances. We are being asked to provide a better service, but this is a barrier to doing so.  Senator Cregan mentioned Cork where the local authority was particularly helpful in regard to those developments.  Cork has also set a standard in regard to tackling the money lending problem.</P>
    <P>I introduced the household budgeting scheme approximately three years ago. Although the scheme has been in operation for only a few months, the number participating continues to increase.  It involves a lot of money, approximately £2 million each year.  Although a facility for rent is not available, we want to be helpful in that regard.  We took the initiative and introduced legislation to implement this, but it takes time to put it into practice.  As regards the situation in Cork outlined by Senator Cregan, the local authority there co-operated with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (c) states &ldquo;the 28th day of July&rdquo;, while section 3 (d) states &ldquo;the 29th day of July&rdquo;.  Those receiving contributory and non-contributory pensions and allowances will suffer most in regard to the increases and this is unfair.  We have been helpful and I know what the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, said that day.  Unfortunately, the press gave the impression that local authorities did not care about the less well off.  In the Cork region approximately 77 per cent of those in local authority welfare assisted accommodation are on social welfare.  It is unfair to give the impression that local authorities do not care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards welfare officers, I cannot speak highly enough of two such people in north and south Cork.  I will not name them, but the Minister knows the people to whom I refer.  Those in need of assistance speak well of these people.  When <Col N="1554" /> considering what should be done about allowances, including rent, welfare, etc., the Minister should set up a system whereby those involved in these areas would be under one structure.  These people have experience which is second to none.  We have discussed many issues in this House over the years.  The Minister introduced the household budgeting scheme relating to the payment of electricity, gas, etc.  This is a good scheme, which costs £2 million annually.  Rent should be included in this scheme and we must talk to local authorities about this.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are extremely important to the less well off.  Teachers, mechanics and others involved in them deserve great credit.  In Cork credit unions have put the loan sharks in shallow water.  When looking at supplementary welfare allowances, I ask the Minister to consider those familiar with them.  If we make one payment, we must not aggravate the present unemployment situation.  There is no answer to this problem and the Minister must not say there is in this or any other Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State replied to points made by Senator Cregan.  There were, and still are, problems with some local authorities.  Senator Cregan also mentioned credit unions.  I worked with the credit unions, which are independent, and this was successful.  In Cork money lending is on the decline and efforts in that regard are beginning to pay off.  Changes cannot be made overnight; they take time to come into effect.  It has taken some time to reach this stage and it is about to snowball.  We are particularly pleased with the household budgeting scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the budget debate on 27 January I announced a number of improvements to the free schemes operated by my Department.  Improvements affecting the free telephone rental allowance will come into operation next July.  A pensioner being cared for by the recipient of a carer's allowance will in future retain entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance.  Previously it would have been discontinued because the living alone <Col N="1555" /> condition, which had to be satisfied for receipt of the allowance, would no longer have been satisfied.  That is an important development.  A pensioner, aged 75 or over, who no longer lives alone will retain entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>In circumstances where someone comes to live with the pensioner, the allowance will be retained by the pensioner and it will not be discontinued as in the past because the living alone conditions ceased to be satisfied.  In order to avoid creating anomalies between pensioners over 75 years in different family circumstances, the free telephone rental allowance will be available from next July to all pensioners aged 75 or over who reside with one other person, their spouse, a family member or a companion, subject to the normal conditions which apply.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan recognises the difference in this regard.  The extra cost is not great because there are different circumstance in the social welfare area. These arrangements will apply across the board.  I am pleased to make this announcement introducing these improvements, which will be of benefit to many pensioners.  Having looked at the situation, we were in a position to take that further step.</P>

      <P>These measures are important.  A telephone means a lot to people living alone.  We now recognise that it is better for people not to live alone and we are giving assistance to those who are prepared to look after relatives.  This assistance does not cost a lot as the telephone line is already connected. We should not forget that they only get the benefit of a free telephone line.  In other countries it is only necessary to pay for calls and one does not pay <Col N="1556" /> a fee for one's telephone line.  I congratulate the Minister on this but it is only what I expect of him.  Free telephone lines should be provided for family units which look after elderly people.  This would cost little.  A family unit should be defined.  It could be defined as consisting of three or more people.  Providing free telephones for such people may encourage many people who live on their own at present to live with their sons or daughters. We can learn from other countries how important it is to have our elders living among us.</P>

I have spoken about this for many years and have always argued that the payment should be made directly to the employee. I do not want the spouse going to a post office or a Garda station to collect it. Family income supplement is paid to families with one child and whose weekly income is less than £185.  The gross weekly income of a family with four children must be less than £245 if they are to be entitled to this supplement.  I would prefer to see the wife paid the supplement through her husband.

      <P>I will rephrase this if the Minister or Senators wish.  The spouse, or other person, goes to a post office or Garda station to collect the benefit.  Is benefit paid to the family, the wife or husband, or both?</P>

      <P>I welcome this provision and the increase of £10 in the weekly limits below which families qualify for family income supplement.  The Commission on the Status of Women recommended that the supplement be paid to the spouse caring for children.  This recommendation is fair.  Family income supplement is one way by which the State can help people with children.  We also have child benefit, child dependent allowances and additions to the taxation exemption limits.  The rate of child benefit has been increased for the third and subsequent children.  I welcome this improvement.  Child dependent allowances can create inequities between families on social welfare and those depending on low paid employment.  The Progressive Democrats would like to see substantial increases in child benefit. When this is achieved we could eliminate other support systems, such as child dependent allowances, additions to the tax exemption limits and, eventually, family income supplement.  This could not be done until there are substantial increases in child benefit, which could eventually be brought into the tax net. This would maximise the amounts available for redistribution to those most in need.  I welcome in the meantime the increases in the income limits for family income supplement.  It should continue to be paid to those who care for children.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement regulations allow a claimant to nominate her or his spouse as an agent for the collection of the weekly payment.  Normally it is the wife who collects it, but the option is there for the husband to do so. As Senator Honan said, it is normally paid to the primary care giver.  This was recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women.  All family income supplement payments are currently made by <Col N="1558" /> post offices.  This is a very simple system. The spouse, normally the mother, is used to going to the post office with a child benefit book and there is no stigma attached to this because everyone with children has one.  In effect, collecting family income supplement is much the same as collecting child benefit and this is what makes it so acceptable.  It is a good system because it is paid for a year and is re-assessed after this period.  Once people become used to this system, it is simple to operate.</P>
      <P>A recent survey showed the occupational breakdown of FIS recipients; it is interesting: agricultural workers accounted for 3.5 per cent of recipients; skilled workers in manufacturing accounted for 18.8 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, skilled workers in manufacturing industry; labourers and unskilled workers amounted to 43.5 per cent; transport, communications and storage workers accounted for 16.4 per cent; clerical workers accounted for 4.9 per cent; workers in commerce, insurance and finance accounted for 9.4 per cent; service workers and defence workers, that is, members of the Garda, the Defence Forces, etc. accounted for 1.7 per cent and 0.16 per cent respectively; and others accounted for 0.74 per cent of claimants.  Sometimes people are confused when they see skilled workers or workers in commerce, insurance and finance claiming FIS.  However, such workers may have big families and this scheme provides family support.</P>
      <P>I remember a newspaper article about workers in the Army and the Garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the headline was that it was disgraceful that these people were applying for the family income supplement. However, it only applies to large families.  It works out at 0.16 per cent of the total, which puts it in perspective. The system supports families <Col N="1559" /> and it does not matter what kind of job one has.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan spoke about not creating a situation where employers could abuse the scheme and try to keep people on low incomes.  There is no evidence of that but I accept the point he made on Second Stage that one must always keep an eye on this.  The system is working well and the Minister of State mentioned possible future developments in relation to our ability to pinpoint people.  That is increasing all the time as we improve our systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is costing £700,000 to implement this scheme.  There has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of people who have availed of this scheme over the last year.  Almost 19 per cent of skilled workers in manufacturing areas have availed of it.  In other words, because of this entitlement to a supplement there is a basic wage for those who are aware of it and apply for it, but how well are we selling it?  Many people are not aware of it or are too proud to avail of it.  Only 19 per cent of skilled workers were prepared to apply for it. This is an indication of how serious the problem is, particularly in middle class areas; 46 per cent of unskilled workers applied.</P>
      <P>Every person working who has a family is entitled to a basic wage whether they get it from the State or their employer.  I have always said that is a good idea but I wonder if we are selling it properly. There is a perceived danger that if we do sell it properly it might cost too much because many people might realise that they have less money than their neighbour who is in the same job but is receiving the FIS.  I am not saying it is a danger because this is a right to which people are entitled under the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person with three children with a weekly family income of less than £225 is entitled to supplementary benefit.  His employer is paying 12.2 per cent in PRSI and he is paying 9 per cent.  Why do we not tell the employer that instead of giving the contribution to the State he <Col N="1560" /> should give it directly to the employee because we are giving it to him anyway? These matters should be simplified.  Can I get a reply to that or am I talking nonsense?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement is a significant part of the income of families on those income levels.  It is important that people are aware of their entitlements.  There was a poster campaign a year or two ago which was effective and helped to bring the extra 25 per cent into the net, plus other measures which were taken by the Department. The Minister probably shares the view that we need to let people know, as far as we can, that family income supplement exists and is available to people on lower incomes.</P>
      <P>I do not know the exact percentage of people entitled to it who actually claim it, but some years ago figures were given and about half of the families who were entitled to FIS claimed it.  I would be interested to know what the percentages are now since the amount has substantially improved with the 25 per cent increase.  I support the view that that message should be got out to the public because it will make a significant difference to people on a lower income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator O'Sullivan said.  All of us agree that people who are entitled to FIS should be getting it.  The Minister of State indicated that the Department would be using whatever figures are available &mdash; from taxation returns, etc. &mdash; and would be writing to people it thinks would be entitled to this family income supplement. This should be done because a number of people are not aware of it and this family income supplement would be of huge benefit to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to encourage these people to stay at work because sooner or later they might realise they would be better off living on social welfare, a situation we do not want.  It is vital that people in low paid jobs and entitled to family income supplement are made aware of it.  I would like to see an extensive campaign making <Col N="1561" /> people aware of their rights.  However, from what the Minister of State said, that seems to be the intention of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the takeup in the past year has been because of the extra money provided.  It was increased by about £20 last year.  This has been well advertised and people have been told about it by their trade unions because we co-operated with ICTU in getting the message across.  Everybody who looks for their tax free allowances gets this advice and it is in child benefit books.  As Senator O'Sullivan said, there have been advertising programmes each year and we will have another one now to highlight the position when this Bill passes.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to studies by economists and sociologists who conduct surveys and estimate how many people might be eligible.  However, the Department knows what money people are getting because if somebody is asked in a survey at the door how much they are getting they will not mention the extra cash they get here and there.  However, applicants must state what their income is.  We found people had higher incomes in practice than was indicated in surveys. Initial figures suggested that about 30,000 people should qualify but only 13,000 to 15,000 qualified.  It looks as if we are beginning to catch up on those figures because it is coming close to 10,000 at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are not so slow as is suggested from time to time.  It is always a great line for the newspapers to say that nobody is availing of the scheme.  There are very few of our schemes which people do not know something about.  I admit there are complications because one may be due one main benefit but not realise one is also eligible for subsidiary benefits.  This scheme has been advertised very widely and we will have another campaign to highlight the position when this Bill is passed.  I always claimed that the studies were wrong, but there is no point saying that publicly because people would say that it was only sour grapes and time <Col N="1562" /> would be wasted on a row.  I believed the figures were wrong at the time but that what really mattered was putting money into the scheme.  When the money was increased the support went to the children and more people came into the scheme.  That is what I believe happened last year.  That does not take from the fact that one has to advertise and I agree with what has been said.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan asked about the total cost, which is now £21.5 million, so it is not inconsequential money.  It is a substantial amount and, in fairness to successive Governments, they have never balked at providing that money as it is almost an incentive to work.</P>

      <P>It is also giving support to families.  It is important that people know it is there for families on low and medium incomes.  As Senator Cregan pointed out, the rates are quite high and go up to £324 in the case of a large family.  It reflects the needs of families and provides direct support for them.  In that sense it is very good and this development will again go beyond the rate of wage increases or inflation.  It goes a step further, which is certainly very welcome, and I know it is welcomed by Senators generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the cost of the scheme is nearly £22 million. I cannot emphasise enough the return on that money.  The Minister hit the nail on the head when he mentioned the need to get people to work and to tell them that it is better to go to work.  Senator Kelleher spoke about the danger of giving the impression that one is better off not working.  We should not create that impression as there is too much of it already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with the family unit where there are children.  It is important to the family unit that a partner is going out to work, whether it is the husband or the wife.  It is particularly important to men and I say that with sincerity.  It is also important to the spouse that her husband is working.  It is very important <Col N="1563" /> and I cannot emphasise it enough.  A family with three children and an income of £225 a week gross is entitled to a supplementary benefit.</P>
    <P>I ask again if we could save the £700,00 and allocate it elsewhere by having the supplement paid directly by the employer?  The person would not get almost 22 per cent of his £225 as a supplement. Why not pay it to them directly without giving them the hassle of going somewhere else to get it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier, the Senator was concerned about the possibility of employers abusing the situation.  We have to be careful about that The scheme works very simply at the moment and with great dignity for the individual concerned. I do not think they want the employers involved in it too much.  The Minister for State talked a little earlier about integration, which will offer all these options.  However, one will still have to decide even at that stage which option&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Senators Cregan, Kelleher, O'Sullivan and Honan would be the first people to say that integration is all very well, but if that is what it means to the individual they are not keen on certain aspects of it.  That issue will arise once full integration becomes a real possibility.  In the meantime we are progressing with the integration of the systems and we are doing it reasonably carefully.  Senators will certainly have an opportunity to talk about these issues before they go too far.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Subparagraph (i) of paragraph (d) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> ...at the rate of 9 per cent, of the amount of the reckonable earnings in that week to which such payment related where those reckonable earnings do not exceed £173 [gross], (or the equivalent thereof in the case of an employed contributor remunerated otherwise than on a weekly basis)</P>
    <P>The Junior Minister spoke earlier about the number of jobs created through the PRSI exemption scheme over the last two years.  Some 3,370 jobs were created over the last two years under the new scheme. Employers under the new scheme can take additional employees from the live register at a reduction in PRSI payments from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent. Employers in particular are saying that taking on people is not worth the cost, which is far too high.</P>
    <P>I do not think the new employer's PRSI exemption scheme created many jobs.  I thought it would create more over a two year period.  Some 2,000 jobs a year is not a great number, given the exemption scheme.  We may be better off extending it to all employees who earn less than £173.  I appreciate what that would cost. We are now saying that if an employer will taken on two more people we will only charge that employer 9 per cent PRSI on their earnings if they are earning less than £173.  If they are earning more than that they will have to pay 12.2 per cent.  Does this not say something about the manner in which PRSI is being paid?</P>
    <P>We should examine the possibility of having one form of tax collection, because PRSI is now a tax.  It is no longer a pay-related social insurance because one does not get pay-related social insurance if one is on social welfare or sick.  The amount is constantly being reduced and that was introduced by the Government.  I am not happy about that. We are eroding the entitlements of the PAYE sector.  Questions have to be asked about where we are going to get the money that is to be paid to those on the unemployment register.  Would the Minister consider allowing a 9 per cent payment for employees earning less than <Col N="1565" /> £200, a week which is £10,000 a year, and 12.2 per cent thereafter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate issues here.  The first is the question of the PRSI exemption scheme.  I felt it was worth extending that for another two years.  Initially, few employers took advantage of it.  Normally one would be inclined to let it go at that but in the last year the take up increased and that is where the 3,770&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but there was very little take up in the first year.  It mainly happened in the second year.  That was probably related to the pick up in the economy in the second year.  However, it is an encouragement and an incentive; it is two year's ahead for an employer who takes somebody on.  I therefore thought it was worth going ahead with the scheme this time and the Government agreed. That was not in the budget either and was actually brought in since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  The Minister always works that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of the things the Government agreed since the budget.  I listened to what Senator Cregan said.  I am conscious of the employer's side and consequently that is one direct specific aid for employers.  It has been retained for another two years.  Separately from that, changes are taking place in the PRSI exemption scheme.  This is a special PRSI package which is designed to maintain jobs, generate new jobs, help labour intensive sectors to compete and boost the take home pay for lower paid workers.</P>
      <P>I had to spend a lot of time thinking about all of this because my first responsibility is to ensure that the social insurance fund is solid and that it is there to meet the obligations.  It is there and it is running well at the moment.  Having said that, employers are seeking reductions in PRSI and there is a question of what can be done and how much can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> Senator Quinn, in his contribution on Second Stage, said that these changes were too little and too timid and he talked about the amount being just crumbs.  I am sorry he is not here at this stage, but the amount is £46 million.  As far as I am concerned, it is a question of a transfer of £46 million.  It is a very substantial amount of money and it is a very substantial change for our system.</P>
    <P>People are forever saying that PRSI is effectively a tax.  As far as I am concerned it is not a tax, it is a social security contribution. It is specifically designated for social security purposes.  It is collected for the social insurance fund and that is what it is spent on.  Before this consolidated fund was put in place, employers had to provide by one contribution or another for occupational injuries and pensions, so it is specifically for those situations.  Other levies, such as the levy which was removed this year, were added on and for that reason it has looked more like a tax.</P>
    <P>I know a good deal about the social security system and I know it is important for workers that social insurance be there as a benefit rather than an assistance. Many people claim that it should be an assistance, that it should be means tested. I do not agree with that.  The tax should level incomes out eventually.  Employees get benefit and then, if there is a lot of extra income, the tax system operates to level out the total income.  It is important that we maintain the security and soundness of the social insurance fund, so this step was a very big one for me, but the fund is healthy.  There has been a good deal of discussion about this, but we said we would do it, monitor the effects and see how we go.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan suggests that we might go further.  Depending on how things go, if there is a response in the economy, if employers respond by taking some more people, the whole fund will stay stable and we can go somewhat further.  That is what I have said I will do.  I will monitor it during this coming year.  Next year we can see what effect it has had and how we can adjust the system further going into next year.  Senator Cregan talked <Col N="1567" /> about putting in another layer, and that is one of the possibilities.  We will examine that possibility, but it depends on the money and the response.</P>
    <P>There has been a very good response from the clothing and footwear sectors. At the same time we must recognise that PRSI is not the only cause of the difficulties there.  My difficulty is that we are really a very small contributor to the whole situation and those in the industry will readily admit that there are other factors which have a much bigger impact on their position.  They do not have a problem <i>vis-a-vis</i> Europe, but the fact that the UK operates this system and one in which there is no ceiling for employers creates a difficulty for them.  They want us to at least begin to address it and we have done so.</P>
    <P>The total full year cost of this concession is £46 million.  This year the net cost of the concession is £28 million and the higher ceiling on the employers' side during this year will provide £3 million. That gives a total of £31 million in 1994, but the full year cost of this concession is £46 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the need to help the service sector among others; but that is the very sector it applies to and that is where a large part of that money will go.  I do not disagree at all with what Senator Quinn said about creating incentives for people to work in those areas but I do not agree that PRSI is a tax; it is a social security payment.  That is where it came from, that is where it is and that is where I intend to keep it.</P>
    <P>If an employee is paid £170 per week the gain to the employer from the PRSI measure alone is £5.54 per week, or £283 per annum.  Similarly for £160 it is £5.12 per week, or £266 per annum.  There is a real and substantial gain.  We will monitor the situation and decide where to go for the future.  Senators must appreciate that it is a very big change and one that allows for development along the lines suggested by Senator Cregan.</P>
    <P>If Senators take into account the other provisions being made in this Bill, the total cost in a full year is £89 million. <Col N="1568" /> That is what is being given to ease the burden at the lower end of the scale.  If the Minister for Social Welfare said a few years ago that £5 million, £8 million or £10 million was to be put into the system, people would be delighted.  The figure is £89 million and that is why I found it hard to contain myself when Senator Quinn referred to it as crumbs.</P>
    <P>I think what the Senator meant was that he would like to see this going much further.  I would like to make it clear that this is a substantial amount of money. The only reason we can do it is because we have done so much work on the black economy.  I agree that there is a lot more to be done, but we have done so much work that we had savings of £236 million over a two year period.  We have done so much saving in this area and bringing more people on board &mdash; the contributors generally are coming out of the woodwork and paying up &mdash; that the fund is in a strong position.</P>
    <P>This is the best time to begin to look at these issues.  The Government was very anxious to do anything it could in relation to that issue to support, strengthen and maintain jobs that are under pressure and also to help create new jobs.  This provision should be celebrated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a social insurance fund by my reckoning, it is a pay-related social insurance fund.  Do not change the playing pitch.  The Minister says the social insurance fund will always be a social insurance fund.  Section 21 of the Bill does not say that.  That section says that pay-related social insurance will be eliminated by November 1995.  I want that to be quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is contradicting himself in his own Bill and I cannot let that go.  I would like to see the Department of Social Welfare creating a situation where more people will go to work and the Bill should be relevant to that objective. While I do not always agree with Senator Quinn, he asked if enough was being done in this area.  Enough is never being done, despite the amount of money spent every day on social welfare.  The <Col N="1569" /> Minister knows that more people would be working if the problem was approached in other ways; yet the problem is how to get outside the existing structure.  I recognise that it is not easy to get this point across to a Cabinet that seeks to do everything possible with money to bring about a situation where more people would be at work.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's initiative created 4,000 jobs over the last 12 months by eliminating 2.2 per cent of pay-related social insurance then he would have done exceptionally well.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and what Senator Quinn says is not too far wrong.  If you are spending so much money every day on social welfare there is nothing wrong with having novel ideas like the one on page six of the Minister's statement saying that 3,770 jobs were created over a 14 month period.</P>
    <P>We can see there is a turnaround in the economy.  If that is the situation, the Minister should not be afraid to use more incentives to create 10,000 jobs.  The State should not be afraid to take less from employers and employees, because it will cost £50 less per week overall. The State can only gain from doing that, because someone with a wife and two children is getting £120 in unemployment assistance.  People in the private sector would ask themselves if they could save on the one hand while distributing or gambling on the other.  The Minister's gamble is paying off by creating employment initiatives.  We must not create a situation where there is no incentive to employ people.  How many times have Senators said that from all sides of the House?  No matter what the Minister says about the 9 per cent and the £173 level, it should be put up to £10,000 a year, or £198 to £210 per week.  Why not?  If the Minister motivates people to help themselves, they will do it.</P>
    <P>Why is no case being made to increase the £173 per week benefit payment?  I would like to give an example, and I promise not to hold up the House on simple issues.  I will speed up the Bill after this point.  Local authorities are a hobbyhorse of mine.  In 1987 we eliminated <Col N="1570" /> thousands and thousands of workers from these areas.  General operatives and skilled workers are entitled to a supplement at the moment because of their low pay levels.  Why is it that people with two children earning £130 per week would earn on average £162 per week if they were working for Cork Corporation, Cork County Council, Limerick City Council or other local authorities?  It may be costing us £32 per week more, but let us look at the benefits.  Most importantly, however, people would be working at real jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the European Commission for questioning what we are doing spending money on job training because we are really creating nothing. Top trade union officials in the ICTU have asked whether any real jobs are being created.  I am talking about real jobs, where a man goes out on a Monday morning and comes back on Friday with his wages.  That is why I think the £173 benefit level is very low.  It is just below the pay rates of local authorities, which are about £176 per week.  Is that a tactic? Are we so small minded that we are not prepared to increase it?  Could the Minister look at every possible incentive to create jobs?  If someone is coming off the dole and will cost the State £20 per week instead of £120, is there not some logic in that?</P>

      <P>The Senator stressed the need to create initiatives for employment. I appreciate that and have been trying to do everything I can about it. One initiative mentioned by the Senator is the PRSI exemption scheme, which created 4,000 jobs.  We will have to see how much we can discover about its effects in due course.  Another initiative I have undertaken, and which relates to the points made by the Senator, is the back to work allowance.  This is something we have discussed over the years, but it is hard to achieve the right climate in which the Government would support such ideas.  I am prepared to try many things, most of which have worked out, and I do not mind a bit of criticism when some do not work out as well as expected. You have to pitch if you are to get anywhere.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance is starting to move now and the Government has agreed to a pilot figure of £3,000.  There was some delay in getting it off the ground because arguments were made in the Dáil that the scheme should be left with FÁS.  My reply to that was that these people are my customers and since I am giving them certain moneys why can I not apportion the money for a period while they try to get employment?  There are no complications and, apart from a handful of staff in the Department, no one else is involved.  We are giving people the opportunity of finding work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme entails a 75 per cent rate for the first year, followed by 50 per cent in the second year.  For the week ending 18 March, the number of jobs created by employers and the self-employed amounted to 1,554 and more than half were people who wanted to start up on their own.  I suspect that that initiative will begin to move much faster and I do not think there will be much difficulty for the Government to proceed further with it if they see it going well.  On the total social welfare expenditure of £3.8 billion, I <Col N="1572" /> want to make it clear that expendture on unemployment payments &mdash; high as it is &mdash; is only just over £1 billion.  Of that, a considerable part is covered by the social insurance fund and the rest is assistance. £1.07 billion is the estimate for 1994, so you are left with roughly £2.8 billion, which is for pensions and other parts of the social security system.  Those are the main points.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned European criticism of our training and educational supports.  Perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that a large proportion of our population is young.  About 50 per cent of our population is under the age of 28 years.  A study of the long term unemployed carried out by the planning and research unit in my Department some years ago found that 80 per cent of the long term unemployed did not have the leaving certificate; about 57 per cent had not continued schooling after the primary certificate.</P>
    <P>We must stop talking about theories and deal with the facts.  My Department looked at the facts and repeatedly found that the long term unemployed had not had the benefit of education in the first instance.  That is why we introduced the second chance education scheme.  It is growing rapidly and is availed of by large numbers.  There are about 5,000 participants in the second chance education opportunities scheme and many secure employment when they finish.  There are also 900 long term unemployed in third level education.  In many cases they progressed to third level from the VTOS, which is the main scheme.  That has improved their potential and their prospects. The policy invests in the development of the people of Ireland and Europe.  Our colleagues in Europe should realise that.  They should realise that the world is rapidly changing and that education is fundamental to those changes.</P>
    <P>If we want to ensure that the workforce, particularly the unemployed, can compete and avail of and create new opportunities, we must ensure that they have the training and education to do so. That is the best advantage we can give <Col N="1573" /> our people.  It will combat poverty.  A study of this issue was launched last week and it found that second chance education was one of the best choices available to the long term unemployed.  We are the practitioners because we have been implementing that policy during the past number of years.  We want to extend it as quickly as possible.  I welcome that report because it supports the Department's strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; is the first word in section 11. Would somebody explain where the word &ldquo;survivor&rdquo; in survivor's pension came from?  A survivor, as far as I am concerned, is a person who was saved in an accident while another person was lost.  I do not know why that word is used.  It is not an appropriate word to use about the people being discussed in this section. We are talking about the loss of a partner. One is not a survivor unless one is talking about an accident.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recognition in this section of the widower's work, or should I say the &ldquo;survivor's&rdquo; work.  What is the definition of a widower now?  Can that be clarified?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Survivor's pension&rdquo; is the title.  I did not have time to consider the title because I was more anxious to introduce the widower's pension.  There was much discussion and negotiation about the pension.  Survivor's pension is already referred to in certain other categories in legislation.  It is also used in international jargon.  &ldquo;Survivor's pensions&rdquo; are referred to in the United States and the phrase is used in a number of other countries.</P>
      <P>I considered the word &ldquo;spouse's&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is quite difficult. We settled for &ldquo;survivor's pension&rdquo; and the meaning of the phrase is generally well understood.</P>
      <P>I accept the Senator's point about widowers. The pension is long overdue. Somebody said earlier that nothing had ever been done for widowers.  However, some time ago I introduced a lone parent's allowance scheme which applied to widowers on the same basis as widows. The survivor's pension scheme gives equal treatment to the widower.  It is the most advanced survivor's benefit scheme in Europe.  Europe is currently trying to figure out how it will deal with the directive. The directive has been there since 1979 and has been actively considered since 1989.  It is hoped to apply the equal treatment directive to widowers' pensions. That has not been achieved yet because of the difficulties and costs in various countries.</P>
      <P>We are providing a full widower's pension similar to a widow's pension where one person benefits from the other, depending on who had the contributions. It is a major step in the development of the social security system.  I am particularly happy for the families of widowers in this year of the family.  About 9,000 widowers will benefit immediately as the provision applies to existing widowers. The number of widowers is lower than the number of widows because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of the survivor's pension scheme which provides equal treatment for widows and widowers.  Widowers will qualify for survivor's pension under the same conditions that apply to widow's contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My difficulty with this provision is that lifelong partners who are not married but who are cohabitating as husband and wife are excluded.  The Social Welfare Act, <Col N="1575" /> 1991, provided that in calculating the amount of certain social welfare benefits payable to any person, a man and woman who are not married to each other but who are cohabitating as man and wife and members of the same household, had their needs and means aggregated as the needs and means of a claimant for certain social welfare payments.  I cannot understand why one social welfare Bill acknowledges cohabitating people while this Bill, which seeks to extend certain provisions to survivors, ignores them. The Minister cannot have it both ways. If he recognises men and women who are not married but live together as man and wife, on the death of one partner the surviving partner should have the same rights as a partner in any other couple.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to the anomaly he has created. My party put down an amendment to this section in the other House.  I would have done so today but it would have been disallowed because it would have involved a cost to the Exchequer.  It is widely accepted that a substantial number of people live in these situations. If we are to develop our social welfare system we should not miss the opportunity to extend this provision to such people.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section. Senator Cregan sought an explanation of the word &ldquo;survivor&rdquo;.  If a person stood for election to the Dáil, lost the election, was elected to the Seanad and finally won election to the Dáil, would he be known as a political survivor?

      <P>I wish to broaden the point Senator Honan raised with regard to cohabiting couples.  No more than 12 months ago, it was found that such people were entitled to benefits under common law and they were divided accordingly. Which provision under subsection (4) gives a higher entitlement, the deserted wife's benefit or the survivor's allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> I am also worried by the subsections dealing with the disregard of self-employment contributions in certain cases.  When a certain amount is paid by the self-employed person, the entitlement to the widow or survivor may not be as high as that of other people, especially if money is bequeathed to the survivor.  Are all being recognised equally in that case?  Certain people are getting benefits while others, despite the fact that they may be contributing at a lower rate because they are self-employed, would not even have the basic cover if they died.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that men are now included in the category receiving survivors pensions.  &ldquo;Survivor&rdquo; is an appropriate term to use.  The term &ldquo;survived by&rdquo;, followed by the name of the family, is widely used in death notices on the radio and in the newspapers.  I do not have any problem with being a political survivor either.</P>
      <P>The women's liberation movement has been active for a long time and has achieved many objectives.  I welcomed the inclusion of men for the deserted and lone parent benefits.  At the time, I knew some men who were struggling to bring up their families on their own.  Similarly, many widowers have been trying to manage a family as well as a job and their other responsibilities without the benefit of such a pension.  The fact there is now equality in this area should be welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan asked why co-habitees had not been included under this provision.  The widow's pension is naturally based on the death of the partner in marriage.  Including co-habitees would be a further extension and development of the pension, on top of this development which is costing £27 million per year.  Other issues, such as what would happen to divorced widows if the forthcoming divorce referendum is passed, for example, will have to be considered and addressed in the future. This provision is a major step forward.  As Senator O'Sullivan said, it puts widowers and widows on an equal basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> Senator Cregan asked if both the deserted wife's benefit and the survivor's pension would be taken at the same rate. They would be at the same level because they are covered under insurance funds and therefore, at the same rates.  The rates within that scheme for dependent children will also be the same.</P>
    <P>It only takes three years to qualify for these benefits.  However, there may be circumstances where five years may be required.  This applies to many people &mdash; public servants, for example.  They are set at the modified rate because they are covered for the widows pension, which will now automatically include the widower's pension.  This provision will have a great impact on the system and I am glad the value of this section has been recognised by this House.</P>

Is the Minister trying to broaden the allowance, otherwise the health boards especially will have to bear the costs.  One of the biggest developments in this regard is in the provision of caring in the homes of the elderly.  I recognise the importance of our elderly people.  The carer's allowance has been of benefit to those helping the elderly.  Is every opportunity being taken under this provision to keep the elderly in their own homes?  Every possible benefit should be given to facilitate these people.</P>

      <Col N="1580" /> ....(2) Section 80 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;£97.50&rdquo; for &ldquo;£80&rdquo; in each place where it occurs.  (3) Subsection (2) shall come into operation on the 20th day of July, 1994.&rdquo;  (4) The Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after section 81 of the following section:</P>
    <P>81A.&mdash;&mdash;Notwithstanding the provisions of this Chapter, pay-related benefit shall not be payable to a person in respect of any day of unemployment or of incapacity for work on or after the 1st day of November, 1995, unless he is in receipt of the said benefit on that day in which case benefit shall continue to be payable for the duration of his continuous entitlement up to the 393rd day of unemployment or of incapacity for work.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I object to this section because the Minister has removed a benefit which the PAYE sector paid for over the years. People in this sector were under the impression that pay-related benefit would be paid if they got sick.  Trade unionists were proud of the fact that if a person was sick they would receive pay-related benefit.  However, from 1995 people's circumstances could change because they will only be entitled to social welfare.  This is the thin edge of the wedge because the benefits to which the PAYE sector are entitled are being eroded. Unemployment and social welfare are taxed and pay-related benefit will now be taxed and taken from the person.  People will not get their entitlements now because the Government does not have the money to provide for the less well off in our society.  I do not agree with this section.</P>

      <P>I hope the Senator is clear about what is happening.  Previously, pay-related benefit came off disability benefit.  While pay-related benefit is coming off unemployment benefit in this legislation, I am putting the total amount of money, £21 million, in addition to a further £2.7 million back into the basic rates of payment.  This also applies to disability benefit.  The average payment is approximately £10 in pay-related benefit, but it only applies to fewer than half the workers who are covered.  It does not apply to them generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their searching consideration of this Bill, which is highly important legislation.  As I said at the outset, it affects 40 per cent of the population.  Some worthwhile innovations and developments are made in the Bill.  I have noted the constructive points made today and I thank Senators for their support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his deep and serious consideration of the Bill.  I have great admiration for the Minister. He has done a fine job in ensuring more and more people are protected by the social welfare system.  Over £11 million is given in social welfare payments every day; the public would probably not believe that if they were told.  The Minister can be quite subtle at Cabinet in obtaining an allocation of money, even in the period 1987 to 1989 when the then Minister for Finance was rather strict on expenditure.  He was probably right to be cautious at that time, but this Minister did exceptionally well for the less well off in our society.  I thank him for his commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister on getting the Bill through the House.  As he said, 1.4 million of our people are being maintained on social welfare payments, which represents a huge percentage of our people.  There is great support for a high level of protection for these people.  While we never have enough to give to them, the Minister is earnest in his endeavours, both in ensuring those who need social welfare payments receive as much as possible and <Col N="1584" /> in ensuring there is no disincentive to taking up jobs.  The Progressive Democrats believe we must maintain employment and encourage people to take jobs, but where people fall out of this net they need the highest level of social protection society can afford.</P>

      <P>I also thank the Minister and the Minister of State for the comprehensive way they dealt with the Bill. It is an important Bill &mdash; over 40 per cent of the population are directly affected by it.  It was well supported throughout the House and it is a tribute to the Minister and his Department and to their new initiatives to curb current difficulties and protect the less well off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in congratulating the Minister, Deputy Woods, on getting the Bill through the House.  It is accepted wisdom both here and in the other House that he has an unparalleled knowledge of the social welfare code and one has to know one's facts when making a point to him.  It is proper to have someone with such skills at Cabinet who also has the interest in and the commitment to the most defenceless section of our society.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators.  The points made have been noted and we will certainly examine other considerations in the future.  This Bill has made a major advance and maintains the progress over the years.  To a large extent that progress has been made by Deputies and Senators in their proposals, suggestions and their experience of how the system works.  In international terms we are in the forefront in the provision of sound and sensible social security.  As a nation we can be proud of that.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the Government's commitment to ensure equal access to justice for all regardless of means and to guarantee the availability of legal services in a speedy and effective manner to those relying on the Civil Legal Aid Service; and in particular:</P>
      <P>&mdash;welcomes the initiative of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in undertaking a major expansion of the Civil Legal Aid Service since coming into office;</P>
      <P>&mdash;applauds the announcement by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that, during 1994, ten new full-time Law Centres and four part-time Law Centres will be established, and that by the end of this year, no county in Ireland will be without a Law Centre;</P>
      <P>&mdash;welcomes the major recruitment of additional staff for the Legal Aid Board during 1993 and projected for 1994;</P>
      <P>&mdash;takes note of the significant progress made towards the reduction of waiting lists and anticipates further reductions in 1994; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;welcomes the commitment to place the Legal Aid Scheme on a Statutory basis.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to participate in this important discussion in relation to an area of governmental endeavour which is so vital to the most vulnerable members of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiatives taken by the Minister, Deputy Taylor, will have great implications for people who need, in many cases as a matter of extreme urgency, <Col N="1586" /> access to our courts at all levels.  The Legal Aid Board was established in 1979 and grew in a rather haphazard manner. Sometimes it had funding while at other times it did not, and the funding was received from diverse sources.  There was an obvious need that people, regardless of their circumstances, were entitled to access to the law if the constitutional provisions in relation to the treatment of people in this country as equal citizens were to have any meaning.  Where people lacked the necessary funds, the State had an obligation to provide such a service. This gave rise to the establishment of the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the first legal aid centres were established at six locations &mdash; Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo.  It was the intention of the then Government to continue to expand the number of law centres.  Unfortunately, due to lack of resources, nothing of any note happened until 1986-87 when the funds of suitors legislation was introduced. The Minister will be familiar with it, but it was new to me.  The fund was made up of unclaimed moneys, which I understand languished in banks and various other places, and was used to establish further centres in other areas &mdash; Tralee, Athlone, Tallaght and a second centre in Cork.  I recall that the fund paid for the refurbishment of the Law Library and various other matters which were necessary at the time.</P>
    <P>The position has dramatically improved through the initiative of the Minister, Deputy Taylor, and his Department. There will be an additional ten full-time centres and a number of part-time centres.  It is worth recording that in 1992 the total staff in the legal aid centres was 99.  The Department for which the Minister is responsible, added an extra 41 people in 1993 and it is envisaged that there will be a further 64 employees by the end of 1994, giving a total employee number of 201.  In addition, the funding has risen from a grant-in-aid in 1992 of £2.685 million to £4.972 million in 1994 &mdash; the amount has doubled.  This is a tremendous achievement in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> I was surprised by the Fine Gael amendment for a number of reasons. First, it did not refer to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform but to the Minister for Justice.  Was it the fault of researchers on the other side that they did not realise the implementation of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission consultation paper on family courts is a matter in Government for the Minister for Justice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but since he has made a mess of this, he wishes to intervene. I am happy to mix it with him at any time, anywhere.  It makes no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second item in the amendment calls on the Minister, Deputy Taylor, to appoint extra members of the Judiciary with specialised training.  It is not the Minister's area of responsibility, rather the area of the Minister for Justice.  The amendment further calls for the provision of extra staff to deal with the delays in child assessments.  That is not a matter for Minister, Deputy Taylor, but for the Minister for Justice.  The final part of the amendment calls for the provision of adequate funds and staff for the existing and new legal aid centres.  Given that the staffing level has risen from 99 to over 200 and that the budget has increased <Col N="1588" /> from £2.6 million to £4.9 million - resources have doubled &mdash; any Opposition would have congratulated the Minister in charge of that particular operation. Instead, we got an amendment that was directed at the wrong Minister, which requested funds that have already been provided and staff which have already been employed or will be employed by the end of 1994.  Wherever the Opposition was, it was certainly not, as we say in Cork, at home on this issue.</P>
    <P>When I researched some information on the service it was surprising to note that 97 per cent of the work carried out in the legal aid centres deals with family law.  That is incredible in many ways, because so much else is happening to people in terms of their legal rights and their desire for access to the law.  It seems they are unaware that they can have recourse to legal aid centres for matters other than family law cases, such as injury and property cases.  There are a number of issues which are excluded for people who qualify in other respects to partake of legal aid in such matters as defamation, civil bills under £150 &mdash; which, I understand, are now dealt with in the small claims court &mdash; debt collection, land disputes and some matters involving conveyancing. However, as I understand it all other areas are available to people who qualify for the provision of legal aid. It is amazing that only 3 per cent of them apply for such aid.</P>
    <P>In common with many provisions in other areas, such as the supplementary welfare allowance, budgets have not been used over the years, not because the need was not there but because people did not know about them.  The Minister will have to address this and ensure that people are aware of the content and availability of such services.  The provision of services which are not properly publicised is in many ways a denial of the service.  Therefore the question of having information in the hands of those who need it most must be addressed, whether it be by the use of television and newspapers or the availability of literature at various centres such as libraries, Garda stations and so on.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1589" /> to comment on this issue when he responds to the motion.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the Minister of 14 new law centres in 1994 represents the most significant expansion of the services by the Legal Aid Board since its establishment in 1979.  I have outlined the progression in the services since 1979 and I pay tribute to organisations such as FLAC and the Coolock Law Centre who provided a service when there was no State assistance in this area.  It is fitting also that the House pays tribute to these organisations.</P>
    <P>The legal profession, to which the Minister, Senator Enright, Senator Cosgrave and others belong, has been pilloried in many instances.  However, what has not been recognised is the work undertaken and the service provided free of charge by those involved in FLAC and other instances throughout the country where solicitors and legal practices have provided a contribution to the social fabric of the country.  They have gone to court on behalf of those who were in no position to pay or where there was no chance of payment.</P>
    <P>This Government undertook to examine the question of civil legal aid and to ascertain in what way accessibility could be increased to people of limited means. There can be no doubt that additional funding will be provided to the Free Legal Aid Board this year.  In addition, the extra funding obtained for the board by the Minister last year is evidence of the Government's determination to ensure that a specific undertaking in the Programme for a Partnership Government is brought to fruition.  It is my intention to introduce a motion to this House which will list the number of undertakings given in the Programme for a Partnership Government and to establish the fact that these undertakings have been brought to a conclusion.  This undertaking was a promise made and a promise kept.  Much as it may upset the Opposition, it must acknowledge that it got its amendment wrong and its information wrong and that in future if the Opposition wishes to attack this Government, it should use live ammunition.</P>

      <P>Senator Magner's contribution to the motion was comprehensive, especially his demolition of the amendment to the motion put forward by the Opposition.

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The House must welcome what has been achieved in this area.  If there is any generosity of spirit in the House, Members must welcome the initiative by the Minister in expanding the civil legal aid service by an amount which is far greater than anything before in the history of the service.  In addition, the House must applaud the announcement by the Minister that he is extending by ten the number of full-time centres and by four the number of part time centres this year.  The House must also welcome the fact that between the beginning of 1993 and the end of 1994 the number of staff will increase by 120 per cent.  Finally, the House must also welcome the fact that the fruits of these efforts by the Minister are visible to us in improvements in the centres at present, especially the improvement in the waiting times.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, if there is any spirit of generosity, or even of objectivity, in this House, Members must recognise that, as Senator Magner has pointed out, the Opposition amendment to the motion is ill considered because the first three parts of the amendment dealing with the appointment of extra members to the Judiciary, to implement the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission on family courts and to provide extra staff to deal with the delays in child assessments are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the provision of adequate funds and staff, there are few areas of public administration at present that is growing as rapidly as the civil legal aid service and this is a fact which is indisputable.  In spite of the general constraints, and correct constraints, on public expenditure and on staff numbers in the public service, the civil legal aid service has been the recipient of substantial additional funding and staff resources in the past 12 months and in the current financial period.</P>
      <P>Both parties in Government can be rightly proud that the Government is achieving more and has achieved more in this 20 month period than has been achieved in the previous lifetime of the service.  Senator Magner referred to the fact that in the two year period from January 1993 the staff level will increase from 99&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair play to the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may dispute the facts if he can.  The staff level will increase from 99 to 204, which by any standard is a rapid rate of growth, given the derisory rate of growth that was achieved in the service over the previous period.  The next 12 months will witness a dramatic increase in the number of full-time centres.  In addition, there will be an increase in the civil legal aid budget by almost one third, which must be welcomed <Col N="1592" /> by any Member of the House who has any sense of objectivity.</P>
      <P>There will be a substantial improvement in the number of full-time civil legal aid centres this year.  At the beginning of the year there were 35 such centres operating throughout the country; by the end of this year there will be 43 centres. This masks the real level of improvement that has been achieved because the most important development this year is that the number of full-time centres will grow by ten, from 16 at the beginning of the year to 26 by the end of the year.  Six existing part-time centres will be upgraded in that process and an additional four part time centres will be opened.  If I may be parochial, I welcome the fact that Wicklow is to get a full-time centre.</P>
      <P>It is worth reminding the House of what is happening on the ground and I ask any Member of the Opposition to declare an objection.  May I ask, for example, if they object to the fact that there is a new centre opening in Dublin city, that Blanchardstown centre, which has operated for years as a part time centre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In addition, Longford, Portlaoise and Wicklow town will have a full-time centre for the first time.  I welcome these improvements, as should all Members of this House.  Furthermore, there are to be additional part-time centres in Cavan, Navan, Carrick-on-Shannon and Tullamore. Again, Members with generosity of spirit or objectivity would welcome that and commend the Minister for what he has done.</P>
      <P>Senator Magner referred to the budgets because nothing can be done without money.  It is worth reminding the House that in 1989 the civil legal aid budget totalled £1.5 million; by 1991 it had increased to £2.35 million; in 1992 it increased marginally to £2.68 million; in 1993 it increased to £3.25 million and by the end of this year it will touch the £5 million mark.  From the end of 1992 it has increased from over £3 million to under £5 million.  Members on the opposite side of the House must welcome that.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael Members have not spoken to each other for many years and I do not want to intrude on personal tragedies in that regard.  Senators on this side of the House are speaking to each other.</P>
      <P>Justice delayed is justice denied.  A Senator pointed out we should look at waiting times.  In Castlebar, North Mall in Cork, Ormond Quay in Dublin, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Galway, Letterkenny, Limerick, Sligo and Tralee waiting lists have been reduced from two months to one month, a significant reduction.  In two centres, South Mall in Cork and Finglas, lists have been reduced from five to three months.  Athlone is the only centre where people must wait for up to ten months.</P>
      <P>This Government has provided the resources and Senators on the opposite side should have the generosity of spirit to recognise what has been done.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has fought for these resources in difficult times and I compliment him in that regard.  Additional staff are being recruited at a time when staff is being cut everywhere else. However, each time a microphone is pointed in the direction of the Fine Gael Finance spokesperson, Deputy Yates, he repeats the standard line about this being a high spend Government.  I am pleased to support this type of public expenditure because this is a long awaited and overdue improvement.  Fine Gael Senators should recognise this and withdraw their nonsensical amendment to the motion.  I would support the first three parts of that amendment at a different time and with a different Minister.  I know the Minister in question would support it.  What has been achieved in this area in the past two years is worthwhile and this House should commend it.</P>

The electorate will get the opportunity on 9 June to make their first interim report on this Government.  In the near future they will be able to give their assessment on the final examination.  The people will indicate their dissatisfaction with members of the Labour and Fianna Fáil Parties.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at delays in regard to children's welfare and disputes. While extra people are being employed in these legal aid centres, obviously some will be busier than others.  Some people in these centres are overworked and there are long waiting lists.  The Minister, a colleague from the legal profession, is aware that not all cases dealt with by civil legal aid centres are run of the mill.  Some may be dealt with in one day while others may be ongoing or may only arise from time to time.</P>

      <P>Senator Roche was given injury time.  After this morning's meeting it is nice to see him backing up his Labour colleagues.  The Minister should take on board what we have said. I applaud him for the progress which has been made but more needs to be done. The system must work well from the time someone walks into one of these centres until after the hearing of the court case and where assessment and welfare programmes are needed.  There is a great deal of red tape in many centres.  Many of the top staff in these centres spend a great deal of time dealing with pink forms, etc., when they should be helping people.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. Progress has been made on this issue but there is still a long way to go.  To our shame, Mrs. Airey had to go to the European Court of Human Rights to be granted the right to free legal aid to obtain a judicial separation.  We began from a minus situation.  The Pringle committee reported in 1977 and the Legal Aid Board was established in 1980.  This year the Minister provided £5 million for the board; in 1993 £3.2 million was provided. This considerable improvement is welcome.  We should not be in conflict on this issue.  There should be agreement, mutual understanding and co-operation because of its importance.  Although I welcome the amount the Minister has provided, we should not go overboard because more than £7 million has been allocated to greyhounds and horses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Tánaiste is interested in greyhounds, we should put this in perspective.  We are <Col N="1599" /> speaking about one of the most sensitive and traumatic times for families in dispute. It is a time when remedies must be provided at a particularly tragic time for families &mdash; husbands and wives, sons and daughters.  Family cases are heard in the District Court in the morning, before other cases are heard or in the evening after normal business has been transacted. I hope the Minister, in co-operation with the Minister for Justice, will provide for setting aside specific days for family cases.  I have seen cases where women were separating from their husbands, and their sons and daughters were torn between the two and did not know which side to be with on the day.  This is a sad time for everybody.  Cases involving young couples whose marriages have broken down are heard on the same day as cases involving people charged with armed robbery and other serious crime. Specific days should be set aside for family cases.</P>
      <P>I would go further with regard to Circuit Court cases.  In County Offaly we have four or five court sittings each year. One day is set aside for Circuit Court cases.  Any of these cases could last a full day.  Normally two are heard in the morning and two in the afternoon.  Up to 30 cases can be listed for the same day. In Dundalk 60 judicial separation cases were listed for hearing on the same day. Sixty families were in Dundalk waiting for their cases to be heard.  Only two, three or five cases could have been heard. We are not dealing with matters such as speed limits and fines, which can be rubber stamped, but with the greatest tragedy which can confront a family.  It is essential that sufficient money is set aside for this important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Magner paid tribute to many young solicitors' apprentices, young barristers, and the free legal aid centres for their excellent work.  The Minister would be the first to admit that the existing scheme would not exist if many young people were not prepared to give their time on a voluntary basis.  Many solicitors are subjected to a great deal of flak, some of it justified.  However, many solicitors <Col N="1600" /> take on cases for which they are not paid. They probably have social consciences and help people who have little finance. This is a good practice and I hope it continues.</P>
    <P>This is a pilot scheme.  The Minister initially offered £65 for each family law case, subject to withholding tax and no travel or subsistence was to be paid.  This amount was increased to £75.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these cases involve a considerable degree of conflict. To remove this, time is required to work out the tedious parts to see where there is agreement as well as disagreement.  By doing this a great deal of the bitterness can be eliminated.</P>
      <P>This is not a job solely for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  There must be co-operation between him and the Minister for Justice and their Departments because there is a considerable overlap.</P>
      <P>I do not think that this should be a contentious issue or that we should have a division on it.  However, as our amendment states, there is a need to appoint extra members of the Judiciary with specialised training and additional staff to deal with the huge backlog of cases.  I cited Dundalk as an example where 65 cases were heard in one day.  There would normally be 30 to 40 cases heard in each circuit court area.  We need extra staff to deal with the delays in child assessments and to provide adequate funds and staff for the existing and new legal aid centres.</P>
      <P>I welcome the progress which the Minster has made.  I believe that the substance of our amendment would be of help to him.  I hope we will not have a division on Private Members' Time tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave, being the sound and experienced solicitor he is, has adopted the well tried and long accepted tenet of the legal profession that when one has a bad case one attacks the witnesses for the prosecution.  He set <Col N="1601" /> about that tactic here this evening.  He had a difficult brief and we all have to recognise that.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice is to enable persons of limited means to avail of legal services. The scheme was established in 1979 following the publication in 1978 of the report of the Pringle Committee on Legal Aid.  At the heart of the Pringle committee report was a recommendation that legal aid be provided by solicitors employed in law centres.  The provisions of the scheme reflect generally the recommendations made by the committee.  The legal services under the scheme are provided by solicitors in the full-time employment of the Legal Aid Board operating from a network of law centres located strategically throughout the State.  Experience in neighbouring jurisdictions which use other means of delivering a civil legal aid service would suggest that the right decision was made when the Government of the day opted to provide State run law centres in preference to other possible methods of supplying legal services.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the scheme the desirability of making its services easily accessible to applicants in all parts of the State has been recognised but achievement of that aim has been outstanding for some time.  An unfortunate feature of the scheme for some years has been lengthy waiting lists as well as the need for many clients, particularly outside Dublin, to travel undue distances to get to law centres.  These features have created frustration and hardship for persons wishing to avail of the services of the Legal Aid Board.  The board's need for expansion of services by way of additional law centres has been a central problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal aid scheme began with six full-time centres which were located in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo.  Between 1986 and 1987 these were followed by new or additional law centres at Tralee, Cork, Athlone and Dublin.  Those centres were funded initially by money obtained under Funds of Suitors legislation.  The further <Col N="1602" /> establishment of three new centres in 1991 at Castlebar, Letterkenny and Dundalk increased the number of full-time centres to 15 and of part-time centres to 19.  Subsequently, the services in Dublin were reorganised by the replacement of the city centre law centre at Aston Place with two additional suburban law centres at Finglas and Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>From the moment it was established the Legal Aid Board received the wholehearted co-operation of the Bar Council. At all times Bar Council members have been active board members and each of the board's chairpersons was also a member of the Bar Council.  They persevered with the board through difficult times.  In addition to the duties normally required of him in the task of directing the affairs of the board the current chairperson, with the assistance of his fellow members, is engaged in the demanding task of supervising the implementation of the development plan.  I am most grateful to him and to his colleagues in the Bar Council for their efforts over the years on behalf of the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>Over the years the demand for services under the scheme continued to be far in excess of its capacity in terms of meeting the demands placed upon it.  This had given rise, as I have said, to long waiting lists at the various law centres but it also gave rise, on occasions, to some law centres being closed to all applicants except those requiring &ldquo;emergency attention&rdquo; to enable them to deal with the accumulation of cases.</P>
    <P>Since 1990, a good deal of the reason for the build up in cases with law centres has been the coming into operation of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  That legislation continues to have a major impact on the work of the Legal Aid Board.  Applications for judicial separation under the 1989 Act, which comprise a substantial part of legal aid work, are more complex and time consuming to process than applications under the old remedy of &ldquo;<i>divorce a mensa et thoro</i>&rdquo; which the 1989 Act abolished and replaced with the new procedures. The number of people seeking legal aid for judicial separation has increased from <Col N="1603" /> 133 in 1988-89 under the old &ldquo;<i>divorce a mensa et thoro</i>&rdquo; procedure to 278 in 1990, 430 in 1991 and 524 in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Government in its <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993 to 1997</i> undertook to provide additional funding to facilitate an expansion of the scheme of civil legal aid advice.  It also undertook to place the scheme on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>On taking office as Minister for Equality and Law Reform I immediately gave priority in my Department to the need to reduce waiting lists.  My intention was to significantly reduce the length of time it takes an applicant for civil legal aid to get an appointment with a solicitor and, within the constraints imposed by prevailing budgetary situations, to develop the scheme to the greatest possible extent.  At that time the waiting period in three law centres was between one and two months, in six centres it was between three and seven months, in four centres it was between eight and ten months, while in the remaining three centres it was over ten months.</P>
    <P>In early 1993 I succeeded in getting from the Government a special increase of £100,000 for 1993 for the Legal Aid Board.  These additional funds facilitated the introduction of the private solicitor project.  Invitations were issued to private solicitors to have their names inserted in panels of solicitors willing to participate in a pilot project in order to see how this initiative might work.  I am glad to say there was a good take-up by private solicitors on the establishment of the project. The project is confined to the area of District Court reliefs in barring, custody and maintenance but has been especially helpful in reducing waiting lists generally because it has allowed law centre staff to concentrate on the backlog of separation cases.  That project is continuing for the present and will shortly be reviewed having regard in particular to the impact of the resources which I have subsequently secured for the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>There have been some differences between the Law Society and my Department <Col N="1604" /> on matters in relation to that project but, in general, I think that it is fair to say that the Department and the society have co-operated to the fullest extent possible on that and all other important issues so far as my Department is concerned.  I greatly appreciate that co-operation which, at the end of the day, works for the betterment of all interests.</P>
    <P>In the second part of 1993 I was successful in securing a Supplementary Estimate for my Department which included provision sufficient to fund the first phase of a development programme for the Legal Aid Board, which was devised by the board in consultation with my Department.  This phase of the development plan concentrated on upgrading the capacity of the existing law centres by the introduction of an additional 41 staff, including 12 solicitor staff.  By the end of 1993 the waiting lists were significantly reduced.  Eight centres were down to between one and two months, which was an increase of five over the position when I took over responsibility for legal aid, seven centres were down to between three and seven months and the number of centres with a waiting time in excess of ten months was reduced from three to one.</P>
    <P>Early this year the Government again responded sympathetically to my request for sufficient funds to proceed with the second phase of the Legal Aid Board's plan of development.  I succeeded in obtaining almost £5 million as grant-in-aid for the board, an increase of almost £2 million over the 1993 figure.  An increase of this magnitude has never been matched by any Government since the legal aid scheme was initiated.  The additional money allows for expansion of the board's facilities to unprecedented levels.  It will ensure that all counties will have either a full-time or part-time law centre.  At present, there are 16 full-time law centres; by the end of 1994 we will have 26 in operation.  The new law centres will be located as follows: two new centres are being provided in Dublin, one in the city and one in Blanchardstown. Outside Dublin, new full-time centres will be located in each of the following <Col N="1605" /> towns: Ennis, Kilkenny, Longford, Monaghan, Nenagh, Portlaoise, Wexford and Wicklow.  The existing law centre in Galway will be provided with an additional solicitor.  A further four new part-time law centres will also be established at Carrick-on-Shannon, Cavan town, Navan and Tullamore.  Accordingly, following this expansion there will be a total of 26 full-time and 17 part-time law centres located strategically throughout the country.  The timetable set out in the development plan requires that all of these centres will be in place and fully operational this year.</P>
    <P>When I took over responsibility for the Legal Aid Board just over 12 months ago there were 39 solicitors and 40 support staff employed in the board's law centres. In 1993 an additional 12 solicitors and 29 support staff were allocated and a further 24 solicitors and 34 support staff will be employed this year to service the new law centres.  When these additional staff are recruited the Legal Aid Board will have a total of 75 solicitors and 103 support staff employed in law centres.  Staff numbers in the board's head office will also be augmented in 1994 to enable them to deal effectively with the additional work generated in the law centres.  These increases mean that, since coming into office, this Government will have more than doubled the number of staff employed by the board.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the waiting times at the board's law centres continues to improve.  The waiting time at present in ten of the board's 16 law centres is down to between one and two months which is seven centres more than when I took office; in five centres it is between three and seven months and the remaining centre, Athlone, still has a waiting list in excess of ten months but the numbers on that waiting list are 30 per cent down on the numbers prevailing nine months ago.  I am confident that the plan of expansion and development of the service which I have outlined will have a major and lasting impact in reducing further the waiting period in the existing law centres.  My hope is that lengthy waiting lists which have already been reduced <Col N="1606" /> significantly over the past year will become a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>As well as the commitment in the Programme for Government to facilitate access to justice, there is a commitment to examine the possibility of extending legal aid to tribunals.  This commitment will be honoured.  However, the first priority is to arrange for the opening of the new law centres, to upgrade the system, to have any remaining waiting lists of substance reduced even further and to generate a more broadly based service throughout the country.  When that is in place I will consider other aspects of extending the service, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation. I am glad to say that considerable progress has been made on the commitment to put the legal aid scheme on a statutory basis.  The legislation on the matter is at an advanced stage of drafting.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that the legal aid scheme will be operated as effectively and efficiently as possible and that the optimum service can be got from available resources so as to benefit the community. Included in the grant-in-aid to the board in 1994 is a sum of £75,000 to enable the board to increase computerisation of the work in law centres.</P>
    <P>I have considered ways, other than legal aid, to improve access to justice. The Family Law Bill, 1994, which is before the Dáil, having been initiated by me a short time ago, contains important new provisions in relation to jurisdiction of the courts.  The Bill provides a comprehensive framework within which extensive remedies can be secured through the courts by spouses and children who face the consequences of marriage breakdown.  The Bill provides for jurisdiction in proceedings for a decree of nullity of marriage, at present confined to the High Court, to be given also to the Circuit Court.  The purpose is to bring that jurisdiction into line with the jurisdiction for separation proceedings, to improve access to the courts and to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court is being empowered also to make ancillary orders in support <Col N="1607" /> of spouses where foreign decrees of divorce, separation and nullity are entitled to recognition in the State and to make any declarations in relation to the status of a person's marriage.  The District and Circuit Courts will have jurisdiction to order maintenance by way of lump sum and secured payments.  That jurisdiction is at present confined to the Circuit Court in separation proceedings only.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has also provided measures by way of improving access to justice.  Last December she extended the small claims procedure to all District Court areas.  Prior to that the small claims procedure was confined to the Dublin Metropolitan District, the District Court area of Cork city and the District Court area of Sligo.  Its introduction nationwide represents a definite advance in providing ordinary people with an effective means of obtaining redress.  It gives people a means of processing small claims inexpensively, quickly and with a minimum of fuss.  The claims are processed by a small claims registrar who tries to reach a satisfactory settlement without the need for a court hearing.  The matter is referred to the courts if necessary.  The only cost to applicants is an initial fee of £5.  Costs are not allowed under the procedure which deals with consumer claims, rent deposits and minor damages.  The monetary limit on claims is set at £500.</P>
    <P>Various court Acts over the years have demonstrated the value of amending or increasing the various jurisdictions of the District and Circuit Courts.  In tandem with such development we must continually seek to promote and develop alternative means of conflict resolution which do not require the respective parties to have recourse to litigation.  Legal services do not solve all problems.  In certain cases, because of its adversarial nature, legal action may even have the very opposite result.</P>
    <P>In the context of marriage breakdown improved access to justice requires that our family law provisions are modernised and that the courts are given full powers to enable justice to be done for parties of <Col N="1608" /> broken marriages.  Nonetheless, in some of these cases the immediate resort to the law could ruin completely the prospect of reconciliation or of a voluntary settlement which would be in the better interests of the parties and their dependants. The legal aid scheme can benefit from the development of counselling and mediation services because a high proportion of family law cases can and should be resolved without recourse to litigation.</P>
    <P>A recurring concern is that legal aid is used by people who should be using other services, such as conciliation and mediation.  Where there is the possibility of reconciliation they should be encouraged and facilitated to avail of counselling. It is equally important that where parties can settle the terms of their separation they should be facilitated to do so by way of mediation.  The importance of this is recognised in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, section 5 of which requires a solicitor acting for an applicant for a decree of separation to ensure the applicant's awareness of alternatives to separation proceedings and to assist attempts at reconciliation.  Work of immense value is done by a number of voluntary organisations in the area of marriage counselling for couples who are encountering difficulty in their marriages.  I am glad to be able to say that I have secured funding of £750,000 for those organisations in 1994 &mdash; an increase of 150 per cent over last year.</P>
    <P>The family mediation scheme was set up in Dublin on an experimental basis under the auspices of the Department of Justice.  It now operates under the auspices of and is wholly funded by my Department.  The purpose of the service is to assist a husband and wife whose marriage has broken down to reach a voluntary agreement about arrangements for children, property, the family home, maintenance and succession rights without the need for court intervention. Under the present scheme mediation is provided free of charge.  The service operates from a premises in Dublin but is not confined to those resident in <Col N="1609" /> Dublin.  A sum of £300,000 has been provided for the service in 1994, which is more than double the 1993 allocation of £124,000.  This is to facilitate the expansion and development of the service and to establish it on a permanent basis.  I commend the work of the mediation service and I intend to give it all the support I can.</P>
    <P>I also commend the dedication shown by the Legal Aid Board and its staff who, while maintaining the existing service, must also ensure that the major development programme which I have described is implemented in full and on time.  I want to stress that some of the reforms of the law and legal systems to which I have referred are complementary to the question of improving access of justice.  I assure the House that it is my intention to maintain the momentum for change and improvement in all areas of access to justice.  I will continue to work towards this end by all the means available to me.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As one of the paid up members of his fan club, he knows I appreciate what he is doing.  However, we should not be too lavish with our congratulations because the Minister has brought the legal aid scheme from appalling to just pretty shabby.  I am aware of the great effort and work he put into getting extra money for these centres but in spite of that we still have a poor legal aid scheme.</P>
      <P>The general population do not seem to have the will to do something for those who require legal aid services.  There are still 15 counties without legal aid centres. I know the Minister will rectify that but, before this Government came into office, people tolerated that situation for years. There are also long waiting lists; I realise the Minister has managed to reduce them.  There are some great distances to be travelled between centres, for example Letterkenny and Sligo.  This too has been tolerated for years and nobody made any effort to change it.  I commend the Minister for having tried to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> Despite the number of solicitors who will be appointed, social welfare claimants will only have one solicitor to 11,000 people while the rest of the population will have one to 700.  That is very interesting. For a family court case a solicitor will be paid £75.  How many visits will that case involve?  How much time will it involve?  I know it is the best the Minister can do at the moment, but reading in the papers about the enormous fees paid every day in commercial cases it is worthwhile to point out that the emphasis we put on property rather than people can be clearly seen.</P>
    <P>The delays have been dreadful because not only are there civil cases, there are cases involving violence, so people have to put up with violent situations within the home for far longer than they should. I know emergency arrangements can be made but I found an emergency appointment could often take up to three weeks and the fact that we have put up with this scandalous situation for so long is not a credit to us.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the changes he has made in the Legal Aid Board.  All of the new appointments he has made are women.  That is an improvement on the situation as it existed when he arrived in his job because there were then 12 male members, the last Minister for Justice having appointed four men to the only vacancies.  As legal aid is mainly used by women it would be worthwhile, when the Minister has time and as he has responsibility for equality as well as law reform, to appoint more women to the Legal Aid Board.  This was one of the first recommendations on legislation made by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  They thought it would be very important to encourage the taking of a more serious view of the need for legal aid.  The amendment is also valuable, because a judiciary with special training would be very useful.  Most legal aid cases are to do with family law matters and specialised training would be a great help.  The Minister himself wants the extra staff and the extra funds, so I doubt if he would have difficulty with that part <Col N="1611" /> of the amendment.  On reading the Law Reform Commission consultation paper on family courts I was very struck by the absence of research on family law matters in Ireland.  It is difficult to know where to go forward.  I hope that the Minister, because he is experienced in this area, will try to see what areas are best dealt with in the courts and what areas are best dealt with by the mediation services.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the mediation service has been taken so seriously by the Minister because one often wonders if the adversarial situation of a family court is the best place to have many of these disputes settled.  I have followed what has been happening with the mediation service since 1986 and which, until the Minister arrived on the scene, got very limited financial resources, so I am delighted they have received more assistance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if we looked into the situation regarding family law disputes we could consider making more use of the mediation services.  Social workers have said to me that often the institution of a barring order, while it solves the situation at the time regarding the violence within the home, can make the dispute more difficult to deal with in the long run.  The Minister is going in the right direction in looking at the mediation service and we should see how we can tie in the court and mediation services together and decide which cases are best going forward to court.  Cases such as those involving violence, child sexual abuse and so forth will have to come up before the courts, but many cases would be better served if they were dealt with by mediation.</P>
    <P>Agreements made under mediation are far more likely to be adhered to than those made in court because the people involved in mediation feel they have had more power over the situation and there is less conflict.  This is particularly important in areas where children are involved, where there may be disputes over the custody of children and so forth.  The more we can deal with these situations out of court and in mediation, the better; so I warmly welcome what the Minister <Col N="1612" /> has done in getting further money for mediation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the prominence he has given to the work done by the voluntary marriage counselling organisations because it would be much better if these family disputes did not occur in the first place. This emphasis is very important and we must try and get at these disputes before they go to court.  I am glad the Circuit Court and the District Court are now being empowered to deal with more family law cases.  This is an improvement. The more the whole tone of these disputes can be reduced the better for getting an agreeable solution in these cases and where children are involved this is incredibly important.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is to extend the scope of the free legal aid service to tribunals.  We talked today about social welfare but many people when they have to go up before social welfare appeals are in a pitiful situation because the legislation is extremely complicated and it is very hard for most claimants to deal with it themselves.  I am delighted that this is being extended to tribunals.</P>
    <P>It is important that people taking a case to the employment appeals tribunal can get free legal aid going there because without a shadow of a doubt people with more money get more justice because they can employ better people.</P>
    <P>I am worried about fees payable to solicitors for family law cases under the new scheme.  I am delighted that so many solicitors have come forward and said that they will take these cases.  The solicitors will probably be charged retention tax on the £75 fee so they will get very little money out of it.  In many cases very inexperienced solicitors may be dealing with clients and family law is very difficult. The whole structure of that family and the whole relationship between the parents and their children may depend on what happens in court on that day and if it gets as far as court I would like to be sure that those involved in the court cases were getting the very best possible advice.</P>
    <P>Finally, I commend all those who work in the free legal advice centres.  Often <Col N="1613" /> the most altruistic and idealistic of law students have gone into the centres and have done an enormous amount of work in guiding people in areas where they could not afford to get legal advice themselves or could not wait long enough to get to one of the legal aid centres.  I commend what the Minister is doing, but, as I said at the beginning, it is shocking that the citizens of this country tolerated the appalling situation in regard to civil legal aid for so long.  While the Minister has improved the situation enormously, and I hope by the end of the year things will have improved further, we have a very long way to go to secure justice for all our citizens in these areas.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to support the motion welcoming the commitment of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in the major expansion that he has undertaken in the civil legal aid service since coming into office.  I agree with other Senators who have said that the base was quite low and that any improvement had to be dramatic to have had any effect.  The provision in the 1994 budget of almost £5 million to fund the free legal service constitutes an increase of 56 per cent and must be welcomed by everybody.  That is not to say that we cannot continue to strive for further improvement or that we should rest on our oars.  We must examine what other improvements are required.  There is no point in enacting laws if people are not fully protected by them.  We should not tolerate a situation where there is one law for those who can pay and no law for those who cannot.  I would see this as a step in the right direction, but it is only one step and we need to keep pressing on.  I would remind my colleagues on the other side of the House that that will mean extra funding which has to come from somewhere.</P>

      <P>You cannot ask people who are attending law centres to pay for that service because they would not be there if they could afford to get legal advice <Col N="1614" /> elsewhere.  The money, therefore, has to come from the public purse and it is quite hypocritical for Senator Neville to start shouting &mdash; as I am sure he is about to &mdash; for extra legal centres&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;without providing the extra taxation to fund the provision of such centres.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to heading off the problem before it gets to court.  It is essential, particularly in family law situations, to keep as many families as possible out of the current legal system, which is highly adversarial.  Whatever illfeeling there may be between a couple before they get into court, it is exaggerated and exacerbated by the time they have finished there.  While adults can possibly take the strain of such court proceedings, the poor, unfortunate children, witnessing two people tearing themselves apart, cannot.  Such proceedings should almost be banned as a blood sport because people in that situation have no mercy for one another and all their failings are laid bare.  Any hope there may have been before for any form of civilised behaviour between the partners goes out the window in court.  Therefore, any money that can be provided for pre-court action in the form of mediation, conciliation or reconciliation should be provided.  It would be more cost effective to have only one mediator as distinct from a judge, barrister, solicitor and the whole legal paraphernalia tied up in the hearing of family law cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disturbing to find that 97 per cent of the work of the civil legal aid service is taken up in family law cases because there are many more issues that people need help with.  I am aware that the Small Claims Court will go some way towards removing such cases from the ambit of the civil legal aid service, but there are many more issues of law which affect people who cannot afford to take on a lawyer.  People need to take on the system and the whole way of looking at a problem.  The ability to challenge any <Col N="1615" /> adjudication concerning the amount of maintenance to be paid by a husband is usually well beyond the reach of a wife, who is the less dominant and less well off partner.  People need help in challenging other issues of law, such as partnership agreements in the small business sector, because they cannot afford to go through a private law practice.  Much injustice is being done for the want of a proper comprehensive legal advice system.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Fine Gael Senators have tabled this amendment for the simple reason that it is an isolated debate.  The issue requires more than two hours of discussion.  The report came out last week and I have only had my copy for the past few days.  There is a lot in it that needs to be discussed and pushing it in here onto another motion is diminishing its impact.  I cannot disagree with what Senator Neville has down here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this important issue which deals with one of the most vulnerable sections of society and one that has been neglected with regard to the application of proper legal aid.  It has been neglected in other areas as well but we are dealing with legal aid now and any improvement there is welcome.  It is important that everybody, regardless of income, is properly represented in court and has full access to the law.  The State should provide this service to people who do not have the financial resources to obtain it.  Equality of rights must be granted to every citizen and that must be our aim under the Constitution. The granting of free legal aid is an important arm in ensuring that sections of society that cannot afford it have full access to the law, full legal representation and full defence when required.</P>
      <P>Centres have been established throughout the country, but they have been established in areas with high populations. As Senator Kelly said, in some parts of the country people have difficulty obtaining access to those centres for geographical reasons.  We are dealing with people who do not have access to transport. Many people do not have cars. When people who cannot afford solicitors come to my clinics with family difficulties I advise them to go to the centre in Limerick.  However, travel is an automatic barrier for such people and it is difficult to persuade them to go to the centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> The Minister should encourage the private solicitor approach.  Such solicitors could be more readily available in our smaller towns.  People can relate to their local solicitor, who could be available free of charge.  If a person approached myself or Senator Kelly in Limerick we could recommend a solicitor who is known to the person and whose office is readily available.  That would be preferable to recommending that the person travel 15, 20, 30 or even 50 miles to an area and offices with which the person is not familiar.  My remarks are not patronising. That has been my experience in dealing with the family problems of people with no income.  Those are the barriers they encounter in obtaining and accepting the free legal aid system.</P>
    <P>The legal service is alien to many areas and many sections of society.  Many families have not had experience of dealing with the law.  People with more income are more aware of the use of the law and of how to get access to the law.  People who require free legal aid are often not accustomed to looking to the law to defend them.  Usually they have not required legal services.  Unfortunately, the number of family law cases which arise each year is growing rapidly.  We as public representatives will be aware of that fact because of the number of such cases which are brought to our attention at constituency clinics.  That is, of course, a separate issue.  However, legal aid must be available to assist those people.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts that the expansion in free legal aid is inadequate.  It is welcome but, as Senator Henry said, it is inadequate.  We will encourage the Government to continue the expansionary programme and praise the Government when it does so.  Senator Kelly has asked how we can fund such a programme.  We could reduce the contribution to Dublin Castle from £5 million to £2 million and the contribution to the expansion of Collins Barracks from £5 million to £2 million.  That would make £6 million available to apply to this programme.</P>
    <P>There are huge waiting lists in the legal area.  People who go to law for the first <Col N="1618" /> time expect instant reaction.  They are unfamiliar with waiting lists in the courts. I might advise a person to go to the free legal aid centre in Limerick.  The person will travel the 15 miles on a bus and on his or her return will report that nothing can be done for a number of months. People are surprised at the delay because they expect their cases to dealt with immediately.  It is important that we strive to deal with cases swiftly.  The personnel in legal aid centres should also explain to people &mdash; because often they are not sensitive to people's expectations &mdash; that it is not unusual that cases cannot be dealt with immediately, that the cases will be dealt with as quickly as possible and that there is concern for their situation. That would be preferable to simply giving a legalistic response.</P>
    <P>I welcome the expansion of free legal aid to tribunals.  I am on the Employment Appeals Tribunal and we had a case yesterday where a person who had been dismissed sought an adjournment because a witness could not attend.  It would have cost the tribunal an inordinate amount of money and we had to refuse the request.  As a consequence the person will have to employ a barrister and solicitor for a second day.  The person is out of work, but we had to do our duty.  Somebody else had been negligent. However, that unemployed person will be obliged to pay a solicitor and barrister for two days.  I believe solicitors and barristers should not be necessary before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and I have consistently argued that case, particularly during the discussion on the Unfair Dismissals Act.  The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, took up the issue, but it is impossible to rectify the situation now.  It is a fact of life that people will get solicitors and barristers to put their cases to the employment appeals tribunal and other tribunals.  I hope it will not happen in social welfare tribunals.  The people involved in that area are open and sympathetic and an adversarial approach is not necessary.</P>
    <P>The area of family law litigation is highly unsatisfactory and our amendment expresses that.  Many Circuit Court <Col N="1619" /> judges are asked to hear up to 70 cases per day.  It is impossible.  Attempting to deal with that amount of work means that no case is dealt with correctly regardless of the efforts of the Judiciary.  Quick decisions and lack of full consideration of cases is not in the long term interest of justice, children and spouses.  It is more important that sufficient time is given to ensure that the best decision is made rather than getting through a volume of cases.  About 12 months ago we discussed this in a motion before the Seanad.  It is an area of concern which we could debate again.</P>
    <P>We should look at the physical conditions of courts.  They are appalling and are a barrier to proper justice.  There should be proper waiting rooms.  People must sit on cold benches in draughty courthouses which were built up to 150 years ago.  I raised the issue of conditions in our coroners' courts during the discussion on the Suicide Bill.  I have spoken to people who went to those courts after the suicide of a family member and heard of the appalling conditions in which they had to wait and listen to other cases. Despite the pressure on those people, they do not have a waiting room.  Sometimes they do not even have heat.  The Minister should look at that area and try to provide proper facilities.  The family court facilities in Dublin are good.  If there were similar facilities throughout the country we would be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I accept that procedures should be established to avoid court cases in family law.  There should be greater mediation to ensure that relationships are not further broken down.  Litigation exacerbates the breakdown of such relationships.  I accept the motion before the House and I am sure that the other parties will accept our amendment to it.  Regardless of the way we started the debate, we can leave the House amicably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have liked to continue the air of bonhomie created by Senator Neville.  It might have been easier to do so if his party had added detail to the motion rather than deleting <Col N="1620" /> its good aspects.  It is difficult to accept an amendment which deletes the welcome to the Government's commitment to improve access to justice through the development and expansion of the services of the Legal Aid Board and replaces it with something entirely different.  It would be useful if the Opposition parties, when confronted with a motion from the Government parties, would acknowledge the good parts of the motion rather than deleting them.</P>
      <P>I might start a row by saying that I am disturbed by certain underlying aspects to this motion and the thrust of the Minister's contribution and some of my colleagues. I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, has left the House because she was nodding her head vigorously when Senator Neville welcomed the family mediation services and said that recourse to the courts for those with marriages in difficulty should be a last resort.  This is at odds with comments attributed to the Minister of State in the media recently, where she was quoted as saying that there is an over-emphasis on families and family issues.  Perhaps the Minister of State was misquoted, but this debate would have been an ideal opportunity to explain her position.  Family values are under attack.  I have serious difficulties with the thrust of some of the pronouncements made in the public arena about family values and the direction we seem to be taking.  However, that is an argument for another day and another place and different legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the expansion of the free legal aid scheme.  I particularly welcome the setting up of a new law centre in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim. This is the first time such an initiative has been taken in my home county and I applaud the Minister for his enterprise.  I was especially interested in the staffing measures he announced to coincide with the expansion of these law centres nationwide. The law centre in Carrick-on-Shannon, despite its part-time status, will create new jobs.  The Minister has promised 24 new solicitors and 34 support staff, including law clerks and clerical assistants, for the new centres.  I hope <Col N="1621" /> these personnel, and especially the support staff, will be recruited from the immediate Carrick-on-Shannon area where there is a high incidence of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension of the small claims court.  We have been lagging behind in this area in a European context for some time.  That will not only take some of the workload from the District Courts but will also provide more immediate, greater and effective access for those submitting small claims.</P>
    <P>The Minister &mdash; several of my colleagues have also made this point &mdash; said the reason for the longer waiting lists in this area is due mainly to family difficulties. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Since 1990 a good deal of the reason for the build up in cases with law centres has been the coming into operation of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989...  Applications for judicial separation under the 1989 Act, which comprise a substantial part of legal aid work, are more complex and time consuming to process... The number of people seeking legal aid for judicial separation has increased from 133 in 1988-89... to 524 in 1992.</P>
    <P>I found this aspect fascinating &mdash; there is no fascination in the figures; it is a story of heartbreak and sadness &mdash; in the context of the debate about the proposed divorce referendum.  If there is currently an increase in the number of cases coming to the Legal Aid Board for applications under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, one wonders whether this development will change to any appreciable degree if divorce is introduced.</P>
    <P>While legislation like the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act has permitted people to seek judicial redress, the Minister stopped short of rushing headlong into divorce by encouraging counselling and reconciliation and then provides an extra £750,000 to voluntary bodies operating in this area.  It would be churlish of anybody not to welcome that <Col N="1622" /> development; indeed, this is the direction the Government should take.</P>
    <P>Would people see divorce as a first or a last resort if it were introduced?  Would the increasing tendency for people to go to law centres to seek redress under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act continue if a divorce environment was created?  At the end of the day, the only ones who would benefit from this would be the lawyers.  Family matters are increasingly been taken into the area of jurisprudence where both lawyers and barristers are required.  One cannot develop the argument fully at this stage in the absence of the Government's proposals in this area.  However, this point re-emphasises what I said at the outset.  There is a disturbing trend and I would have serious difficulty with its continuance in the manner suggested.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the family mediation service initiative, but only in the context of my contribution which is centred more on family reconciliation and mediation than separation.  I do not want to give the impression that I am ostrich-like in my attitude.  It is no longer tenable to suggest that someone is more or less conservative in their thinking because they come from a certain part of the country.  I could cite several cases of marital difficulties and separations in my home town which has a population of 700, and I am sure the same would be true of any town or village. The State has a responsibility to do its utmost to ensure that married people stay together rather than encouraging them to separate.  I know some liberals would throw up their hands and say I am suggesting the State should decide on the direction marriages should take.  If the State is already beefing up the mediation and reconciliation services by giving them more money, maybe we should go the whole way and ensure that the best service is provided to deal with marital difficulties.</P>

      <P>I welcome the extension of the free legal aid scheme.  Although its funding has increased by 52 per cent, we are still well behind the rest of Europe. Even with this increase, the amount we <Col N="1623" /> spend on free legal aid per head of population is £1.46 compared to £4 for Northern Ireland and £4.80 in the Netherlands. There is still a long way to go.</P>
      <P>The free legal aid system deals almost exclusively with family law matters. However, the scheme is still not comprehensive enough.  The Minister gave a commitment to look at representations before tribunals, for instance, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Social Welfare Appeals Tribunal.  There was a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to include tribunals in the scheme.  Perhaps the Minister would consider this extension. The scheme should also be extended to help in the preparation for the divorce referendum and I am sure more pressure will be put on the various centres throughout the country.  Although there has been an extension, further funding is required.</P>
      <P>Many speakers talked about the high percentage of family law cases which these centres deal with.  I agree with previous speakers who asked for increased funding for mediation services.  People who take cases to court are often at the end of their tether by the time they get there.  Many such cases might not go to court if counselling and mediation services were provided beforehand.  It is important to provide extra staff to counsel children.  We also need to appoint extra members of the Judiciary who have specialised training in family law matters. I welcome the recent appointment of Ms. Catherine McGuinness to the Circuit Court because she has great experience in family law matters.  We need more people like her on the Bench.  Many judges need specialised training because this is a specialised area and I would like to see changes taking place in this regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiatives taken by the Minister and I offer my party's support for them.  The scheme should be further extended because, although we have increased the funding, we have a long way to go.</P>

      <P>I opened this debate at 6 o'clock this evening when the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, was in the House.  I now welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, to the House.</P>
      <P>It has been a good debate, but I want to refer to a number of points made by Senator Mooney about the regard of Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, for family values and family life.  Her record in defending people, particularly women, is without parallel.  Divorce is a matter for the partnership Government's programme and it will be implemented.  This issue will be put to the people in a referendum. This decision has been taken by both parties in Government and I am happy this will happen.</P>
      <P>The debate about civil legal aid was about the hidden Ireland where women continued to suffer.  They suffered beatings, deprivation and indignities because they had no redress.  The rich could consult with lawyers and psychiatrists, while the poor had to continue suffering.  I am delighted that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has seen fit to double the budget and the staff and to open more legal aid centres in this country, which has not been attempted before.  This will be of benefit to the poor and to the fabric of our society.  I commend Deputy Taylor and the Government for their actions because the Cabinet must always make a decision about spending cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is has been a generous debate and I accept the contributions made by Senator Cosgrave and Senator Enright, who are practising lawyers.  Except for the last part of the amendment, it addresses questions proper to the Minister for Justice. The last part calls on the Government to provide adequate funds and staff for existing and new legal aid centres.  Both sides of the House must agree that this requirement has been met by the existing centres and by funding.  I agree with Senator Neville that the condition of courthouses is disgraceful.  It is inhuman that families must queue in public to <Col N="1625" /> transact business on the most traumatic day of their lives and this should be changed.</P>
    <P>I accept the first three sections of the Opposition's amendment.  If it is not pressed to a vote, I agree with the permission of the Whips, to address the question of the appointment of members of the Judiciary who have specialised training.  No one disagrees with the fact they need training because decisions have been made by the Bench which have made us recoil in horror.</P>
    <P>I agree also that extra staff is needed to deal with the delays in child assessments. This is one area where the Opposition and the Government are not divided, unless we invent divisions.  We will only invent them for political point scoring which satisfies the politicians, angers the public and resolves nothing.  I accept the amendment and we will discuss it at a future date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for accepting this matter on the Adjournment.  I raise this matter due to the intolerable situation many farming families are facing because of the failure of the Department of Agriculture to meet its responsibilities with regard to payments under a number of schemes. Those payments are not due for 1994 but for 1993.  No other sector of society would tolerate a situation whereby coming towards the end of March it had not <Col N="1626" /> received payments for 1993.  I cannot understand why the Department of Agriculture, having operated a number of those schemes for a number of years, cannot get its act together and be in a position to make the payments to the farming families.</P>
      <P>In excess of 0.5 million payments are organised and made weekly by the Department of Social Welfare; yet farmers cannot get the payments to which they are entitled from the Department of Agriculture.  I cannot understand why many of the payments due to farmers have not been made.  All of this money is EU funded to some degree and why farmers cannot be paid the money they are owed I just do not understand.  No other sector of society would tolerate the way the Irish farmers have been treated.</P>
      <P>These payments are owed under the ewe subsidy scheme, the headage payments scheme, the suckler cow scheme, the beef premium scheme, the equine payments scheme and the extensification scheme.  This has been one of the most difficult years for farmers for God knows how long because of the extremely bad weather we have had since November, yet farmers have not been paid the grants they badly need to purchase feed for their livestock.  I have no doubt that the Cathaoirleach, like me, is inundated with people coming to him asking when those payments will be made.</P>
      <P>The ewe subsidy scheme should have been paid long ago for 1993; but, as far as I can establish from the Minister of State's office, no date is set for payment as yet.  That is intolerable when farmers have had to purchase feed since last November to keep their stock alive during one of the most difficult years in farming from the point of view of weather and other difficulties that sheep farmers are experiencing from losses.  However, they have been left waiting for the ewe premium of approximately £9 or £10 pounds per head.  At least that is the rate in Connacht; it may be less in Leinster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Headage payments are organised by Brussels as a subsidy to farmers in the severely disadvantaged areas of this country &mdash; in other words, farmers who <Col N="1627" /> cannot make a living from the land in its own right.  Those payments have not been made for 1993 as yet.  Some farmers have received 60 per cent while others have received nothing.  No matter who is contacted in the Department of Agriculture you are told that they are too busy, they are bogged down with files and they are not able to explain why the payments have not been made, particularly to those farmers who have received nothing or only 20 per cent of their entitlement.  It is hilarious that what was supposed to be an income subsidy for farmers to be paid in the year it was due &mdash; that was the intention behind the scheme &mdash; is now three months overdue and there is no sign of payment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suckler cow scheme, I understand that approximately 60 per cent has been paid in most cases. However, that leaves 40 per cent outstanding. Once again there are farmers who have received none of the payments due and I cannot understand why the Department cannot get its act together for the 1993 scheme.  It is supposed to have been computerised, the forms are computerised, yet it cannot pay out the money due.  As I understand it, these animals were examined before July 1993, yet the payment has not been issued.  It is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy J. Walsh, is not here but I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O' Shea, to the House.  The Minister for Agriculture should be in a position to answer the questions I am asking as the buck stops on his desk.  The beef premium scheme is hilarious.</P>
    <P>I am aware of cases in my county where people filled out the forms as drafted by the Department of Agriculture and they put in the dates of birth as requested &mdash; 21 months on 1 January 1993.  They were turned down because they were told that the animals should be a month older. These people are distinct from those who were put out of the scheme because of errors.  These people filled out the forms precisely as demanded by the Department of Agriculture and were told that <Col N="1628" /> they could not be paid on two, four or maybe six animals, but got grants for the rest of the animals.  They were not put out of the scheme because they were right and the Department was wrong.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand &mdash; and it defies explanation &mdash; how Department officials could be so naive as to allow forms to go out which were totally wrong.  There were other people who applied for the ten months of 1992 and put down the animals' age.  They applied again in 1993 and were told that they had applied in 1992 with the animals at a certain age and that there was an irregularity with the reapplication.  They got a letter from the Department telling them that they were out of the scheme for two years.  Can the Minister or any of the Department's officials justify people being deprived when they have made genuine errors?  It is the same as saying to somebody that they must work for the next two years without any payment.</P>
    <P>This goes back before the time of the Minister of State, back to the naivety of the Ministers who accepted the CAP reform without knowing what they were accepting.  The Irish farmers are now stuck with the situation and are paying through the nose because of mistakes by the Minister of the day and his officials who did not know what they were accepting from Brussels and are not now able to implement the scheme.  I defy contradiction on that matter.</P>
    <P>Some cases cannot be justified.  One person had 48 bullocks entered for the scheme, four of which did not have teeth and were turned down.  Anyone who knows anything about livestock knows not all animals have their teeth at two years of age, yet these were turned down even though they were over 24 months. That man was deprived of his beef premium payments, not just for 1993 but for 1994 also.  Department officials must start to operate the schemes sensibly.  If they continue to implement them as at present they will be asking for passports and birth certificates for every animal born in this country.  The scheme is collapsing and it <Col N="1629" /> must be amended so it can be operated practically.</P>
    <P>The equine scheme grants have also not been paid.  Documentation must be submitted and the bloodline of the animal sent with the application.  Yet only 60 per cent of the grant is paid.  Why is the full amount not paid?  The documentation has been supplied; 60 per cent of the grant would not have been paid if it had not been.  Why has the full payment not been given so people can have the money to which they are entitled?</P>
    <P>Last year there was great difficulties with the extensification payments.  Forms were issued to the farming community in March 1993, which were withdrawn in April and had to be resubmitted by 1 June.  Yet no word has come from the Department of Agriculture as to when those payments will be made to farmers. Farmers had to consult maps and exclude roadways, rivers and rocks from their property, but no word has come.  The same position now arises in that maps and other paraphernalia now have to be supplied.  Farmers are entitled to know how much they will receive and when they will receive it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to say how much money is owed under each scheme and when it will be paid.  He will accept my remarks are not directed at the him but refer to the way the scheme operates in practice, which has caused major frustration to me, the people I represent and many other politicians from rural constituencies. The people are entitled to know when they will receive their grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of CAP reform the number of livestock and area aid applications received in 1993 increased sharply when compared to the number received in 1992.  That increase was of the magnitude of 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new EU regulations governing the premium and headage schemes from 1993 are considerably more complex than the regulations they replaced.  For example, they introduced for the first time area aid applications; stocking density <Col N="1630" /> limits into the premium schemes; individual quotas into the ewe premium and suckler cow premium schemes; requirements relating to the keeping of registers under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes; and the entering on computer databases of the tag numbers of cattle submitted for suckler cow premium and disadvantaged areas grants.</P>
    <P>The consequence of the substantial increase in the number of applications received in 1993 and of the greatly increased complexity of the EU rules governing the 1993 premium and headage schemes has been a great strain on the administrations of all member states of the EU and not just on the Irish Administration.  Whereas Ireland managed to pay 60 per cent advances of special beef and suckler cow premia in late 1993, for example, some other EU member states did not manage to do so. The overall position in Ireland at present is as good as or better than the positions in most other member states.</P>
    <P>By 21 March 1994 my Department had made some 402,700 payments under the 1993 special beef, slaughter, suckler cow and ewe premium schemes and the 1993 cattle, equine and sheep headage schemes in the disadvantaged areas. These payments came to some £234 million. Considerable progress has been achieved in clearing payments since the beginning of the year with some £50 million being issued.</P>
    <P>Payments are continuing across all schemes and November 1993 special beef premium payments are about to commence. The final instalment of the 1993 ewe premium was recently adopted by the European Commission thus clearing the way for payment to be made.  Most farmers are expected to receive their payments by the middle of April.</P>
    <P>Many of the outstanding payments are the subject of queries &mdash; this is particularly so in the case of the special beef premium scheme &mdash; and the failure of farmers to respond in many cases to the Department's necessary inquiries is slowing up payment.  Payment of the balances in respect of special beef and suckler cow <Col N="1631" /> premia is essentially dependent on all 1993 applications from an applicant being processed.  This effectively means payment of these balances cannot commence before April.</P>
    <P>Our objective is to continue processing all 1993 applications and pay all outstanding non-problem cases during the next two months.  Overtime has been sanctioned to ensure this objective is achieved and I am satisfied the substantial progress made to date on the 1993 payments will be maintained so as to achieve clearance of all 1993 non-problem cases in the earliest time.  Looking to the future, I have arranged for the allocation of some £4.8 million to provide extra staffing and computer resources to my Department to expedite the processing of payments under these schemes in 1994 and future years.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the increased complexity of the rules governing schemes causes problems to farmers in filling in their application forms.  I am therefore pleased that Teagasc is continuing its CAP consultancy service, which was used by so many farmers last year.  I believe this service, along with farmers being more attuned to the new requirements in 1994, will contribute to more accurate <Col N="1632" /> completion of applications and thereby achieve the earliest payment of headage and premia grants.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to be specific on the amounts outstanding under the various schemes, given the linkages under the integrated administration and control system between all applications submitted by applicants, the stocking density and individual ceiling provisions and the difficulty of estimating the numbers of animals likely to qualify for extensification grants.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I join with him in complimenting Teagasc for its work. However, it is regrettable that the Department is unable to give an estimate of the amount owed to farmers within £10 million.  The question I asked related to the money owed and while I did not expect the precise amount, I did expect a round figure.</P>
