      <P>I have notice from Senator Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make a special allocation of funds available in 1994 to Clare County Council to undertake major remedial and maintenance works on the Ennis/Kilrush/Kilkee road in view of its importance from an economic and tourism point of view.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Bill Cotter of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to upgrade, as a matter of urgency, facilities at Knockconan and Derravoy national schools, Truagh, County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Seán Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the urban renewal scheme in the town of Letterkenny, County Donegal and to introduce the scheme in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Daly's and Senator Cotter's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Maloney may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to have a full debate on Northern Ireland next week, if possible.  I asked him to do so last week and he said he was willing in principle but he could not give the House a specific guarantee.  All sides of the House would like an opportunity to discuss events in Northern Ireland and in this part of the country since our debate on the Downing Street declaration.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House also allocate time next week to discuss Item 31, the report titled &ldquo;A Crusade for Survival&rdquo; which was mentioned last week? All parties agreed then that the matter should be debated at length in the Seanad.  There is a certain urgency about the matter and the Leader should move quickly in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader make time available tomorrow to discuss Item 32, a motion in the names of the Independent Senators? There would be agreement in the House to that matter being discussed if only for one hour tomorrow.  It has not been discussed in the other House or in Committee, as far as I know.  The Independent Senators might prefer more than one hour for the debate.  However, in anticipation, I wish to make my support on the matter known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past weeks the social partners have discussed the <Col N="175" /> new programme &mdash; the Programme for Competitiveness and Work &mdash; which will be launched next Monday afternoon.  As the programme will determine the country's direction in many areas over the next three years, it would be appropriate to have a detailed report and full discussion on it in the House as soon as possible.  I ask the Leader to consider having such a discussion either next week or the week after.  It would be in our interest if Members of the House were briefed on what is planned and if they understood the operation of the programme.</P>
      <P>There is an outstanding commitment since before Christmas that the Leader of the House will make time available &mdash; and the matter has been raised on a number of occasions since &mdash; for another discussion on the marine and associated matters.  It need not be a long debate, although when it was last discussed many Members did not have the opportunity to participate and most who spoke were unable to develop their points.  There have been developments in the marine sector in the intervening period and we need another opportunity to discuss it.</P>
      <P>Finally, I again ask the Leader of the House to outline a programme of work for the coming months.  It is important that we know what is happening with regard to legislation.  The other House will be concerned with the Finance Bill for a long period.  This is a critical time for the initiation of legislation and this House should claim that task.  There is a need for organisation and the Government Departments should indicate what legislation is planned.  Legislation which is already prepared should be introduced in this House and should not be delayed in order to allow the Finance Bill go through the other House.  That causes a problem every year, with the result that legislation is forced through at the end of the session.  I urge the Leader of the House to reach an understanding with the Government Departments that such legislation will be initiated here.</P>

      <P>My request to the Leader of the House echoes Senator O'Toole's first statement with regard to <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> 2 and what will emerge from it.  It seems extraordinary that a cosy tea party takes place in Merrion Street where the social partners wander in and out while the elected representatives do not seem to have any input into the process.</P>

      <P>It is essential that this House debates the matter even at this stage.  It is quite extraordinary in a parliamentary democracy that Parliament seems to be the last place consulted about this matter and that public representatives elected to the Houses do not have an input to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter I wish to raise relates to Private Members' Business this evening, the motion on residential property tax.  In view of the interest in this matter would the Leader be prepared to extend the time, even by a quarter of an hour?  As the Cathaoirleach is aware, we have been running into difficulties.  In this instance we need to leave time to explore <Col N="177" /> the differences between the Government parties on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason we need extra time.  I support Senator Mannings's call for a debate on Northern Ireland. My request would have been more specific and would relate to section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, but that can be dealt with in the overall debate.  Once again we have a major decision taken during a parliamentary recess and Parliament did not seem to have any input.  That strikes me as being antidemocratic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I call again this week on the Leader of the House to have a full day's debate on the fishing industry.  It is vital to have such a debate because over the past three months fishermen have suffered due to bad weather.  If it was the farmers they would all be out shouting, but when it is the poor old fishermen nobody stands up for them.  During the last three months of really bad weather boats have been tied to the pier and fishermen are not able to meet their financial commitments.  The Minister should have our support in the negotiations in Europe at the beginning of April.  There should be no further restrictions on quotas and the Irish box must be maintained for the Irish fleet and the Irish industry.  I call for the debate as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the leader of the Fine Gael side for referring to motion 32 in the name of the Independent Senators. It was phrased carefully in discussion with my colleagues and it reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Irish Government to press the UN to take whatever international measures, military, political, and economic, are necessary to protect the civilian population of Sarajevo; and to further the establishment of a lasting peace in Bosnia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> It is important that we have an opportunity to discuss this matter and I ask the Leader to give an indication as to when that discussion will take place.  These matters have been discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and there are five Members of this House on that committee.  I hope, in the light the general support there would be, that we might discuss it at this juncture. There is a movement toward making a decision about air strikes.</P>
    <P>I would also ask for an update on a matter about which I and other Members, on both sides, asked for a debate, that is, the drug problem in the inner city.  The Cathaoirleach and the Leader will be aware that in the last couple of days statements have been made that there are up to 40 pushers selling drugs in one small area of the south inner city on any given day.  It is a matter that should be discussed in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call to the Leader of the House for an early debate on Northern Ireland.  The agenda has changed.  This House should have the opportunity of sending a clear signal and expressing its support for the Downing Street declaration.  If we do not have that debate or send that signal we are not representing those who elected us as a parliamentary body.  We have to be seen to have a clear voice on this important national issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also welcome a debate on the former Yugoslavia.  This issue was raised in the House last year. Now we face the possibility of air strikes to lift the siege of Sarajevo.  It may be rather late for this House to debate the matter when this development is imminent. We may hear calls from outside that the wrong steps were taken.  It is important that we debate the issue immediately, at least to give support for whatever actions are taken.  Our Minister for Foreign Affairs would then know the views in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drugs issue should be debated in full.  The problem has gone on for far too <Col N="179" /> long and has not been properly addressed in this House.  This morning I heard a former Member of this House support the legalisation of soft drugs and perhaps even harder drugs.  Such call should be rejected immediately.  Those views are not condoned by many.  I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on these two issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald's call for a full day's debate on the fishing industry.  It is probably our biggest national resource and it deserves our fullest attention.</P>
      <P>On the drugs issue, I have urged for some time that a co-ordinated plan be put in place, with the co-operation of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence and for the Marine, to protect our coastline from the importation of drugs.  This would require a full day's debate.  The point raised by Senator Norris shows that this issue has two aspects; first, the importation of drugs and second, the use and supply of drugs in local areas.</P>
      <P>The history of this House shows it has led the way on Northern Ireland.  It would be good if we could devote a large amount of time to a debate on this issue and how matters are progressing.  At such a debate I would take the opportunity to put paid to the howls of derision and opposition from the Members opposite about certain measures undertaken. Sometimes those who oppose initiatives have a lack of vision and oppose the measures because they have no proposals to put forward.  That debate should be held at the earliest date possible.</P>
      <P>Finally, I call for a debate on another issue I raised previously.  Because of mistreatment in the conduct of the criminal justice system in Britain, we should have a full debate on the Extradition (Amendment) Bill before it comes before this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">

      <P>We will continue to mention to the Tánaiste the requests made by several Members for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I will return to the House <Col N="180" /> with a more definite statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of the Whip that a debate on Item 31 take place next Thursday. It is an important matter for all those interested in the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Item 32, the Independent motion, was mentioned by Senator Manning.  The Tánaiste attended an important meeting on this issue in Brussels during the week and we will have a discussion on it.  I know the House would welcome the opportunity of even a short debate.</P>

      <P>The issue of the marine was raised by several Senators.  I can assure the House that within the next few weeks we will be afforded the opportunity to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>I spoke this morning to the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Dempsey, about the programme of legislation.  I will bring the information to the House next week if I do not have it tomorrow. Senator Dardis asked for more time tonight.  Having listened to and read the Taoiseach's speech this morning, he will have ample opportunity tonight to discuss the issues he may wish to raise and to remind Members of the House of commitments and statements made over the years on various issues.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 4, after &ldquo;building,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;mobile home,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister made an amendment in the other House to insert the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;means&rdquo;.  I accept that this could include mobile home and I will not press the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, paragraph <i>(e)</i>, line 18, after &ldquo;train&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;bus, taxi,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The section refers to any train, vessel or vehicle used for the carriage of persons for reward.  It is important that there is a particular emphasis on buses and taxis. Assaults on train drivers are rare but there are frequent and regular assaults on both taxi drivers and bus drivers in this city. A considerable number of bus drivers, mainly in Dublin but also across the country, <Col N="182" /> are assaulted and robbed on a regular basis.  We should endeavour in this House to reassure many of these bus drivers that we share their concern and fears about continual assaults and robberies.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in 1992 there were 81 assaults on bus drivers, while in 1993 there were 84 assaults.  In 1992, there was 51 robberies of bus drivers while in 1993 there were over 80. There are approximately 1,750 bus drivers in Dublin, and of these, 50 are out of work through injury following assault. Mr. Bob Montgomery of Dublin Bus stated recently: &ldquo;We would hope to have the continued support of our customers, the Gardaí and the courts in ensuring that our staff can carry out their jobs free from the threat of assault&rdquo;.  I accept that, but we in this House should make every effort to protect bus drivers and taxi drivers who are in the frontline and are being continually assaulted.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus are introducing protective screens to help safeguard drivers, but the inclusion of this amendment in the Bill would be of benefit and would demonstrate that this House shares the concern of Dublin Bus and the bus and taxi drivers in this city.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minster to give favourable consideration to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I also share the concerns of workers in Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.  When I had responsibility for both organisations in 1992, as Minister for Transport, there was close co-operation between them and the Garda Síochána to minimise the number of attacks as far as possible, especially late at night. Over a period of time, late night services to certain parts of Dublin were suspended. I was delighted that those services were resumed with the full co-operation of the gardaí when I was Minster for Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Justice I have taken an interest in this area and I am aware that substantial progress and improvements have taken place regarding a lowering of the level and the number of assaults on drivers, and that Bus <Col N="183" /> Éireann has taken, with the advice of the gardaí, the kind of measures to which the Senator referred.  The officials and workers of Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath can be assured that every support will be given to them by the Garda Síochána to try to minimise both the number and the level of assaults.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the proposed amendment is necessary.  There is no doubt that both buses and taxis are covered by the phrase &ldquo;vehicle used for the carriage of persons for reward&rdquo;.  I am also advised that there could be technical difficulties with the proposed amendment and that it would be unlikely to be helpful to the courts in interpreting the section itself.  For example, as worded, it might be taken to suggest that a bus or a train is not a vehicle used for the carriage of persons for reward and this would cause needless confusion.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that because of the use of the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo;, the list is not intended to be exhaustive.  While I appreciate what the Senator is trying to do, I am unable to accept the proposed amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In my discussions with Dublin Bus and the taxi drivers, they expressed their appreciation of the work of the Garda Síochána, which has been enhanced by the link between their radio controls and the Garda stations.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes specific reference to trains.  The offences covered by this amendment relate to public order, especially with regard to buses, bus drivers and taxi drivers, many of whom are in fear for their personal safety at times and, on occasion, for their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that a clear message goes out from this House that any assaults on bus or taxi drivers will be viewed with the utmost gravity by this House, the courts and all other authorities.  This type of vandalism and crime must be stamped out.  People should be able to travel safely in this city and those who do not have private transport need buses.  For the sake of <Col N="184" /> those people, I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agrees it is necessary to ensure that those who drive and man buses in Dublin city and elsewhere are protected from those who would attack and rob them.  I sympathise with the Minister's position in terms of the legislation before the House.  If we refer directly to bus or taxi, we will face problems relating to definition, but the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; covers that.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Enright in regard to personnel, but I would deal with the protection of personnel by way of penalty and by ensuring the law is exercised to its fullest severity when people are attacked. Sometimes the exercise of the law in the protection of those who have been assaulted is not all that it might be.  I appeal to the Minister to deal with this matter through penalty rather than by the insertion of the words proposed by Senator Enright.  The Minister and Members on all sides of the House agree we must ensure that personnel and the public are not injured and property is not damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anyone is in any doubt, this section does not deal with assaults, it deals with the definition of a public place.  Senator Dardis made an important point when he said we have other laws which deal with assaults on taxi and bus drivers, etc.  Furthermore, strong powers have been given to the Garda Síochána in section 18 and elsewhere in the Bill.  Senator Dardis was correct when he said the way to deal with this type of assault is not by increasing powers or by introducing more legislation but rather by the level of penalty included in any Bill which deals with assaults.</P>
      <P>The amendment is superfluous because the term &ldquo;includes&rdquo; is contained, so the list is not designed to be exhaustive.  A vehicle used for the carriage of persons for rewards includes buses, taxis, hackneys, etc.  If the section lists vehicles, one is bound to leave one out, thus creating difficulties of interpretation in the courts at a later stage.</P>

      <P>We accept that a law must be practical and must deal with realities which arise. The Minister gave a commitment in the other House that she would accept the intention of an amendment put down by my colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, and that she would consider it between Report Stage in the Dáil and Committee Stage in the Seanad.  She has made amendments to section 3, which deals with the interpretation of the Bill, but she has not gone far enough.  It does not make sense that it is acceptable for somebody with a ghetto blaster to throw a cider party in their front garden and shout at neighbours as they go up and down the street but not acceptable, and seen as an interference with public order, if they do this outside their front gate.  I ask the Minister to explain why she could not accept more fully the recommendations made by my colleague in the other House.</P>

      <P>A similar amendment, as Senator Honan has said, was discussed at great length in the other House.  She is correct in saying I undertook to look at this matter again during the course of the Bill's progress in the Seanad.  The definition of a public place has already been amended to deal with the main practical difficulties about the definition as it was originally formulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> Fears were expressed that it would be insufficient to cover gangs of youths gathering and misbehaving in public parks, whether those parks were open or closed. Paragraph (b) of the definition now covers this.  Paragraph (c) also includes cemeteries and churchyards.  These were very sensible amendments to deal with real problems in our communities.</P>
    <P>There were very strong reservations expressed in the other House about an amendment similar to that tabled by Senator Honan.  The basic problem is that if places adjacent to public places are included, in reality almost everywhere becomes a public place.  I believe this would go too far.  To take the example Senator Honan raised, in which a family dispute takes place in someone's front garden and the behaviour of those involved can be seen and heard from the roadway, under the terms of the amendment the sections of the Bill would apply to that behaviour.  If that behaviour came within disorderly behaviour under section 5, an offence would have been committed and the Garda would have the power to direct the members of the family to leave.  If this direction was not complied with, there would be an automatic power of arrest.  While this may seem an extreme example, it well illustrates the need for caution in this area.</P>
    <P>The argument was strongly made elsewhere that essentially the very nature of public order offences is that they occur in areas to which the public generally has access.  They are not designed to regulate behaviour where a person is on his or her own property.  In terms of civil liberties considerations, it seems reasonable to suggest that the standards of behaviour required from people, when they are in areas to which others also have access, involve different considerations from the type of behaviour in which people can indulge, say, in their own back gardens. This distinction would be particularly acute in relation to disorderly behaviour under section 5.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, the criminal law should be more reluctant to intervene where behaviour of the kind covered in an early section of the Bill takes place <Col N="187" /> other than in a public place.  Otherwise, there would be a real danger that gardaí would be called on frequently to adjudicate on relatively trivial rows and disputes between neighbours who object to each other's behaviour when in their back gardens.  I do not dispute that genuine difficulties can arise in this regard but I regard the intervention of the criminal law, as apparently envisaged by this amendment, as far too blunt an instrument and going beyond the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have to say, however, that despite extensive consultations with the draftsman, we have not been in a position to devise a formula to deal with all possible genuine difficulties in a way which would not leave the definition wide open to cover matters such as family disputes. This type of difficulty was largely recognised by the proposing of similar amendments elsewhere.  We have devised a different approach in relation to one of the main difficulties mentioned in terms of the present definition.  It was suggested that under the definition the Garda would remain powerless to deal with gangs of youths who trespassed on derelict sites and caused difficulties for the surrounding communities.  This situation is already dealt with, to some extent, by section 13, which deals with trespass on any building or the curtilage thereof in such manner as causes, or is likely to cause, fear in another person.  In amendment No. 18 I propose to give the Garda power to move on people acting in such a manner.  This will represent a practical approach to the difficulties which have been raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly interested in this amendment and the Minister's reply, in which she goes some way to meet my anxieties.  She is, of course, very sensitive to issues of civil liberties and so, on most occasions, am I.  However, I am persuaded of the importance of this amendment by virtue of my own recent experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has more or less outlined some of the difficulties which can arise. <Col N="188" /> We have a problem, for example, in two buildings in North Great George's Street which I managed to get placed on the derelict sites register.  They were then taken over and an attempt was made to turn them into flats.  This broke the building regulations and resulted in a court case.  As a result, the buildings became derelict to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>There are some surviving tenancies from the original illegal development. There has been a series of squatters including cider drinkers, drug addicts and so on.  There have been attacks on the public, handbag snatchings and considerable nuisance occasioned by noise caused by ghetto blasters.  There is also the sound of floor boards being ripped up, electrical appliances being destroyed and people in the neighbouring house have been exposed to the danger of fire and flooding because the lead has been taken off the roof.</P>
    <P>The police have been extremely helpful and sympathetic.  We had a meeting last week with the superintendent in Fitzgibbon Street station.  I almost had to protect him because of the exasperation of some of my neighbours.  I had to say to them that this man is doing his best but he is circumscribed by the law.  Every instance raised by people who are living in great fear and trepidation next door to this nuisance was met by the superintendent saying that there are no powers under the criminal law.  The Garda cannot enter the building except in hot pursuit.  Noise, for example, is a civil matter.  A civil case can be difficult and long drawn out and in a situation where the proprietor of the property is ill disposed can expose the complainant to danger and intimidation.</P>
    <P>I am persuaded that there is a necessity to look further at this law so that the police have powers to do something where there is serious danger and threat. With regard to noise levels, for example, the superintendent explained that if there is an outrageous party going on late at night they can knock politely at the door&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, it is not. They can knock at the door and ask that the volume be reduced but they have no power to enforce it.</P>
      <P>Behaviour in trains, vessels, vehicles and so on can cause a nuisance to the public, but so can the behaviour of people on private property.  They appear to have rights even if their tenancy is illegal or if they are squatters.  I am not sure that is really acceptable.  I know that I may be going against my usual civil liberties stand in this but I do so simply because I am so aware of the problems for people living next door to such nuisance.  I have also been made aware of the difficulties for the police who do everything they possibly can but often their hands are tied.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone some distance to bridging the gap, if I may use that term, but I still see a difficulty. To put a hypothetical case to her, let us assume that there is a farmland adjacent to a housing estate.  People enter the land &mdash; as they have in the case of my farmland and had their cider party by the banks of the river &mdash; and in that way cause a nuisance, disturbance, criminal affray or whatever.  Is section 13 adequate to deal with that situation?  These people have entered private property and are trespassing.  Does it then become the owner's responsibility to eject them? What powers do the Garda have to get rid of them and to stop their activity?  In rural towns there can be a real problem where farmland or other private property runs right up to the edges of housing estates and buildings.  The distinction between the individual who comes in and causes disturbance and the gang that comes in and causes disturbance was dealt with by Senator Norris and I do not need to go into that in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that there is a balance to be struck between civil liberties and the right to privacy of householders and people living in residential areas.  If somebody has a neighbour who practises on his tenor sax for ten hours a day, does <Col N="190" /> that get to a point where it comes within the ambit of this legislation or would it be up to the injured party to take an action for nuisance and deal with it in the courts over a lengthy period at their own expense?  That should not be imposed on people.  In certain circumstances it should be dealt with under criminal law rather than having the individual seek redress at their own expense through the courts.</P>
    <P>I realise that there is a framing difficulty in terms of trying to cover every situation.  Nevertheless, I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about how this legislation might deal with those situations.</P>

      <P>The water has been muddied a little here and we are dealing with a number of different issues.  It is most important to remember the constitutional guarantee that one's private property will not be interfered with. There are several Acts which support this guarantee by protecting private property from trespassers, criminal damage and trespassers with criminal intent.</P>
      <P>I understand some of the points made but if an amendment similar to that suggested by Senator Honan is accepted, it could jeopardise the constitutionality of certain sections of the Bill.  There is also the consideration that many of the problems raised by the Members opposite are already dealt with both in recent legislation and other statutes which have been in place since the 1850s.  Inserting the suggested amendment would jeopardise the intent of the section and the Bill and it would be a bad move.</P>

      <P>Or Senator Mooney, who has a radio programme. We have to be careful not to complicate this legislation by trying to cover so many subjective matters.  Senator Norris gave an example about floorboards being ripped up and electrical wiring being pulled down and the genuine fear caused to neighbours.  When this Bill is passed, the gardaí will have the power to deal with that under section 13.  That is the important point and we do not need to accept this amendment in order for that to happen.  In discussions with the gardaí and others involved in the legal system it was clear that they were pushing very strongly for a power to deal with this sort of problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis spoke about cider parties on the banks of the river on his land. That is trespass and would automatically be covered under section 13 of the Bill. It is important in the context of civil liberties that we do not go too far.  I have already been accused of going too far. However, I hope that Senator Norris will be satisfied that when the Bill is passed the type of behaviour he mentioned will be covered under section 13.</P>

It would be far too strong an addition to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to lay my cards on the table in response to what Senator Crowley said about private property.  I am a property owner.  I have an interest <Col N="192" /> in property through various organisations around the city but there is far too much regard for the rights of property owners in this State.  We are supposed to be a Republic.  We are supposed to protect the interests of persons of no property, but we guarantee the rights of property owners <i>ad nauseam.</i>  There should not just be respect for the rights of property owners, there should be an examination of the responsibility of those who own property to maintain those properties and to ensure that the conduct carried on in them is appropriate and civilised.  It would not cost me a thought if the rights of property owners were mitigated to some extent in the public good.  I wish to point out to my friend, Senator Crowley, with whom I agree on so many things but not on this, that there is a case to be argued under the Constitution that the public good carries at least as much weight as the rights of property.</P>
      <P>One of the problems is that buildings are allowed or are encouraged to become derelict so that what are known as northside planning permissions can be obtained.  Where planning permission is not granted, vandalism is encouraged and then it is possible to apply to the corporation for permission to demolish.  The police cannot act even if certain activities which the public suspect to be criminal in one way or another are taking place unless the owner complains to the police. That is a problem because where the owner is seeking the dereliction of the property he or she will not be anxious to lay a complaint and a third party such as a neighbour or passer by is precluded from making that kind of complaint, as I understand it.  Perhaps I am misinformed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Music and ghetto blasters are not the only problems.  I passed a series of houses during this week where men were ripping up the floorboards.  They were doing considerable damage to an essential element of a building that is listed for preservation. When I reported it to the police I was told there was nothing they could do unless the owner complained.  I am looking for the right of a third party to lay a complaint against that kind of vandalism <Col N="193" /> and damage and I do not care if it mitigates the rights to private property.</P>
    <P>We have far too much respect for the rights of property owners who very often, certainly in this city, are not scrupulous about the way in which their property is maintained.  There was a situation where people were being mugged, handbags were being snatched and the young attackers were running into this particular house.  The police went in eventually and they found 30 or 40 handbags on the roof.  These people had access to the skylights.  If one house in a Georgian terrace goes rotten it is like the proverbial rotten apple in the barrel.  It exposes every house in that terrace to the danger of penetration, theft and fire.  If one house goes on fire it can very rapidly spread to an entire block.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for drawing my attention to section 13.  This assists to a certain extent, but not entirely because it deals exclusively with people who are trespassing.  What is the situation with regard to a person who maintains they have acquired by some means or other, perhaps with the connivance of the landlord in order to vandalise the premises, a legal or quasi-legal tenancy?  They are not trespassing, but they may be a nuisance or causing damage.  Section 13 as I understand it, and perhaps I am incorrect, only covers persons who are trespassing on the property.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> The Minister is correct about the subjectivity of noise levels.  I am well aware of that because we had to deal with this problem.  We had to get special instruments to measure the number of decibels because we were dealing with commercial dance halls.  It is not always possible to do that.</P>
    <P>One of my neighbours was so annoyed about the noise coming from a concert band which was practising in the street that I attempted to do something about it.  The moment I quelled that noise, he established a school where drumming lessons were given in a small shed in his back garden.  This destroyed my enjoyment. He was acutely sensitive to the noise of Dublin concert bands practising, but yet for some unexplained reason he was deaf to the immensely irritating sound of someone practising jazz drumming in a back garden two doors away from me on a summer afternoon.  I accept the Minister's point about subjectivity.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 25, to delete &ldquo;to a fine not exceeding £100&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for a first offence to a fine not exceeding £100 and for any second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding £500&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for a fine not exceeding £100.  The courts should be empowered to impose a fine of up to £500 for a second or subsequent offence.  This could be a <Col N="195" /> serious matter.  The sum of £100 is a reasonable amount to pay for a first offence.  Different amounts, for example, £500 or £1,000, were mentioned in the Dáil when this matter was discussed.  We should allow the courts to impose a fine of up to £500 for a second or subsequent offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that when she introduced this Bill I made some references to what could be loosely referred to as the town drunk or the chronic alcoholic.  There is at least one of these in every town or village and if they do not reside there they come from outside and make a nuisance of themselves and endanger the citizens about their normal work.  This section does not address this problem.  Inserting an amendment to increase the fine will not minimise or help to eliminate such a public nuisance.  I appreciate that the Minister has a difficulty in this regard but, rather than fining or imprisoning, there should be a form of community service for such people.  I do not see the point in heavily fining someone who has not got the resources to pay.  The sort of person I am talking about does not have money because they drink or gamble it all away.  If they are put through the courts system and fined £10 or £20 the chances are that they will be in default. What happens then?  A summons is served on them and they are locked up for a certain length time.  They are probably put into rehabilitation or a low-security custodial environment.  After the required number of months has been served they come out and do exactly the same again.  I am suggesting that there should be some mechanism within the law that does not impinge on the independence of the Judiciary but would encourage judges faced with this type of individual to look at the long term effects of whatever penalty they impose.  That long term effect should have a rehabilitation aspect rather than a custodial one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have inherited much of our legislation from the British.  Senator Norris touched on this in his last contribution. <Col N="196" /> There seems to be an over-emphasis on the rights of people of property and we seem to have inherited this culture. Rehabilitation was not a word that entered into the vocabulary of that time. We are a much more caring society, even &mdash; if I may use the word &mdash; a liberal society in that we no longer believe locking people up and throwing away the key will solve the problem.  It does not.  The problem comes back to haunt us again.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider introducing at some point under this section &mdash; if not in direct legislation &mdash; a climate of encouragement so that people transgressing the law would not just be fined or locked up but put into community service.  That way they would be of some benefit to the community they have antagonised and intimidated.  Perhaps she might consider this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the thrust of what Senator Mooney said.  I am extremely disappointed that a person drunk in charge is liable to have a criminal conviction against them.  The Law Reform Commission suggested that this should not happen.  When discussing the Road Traffic Bill a few weeks ago, I asked if pedestrians and cyclists &mdash; who may be the intoxicated parties involved in an accident &mdash; could be subjected to blood or urine tests in hospital.  Apparently this is not going to be so, whereas a person who is a danger to themselves, let us say, can be arrested and brought before the courts.  As far as I know, the courts are allowed to demand community service. That is what I hope would happen.  It would be serious to make the fine higher because people in these conditions will not be able to pay.  This applies not just to the village drunk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One summer's night last year, going along St.  Mary's Road I came across a very drunk young man of about 18 years who was rolling around in the road.  All he could say was that if his mother could see him she would kill him, and so she would have.  I could not get a name and address from him so, aided and abetted by the sacristan from the local church, we eventually alerted the gardaí who <Col N="197" /> brought him to hospital.  How enthusiastic would the sacristan and I have been if we thought the young man was going to have a huge fine slapped on him?  I would suggest that community service is the obvious thing.</P>
    <P>Rather than imposing big fines on people who are rambling on the roads, they could be dealt with in a much better way by giving the Garda some power to detain them instead of charging them.  It would be much more satisfactory.  I would be extremely slow to have any involvement with people who, while a danger to themselves, are not really doing any harm to anybody else, if I thought they were going to have an enormous fine imposed on them.  As Senator Mooney said, they would obviously not be in a position to pay it and so they would be lodged in gaol.</P>

In most police stations there used to be something called the drunk-tank where people were stuck, without conviction, to sober up.  Then the friendly neighbourhood guard released them the next morning with a hangover.  Driving here today, at about half past one, I saw a man as drunk as a boiled owl in Nassau Street.  He was walking along the white line in the middle of the road and behind him was a procession of taxis, cars and buses.  The language I used towards him <Col N="198" /> when I came parallel to him was the reverse of parliamentary.</P>

      <P>He was somebody who certainly could have been seriously injured or killed if someone had come around a corner.  Alternatively he could have caused serious damage or injury to somebody else driving a car.  I have frequently seen, particularly at night, people who are thrown out of pubs lie in a huddled heap until some degree of consciousness returns, and then stagger out into the middle of the road.  Very often they are shabbily dressed in dark clothes which makes it virtually impossible to see them.  I support what my colleague Senator Henry, said about the dangers created not just by drunken drivers but also by drunken pedestrians as a hazard to motorists.</P>
      <P>I am persuaded by the argument of Senator Mooney that fining some of these people is not always the appropriate mechanism, but there are occasions on which members of the professional classes have been known to misconduct themselves at a late hour of the evening when under considerable strain.  I would have no problem about them being restrained either, or perhaps even inserted in the drunk tank and given an asprin the next morning.</P>

      <P>Apart from my opposition to Senator Enright's amendment, it is lost at this stage even if it goes to a vote.  I think I have everybody on my side.  In the Bill as published the maximum penalty was £500.  I reduced that to £100 because of a long discussion on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  There was a lot of opposition to the offence itself first of all but, having decided that it was perhaps better to have it there than not, there was equal opposition to the level of the fine being imposed.  Therefore I agreed to reduce it to £100.  I feel strongly that the offence should be there. <Col N="199" /> The Law Reform Commission recommended that an offence along the lines of the offence in section 4 should be included as part of the Bill.  That refers to cases where the drunk person is a danger to himself or to others.  That has to remain, and we have heard several examples today of the dangers that can be caused.</P>
      <P>I feel equally strongly about Senator Mooney's point.  We have, as Senator Mooney knows, a discussion document from the Law Reform Commission in relation to sentencing policy generally.  A lot of changes need to be made.  We do not need to lock up everybody, we need to provide a far greater range of community service orders.  In fining people we also need to allow them to pay by instalment or to have an attachment of earnings facility.  We do not have those facilities at present.  A community service order currently is only imposed in lieu of a custodial sentence.  The judge cannot impose a community service order instead of a fine.  That creates its own difficulties.  Senator Mooney is right that much good work has been done throughout the country through community service orders and that should be encouraged.  It is often a greater humiliation, particularly for younger criminals, to be obliged to obey a community service order in their own community than it is to go to Mountjoy.  Nowadays, in certain places it is a notch in one's belt to have spent time in Mountjoy.  The discussion document from the Law Reform Commission is available.  I impatiently await the final document because we will then introduce separate legislation dealing specifically with sentencing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Henry's point, we must ensure that the Garda Síochána continue to use their common sense even though they have substantial powers. They often encounter drunken people about to get into a car.  They could let those people get into the car and drive it but often the gardaí will convince such people not to drive the car because they realise the probable consequences for the <Col N="200" /> person's job and family.  They use their common sense and take such people home or act in the same way as Senator Henry and her friend the sacristan.  We should recommend that course of action and ensure that it remains available to them.  Then we will not suddenly have gardaí on the streets of Drumshanbo or Carrick-on-Shannon running after the town drunks and detaining them.  It is better to take the course of action I and other Senators have suggested.  I believe Senator Enright's amendment is not supported by any side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There are varying degrees of severity, which depend on who is hearing the case.  A number of judges place people who come before them for an offence of this nature in the care of the court welfare officer.  Unfortunately, that is the exception rather than the rule. So many cases come before the court that the judges do not have the opportunity to take an interest in an individual who may be an alcoholic.  Much rehabilitation can be achieved through the court welfare officer working in conjunction with the District Court.</P>
      <P>However, some individuals cause serious problems.  It is when such serious problems of annoyance and upset are caused by individuals that the gardaí will charge them with the offence.  The gardaí, confronted by the person lying asleep on the side of the street, will usually bring him home although that is not to be recommended when they have so much other work to do.  I proposed the amendment to deal with people who continually misconduct themselves and endanger themselves or other people.  I will not put it to a vote.  It is a last resort to summon such people but in some cases it may be necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister has reassured me.  The gardaí should be encouraged in their social worker role towards drunks. I have worked in casualty departments and it was a major problem when the gardaí unloaded such people at night. Some people may have been in a drunk cell, while the remainder were in the <Col N="201" /> casualty department.  It is somewhat irritating. I am sure that the gardaí and the medical profession would prefer to put up with such irritation rather than have people charged.  A criminal conviction is very serious.  I hope the gardaí will continue their excellent work with these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister referred to the good sense and discretion of the gardaí in handling these situations. One matter which has not been referred to and which I consider to be particularly tragic is the sight, which I have frequently witnessed, of a drunk adult in charge of a child or children.  I have seen the gardaí intervene in such situations in order to protect not just the drunk but the child. We have spoken about property rights and we constantly hear about the rights of parents and the rights of the family. However those parents can often violate such rights.  It is very frightening for a child and it is bad from the educational point of view that they are inured to such behaviour by adults.  It can also expose children to real danger and I have seen the gardaí exercise their good judgment and discretion in this regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned that the hospitals are filled with such people.  I do not want to suggest that I live in a disreputable part of Dublin but I am well aware that every Friday night the same people collapse in a drunken stupor after instructing somebody to ring the hospital. They even have the number ready because they want to spend the weekend in hospital.  In a way I do not criticise them for that.  They are unfortunate people who are down and out.  They may inflict themselves on Senator Henry and her medical colleagues, but they are unfortunate and cannot bear to be exposed to life on the pavements of the city at weekends.  They get drunk and ensure they are sent to hospital or arrested because it is the only place they can go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;Where a member of the Garda Síochána suspects, with reasonable cause, that a person is consuming intoxicating substance(s) in a public place, in such a way as to cause nuisance to another person, the member concerned may seize, obtain or remove, without warrant, any bottle or container, together with its contents.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main reference is to intoxicating liquor but I am anxious that the gardaí have the power to take action when drugs are involved.  It is important that drugs be covered in that instance.</P>

      <P>This amendment was proposed by Deputy Gay Mitchell on Report Stage in the Dáil.  I believe my amendments on Report Stage adequately met the aim of this amendment. The Garda Síochána under section 4 of this Bill will have the power to seize intoxicating substances where an offence is suspected under sections 4, 5 or 6.</P>
      <P>I am advised that there would be a difficulty in providing for a power of confiscation, as the amendment proposes, which is not linked to the commission of an offence.  The amendment refers to a person consuming intoxicating substances &ldquo;in such a way as to cause nuisance to another person&rdquo;.  Senator Enright and others would accept that what is really at issue is not the manner in which substances are consumed but the attendant bad behaviour.  I am confident that the amendments that have already been made will meet the points of concern in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister.  The concerns expressed by Senator Enright appear to be genuine.  However, his concerns are met by the Bill as amended by the Minister in the Dáil.  The only margin <Col N="203" /> of difference between them is the manner of consumption.  In a sense, it is almost down to table manners.  The fact that somebody is a sloppy drinker and one is offended that he slurps his drink and audibly wipes his moustache &mdash; I am being facetious to an extent &mdash; appears to be the only difference.  The concerns appropriately expressed by Senator Enright are covered by the Bill as amended in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister's amendment went a considerable way to resolving our concerns.  I am not referring to somebody who drinks beaujolais at lunch.  I am deeply concerned about the drug problem, which was mentioned on the Order of Business.  I put down this amendment to ensure there was no loophole whereby anybody could escape.  I am sure the Minister's advisers and the Garda Síochána have brought this matter to the Minister's attention.  I am aware of people who were arrested for drunken driving, but when they were breathalysed and samples were taken it was found that they had consumed only a small amount of drink.  Drugs were responsible and the gardaí were not aware of it until afterwards.  This might be an exception but I put down the amendment to deal with instances where drugs are being used.</P>

      <P>I would like to be assured that the Minister is satisfied with this section.  Despite the good sense of gardaí &mdash; we all have the attitude that all our policemen are wonderful &mdash; the reality is that this gives sweeping powers to the Garda Síochána.  The section refers to a specific time and, in the context of the amendment, to specific items, but the Garda have the right at any other time to charge a person with an offence if they believe that they have been conducting themselves in a disorderly manner in a public place.  I will leave the matter at that.  The Minister has had many applications from those concerned about the erosion of civil liberties.  I am satisfied if the Minister is content that this is a <Col N="204" /> section that will be helpful and beneficial to the community rather than a further erosion of civil liberties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  after having been warned by a member of the Garda Síochána that they are committing an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>After Leaving Certificate examinations many young people go out for the night to celebrate the completion of their exams or the results.  Everybody is in high spirits.  They might be singing or shouting &mdash; which is not to be condoned &mdash; and they meet a garda who tells them to stop. However, they continue on their way and somebody starts again.  I am not in favour of such conduct but we must recognise that it happens.  It is not sufficient for a young person who is in high spirits after an exam that they be asked to desist.  If this sweeping section is to be included they should also be warned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section deals with offensive conduct or annoyance to any person.  Annoyance is relative.  I live within 50 yards of a night club and on occasion people come out of it in good spirits and make a little noise.  However, on a Saturday night in the middle of the town one cannot expect everybody to walk home with their hands in their pockets and their mouths closed. One must expect high spirits from young people and it is living in a fool's paradise to think otherwise.  We have to allow people to let off a little steam.  One can meet people who get annoyed over simple matters.  In the context of this <Col N="205" /> section I would be careful to give people a little leeway irrespective of their age.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about the common sense of the vast majority of the Garda Síochána and of our judges in all courts. However, let us admit there is an exception to every rule.  It is human nature.  A defendant might come before a particularly strict judge and be landed with a conviction.  Since it is a criminal conviction they might find that their entry into other countries is prohibited.  I feel strongly on this matter and I hope the Minister might see her way to accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I read through the section several times when I saw this amendment.  Perhaps I am being naive in my reading of section 5 (1) (b) but if a member of the Garda Síochána asks somebody to desist from doing something they inform them that if they continue they are committing a crime.  There is an implication they would be informed that they would be in breach of the law or are likely to be in breach of the law.</P>
      <P>Further leeway is given in subsection (3) in reference to &ldquo;any person who is or might reasonably be expected to be, aware of such behaviour&rdquo;.  A reasonable standard is to be applied.  If a garda is being over officious, as Senator Enright pointed out, the standard is being applied reasonably so the court can interpret that in a broader sense than the officer who brought the charge.  I am not certain that there is a necessity for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Enright. I would like the Minister to clarify what Senator Crowley said &mdash; that there would be the implication that people would be informed by the garda that they are committing an offence.  This could be quite serious as people might not be aware that they are committing an offence.  People are well aware that certain things they might do are against the law, but in this case, particularly with young people, they may not be aware of that.  I would like the Minister to clarify that the Garda Síochána would inform the person that <Col N="206" /> they are likely to be committing an offence if they continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be opposed to this amendment.  It is reasonable that between certain hours, particularly the hours of midnight and 7 a.m., the gardaí would have powers to deal with certain forms of behaviour and that such behaviour would be subject to criminal law, irrespective of whether the gardaí happen to be present.  As in many of the sections of this Bill there is a difficult balance to be drawn.  On the one hand, we do not want to place needless constraints on boisterous young people, whether they are celebrating the Leaving Certificate results or celebrating after a football match.  On the other hand, we have to protect people as best we can from the antisocial behaviour of others which impinges adversely on the quality of our lives.  What we are proposing under section 5 &mdash; outlawing behaviour at set hours where, by definition, it is most likely to be objectionable &mdash; is a reasonable attempt to strike that balance. More serious forms of such behaviour are dealt with under section 6.  I honestly think we have kept the right balance in this section.  There are times when people, not always the young, get involved in certain behaviour between midnight and 7 a.m.  Often they are not aware their behaviour is causing difficulties or causing fear to other people. Under this Bill if a garda approaches a group of young people and asks them to move on under section 8 we would expect the Garda to inform them that if they fail to move on they will be committing an offence.  That is implicit in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a long discussion on this Bill in the Select Committee on Security and Legislation of the other House.  I know there are concerns about certain aspects of the Bill.  Where such concerns were real I was prepared to amend the legislation accordingly.  I feel strongly that within certain hours there is an obligation on people to behave in a particular way.  I do not think gardaí will unduly interfere with young people if they are <Col N="207" /> celebrating leaving certificate results or an Irish win in the World Cup.  They will have the common sense we spoke of earlier.  Those of us who walk late at night will have come across unacceptable behaviour.  Often people go out with the intention of causing difficulties for others.  Where the behaviour persists and people will not stop we have to have the power in the Bill to deal with it.</P>

      <P>If the Irish defence had been half as good last Saturday as the Minister's defence of the Bill today, the rugby team would probably have beaten Wales quite heavily.</P>
      <P>I am concerned because this will affect young people.  There were occasions when I was out for the night between the ages of 18 and 22 when I would have conducted myself in a far different manner from the way I would now.  Given the seriousness of what we are discussing, there is no undue effort involved in accepting this amendment.  It would mean that young people would be warned.</P>
      <P>I have listened to Senator Crowley with great attention because his approach is reasonable.  It is important to include this provision in the Bill.  It is wrong not to do so.  In court a garda will say that he told someone to stop doing something. He should also have to give evidence that he warned the person involved.  There will be people to give evidence for and against; the State will outline its case and the defendant will outline his position to protect his good name.  Without the warning many young people will fall foul of this section and we have a duty to protect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> We are dealing with people out on a Saturday night.  People from outlying areas will get a bus into large towns to go to discos.  When leaving the disco a group will often go to a take away.  There is bound to be noise and if one lives in the centre of a town one has to accept a certain amount of it.  I live in a town, between two hotels with dancehalls attached.  I see nothing wrong with good humoured people and I have no complaints. Even if some people find it annoying it is not fair that the stain of a conviction be put on someone's character, which he or she will have to carry till death.  This is a serious matter.  It is one of the few areas in the Bill about which I feel strongly enough to call a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already established my credentials in this area in the context of the balance mentioned by the Minister.  I am disappointed in one respect.  I wonder if Senator Enright or his mentors who drafted the amendment are followers of American police shows. They seem to wish to apply the Miranda case to Irish citizens so that the Garda will have to read people their rights.  The balance of my sympathy lies with the Minister.</P>
      <P>Everyone from rural Ireland will recognise the scenario painted by Senator Enright but he has left out an important element.  Much of this antisocial behaviour springs from an abuse of alcohol. The vast majority of young people who go our for a night go home quietly.  I live in a town with a dancehall and the citizens there will welcome the extra power given to the Garda by this Bill.  It will stop those louts who delight in driving their cars and motorbikes around the streets at 1 or 2 a.m.  They deliberately shout abuse at each other or anyone who crosses their path in the firm knowledge that the Garda can do nothing about it.  It is only a minority and I appreciate what the Senator says about the boisterousness of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind this legislation is to eliminate the acceptance of the abuse of drink in our society.  Much of this antisocial behaviour springs from drink, <Col N="209" /> especially among young people.  We heard today about people celebrating the leaving certificate.  Some people get extremely drunk.  Not long ago when I was leaving school the extent of celebration was a bag of chips, an ice cream or a lemon soda.  Perhaps the same was true for the Senator.  That is no longer acceptable.  Now people have cider parties, rampage around the streets, get drunk and claim that when the pressure is off they can do what they like.</P>
    <P>I will not labour the point but I welcome the thinking behind the section.  If this antisocial behaviour is brought to the attention of the Garda the subsequent blemish on the character of a citizen can result in being barred from other jurisdictions or prevent him or her finding gainful employment.  I can understand the reasons behind the amendment, but the Senator has approached the issue from the wrong viewpoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the Minister misunderstood me, I wholeheartedly agree with the spirit of this section.  Antisocial behaviour is not acceptable.  I agree with Senator Mooney that much of this behaviour occurs late at night after discos and pubs are closed.  However, it cannot be taken from Senator Enright's amendment that he does not agree with the spirit of this section.  He only seeks that the Garda inform people that they are committing an offence.  I welcome the extra powers this Bill gives to the Garda Síochána and I accept that there is a need for the curtailment of this type of boisterous behaviour.  It would not be unreasonable to ask that such people be informed that they are committing an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand the reasoning behind the amendments proposed by Senator Enright.  The argument he used on section 4 dealt with alcohol-related offences and he wanted to increase fines for second and subsequent offences.  However, he is trying to restrict the powers of the Garda to deal with situations which might not necessarily involve intoxication.  People <Col N="210" /> may be naturally boisterous and need no substance abuse or intoxication to take part in disorderly conduct.  As the Minister said, the implication is already within the section that people would be aware when they are requested by a member of the Garda Síochána to desist from certain conduct that unless they do so they are liable to a fine under the criminal code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be cautious about having an offence on the Statute Book of which the person involved is not aware.  There must be some middle ground in this because what is reasonable conduct in one situation may not be reasonable in other circumstances.  It is very much up to the individual garda to determine the level of acceptability.  We must be wary of somebody committing an offence without knowing that they have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any problem in what Senator Enright is seeking.  The previous speaker summed it up.  It is vitally important that people are warned. It is also important that the Garda Síochána, who implement legislation, are instructed that they have to warn people that they are breaking the law.  I understand the work of the Garda Síochána and I do not carry a flag for anybody. I am aware of what happens on these occasions because I come from an area where there are similar problems.</P>
      <P>The amendment is not asking for a great amount.  There are times when one could be speaking to a person who is breaking the law and no matter what one says they are not likely to listen to common sense.  The Garda Síochána are fair and I am not saying that they would not be so.  Senator Enright is seeking to ensure that these people are informed, irrespective of who they are, that they are committing an offence.  There is nothing in the section which covers this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are prepared to accept that abusive or insulting words can be used which do not break the law.  I have often attended hurling matches where insulting words were used.  In this context the definition <Col N="211" /> of breaking the law could be different because the words would be against another team.  A question could arise as to whether we are defining one or the other. This matter is important and compromise can be reached.  Senator Enright's amendment is fair.  There is no danger in it and most importantly it covers the Garda Síochána if it goes before the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are supportive of much of the tenor of this section.  From our approach, both in this House and in the other House, it can be seen that we support most of this Bill.  However, we must be careful.</P>
      <P>Senator Crowley mentioned section 4. There is a difference in that section 4 refers to &ldquo;a reasonable apprehension that he might endanger himself or any other person in his vicinity&rdquo;.  There is no danger to anybody here and that is the separate and distinct point.  Senator Mooney made the point that many problems arise from the abuse of alcohol.  I do not condone the abuse of alcohol.  The vast majority of young people are reasonable and they do not over indulge in alcohol.  They have a far better approach to alcohol than people in previous generations and many of them are health conscious.  Very few of them overdo it.</P>

If there is somebody speeding up and down a street and sounding a horn, they can be charged with dangerous driving.

      <P>They can be charged with any of those offences.  If people drive up and down a street at night at speed or sound their horn, they can be quite easily apprehended and separate action can be taken against them.  In this amendment, I am seeking a warning by a garda so that a person realises that he or she has to be careful or they will find themselves charged under this or some other relevant Act and brought before the courts.  It is simple.  We are discussing a public order Bill and we must not lose our common sense.  We must be reasonable and fair.</P>
      <P>Senator Crowley should remember that decisions in the courts are based on what is in the Bill, not what we thought was in it.  We are leaving out a fundamental point about warning somebody and that is a necessary step.  Most gardaí will be fair but if somebody meets a garda who perhaps is over officious and is brought before the courts, the defendant should at least have the opportunity of stating that he or she was not warned. If somebody is told to desist and then warned, they should comply.  It does not just involve celebrations on the day of a soccer match or after the leaving certificate. Many young people who are sober and have not consumed any drink will come out of a disco in good humour. They go down the street looking for lifts home and buses and start shouting at one another.  That type of conduct is normal every day living.  This legislation will hit young people unduly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Enright should not get the impression that I am being personal with him on this.  I deeply respect his views because of his great experience in this whole area of the law. We are probably dealing with semantics. However, I think I am right when I say it is normal practice, except in the case where somebody is being issued with a parking fine, that one is advised that under the relevant section of the relevant Act one is liable to be charged.  Whether it is stated in legislation or not, if one is caught for speeding, the garda advises that whatever one may say, it can be <Col N="213" /> used in evidence against one under the relevant section of the Road Traffic Act.</P>
      <P>The implication in the section is that the standard to be used in deciding whether the behaviour was one of disorderly conduct or not is the reasonable standard stated in subsection (3).  What is being sought by this amendment is a formula that could be employed by people to get off the charge by alleging that they were not read the full list of rights and warned.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the Senator wishes to make watertight, and difficult to impose, a section of the criminal code where a certain degree of flexibility should be allowed in the way it is implemented.  I agree that there must be protection to ensure that somebody is not wrongly made a target under this legislation.  However, in the vast majority of cases this will not happen and what is being proposed in this amendment is uncalled for within the terms of the legislation in the context of the way the criminal justice system operates.</P>

      <P>There is obvious concern regarding the erosion of civil liberty, and Senator Enright made a valid point, which I made earlier, regarding the common belief that all of the gardaí are wonderful.  They are not all wonderful.  I wish that they were, but that is not in the nature of the realities of human life.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to engaging in offensive conduct.  Does that apply to, for example, a bunch of boisterous youngsters coming out of any place of entertainment, or even out of a pub, and engaging in laughter and the conviviality that would surround that type of event?  Any garda who would use this section of the Bill to charge those people before a court would be laughed out of court.  A good lawyer, such as Senator Enright, would drive a coach and horses, to employ a cliché, through such a case by such an over officious garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Common sense ensures that we know offensive conduct when we see it, although we may not be able to describe it in writing.  Presumably a garda, who has received more training than the general <Col N="214" /> public to identify areas of potential conflict in a social environment, would be able to readily identify offensive conduct. Admittedly it would be the garda's opinion, but that opinion would be subsequently tested by the court.</P>
    <P>Where the gardaí identify offensive conduct, they do not then proceed to charge.  They request those engaged in such behaviour to desist.  There is not a quantum leap from the garda identifying the conduct as offensive to charging those involved and bringing them before a judge.  There is a fail safe method set out in the Bill requiring the garda to request those involved to desist.  Those charged in court can be asked if the gardaí requested them to desist and if they indicated that they found the behaviour offensive.</P>
    <P>Surely there are enough safeguards built in to this section on the basis I have outlined.  Even the most officious of gardaí, who would proceed with cases in order to increase their rate of detection or to impress their inspector or superintendent, would have such cases dismissed by the courts.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is trauma involved in going through that process and I do not question the Senator's motives.  I appreciate what he is seeking to achieve by this amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Mooney has pointed out that under the Bill a person <Col N="215" /> engaging in offensive behaviour must be advised to this effect and requested to desist, which I appreciate.  However, the Bill does not make clear that even when people engaged in offensive behaviour are requested to desist they are aware that they are committing an offence.  A reasonable garda will request them to leave, which is acceptable.  However, under the Bill such persons have committed an offence, even although they may not aware of this.</P>
      <P>Our concern is to ensure that the law provides that the person is made aware that an offence has been committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe that those engaged in offensive behaviour should be warned that they are committing an offence.  Regrettably, many of these cases will end up in court and no circumstance should arise where people can allege that they were not warned that they were engaging in offensive behaviour.</P>
      <P>If one is caught speeding, one is warned that an offence has been committed and charges may follow under the Road Traffic Acts.  This is only proper as the gardaí are working on behalf of us all.  However, the correct approach has not been taken in this Bill.  People could be guilty of an offence and may be under the impression that they are not breaking the law.</P>
      <P>In view of this we are seeking an addition to section 6 of the Bill.  This will also strengthen section 4 and section 5 and will enhance the Bill generally.  Most importantly, it will protect the 98 per cent of the Garda Síochána who work fairly. Unfortunately a small minority of the gardaí do not behave in this way, for whatever reason.  In such circumstance the innocent may suffer and, therefore, I ask the Minster to give favourable consideration to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about prevention and that is what we are looking for.  A situation could arise outside a chip shop <Col N="216" /> on a Saturday night when a large crowd gathers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>If a queue of people at a chip shop make noise and continue to do so after being told to desist by a garda, a warning should be given.  I believe a warning would have an effect and the problem would cease.  If the garda in this instance tried to arrest somebody without a warning, it could escalate the trouble rather than curtail it.  The best laws are those which people fully understand.  In this instance people would understand their position because they would have been given a warning.  Going to court is traumatic, particularly for somebody charged with such an offence.  A person may or may not get off, depending on the judge.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with civil liberties and we must balance that with law and order. We must ensure the rights of the individual and of society are protected.  By not inserting a warning in this section, we are weighting the Bill against a young person who may find himself in court for shouting.  That is not what we want because it could lead to a serious situation in the future.  We often speak about young people and how good they are. They are good and we should ensure they are treated fairly.  Without the simple inclusion of a warning in this section, the Bill is weighted against young people.</P>

      <P>We have gone off beam in discussing this section because we have gone into the realm of suggesting that every garda will go out of his or her way to find young people genuinely enjoying themselves after midnight, whether outside a chip shop or otherwise.  We are suggesting gardaí have nothing better to do with their time than to follow people, arrest them and bring them in under the rigours of the law. That is not what the Bill is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney put the case well when he said we are talking about offensive conduct and unreasonable behaviour. Everyone knows what offensive conduct <Col N="217" /> and unreasonable behaviour are.  Why should we accept an amendment to this section which would mean people could only be dealt with if a garda had warned them in advance?  I know a case where an elderly couple who live on the main street of a town are persistently disturbed each morning between 2 and 4 a.m. by a gang of young thugs who sit on their window ledge.  They sing at the tops of their voices and play a ghettoblaster. When the elderly couple telephone the Garda Síochána they scarper.  The gardaí are unable to find them and when they go, the thugs return.  I do not believe Senator Enright is suggesting in that instance that the gardaí give these people a warning stating that they will dealt with under public order legislation.</P>
    <P>Young people know what offensive conduct and unreasonable behaviour are. We are not referring to teenagers who want to go out to have a good time.  Such teenagers behave in a reasonable manner and they do not cause difficulties for anybody because they are not involved in offensive conduct.  They are involved in the same type of behaviour we were involved in when we were young.  We are not trying to upset the normal social behaviour of anybody.  We are talking about anti-social behaviour, offensive conduct and unreasonable behaviour which create difficulties for people.  We must give the gardaí the power to deal with that.  Amending this section so that a garda could only deal with that by giving a warning in advance, would place unreasonable constraints on gardaí.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright is suggesting that gardaí will have nothing better to do with their time than to go around looking for these young people.  I know the Senator does not want to suggest that, but that is how it may interpreted.</P>
    <P>I was open in the other House and Senator Enright has been complimentary in that regard.  I will be equally so here. Amendments I put down and those I accepted on Committee Stage and on Report Stage in the other House have gone a long way to deal with points made. If there are further instances in which the <Col N="218" /> Bill needs to amended, I will be happy to do so.</P>
    <P>I, like others, am aware of civil liberties, but it is a two way thing.  Young people have civil liberties in that they may go about their social activities in an acceptable manner, but so too do elderly people living alone and those who are persistently upset by unreasonable behaviour and offensive conduct.  We must achieve a balance and that is what we have done.</P>

      <P>The Minister's point about the gardaí having nothing better to do than to annoy and arrest young people is a misinterpretation of what I said.  I would like that to be understood.  I said it was essential that a warning be given. Regarding the elderly couple mentioned by the Minister, it is amazing that no action has been taken against those thugs.  The Minister should inform the gardaí in her area that they should take action against those people by binding them to the peace.  They are entitled to do so.  If the Minister gives me the name and address of these people, I will tell them what procedure to adopt.  If what the Minister said is correct &mdash; I do not doubt that it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a more serious problem than the one we have just spent a great deal of time discussing. I have always said, and many have agreed, that it is important that people pay fines in order to prevent future crime, as Senator Enright said.  There should be a minimum fine because a judge may impose a fine of £10, £15 or £20, which is a small amount to many young people.  It is a lot more to their parents, who cannot afford it because they are trying to rear a family.</P>
      <P>Are we prepared to consider saying that people must pay a certain amount? The law can fine people who annoy others on the street or have radios on outside. With all due respect, I do not think that this Bill will make the law any more effective. However, people will be affected if money is taken out of their pockets and has to be paid by a certain time.</P>
      <P>A minimum amount should be specified in the Bill.  However, it should be at the judge's discretion, for example when dealing with an unemployed person. There are many unemployed people, but there are also many people who have money for other things.  They can cause a lot of trouble and walk out with a £10 fine.  This contrasts with a section in another Bill where if a person goes outside the white line they will be banned from driving.  Let us be realistic here.  As many people, including the Minister, have said, it is important that these people are hurt in their pockets.  In ensuring that this Bill is constructive and tight, can we not specify a minimum fine of at least £50?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing fines instead of custodial sentences in this area.  As we all know, prison places are being taken up in cases where a fine seems to be a far better penalty and a more effective deterrent. On the question of a minimum fine, it is a fundamental part of our sentencing and penalising procedure that no minimum should be set on a sentence or fine. The discretion must be given to the <Col N="222" /> Judiciary to decide and to take mitigating circumstances in individual cases into account.  I would totally object to Senator Cregan's suggestion on this point because it does not allow flexibility to judges in the deserving cases which come before them who will not be able to afford to pay a minimum fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Crowley.  It would be dangerous for the Legislature to require any member of the Judiciary to impose a minimum fine and whether that would be £2, £10 or £50 would not make any difference.  It is better to leave it to the discretion of the judge, who is the only person who will be in possession of all the facts in relation to any particular case.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator Cregan's frustration when he talked about persistent offenders and people who do not mind paying £100 or £50 because it is paid by their parents.  We discussed this earlier in the context of a proposal by Senator Mooney in relation to sentencing and community service orders.  As I said then, a custodial sentence or a fine very often makes little difference to somebody of the type about whom the Senator is talking. Service in the community in which they have been offending may be a far greater humiliation and threat to them than any fine or custodial sentence.  We are awaiting the final report of the Law Reform Commission on sentencing.  At the moment we cannot impose a community service order in these circumstances as a community service order is only imposed instead of a custodial sentence.  I would not be prepared to impose a minimum fine.  It is better to leave it to the discretion of the Judiciary in all cases.</P>

      <P>This section, which refers to threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place, seems very similar to section 4, which deals with intoxication in a public place.  I appreciate that a person could indulge in threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place and be cold sober but I ask <Col N="223" /> why it was decided to have two separate sections rather than incorporating the two situations in one section.  The use of threatening, abusive or insulting words is open to a subjective interpretation.  For example, politicians in a public place during an election campaign may, depending on the side of the House from which they come, interpret the comments of others as being threatening, abusive or insulting.</P>

      <P>One should ask Michael O'Leary about some of the things that were said about him at that time.  They <Col N="225" /> were near enough to being abusive and insulting.  Similarly, Dermot Morgan hit people hard.  But in a democracy there is an exchange of views, much of it humorous, and we must be careful to continue to allow that type of discussion.  It is subjective and many caricatures may be regarded as being insulting to the people involved.</P>
      <P>The section contains the phrase &ldquo;in a public place...with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned.&rdquo;  If Dermot Morgan were to say some of the things he has said on television and radio in a pub on a Saturday night, there is every likelihood that it would lead to an altercation.  One has to be careful and the wording in my amendment &mdash;&ldquo;threatening or intimidating conduct or conduct likely to incite violence with intent to provoke a breach of the peace&rdquo;&mdash; is more reasonable. One has to take account of ordinary banter such as one hears at hurling matches all over the countries where referees are called things on occasion which certainly are not parliamentary or praiseworthy.</P>

I thank the Minister for pointing out that I was ahead of myself.  It is not the first time I have ended up with egg on my face and no doubt it will not be the last.  I will encapsulate what I had said.  The Minister <Col N="226" /> might clarify the reasoning behind this section.  I appreciate what Senator Enright is attempting to do &mdash; to water down what seems to be very stringent provisions in this section in relation to threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place.  What I was attempting to do, by comparing the reality of Speakers Corner at Hyde Park, was to suggest that perhaps it might be an idea for some enterprising individual to set aside a designated park which could be an Irish Speakers' Corner.  Then, in the event of this legislation being passed, if anybody felt upset at the implications of it, all they would need to do is travel to the designated place and insult anybody for as long as they liked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be helpful if first I were to do as Senator Mooney asked and give some of the background to section 6.  Section 14 (13) of the Dublin Police Act, 1842, makes it an offence to use &ldquo;any threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned.&rdquo;  The penalty is a maximum fine of £2 and the Law Reform Commission proposed that the offence be updated and that it subject to a term of imprisonment of up to six months.  What has been done in this section of the Bill does not introduce a new concept to the law, but we are trying to make the law reflect modern realities and to impose appropriate penalties in cases of such behaviour.  This provision is to be taken in conjunction with the power being given in section 8 to the Garda to move on people who are misbehaving in this way.  We give the Garda Síochána effective powers to deal with the types of problems with which, unfortunately, we have become all to familiar.  This provision will be of especial use in dealing with problems in O'Connell Street when gangs of youths congregate and act in a threatening and insulting way to passers-by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important point which I should emphasise is that we are not creating a new offence here.  It is a matter for the <Col N="227" /> courts to decide whether a particular form of behaviour or words is threatening, abusive or insulting.  The behaviour must be with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or be reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be caused.  The Bill as originally published included the words &ldquo;or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned&rdquo;.  To meet the concerns which were expressed this was amended to being &ldquo;reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned&rdquo;.  Accordingly a person who engages in a protest who does not intend to provoke a breach of the peace, like Senator Enright, and is not reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned, like Senator Mooney, has nothing to fear from this section.  That is as far as I could reasonably go in moderating the threshold at which the offence would be committed and I would not be happy with amendment No. 9, which would delete the provision in relation to recklessness.</P>
    <P>In relation to the breach of the peace, the Law Reform Commission, while acknowledging that historically the concept has lacked an authoritative definition, referred to a case in the Court of Criminal Appeal where it was said that in order to constitute a breach of the peace an act must be such as to cause reasonable alarm and apprehension to members of the public.  The view of the Law Reform Commission was that the wording in the 1842 Act had stood the test of time well and that it should be retained.  I believe that the words &ldquo;abusive&rdquo; and &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; should remain in the section.  I do not accept that the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; would add anything to the word &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; already included in the section.  On a general point, I cannot accept that there is an absolute right for people to go around abusing and insulting others and indeed if there is a basic right involved it is to be free to be able to go about one's business without being abused or insulted.  In the circumstances therefore I regret that I cannot accept either amendment.</P>

      <P>In regard to this amendment, I am a little concerned in regard to political protest in this instance and again in section 7 in regard to the distribution of literature.  There are occasions on which people in public life are caricatured.  It is part and parcel of democracy.  I am bringing this matter to the attention of the House in the hope of having these amendments agreed to.  There are situations where people make comments which are abusive in ways, but to have a fine of £500 or three months in prison for such offences is very punitive.  I am concerned about it.  I see the point the Minister is making.  There are occasions where there are gangs of youths and it is necessary to be able to tackle those people and make sure that they are not allowed to insult people and use foul language at passers-by.  I feel that my amendment, which reads &ldquo;or intimidating conduct or conduct likely to incite violence with intent to provoke a breach of the peace&rdquo; is nearer to what is necessary in this instance.</P>
      <P>The second amendment I put down reads &ldquo;or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned.&rdquo; In regard to the first part of the measure, the State has to prove that there was intent to cause a breach of the peace.  The second part of the measure, &ldquo;or being reckless,&rdquo; is very open and subjective. That is why I felt it might be deleted.  I see the Minister's viewpoint, but I feel that this is essential because of the nature of the penalties imposed.  The fine was £2 and it has been increased to £500 and three months in prison.  It is certainly above the consumer price index, even though the Act was enacted in 1842.</P>

Some of them convey messages which the party in Government would find insulting but which the Opposition would find humorous.  I would not like to see people arriving with placards outside Leinster House or anywhere else and finding that they can be charged with an offence because some of the material they were using was abusive or insulting.

One area we want to tackle and which got a lot of airing when we discussed it in the other House involves criminal gangs who operate in a certain area.  They are identified to the gardaí by a family and they then decide to write graffiti, draw obscene posters, deliver anonymous leaflets and so on.  We cannot allow this to continue without that family having some means of recourse, with the support of the gardaí.  We are not talking about legitimate protesting or creative headlines on a placard, but about specific instances where the gardaí must be given the power to deal with it.</P>

      <P>A judge should be entitled to ascertain the type of damage the injury caused to the individual and whether it was of a temporary or permanent nature before he passes sentence on a person convicted of such an offence.

      <P>I have examined the Senator's amendment and having given the matter detailed consideration, I regret I cannot see that the amendment would achieve anything of <Col N="231" /> value beyond what is already in place. When we discussed this on Committee Stage in the other House I indicated that section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, already provides that in determining the sentence to be imposed on a person for specified offences a court shall take into account and may, where necessary, receive evidence or submissions concerning any effect of the offence on a person in respect of whom the offence was committed.  Among the offences to which section 5 of the 1993 Act applies are offences involving violence or the threat of violence to a person.  This means that any of the offences dealt with in the present Bill which involve violence or a threat of violence to a person will be subject to the provisions of section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the thinking behind the Senator's amendment, I do not believe there would be any advantage in providing in this Bill that a court may receive evidence regarding the effect of an offence under sections 5, 6 and 7 on the victim.  This is the current position in relation to all offences and, as I have indicated, special measures have been adopted where an offence involves violence.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, we would all be concerned that by adopting this amendment the Oireachtas would, in some way, give out a signal that only in cases which came within section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, or within the terms of the Senator's amendment could a court seek evidence to establish the effect of an offence on the victim.  What the Senator wants to achieve is already in existence and we do not want to give out a wrong signal during the course of the debate on this Bill.</P>

      <P>Many people who allow their children to become involved in crime manage to escape the responsibility.  This amendment would make parents more careful about the conduct of their children.  They would be responsible for looking after their children and if they committed an offence they would have to pay for it. In addition, the injured party should be entitled to receive full compensation for their injury.  This method would make the parents of children liable for the expenses, costs and compensation.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Senator's concern, there is no need to include in the Bill a provision along the lines of his amendment.  This is because section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, allows a court on conviction of any person of any offence to make an order requiring the offender to pay compensation in respect of any personal injury or loss resulting from that offence to any person who has suffered such injury or loss.  Section 6 of the 1993 Act will apply automatically to all offences under the present Bill.  Section 6 also provides for the payment of compensation by parents and guardians in respect of offences committed by juvmonsense <Col N="233" /> eniles and, in addition, allows compensation to be paid by instalments.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention that although the Senator's amendment refers to the payment of compensation by parents and persons other than the offender, it does not require that the offence be committed by a juvenile.  Thus under the terms of the Senator's amendment the parents of any offender of whatever age could be ordered to compensate a victim.  I am sure that was not the Senator's intention. What he is trying to achieve is already covered under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, in the same way as the previous amendment.  For that reason, there is no necessity to include it in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which I undertook to bring forward in response to suggestions made in the other House.  Its effect would be that the powers of the gardaí to issue directions under section 8 would now also apply where they suspected that an offence was being committed under section 9, which deals with wilful obstruction. For example, if the gardaí were dealing with people who were blocking a road, it would be appropriate to have the option of directing them to desist, rather than having to charge them.  In these circumstances, potentially difficult situations might be defused without the necessity to resort to the full rigours of <Col N="234" /> the criminal law.  I might also mention that we are not providing an automatic power of arrest under section 24 for offences of wilful obstruction, but that power of arrest would be there if a person continued to obstruct after a direction from the garda to desist.</P>

      <P>I would be anxious that this would be allowed because you can have people who are waiting to have a protest.  If a garda wishes to have somebody moved on in this instance, this amendment will provide a safeguard regarding public protest or political demonstration.  As of now I do not see any problem with this matter and in our democracy we have no current problems of the kind.  However, something of this nature going on the Statute Book could lead to a situation some years down the road where public protests or political demonstrations involving people congregating could be deemed unlawful. This amendment, therefore, would provide a necessary safeguard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem which we are trying to address under section 8 is the difficulty for gardaí in relation to persons loitering with intent to commit a crime.  As the Law Reform Commission pointed out in its report on vagrancy and related offences, the effect of the Supreme Court decision in the King case in 1981 was that all that portion of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, which relates to the loitering with intent offence is no longer part of Irish law.  The commission recognised the difficulty of framing a new type of loitering offence. This would be likely to be susceptible to the same kind of challenge which succeeded in the King case.  In the circumstances they did not recommend a new loitering with intent offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> While recognising the real difficulties which the Garda face in this area, the Government concluded that it would be unwise in all the circumstances to attempt to provide for a general loitering type offence.  However, in an effort to address the problem the Garda are being given powers under section 8 to direct people loitering in a public place in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable apprehension for the safety of persons, or the safety of property, or the maintenance of the public peace.</P>
    <P>The section is not aimed at public protests or demonstrations.  However, I am not in a position to accept the Senator's amendment because I cannot accept the proposition that the Garda should not be in a position to intervene where people are gathered, for whatever purpose, if they do so in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the safety of other people, property, or the maintenance of the public peace is at risk. There are, of course, constitutionally protected rights of freedom of assembly and so on and, by definition, they will not be affected by this legislation; but I think it would be unreasonable to suggest that such rights extend, for example, to jeopardising the safety of others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that this legislation will be on our Statute Book.  Section 8 (b) reads:</P>
      <P>.......without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, is acting in a manner which consists of loitering in a public place in circumstances, which may include the company of other persons, that give rise to a reasonable apprehension for the safety of persons or the safety of property or for the maintenance of the public peace,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be absolutely no danger in regard to a political protest or demonstration of one form or another.  My amendment refers to &ldquo;a public protest or political demonstration&rdquo; and having that included would be a safeguard.  How Governments act at a particular time varies.  You could have people in the <Col N="236" /> future who wish to prevent demonstrations and who may seek to use legislation of this type to do so.  I go along fully with the section and am not opposed to it.  I appreciate the situations with which the Garda are often confronted.  I fully support what the Minister has outlined in her reply as well as what she has said in the Dáil.  The amendment is just a safeguard to exempt protests from the Bill.  We must be sure of what goes onto the Statue Book and so this amendment is a desirable safeguard.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;9 (1)  Any person who shall in any unlawful manner wilfully prevent or interrupt the free passage of any person or vehicle in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that legislation of this nature would not prevent the legitimate right of citizens to place pickets, protest or assemble in a peaceful manner.  An amendment of this nature would be desirable. I see the point of what the Minister is trying to achieve.  It is important that people should be allowed to go freely <Col N="237" /> about their lawful business without restriction.  We go along with the section, including the Minister's figure of £200, but this safeguard should be included because we have always had the right to picket in a peaceful and proper manner. That is exactly what this amendment is attempting to safeguard.  Workers and others who feel they have genuine grievances should be entitled to display their objections through peaceful pickets and the amendment is necessary for that.</P>

      <P>I would have had serious concerns about this section, such as outlined by Senator Enright, but for the amendment the Minister moved under section 8, where section 9 has now been included along with sections 4, 5, 6 and 7.  In effect, it is a fail-safe mechanism that creates a breathing space for the Garda authorities if they are in a situation where there might be a possible abuse of the law or a conflict is developing.  Then, rather than going straight for the jugular and charging people, they will now be required under the Government's amendment to request that the person or persons so suspected desist from acting in such a manner and leave the vicinity immediately in a peaceful and orderly manner.  I am satisfied with that insertion because were it not there, I would have been concerned.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, we in this country have avoided the worst excesses of industrial unrest, as witnessed in Britain when the vast powers of the State were brought to bear on the miners during the 1984 strike. The legacy of that is seen in British society today and it will be there for a long time to come.  I believe that it probably created a cleavage between the public and members of the working class, who traditionally had a respect for law and order.  That broke down as a result of bringing the vast panoply of State power to bear on the miners by using the police as agents of the State in that dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our culture is different.  While I do not anticipate that we would face such excess, there was a fear that if the amendment was not made, it could occur at some <Col N="238" /> future date.  As Senator Enright pointed out, we are discussing the law as it will be interpreted until such time as it is repealed &mdash; and the Minister referred to legislation which appears to have been copied word for word from legislation in 1842.  The Minister has recognised that there could be an area of potential conflict between the Garda and the public in the context of industrial unrest or protest. There is a fail-safe mechanism in the legislation which requires the Garda to take certain steps prior to charging people with offences in that context.  In that respect I would not favour the amendment.</P>

Let us not forget also that the difference between Ireland and England, where the State could introduce powers for use against the miners' strike, is our written Constitution.  The Constitution allows for the right of association, the right to strike and the right of dissociation. Therefore, any laws enacted which would adversely interfere with that right would be invalid on a constitutional basis.  There is no need for Senator Enright's amendment.  The area is covered by the content of the section and by the overriding power of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support subsection (2) of the amendment, which refers to the question of assembly and picket.  I would have liked to have been here earlier, but unfortunately I was obliged to attend the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  On my way past my office I picked up about six letters which I have with me.  They are from members of the public, of whom one is a retired Army officer.  All express real concern &mdash; which may be misplaced but is genuine &mdash; on the part of a wide section of the public that the capacity to picket may be restricted under various sections of this Bill.  One or two of the sentiments expressed refer to earlier sections of the Bill which I, unfortunately, <Col N="239" /> will not have the opportunity to discuss until Report Stage.</P>
      <P>There is widespread concern that sections of this Bill could operate against the right of ordinary citizens to picket. Subsection (2) of Senator Enright's amendment states:</P>
      <P>Nothing contained in this section shall be construed so as to prevent the exercise of the legitimate rights of citizens to picket, protest, or assemble in a peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>If it reassures the public, it is a good amendment.  The sense of that subsection is unarguable.  I do not believe that the Minister wishes to curtail the right of the public to protest or picket and I am not sure that the wording in subsection (2) is offensive to the Bill.  I notice that there is a note after the amendment which states: &ldquo;Acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 9 of the Bill&rdquo;. Would that be true if subsection (2) only of the amendment were accepted?  The meaning of Senator Enright's amendment echoes a widespread public concern, which I share to a certain extent.</P>

      <P>The wording of subsection (1) of the amendment is almost identical to the wording of section 1 of the Bill.  Therefore, what is mainly at issue is the insertion of subsection (2). There would be technical, legal difficulties in accepting that part of the amendment.  The only interpretation which a court could put on the phrase &ldquo;legitimate right of citizens to picket&rdquo; and so forth would arise in the context of constitutionally protected freedoms.  It would be unprecedented.  Clearly it is unnecessary to put in the legislation something which amounts to saying no more than that the legislation, or part of it, is subject to constitutional rights.  As Senator Crowley said, all legislation is subject to constitutional rights.  While I appreciate the thinking behind the amendment, I hope the Senator can accept that it would not be appropriate to include such a provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the more general point, I cannot <Col N="240" /> accept that there is an absolute right for people to obstruct the free passage of persons and vehicles.  If anything, the presumption should be in favour of the right of people to travel unobstructed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to take this matter in isolation.  I accept the Minister's good intentions, but the letters I have received couple this section with section 6.  If there is not an explicit protection of the right to picket and protest peacefully and there is a section which makes it an offence to use insulting or offensive language or engage in insulting behaviour, there appears to be a serious limitation on the right of the public to exercise its right to picket and protest. The Minister says that this is redundant because the right to picket and protest is already guaranteed.  That may be so, but if something is redundant it is surely not damaging to the Bill.  Therefore it could be accepted as a placebo, because the public is clearly concerned.</P>
      <P>I regret that I was not here for the discussion on section 6 because there may be a concern that the interpretation of words such as &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; or &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; can be very wide.  In my time I have carried placards which a large number of people would consider insulting and offensive.  I hope that my right to continue to carry such placards will be sustained. Perhaps if for nothing more than a public relations exercise, there is a necessity for its inclusion.  I do not often get so many letters on a subject of such a technical nature.  They are not from cranks or from those who are dismissed as &ldquo;do-gooders&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister has correctly stated that the section as outlined in the Bill and the first subsection of my amendment are similar.  In the course of a normal picket people walk up and down <Col N="241" /> in front of the gates of, perhaps, a building. It can be stated that people walking in front of the gates are wilfully preventing or interrupting the free passage of people through the gate.  In fact, cars and lorries are usually allowed to travel back and forth.  Only on rare occasions have vehicles been prevented from going in and out of buildings.  The history of industrial relations in Ireland has been excellent. It is important that this safeguard would be included.</P>
      <P>It was stated that a constitutional action could be taken on this matter, but I do not think we are anxious to have a constitutional case taken.  My amendment could not be fairer.  It refers to the &ldquo;exercise of the legitimate rights of citizens to picket, protest, or assemble in a peaceful manner.&rdquo;  If one wanted to devise words to be fair and reasonable one would have to go a long way to get a better wording than I have used.  Senator Crowley referred to constitutional rights. When one examines the number of cases which have been taken to safeguard constitutional rights, it clearly indicates the necessity for this amendment.  If the Bill is passed without this amendment people may have to go the Supreme Court later to have this legislation tested.  There will undoubtedly be quite an amount of litigation arising from this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subject is Senator Neville's brief and, unfortunately, he is unable to be present today.  Most of the correspondence has been addressed to Senator Neville.  I have received only a few letters about this Bill and they were circulated to nearly all Senators.  I have not received the same volume of correspondence as Senator Norris.  There are many people who are supportive of this Bill.  They feel it is time there was a Public Order Bill and that vandalism and blackguardism were properly stamped out.  There are others, however; perhaps they are the do-gooders, but on occasion some of the do-gooders are right.  In this instance, according to the comments I have received, there is genuine concern that in a few years' time an effort might be made to prevent the right of peaceful protest or assembly.  This amendment <Col N="242" /> does not ask a lot and Senator Norris made the point that it might only be taken as a goodwill gesture.  While it may be that, its specific inclusion will make many people happier about having the right to assemble in a peaceful manner and the right to picket and protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and harp back to the point I made earlier regarding the constitutional rights that are protected. The inclusion of subsection (2) of Senator Enright's amendment would narrow the ambit of the constitutional rights that already exist.  The existing constitutional rights may be broadened by judicial interpretation and cannot be narrowed because of Supreme Court decisions in two cases which I can remember. One case involving CIE and the other involving the INTO have guaranteed the right to picket and the right to pass a picket.  Therefore, it would be a retrograde step to have this subsection in the legislation.</P>

I would like to support Senator Enright's amendment because there are many people who are concerned about this matter.  The Minister herself has talked about concerns for civil liberties.  There is great support for this Bill in general but to allay the fears of those who are concerned the Minister should show goodwill by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>May I say in passing that I am supporting a right of which I have been the victim?  I have had my own house picketed by the Povisional movement.  Unfortunately, I was not there to welcome them, as they would have been welcome. I was also picketed by the Relatives for Justice and Peace on the basis that I had refused to be interested in the Feargal Caraher case the day after I had agreed to take part in an independent inquiry. As far as I am concerned, they are welcome to picket and it is an important right we should all have.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Senator Mooney.  He spoke about the situation in Britain some years ago at the time of the coalminers' strike and the problems it caused in homes.  I am friendly with one family whose father was a coalminer and they take their politics seriously in Britain.  The family were solid Labour supporters, but prior to one election the son announced that he was going to vote for the Conservative Party.  He did so and following that his father did not speak to him for two years, and that <Col N="245" /> was compounded further by the coalminers' strike.  This is an important point since we are speaking about pickets and peaceful protest.</P>
      <P>We agree that a person should not be allowed to wilfully obstruct anybody, but this amendment seeks to allow people to assemble in a peaceful manner and to exercise the legitimate right to picket or protest.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to withdraw the changes in residential property tax, as proposed in the recent budget by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion will hopefully highlight for the Government the huge impact this tax will have on householders all over Ireland.  It has been said this tax will affect Dublin exclusively but it will <Col N="246" /> impact on families and homes throughout the country.  An independent body, the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute, stated this tax will affect 40 per cent of households in the Dublin area.  Members of the Government ignored this statement and insisted the tax will only affect 3 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>An ESRI report says Ireland has the highest level of home ownership in the world, with 80 per cent of properties being family-owned homes.  This level of home ownership has in large measure been achieved by the policies of successive Governments which provided incentives to encourage people to buy their homes.  The incentives came in the form of exemption from stamp duty on new homes; new house grants for first time house buyers; nationwide local authority house purchase schemes; life insurance relief on endowment mortgages; and significant mortgage interest relief.</P>
    <P>The budget changes affecting the residential property tax and the reduction of mortgage interest relief are clear indications of a complete change in Government policy on family home ownership. Many families who have improved their homes and borrowed extensively will, because of these changes, find themselves caught for a further tax liability they had not foreseen.</P>
    <P>The budget changes are a two pronged attack on the family home.  The lowering of the threshold on house value to £75,000 and the family income level to £25,000, coupled with a 10 per cent reduction in mortgage interest relief, will have a serious impact on the standard of living of many families.  The changes are anti-family and anti-home and that is why there has been such a public outcry against these proposals.  The family home or residential property tax is in plain language a return of rates on domestic dwellings. Rates are back, with the difference that the funds will not be spent locally as in the past but will go into central funds.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, has stated the opposition to these changes is media driven.  The Tánaiste and the Government are ignoring the real concerns <Col N="247" /> of people affected by this tax.  All household income is taken into account, while ignoring the substantial mortgage commitments attaching to most of these homes.  In many instances a family home can be mortgaged up to 90 per cent of its value.</P>
    <P>The Government has stated it will examine any anomalies that may arise. However the clear signal from all senior members of Government, including the Taoiseach, is that there will be no real or substantial changes to the proposals outlined in the budget.  This morning in the Dáil the Taoiseach has come down strongly in favour of this family home tax. It is now definitely Government policy.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government is obviously to use this family home tax as a major source of revenue collection in the future.  The increases will be seen in future budgets, with property values and income levels being reduced and the tax rate increased.  As the Minister for Finance sees the current tax affecting only 3 per cent of the population, it is easy to see he intends to extend this measure further to broaden the tax base.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated these proposals are a once-off charge.  Those who saw car tax abolished by Fianna Fáil in 1977 now see a change in policy where the same party will allow the State to seize and sell an untaxed car under the new Road Traffic Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>We said the 1 per cent levy was a once-off charge and it is now gone.  The Senator should start to believe us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Words carry little weight in some instances.  That is why there is nationwide fear and dread about these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tax is based on self-assessment.  A family submits the valuation of the home. The Revenue Commissioners can, at any time in the future, re-open the question of the valuation submitted by the owner, whether based on neighbourhood values or otherwise.  The commissioners are empowered to levy a tax based on their <Col N="248" /> revised value and impose penalties and interest at 15 per cent for non-payment of tax they claim is outstanding and where the taxpayer was unaware any liability existed.  If the outstanding tax is unpaid interest continues to fall due and remains as a charge on the property.  The residential property tax is therefore by its nature a direct attack on the family home. People will not be allowed to sell their homes unless they get a clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners, so they will be caught in that way also.</P>
    <P>This tax is neither equitable nor fair and strikes at the nature of the Irish people.  Rather than encouraging families to improve their homes, these measures will act as a deterrent.  It resembles the old penal taxes in Ireland where tenants had to pay for any improvements carried out on their properties.</P>
    <P>Over the next three to four years of this coalition Government, this tax will hit people on all income levels in all homes across Ireland.  The Government has said the reaction is out of proportion to the impact of the tax, yet each of the Government parties is trying to evade the responsibility and the odium attaching to it.  The Government should accept the motion and withdraw these changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and call on the Minister for Finance to withdraw this penal and inequitable tax.  The residential property tax in the 1994 budget is totally inequitable in that the value of the property affected has been reduced to £75,000 and the income threshold has been reduced to £25,000.  In addition, one must look at the situation in which it occurs.  Just over a year ago, both parties now in Government gave firm commitments to the electorate that this would not occur when they entered Government.  In particular, the Labour Party gave specific promises in the newspapers. Its leader, Deputy Spring, stated clearly at that time that Labour had no plans to introduce a new property tax and would not reduce mortgage interest relief or VHI tax relief.  These are just some of the clear commitments that were given <Col N="249" /> to the electorate and it voted for that party on the strength of them.  The Government has reneged completely on commitments given to the electorate and it is time for it to withdraw this inequitable tax.</P>
      <P>As Senator Enright stated, this tax is totally anti-family in so far as the entire family income in a property will be taken into account.  I give the example of two old age pensioners living alone who receive approximately £5,000 or over a year.  They have a son or daughter living with them who has a salary of £21-22,000. That family will be subject to this penal tax.  They may have bought their house six years ago for £60-66,000, but as a result of an increase in value it is now worth £75,000.  These people will now have to pay the tax.  In those circumstances, people will be forced to leave the family home and find accommodation elsewhere.  In many instances this will cause an additional burden on the State because it will have to provide home help where the son or daughter who was living in the home traditionally provided that assistance to their parents.</P>
      <P>We have a high incidence of home ownership in this country.  This tax is particularly anti-urban.  People in the average towns in Ireland, quite apart from those living in cities, will be subject to this dreadful tax.  It is an assault on the fundamental tradition of home ownership, which is very much part of the Irish scene and quite different from the experience of other parts of Europe.  I appeal to the Minister to take this matter into account.  We must recognise that the majority of houses are mortgaged to the hilt and their owners are taxed to the limit.  The Government is proposing to impose a further penal tax.  It is totally unacceptable and the Minister has no choice but to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has stated its commitment to job creation.  The Minister for Finance stated that 9,000 extra jobs would be created in the building and construction industry during 1993.  However, we saw the loss of over 6,000 jobs last year and if this tax is imposed we will see further job losses in the building industry. <Col N="250" /> I refer in particular to small building contractors and tradesmen, such as carpenters, who put extensions on to people's houses and do basic home improvements.  People will be reluctant to proceed with this type of work because it will give additional value to their house and bring them into the tax net.  The result will be that many small builders will be put out of employment.</P>

      <P>This is a reality and the sooner the Government parties recognise it the better.  As a result of the imposition of this tax, more and more people will not carry out the necessary improvements to their homes.  In years to come we will see a future Government forced into the position of reintroducing home improvement grants to bring up the standard of dwellings across the country. I appeal to the Minister to take these serious matters into consideration.  I also appeal to him to recognise the anti-urban trend involved in introducing this taxation. This penal tax will force people on a limited income, who are mortgaged and taxed to the hilt, to sell their homes and buy other houses of a lower value. Houses which are currently valued at approximately £60,000 will be caught in this tax net in another four or five years. The Minister says this will be index linked.  In 1992, we heard the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, make the same hollow promise.  As Taoiseach he has presided over a Government that has proceeded to reduce the valuation and income thresholds and break promises and commitments he made as Minister for Finance in 1992.  The Government cannot stand with any honour or dignity in relation to this tax.  It must recognise <Col N="251" /> that is it a fiasco, that it is inequitable and withdraw it immediately.</P>

We are discussing, in a total Government expenditure of over £12 billion, a tax imposition of £5 million, representing .04 per cent of GNP.  At a time of concern for employment, the people expect to hear more from Fine Gael about its strategy, its priorities and how it would propose to implement them, as distinct from concentrating on one minuscule element of the budget.  It must be seen in its overall context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget has two central themes. The first is to boost economic activity and employment creation and <i>pari passu</i> to begin a new phase of tax reform.  The budget is based on a net increase of 21,000 in employment in 1994.  That will be the largest increase in employment since 1989-90.  Since the Government of <Col N="252" /> which I was a member came into office in 1987 in succession to the Fine Gael dominated coalition Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;net employment increased by 56,000, thereby reversing the disastrous decline up to then.  The second point which must be remembered about budget strategy is that we have to give signals to the outside world.  We must abide by disciplines which we accepted in the Maastricht Treaty.  It is significant in that context that Ireland is now the only country to remain within the Maastricht guidelines while, at the same time, reducing the overall taxation level.  That is no mean achievement at a time when that is the base on which economic activity is constructed.  By way of illustration, the debt GNP ratio was reduced from 127 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 100 per cent in 1992 and it is still reducing.  In addition we have the lowest rate of inflation in Europe.</P>
      <P>The strategy which the Government is continuing to pursue of reducing taxation by reducing public expenditure is the only honest and consistent way of correcting the problems we have had in this economy over the years.  I was crucified by my colleagues in Fine Gael, who were in the Dáil with me, for reducing the budget estimates for the former ACOT and the former An Foras Talúntais from £35 million to £28 million.  This was an unpopular measure, but we did it because we knew it was necessary to reduce the level of taxation and to get Government expenditure in order.  Does anyone now hear of a farmer, or anyone else, complaining about the fact that there are inadequate resources for Teagasc?  We took the tough decision and did the right thing, and those who took the popular attitude must recognise that one is obliged in political activity to have a level of consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> The overall level of public expenditure is reducing.  Total Government expenditure was 52 per cent of GNP in 1986, whereas in 1994 it is expected to remain more than 10 per cent lower than this at around 41 per cent.  Are these facts to be dismissed as being of no consequence? Recent figures from the EU illustrate that Ireland has the lowest public expenditure as a percentage of GDP in the EU.  It is a record.  Did we ever believe when Fine Gael was in Government that this would be achieved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding taxation, which puts matters in context, in the middle 1980s there was a 1 per cent income levy, introduced by the then Government, a 65 per cent top rate, and a standard rate of 35 per cent income tax. There were queues of cars crossing the Border, which I personally witnessed, and the Border regions were crucified by a lack of competitiveness.  For that reason we have been careful in this and the previous budget to keep indirect tax increases at a modest level to prevent a recurrence of that situation.</P>
      <P>A key component in public expenditure is public service pay which I will not address at present as it is a major issue.  I have some familiarity with tax reform as I was the Minister for Finance who, in 1980, established the Commission on Taxation.  The consequence of this was the reform proposal of Miriam Hederman O'Brien, who in the first report recommended specifically that we broaden our tax base, reduce the level of income taxation and consider the application of a range of what she hoped would be graduated and modest increases in new areas such that which the House is addressing.  Fine Gael supported the recommendation and I heard Senator Enright speak to that effect in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>In that context, this change is a modest contribution towards the pro employment thrust of the 1994 budget.  The present tax structure tends to favour investment and housing, especially in trading up and competing for limited capital funds with opportunities for industrial and commercial investment which is an essential basis for increased employment.  This is what is required.</P>
      <P>The limited reductions in the RPT thresholds, together with the complementary changes in mortgage interest relief, must be seen as a modest move towards tilting the balance back towards investment in employment generating productive areas as an alternative to investment in property.</P>

It represents a modest contribution to income tax improvement in the 1994 package which will cost £330 million in a full year.  Taking account of marginal relief, as detailed by the Minister, and the consequences of that relief, there will be no significant adjustment for those who will be liable for the first time.  The facts speak for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minster to the House.  The budget was balanced and well thought out.  I am not taking a stance on party political lines as I am an Independent. Listening to the contributions from both sides of the House, and having a certain political memory, there is little to choose between the parties.  Listening to Fine Gael, one would scarcely conceive that property tax was first introduced when it was in Government.  The <Col N="255" /> party now appears to wish to distance itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with at least equal enthusiasm to those in the Fianna Fáil Party who wish to distance themselves from their Labour Party colleagues.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a couple of points about this tax in general and then make one specific plea to the Minister.  The value of a house is established by self assessment. This is a dangerous concept because the value of a house is the same as the length of a piece of string.  How is it assessed? For example, at a public auction there may be no bid or there may be two people interested in the house and they inflate the price of the house artificially.  Is somebody in that situation going to be penalised retrospectively by the inland Revenue for a situation over which they have no control?  This would be most unfair.</P>
      <P>There are circumstances where, for example somebody invests in a house, the area in which they live becomes fashionable and they then find themselves triggered into a situation where they must pay property tax.  That is unfair.  I do not see why changed circumstances should catapult somebody into this bracket.  On the radio this morning I heard the economics correspondent of one of the principal newspapers say that this situation was too bad and the people involved would have to sell their house.  That is a radical thing to say to people simply because they have the misfortune to live in an area which is becoming popular or fashionable.  They either have to pay a tax which they cannot afford or they must sell their house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This goes back to the rack renting of the nineteenth century, when absentee landlords observed closely the operation of their peasants on their <Col N="256" /> ground, and if they spotted any improvements, instead of allowing them to enjoy the benefit of their efforts in improvement, they penalised them by rack renting them.</P>

      <P>People have been encouraged by Governments to trade up.  This involves them in taking out extra mortgage responsibilities which limit their disposable income.  They are now going to be caught, and they will feel aggrieved about the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of how much revenue this tax will produce, that is either a fraud or a sham.  If it is only £5 million, is it really worth the political backlash?  If not, how much is it really going to be worth?  If it is only £5 million, where is it going?  The idea of handing this money, which is squeezed out of the unfortunate, prudent classes, and handing it over to the GAA for Croke Park, before it is required to allow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My direct plea to the Minister is based to a certain extent on personal interest. As the Minister will know, I am referring to North Great George's Street, and I am aware that he is well disposed towards that area.  I do not have to pay property tax because when the assessment form was sent, I pointed our that I bought <Col N="257" /> my house for £26,000 15 years ago in a situation where it had been on the market for two years and there had been an auction without a single bid.  There was a brothel in the basement next door and the house was in ruins &mdash; I managed eventually to put it on the derelict sites register.  On the other side was the headquarters of the Moonies.  I asked how many people were going to put in a bid for that particular house.</P>

      <P>I am tempted to use the old cliché, Senator O'Kennedy, I did not interrupt the ex-Minister, so he should not interrupt me.</P>
      <P>In regard to heritage houses and those who took out mortgages to restore them, we went through a stage where the State was actively antagonistic towards this type of restoration.  It is now neutral and attitudes are changing in regard to this process.  Unlike other European countries, no grants are available for this type of restoration work.  Those who put their hard earned cash into the restoration of these houses and who took out substantial mortgages will now be penalised. By their efforts they have increased the value of the house.  In certain parts of the city they have increased the value of an entire area, which is socially constructive in terms of the life of a city.  When they sell the house they will get a small reward for the effort they made without assistance from central funding.  If there is any conviction about the importance and the necessity to conserve our architectural heritage, then listed buildings should be exempt.  I would like the Minister to consider that.  When we debate the Finance Bill, I will make a more detailed plea in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> I refer to the question of the value of a house.  I am in favour of paying for services, a tax related to income and so on.  Given that it is difficult to establish the value of a house because of variables in terms of markets, auctions, etc., why not take the value of the house at the time of purchase and index it over the period of years from that time to bring it into a realistic situation in relation to current market trends?  If the Minister insists on a property tax, it should be taxed on the value of the house when it was purchased.  This obnoxious idea of penalising people for improving their properties and areas should be stopped. We should encourage people to improve themselves, their homes and areas.  We should not go back to that awful situation, which I see as an equivalent to rack-renting decent people attempting to be prudent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I second the amendment to the motion, which refers to the broadening of the tax base and getting rid of anomalies.  We hear a lot about tax reform from all parties, but as soon as changes are made there is uproar from some of them.  We also hear people talk about the poverty trap.  As far as it is concerned, many people get into this situation if they get a small increase and, therefore, move into a higher tax bracket.  We can only have equality in society by proper tax reform and by a widening of the tax base.</P>
      <P>I started my first job in the 1960s and I earned £9 each week, which was a substantial amount.  Each week £1 was stopped out of my earnings, consisting of one stamp and income tax.  The majority of those living where I worked did not pay tax.  The tax base has since broadened, but it must be further broadened to have equality in tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Property tax is not a new concept.  I say that because the press and others have said it was introduced by the Labour Party.  Property tax has been in existence since the early 1980s.  Like other taxes, it was adjusted in the budget; but so too was income tax.  The figures we talk about <Col N="259" /> in relation to property tax are £75,000 and £100,000 and incomes of £25,000.  I know of people with a small pension from their social welfare contributions and from the place they worked &mdash; for example, the county council &mdash; who pay £5 or £10 each week in income tax, but we hear little about that.  Yet we hear about somebody with a house worth £100,000 and an income of £50,000, a considerable sum, who must pay £250 property tax.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this is an excessive tax. If one goes to the bottom of the scale to pick out individual items rather than considering the tax in an overall way, one comes up with some startling figures.  We must take into account the way the tax has been adjusted to 1 per cent for a house worth less than £100,000.  How many people own houses worth £40,000 or £50,000 and have incomes of £20,000? One cannot isolate part of the budget and say it has to go without considering the parts which are not highlighted.</P>
    <P>The budget focused on the lower paid. Those earning less than £9,000 each year do not live in houses worth more than £75,000 and may never earn £25,000 or £500 per week, but they are gaining as a result of the removal of the 1 per cent levy and the health, employment and training levy.  Do people want to abolish property tax and bring back a levy or enforce the health, employment and training levy? There was a substantial increase in the children's allowance, and the personal allowance was increased by £350 for a couple, or £175 each.  This has been overlooked in this high-powered debate about a tax which means that a person with a house worth £200,000 will have to pay £2,500, an increase of £615.  I do not believe that is excessive.  If a person owns a house worth more than £200,000, with an income to keep it going, this tax will not be a burden on them.</P>
    <P>Does anyone in this House like to pay tax?  I do not.  Consequently, any tax which is changed, or otherwise, will meet with opposition.  We must look at the budget in its overall context.  Do we want to focus on the lower paid?  Do we want <Col N="260" /> to give substantial relief to middle income earners?  With the adjustments made in the budget &mdash; the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy, the raising of the allowance by £350 for a couple and the extension in the standard rate band by £1,050 &mdash; a couple earning £25,000 gain £640, a couple earning £30,000 gain £690 and a couple earning £40,000 gain £790.  This will get rid of any property tax liability.  I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The residential property tax is unfair.  It penalises people who choose to live in one part of the country rather than another.  It takes no account of relative house values in different parts of the country and in different cities.  For this reason it has been labelled an anti-Dublin tax.  It takes no account of the wealth of the householder.  Whether one owns 100, 50 or 10 percent of the family home, one pays the tax on the value of the property.  How can it be equitable that someone with £120,000 in cash can purchase a house and pay the same tax on it as a person with a mortgage of £80,000, who is put to the pin of his or her collar to pay the instalments?</P>
      <P>The tax penalises people for investing their already heavily taxed income on house improvements.  The construction industry commented on this.  Senator Taylor-Quinn also made this point.  We are told the Government's priority is job creation, and I welcome this.  When one buys a house, especially a secondhand one, it always needs repair, painting and decorating and probably an extension, which would involve a contractor.  This type of work creates sustainable jobs.</P>
      <P>People who have enough money to buy a house, but instead put it on deposit and rent a house, pay little or no tax on their deposit income and no stamp duty and do not contribute to downstream job creation.  Householders and those on the dole are the losers as a result of this tax. It is inconsistent with the Government's strategy for job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It penalises people when the values of their houses rise faster than their incomes.  It penalises those who cannot afford the expense of an annual valuation <Col N="261" /> of their property.  Is it fair to ask taxpayers to place valuations on their homes?  Surely the value of a house can only be determined when somebody states what he or she is prepared to pay for it.  The Government ignores this reality and prefers instead to lumber people with a tax based on the notional value of their property.  The new reduced threshold for payment of the tax &mdash; houses valued at £75,000 and household incomes of at least £25,000 &mdash; means we are on the slippery slope for a wide ranging revenue source.  This is a worry for house owners.</P>
    <P>The property tax cannot be taken in isolation.  I am pleased to see, and welcome, the Minister for Finance.  In his recent budget he also brought in regulations which will reduce mortgage interest relief and VHI insurance relief. The State has responsibility for helping the less well off, who are on social welfare. Successive Governments have come to the assistance of such people as the unemployed and lone parents.  Credit must be given to the Minister for continuing in the budget to help such people. However, there is another category of people which also needs support from the Government.  This consists of those who buy their own houses, pay their taxes, educate their children and send them to university.  If one is earning £30,000, has two children at university and is paying medical and other expenses, one has very little left.  It is unfair to tax people to that extent.  The State has a responsibility to support middle income earners in raising their families.  For that reason I think the tax is anti-family.</P>
    <P>The best case which can be made against this tax has been made by members of the Minister's party.  The Minister was an esteemed member of Dublin Corporation and a former Lord Mayor of Dublin.  At last Monday night's meeting of the corporation prominent members of his party requested the suspension of standing orders.  This was fought tooth and nail by Labour Party members of the corporation.  Standing orders were suspended and a motion was proposed and passed calling for a reexamination <Col N="262" /> of the residential property tax to ensure an equitable charge, ability to pay, mortgage reduction and no disruption of the family structure.  Members of the Minister's own party proposed and supported that motion.  Five of them are Members of the other House.  I hope, when the Finance Bill is being voted on, they will have the same courage they showed on Monday night and go through the lobby with my party and vote against the Finance Bill which proposes to introduce this tax.  This is the best case I can make against this tax.  When members of the Minister's own party are opposing the tax, why should I add to this opposition?</P>

A Fine Gael Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, introduced the residential property tax in 1983.  The current leader of that party saw a further rationale for taxes on property and capital when he introduced a land tax.  Fine Gael can be forgiven, given its current state of affairs, for facing in several different directions at the same time.  The reality is that this party is absolutely hypocritical on this issue.  To describe an imposition of £5 million in the tones used by Senator Taylor-Quinn can most charitably be described as being grotesquely over the top.

VAT was at 35 per cent, the top income tax rate was 65 per cent, income levies were introduced and, of course, the residential property tax was introduced.  Where were some of these people then?  Some were Members of this House and more were Members of the other House.  They kept their mouths closed.</P>

I am sick to the teeth of listening to Progressive Democrats spokespersons telling us we must bite the bullet and be involved in taxation reform.

      <P>On what basis, because I just want to help them with their selective amnesia?  I will deal with the detail of the document, but the Progressive Democrats will read from it in a moment.  In this document they recommended that the then residential property tax was not enough, that Fine Gael and the party in Government with them had not gone far enough.  They suggested that we needed a local government charge which would be a real levy, would widen the group of people who are in the tax net and would pay for all local government services.</P>

      <P>The Senator will have his chance.  In 1991, during the review of the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government, the Progressive Democrats proposed a reduction in the level of tax relief on mortgage interest and VHI premia.  That party is screaming about the same issue now.  This was in line with the basic philosophy which had been continuously published by that party since the 1988 policy document.  Yet when similar proposals with regard to increasing the tax net were produced in the 1994 Budget, Deputy Cox slated it and said it was an unfair attack on self reliance.  Given his recent vicious shafting by his party, I think one can forgive him for being a little trína chéile on all matters relating to tax.</P>
      <P>However, the same could not be said for his party leader and her extraordinary contribution on national radio today.  In an interview on radio today Deputy Harney challenged the accuracy of statements made in the other House by the Taoiseach this morning.  She repeated with particular vehemence that the Progressive Democrats had &ldquo;never, never, never been in favour of a property tax&rdquo;. Somebody recently suggested that her grasp of fundamental economics was, to say the least, tenuous.  If she had trawled the record of either House or even read the published policy documents of her own party, she would know that is not a truthful or accurate statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record shows that at their 1987 party conference the Progressive Democrats <Col N="266" /> voted in favour of tax on all real property as a method of funding local government and improving the overall tax balance in this State.  There is something to be said for that approach. Deputy Harney, as a front bench spokesperson of that party at that time must surely be aware of those policies.  On 11 February 1988 there was an interesting contribution on this whole matter in the Dáil, at column 1913 of the Official Report.  This contribution was made by Deputy O'Malley, a man who is used to telling us all how we should govern, bite the bullet and do the hard thing.  He stated in regard to widening the tax net:</P>
    <P>However, that is really only feasible in the context of widening the tax base. That is why our party is committed to a comprehensive property tax on buildings and land to get this equation more into balance.</P>
    <P>He went on and quoted statistics from other countries and decried the level of property tax in this country.  If that is not cant, humbug and hypocrisy, given the activities of that party in the last two days, what is?</P>
    <P>The reality is that this represents a modest extension of property taxation.  I accept the contributions made by people who say that there are deficiencies in this, which is why I and others in my party and the other party in Government have campaigned with the Ministers involved to modify any untoward imposition which will occur.  The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to listen.  However, I could not blame him for not being prepared to listen to the cant and hypocrisy we have had here.</P>
    <P>The reality of taxation is and always has been that whatever a Government gives, it must first take.  If we are going to have a low tax economy we must have a low spend economy.  If we are going to have a low spend economy and cut back on public expenditure programmes, one can only imagine how the hypocritical pips would squeak at that stage.</P>

      <P>The Senator was able to quote from the document; he should at least give me the chance to quote from the same document.  Several speakers on the other side of the House invited us to comment on the overall budget strategy, which is very tempting.  However, if we were to do so we would be here for the rest of the evening.  Given the time constraints, I do not think I can go into it in a great deal of detail other than to say that I do not accept that what was presented to us in the budget represents anything to do with fundamental tax reform.  It represents tinkering around the edges with mortgage interest relief, VHI relief and the area of property tax.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate aspect of it is that once again it is the middle class taxpayers who are asked to bear the burden.  The burden always comes back on the same small group of people who work for, invest in and stay in the country.  That is what is inequitable about this tax.  I can guarantee that it will go the same way as the inequitable 1 per cent income levy and the imposition on spouses of probate tax, which was introduced last year. Thankfully, the Minister at least exempted the spouses in this year's budget from that tax on an estate of £10,000.  If we are talking about tax reform let us decide what it is that we are talking about.  Is it tax reform which we have before us?  My submission is that it is not.  We do not have tax reform or a commitment to it from this Government.</P>
      <P>The next question which arises is whose policy is it?  Over the past few days we have had so many people running for cover that one begins to wonder is it the policy of the Labour Party, which told us during the general election that this tax would not happen?  Or is it the policy of Fianna Fáil or of part of that party or part of the Labour Party?  It has got to the stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I add up all my assets, subtract my liabilities and pay the capital tax on the remainder.  That is the principle of capital acquisitions tax and most of the capital taxes that have ever been introduced in the history of this State.  In this case, however, a house may be valued at £75,000 and tax is paid on the total value, although there may be mortgage of £55,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> There has been talk about dealing with the anomalies in this taxation.  The whole tax is an anomaly and should be abolished when the Finance Bill comes before us.  We should not be considering it at all.  Even if one were to accept the anomalies, is it right that a retired person living in a house worth £100,000, who has children working who are not the title holders to the house, should be liable to pay the tax on the property?  That is not equitable and it should not happen.</P>
    <P>There has been some dispute as to the number of homes which will liable for the tax.  According to the recent MRBI poll, electors residing in an estimated 110,000 households view the residential property tax as being harmful to them.  Further analysis of the data shows that of the 110,000 households in which adult residents claim to be affected by the residential property tax, 70,000 are middle class, 55,000 live in County Dublin and 43,000 are middle class and live in County Dublin.  Those figures are very different from the figures about which the Taoiseach has been talking.</P>
    <P>The latest lunacy I have heard is the suggestion by Minister of State, Deputy Burton, that this tax should be paid out of PAYE earnings.  This is the first example in the history of the world where we have PAYE capital taxation.</P>

There are farmers and people in business who get their income two, three or four times a year. Certain farmers wait 12 or 14 months to get the money from Brussels which the Government owes them.  That is the reality with which we are dealing.  PAYE capital taxation is a new phenomenon which we should record for posterity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to introduce this tax.  It is only going to raise £5 million &mdash; the £5 million that was given to Croke Park.  I agree with Senator Roche's comments <Col N="271" /> about the value of the Gaelic Athletic Association; that is not what is at issue. However, there are other places which are more deserving of that £5 million. In my view that money would be better placed in the pockets of the people who work, invest and live in this country.</P>

If we are guilty of anything it is lack of presentational skills in relation to some aspects of this budget.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats built a castle based on toughness in determining how the finances of this State were to be restructured.  They were going to be as tough as nails, yet when they see what is really a minor adjustment in the taxation system, they go absolutely crazy.  Therefore, I am ruling them out of the way.</P>
      <P>I turn briefly to my former comrades in Fine Gael.  It is possible that they could one out of three wrong but when they get three out of three wrong and are about to get the fourth issue wrong, it is time they asked themselves some questions. We had a debate on Telecom Éireann in this House and the frighteners were put on half the population.  They said that people were going to surrender their phones by the thousands because their bills would increase by 700 per cent following the restructuring of charges.  We were told that the Government would rue the day and the people would know when they got their bills that this Government, and particularly the Labour Party, had sold them down the drain.  What was the final result?  The bills went down.</P>

It was claimed that Dick Spring went up to the hangar and made promises on which he was not going to deliver. They said there would be a huge rift between Labour and Fianna Fáil, Aer Lingus would collapse and the Government would be booted out.  What was the reality?  The Government came up with the cash, Aer Lingus restructured and there is every possibility that it will become a viable and profitable organisation over the next three years.</P>

The extension of residential property tax has received lavish coverage, yet the decision to extract a further £30 million from those on low income has barely been mentioned.  Media attention and political pressure have resulted in a retreat on this question.  It looks like a retreat because we are told that hardship cases will be examined.  How is the Minister going to look at hardship cases?  How is hardship to be defined?  Guarantees are being offered that the tax will not be extended.</P>
      <P>The danger that the tax could be extended is the main reason it must be opposed.  When residential property tax was introduced we were told it would apply mainly to people who had second residences.  There was much speculation at the time, but the tax remained more or less the same.  We had the abolition of the resource tax and the land tax.  There was great support for the land tax because it was accepted as an equitable system of imposing tax on land and progress was being made in that regard.  The Government elected in 1987 abolished the land tax and now in the guise of tax reform, a burden is being imposed on people who own their own homes in the form of residential property tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large amount of State aid is paid to people on supplementary welfare who bought their own homes with borrowings from the bank, building society or the local authority and who now find themselves unemployed.  They depend on supplementary welfare allowance to pay the mortgage.  People were relying on mortgage interest relief when calculating their mortgage repayments.  That relief was <Col N="275" /> another factor which encouraged people to buy their own homes.  Last week I had experience of a person who deemed it necessary to take a shared ownership with the county council because of the fact that we do not have a good public housing programme.  The house cost £50,000.  That is not much less than the present residential property tax threshold. That person took out a shared ownership loan because they saw no prospect of being allocated a local authority house for quite a number of years, and wanted to make a home for their family. That is the kind of scene being discussed here.  Any extension of the tax will be vehemently opposed.</P>
    <P>People who are being affected at the moment represent a very strong lobby and there is already a retreat.  If it is being done in the guise of reforming the tax system and if the State can only account for 5,000 self employed people who pay a certain level of tax there is something wrong with the system.  There is something radically wrong when the State has to give a tax amnesty to tax evaders and tax avoiders.  That is the area to concentrate on and if there are many other measures such as a tax on wealth and so forth, they should be pursued vigorously.</P>
    <P>It looks like the tax inequalities will continue for the future, although I thought things would change.  I believed the line would be drawn when the Labour Party got such support.  I do not want to be critical.  If any line has been drawn it is very vague indeed.  The same people have the power, the same strong lobbies have the influence, not the ordinary people, the ordinary workers, the people on the dole or the middle income group who are being fleeced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present controversy surrounding this once-off adjustment to the residential property tax thresholds completely ignores the very significant changes in the budget in favour of all income earners, including those on lower incomes.  There has never been a more radical budget in this regard, and the very significant <Col N="276" /> increases in take-home pay which will result must be taken account of in any balanced and fair consideration of the residential property tax issue.</P>
      <P>Over the last number of years a great deal has been said by numerous commentators about tax reform.  We all, of course, have our own views as to what precise form tax reform should take and as to how far reform can usefully be taken.  While not wanting to exaggerate the importance of tax reform in terms of job creation, I am acutely aware that it is one of the more important economic tools which can aid economic development. It was with a view to focusing the debate on this issue in the context of the actual tax situation that I took the opportunity in the budget to outline the taxation strategy which I intend to pursue in the medium term.  The Government's thinking was spelt out very clearly for those who wanted to read it.  It set it out more clearly than any Government has done in the 17 years that I have been in the other House.  It was not just the position for 1994, it was the position for the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>My budget speech set out what I and the Government regard as the guiding principles for a &ldquo;pro-jobs&rdquo; taxation strategy. The concerns which underpinned this budget and will remain the barometer of progress over the coming years are, in a nutshell, to seek to redress the long-run tendency for earned income to contribute a growing proportion of total revenue, to preserve and build on the considerable base-broadening across all major tax heads, but at the same time to preserve reasonable and focused incentives which further our economic and social objectives, particularly in relation to employment.  These are the kinds of issues Senator Dardis was talking about. In this budget we have many of them. We will continue to pursue simplification and streamlining of tax legislation and administration, subject to the overriding need to maintain effective collection systems, which are fundamental to equity in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all recognise that tax reform is not simply a matter of reliefs.  The <Col N="277" /> strategy behind the present tax changes involves a reorientation of the overall system to be more employment friendly. This necessarily involves choices and trade-offs, and the availability of some limited leeway this year does not get away from this.  In the income tax and PRSI code, focusing reliefs and reductions on the lower paid necessarily meant less relief for others.  Moreover, to make possible the considerable mainstream reliefs required some offsetting measures elsewhere in the tax code.</P>
    <P>One of the key requirements, if we are to come to terms with the huge employment challenge facing our society, is that public policies promote job-creating investment, and in particular support the establishment and development of indigenous businesses.  One element in this is the adoption of the kind of targeted and focused measures which this budget contains.  The other side of the coin is that we look critically at aspects of our tax system that may divert resources into other areas which, whatever their particular merits, do not contribute to the creation of long term sustainable jobs. The advantages which our tax system conferred on housing investment have long been criticised from this standpoint. I feel satisfied that the steps I took in this budget to redress this imbalance in putting mortgage interest relief on a more equitable footing and in the very limited extension of the residential property tax are fully justified in the context of what must be our overriding objective to step up the pace of employment growth.</P>
    <P>Before I address the various issues raised in relation to the extension of the residential property tax, there is one point that I have to stress.  There is absolutely no question of the tax changes effected this year being a departure from the long-standing position that the core of housing policy is the promotion of owner-occupation, that is, of giving reasonable assistance to families who wish to acquire their own housing.</P>
    <P>Even when the standard-rating of mortgage interest relief is fully implemented, there will still be very substantial assistance through the tax <Col N="278" /> system, that is, from the general body of tax payers to those people who borrow to buy a house.  It will still be in excess of £100 million per annum.  For the first time buyer this will amount to meeting one quarter of the interest costs up to a size of mortgage that would at the prevailing interest rates fund the purchase of a substantial house.  Even after the initial five years, approximately one fifth of the interest outgoings will be recouped.  First time buyers of new houses will get a substantial grant, as they do at present, and most buyers of new houses are fully exempted from stamp duty.  These benefits and reliefs are useful and they will remain.  No one should try to argue that we are moving away from supporting home ownership, a concept we have had in this State for decades.</P>
    <P>The residential property tax as extended is both a modest measure of equity in the tax system and a contribution towards tilting the balance in the tax code more in favour of productive investment, which helps to create and safeguard employment.  The present tax structure has tended to encourage more than necessary investment in housing.  In particular, it has given rise to tax driven trading up, with an undue bias towards the purchase of houses as investments rather than homes.  These views have been echoed in all major reports and articles over the past 15 or 20 years, including the Commission on Taxation, which Senator O'Kennedy mentioned, the three recent NESC reports, Culliton, the ESRI and the OECD.  Every political party has done a major document on tax reform and those who looked at the issue came up with the same solution.  I will not quote from them, but they add to the argument.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward in the last two weeks was that everyone was in favour of this measure, but not in this form.  If it were done their way, they would still prefer it to be done differently and that is what always happens in this country.  Most commentators never check what was said last year or the year before.  Most commentators, with the exception of one, strongly supported residential <Col N="279" /> property tax over the years. However, when they were contacted in recent days by various programmes they declined to take part.  I have no doubt that in three months' time, when they take out the files to make another speech about tax reform, they will make the same points they have been making for the last 20 years.  We should take this into account in any constructive discussion on this issue.</P>
    <P>Employment is important at present. We should concentrate on it because it will be an issue in this House and this country for the next ten years.  We should focus our energies on what we can do in this area.  The reaction to this is not about the minor extension to the residential property tax.  Everyone in the House, including my Government colleagues, mentioned the £25,000 income limit. However, no one mentioned the marginal relief, which means that a person earning £26,000 has an 80 per cent reduction, or the person earning £27,000 has a 60 per cent reduction.  People talk as if everyone was included at £25,000, although when the marginal relief removes a large proportion of the population. Senators know that many people earning between £25,000 and £30,000 are removed.  Only 7.5 per cent of the 915,000 people who pay tax earn over £30,000.  The marginal relief catches between 7.5 and 12.5 per cent of the people.  Some 5 per cent of the total are included in the marginal relief and this is a large proportion.  If one looks at the indexes, one will see that a large proportion of people are removed.</P>
    <P>Investment in dearer houses can only be to the disadvantage of industrial and commercial investment, which is essential for employment growth.  There is no argument about that and everyone who has written about this subject has agreed with this point.  This is partly a matter of scarce investment resources, partly of the individual's limited capacity to contemplate borrowings or financial exposure on more than one front, and partly of the natural disposition of financial <Col N="280" /> institutions to favour secure lending.</P>
    <P>Resulting from the 1994 adjustments, the yield from the residential property tax will increase from £9 million in 1993 to £14 million in 1994.  This represents a modest contribution to the income tax improvement package in the budget, which will cost £330 million in a full year. This package will give significant benefits to all taxpayers.  For instance, a married couple with two children who earn £30,000 will gain £639 from the mainstream income tax, levies and PRSI reliefs.  To put this in context, the additional residential property tax charge on an £80,000 house for this family, which is the average family in most surveys, will be £20.  We must look at this if it is a major issue.</P>
    <P>Few people are writing letters about this issue because most people are concerned about what might happen in the future.  It was for that reason that the Government clarified the situation last night, because it was being said that the Government would change the figure to £55,000 next year, £40,000 the following year and £10,000 the year after and that everyone would be included.  It is not a question of the Government indexing the threshold.  The Government did not take all week to consider this issue because there were more important issues to be considered, such as how to target the lower paid, what to do with marginal relief and how to help middle income earners generally.  These issues were discussed in detail and the Government felt that £30,000 after marginal relief and £75,000 index were reasonable figures.</P>
    <P>The existing records and figures have been proven right over the past 12 years. We argued about probate tax in this House, and Senator Dardis finally acknowledged that the changes were reasonable.  I said last year I would look at them and review them during the course of the year.  I made that promise to Senator Dardis and others in this House. Amendments were tabled and withdrawn and we said we would look at them.</P>
    <P>The figures of £30,000 and £75,000 were reasonable figures based on existing <Col N="281" /> statistics, which have been right for the last ten years.  During the past two weeks everyone said their statistics were better. If their figures for the next ten years are better than the figures from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of the Environment for the last ten years, then I will be glad if I am still around in ten years' time to acknowledge them. The fact is that the figures from the Department of the Environment and the Revenue Commissioners have held up. The reason is that while there are 56,000 houses in the State worth over £75,000, the statistics show that over 50 per cent are income exempt and that will continue to be the case.  One can see this from the bar charts or figures of who pays what.</P>
    <P>The figures show there is great concern that three or four incomes in a house will put everyone over the £30,000 limit.  I am not saying there are not some houses where this will happen, that there are not some anomalies, or that in some cases a family, a husband and wife, would have an aged relative such as their mother or father in the house which could increase the income.  But if this is the case, how do we explain the fact that there are 876,000 private houses in the country when we have only 915,000 taxpayers? There are either a lot of houses in which no one is living or where five people are living.  Perhaps my figures are wrong, but we should explain how there are 876,000 houses when we have only 915,000 taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The house value and income thresholds are being reduced and we know the figures.  An important point often overlooked is that the child relief substantially reduces the charge for all <Col N="282" /> families with dependent children.  I want to put that on the record because it was not mentioned here tonight.  All residential property tax bills are reduced by 10 per cent for each eligible child in a household.  Thus, where there are four children the charge will be only three-fifths, or 60 per cent, of the full figure. Moreover, marginal relief serves to greatly reduce the actual residential property tax charge for people whose income is relatively close to the new threshold of £25,000.</P>
      <P>I wanted to make that point because last night I saw a lady on the news who, I am sure, was following her own figures. She had five children.  She said her husband told her that the increased charge &mdash; not the charge &mdash; was £40 a month more, that is £480.  If she has a 50 per cent reduction, we are getting into big house numbers.  I know because I had a person today who has a £1.1 million house and has spent £250,000 on it.  He told me his bill was now £19,000 per year and made the point that over ten years that was an awful lot of money.  I asked him what his income was and he said it was substantial.  His point really was that he did not mind 1.5 per cent but his argument was about the 2 per cent.  There are perhaps anomalies on one side as well as the other, because a bill like that seems very substantial to a person who is out there trying to make money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to acknowledge is that because a person has £25,000 and they cut their cloth to measure, they have no money.  However, if a person has £100,000 they also cut their cloth to measure and I suppose their liquid cash is tight as well.  There are not that many people around with hard cash, though there are many people around with assets.  The Government will look at all these issues.  However, the proposal we are bringing forward is reasonable.  In five of the last seven reports on property tax in this State, people spoke about tax takes of £250 million to £300 million.  The Government is making slight adjustments. I agree with the earlier comment that our change in RPT is tinkering with the system.  The changes we made in <Col N="283" /> exemptions, levies and marginal relief were not tinkering with the position &mdash; they cost £330 million which has to be funded every year.  This one, however, was a slight tinkering with it in line with what we thought was reasonable.</P>
    <P>People should not get all het up about this.  In driving the lobby they are saying quite clearly that they do not want to see a property tax on all sides and would rather &mdash; you have heard the arguments &mdash; put a penny on the pint or tuppence on petrol.  But if we went back into that cycle in the next budget we would stick 5p or 10p on drink, perhaps 10p on fags and 10p on petrol.  That would push the consumer price index through the roof, inflation and wage demands would be driven up, there would be pressure on interest rates and we would be back on the merry-go-round again.  Is that the way we want to go?  Is there no consensus? Successive Governments and successive commissions for every party in the House &mdash; although I am not too sure about Senator Sherlock's party &mdash; have examined this and said that base broadening was the way to go.</P>
    <P>The reality is that as soon as anybody does anything, others are against it.  They say that if it had been done another way they would have been for it, but now they are against it.  If we continue that way we will maintain high taxes on income, a disincentive to work, and we will be moaning on about how PRSI should go or be in with social welfare.  This year the Government substantially changed PRSI, with a 25 per cent reduction for low paid workers, as well as doing away with the health levy and the 1 per cent levy for low paid workers.  We are trying to set a target so that we continue to move in that direction.  We know we have not solved all the problems on the marginalisation of the £9,000 and what happens when you go £1 over that.  There are still issues to be addressed, which I spelt out in our strategy document.</P>
    <P>It should be apparent to the public that the general impact of the changes in RPT will be modest and that in the vast bulk of cases the increased charge will be far <Col N="284" /> outweighed by income tax reliefs announced in the budget.  In view of the level of public concern on the issue we will be reviewing certain situations where it has been suggested that the operation of RPT may impact unduly.  Any anomalies which cause unreasonable hardship to families now or in the future will be dealt with in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  We are not talking about anomalies that arose in the last fortnight; we are talking about anomalies that have been there since Deputy Alan Dukes brought in this property tax 12 years ago.  Anomalies have been raised from time to time over the years and nothing done, but I am prepared to do something about them.</P>
    <P>The fact that the increases in the residential property tax are modest should not be interpreted as an indication that further increases are planned.  Successive Governments in recent years &mdash; I have been part of three different Governments &mdash; have been working to introduce base broadening while reducing taxes.  I can confirm that there is no intention to reduce the thresholds further.  While many economic reports have recommended the introduction of a comprehensive property tax, the changes in the long standing and limited residential property tax are once off and should not be interpreted as a first step on any road, particularly the road to a full property tax.  These changes constitute a modest element in the overall strategy for reducing levels of income taxation and improving the equity of the tax system through broadening the tax base, and for curtailing the relative tax advantages of investment in dearer residential property as compared with industrial and commercial investments which are essential for employment growth.</P>
    <P>I do not think it makes any sense, at a time when Government is actively seeking to encourage a flow of savings into job-creating investment in business and commercial ventures, to give signals through the tax system, both through interest relief and exempting fully from the RPT many valuable residences, that the best repository for savings is to <Col N="285" /> acquire a dearer type of property.  Over Christmas people were already highlighting the fact that we would be off into an inflation zone, trading up business. They said there would be no money for business investments and that everyone would take off into the property area.  I think it is perhaps no harm that that has declined over the last few weeks.  This budget moves to redress the imbalance in tax treatment between investment in house property and areas which contribute directly to supporting employment, but in such a way as to maintain reasonable and equitable assistance towards owner-occupation and not imposing any property tax charge on people with average income or with houses not valued over £75,000.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senators for contributing to this debate.  I look forward to returning for the debate on the Finance Bill and discussing all the initiatives that this Government has brought forward in this budget.  I have no doubt that the economic benefits of the 1994 Budget will assist the country.  Already we can see money supply up, a growth rate of 4 per cent, an inflation rate of 2 per cent, and so many other things that are right.  True to form in Ireland, people go through a 116-page budget speech and obviously can find nothing in 115 and three-quarter pages of it; yet they manage to find something to set off scare-mongering the nation again.  However, at the end of the day, I see the 1994 Budget will be seen as one of the better ones in recent times.</P>

While I do not agree with his defence of the tax which has been introduced, I am delighted that at least we have had an articulate, well-written and well-pronounced defence of it.  Before that we were treated to a speech from Senator O'Kennedy which did not once address the issue of property tax.  In fact, I do not think it mentioned residential property tax at any stage.  We were <Col N="286" /> treated to a speech from Senator Roche of a kind I have got used to.  It is the single transferable speech in which he simply insults whatever political party his party is not in coalition with at the time, and uses the same insults for them.  It was effective, but it is, I am afraid, becoming extremely stale.  I have heard it before. It was addressed to the Labour Party when Fianna Fáil was not in coalition with that party, I heard it when Fianna Fáil was not in coalition with any other party and now I hear it addressed to both Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats. I could have written it for the Senator; in fact, I think I did some years ago.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that we have had a pre-budget debate in this House. However, we have not had an examination of the issues involved.  We do not necessarily need to know the detail of the residential property tax which has been spelt out <i>ad nauseam.</i>  We want to know whether it is a radical departure and if there will be a radical transfer of tax from income to property.  The Minister seemed to assure the House that this is a once off tax, that he has made a mistake for which he is sorry, so he will stop it at this stage. He has had enormous problems from Senator Magner's party and from his own.  Therefore, this is all the medicine he will give us.  That flies in the face of what Senator Magner's colleague, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, Minister of State at the Department of the Tánaiste, said when she claimed it was a radical restructuring of the tax system.</P>
      <P>I do not know who is speaking with authority but I know its effect and I congratulate the Minister on it.  The Minister has stolen 3 per cent from Senator Magner's party.  Indeed, if 3 per cent had to go one way or the other, I prefer the direction it took.  The Labour Party is undoubtedly responsible for this tax.  The consequences of the tax were not thought out in a budget which &mdash; and I congratulate the Minister on this &mdash; was in many ways tremendously effective and good.</P>

Suddenly, when the budget is announced, the members of the Labour Party spot anomalies which have been in existence for 11 years.  The reason, as everybody knows, is quite simple.  They are getting huge flak from the middle classes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is why they spotted the anomalies and why we hear verbiage such as &ldquo;inequities&rdquo; and &ldquo;anomalies&rdquo;. It is also why there will be a number of changes in the Finance Bill. There will be changes because of public reaction and it is a good thing we have such public reaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious issues must be addressed.  They include the questions of whether residential property tax is a good idea and whether we should have such a tax.  Are there so many anomalies, as they are euphemistically described by the Minister and the Labour Party, in the residential tax that it is not a workable tax? I believe that to be the case.  It is not a residential property tax.  Other people wrongly call it a &ldquo;property tax&rdquo;.  It is not. It is a tax on peoples' homes and an income tax.  It is an income tax on those who have incomes over £25,000 and who also have houses worth over £75,000.  A large number of people with incomes over £25,000 inevitably fall into that <Col N="289" /> bracket.  We are really introducing a surtax on those who have expensive houses.  If the Minister called it an additional income tax I would not quarrel with him.  However, he does not do so. He calls it a residential property tax and confuses everybody.  An income basis is needed for it.</P>

      <P>The other issue which has not been pointed out is the fact that there is no ceiling.  The Minister spoke very sympathetically about the man with a house worth £1 million who had to pay £19,000 per annum.  It is absurd that anybody should have to pay £19,000 per annum because he lives in an exoensive house.  That is unfair.</P>

What will happen if Senator Magner's house increases in value to £300,000 or £400,000?  There will be howls of protest here.  The Act will be repealed and the Finance Bill will suddenly abolish residential property tax. There are unexpected circumstances in which there may be movements in the property market which the Minister cannot possibly anticipate.  It would be far more sensible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious danger that some people will be caught not only for the full value of the mortgage but for a net liability.  That is an extreme case, but the Minister should legislate for <Col N="291" /> extreme cases.  I was tired of hearing him say that only 3 per cent or 7 per cent or a small number of people will be affected. Those people will suffer immense hardship just because they have incomes of £25,000 per year and houses worth £75,000.  That does not mean that they merit crucifixion.  Just because 3 per cent of people are unfairly treated does not mean that they should be unfairly treated.  The Minister is there to legislate for the exception, not for the rule.  It is easy to legislate for the vast majority.</P>
      <P>Luckily, the Minister has decided to respond to public opinion.  I ask him to take a radical look at this tax and recognise that it is fundamentally flawed.  He has obviously been stopped in his tracks by his party and it is going no further.  It is unnecessary and full of anomalies.  The debate this evening has been of such an abominably low standard from the Government side of the House that he might consider abolishing it.</P>

      <P>I am honoured to speak on the amendment to this motion.  I am glad to have the opportunity to put the record straight.  Members opposite call for reform of the taxation code and the welfare code, but when the most radical change in many years is being put in place they immediately object.  This shows the lack of initiative and vision on the Opposition benches.  When they are asked to put forward alternative proposals to reform the system they are unable to come up with anything concrete or definite. If one goes over their previous record in this field, as other speakers have done, one will see the gap that has developed between what they are putting forward now and their declared party policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation reform does not only mean that we are going to reduce all tax bands; that is part of it.  The most important part <Col N="292" /> of the reform of the tax code is a widening of the tax base to make it more equitable and fairer to everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in the residential property tax net since 1987.  On top of that I have been paying service charges.  Obviously, I would prefer not to have to pay any tax.  It would suit me better to have more disposable income and not pay any tax.  At the same time, I understand that if we are to put in place the proper services for the people, if we are to provide a caring society and protect those most vulnerable in our society, then there is a moral onus on every one of us to pay what we can.</P>
      <P>Figures have been bandied about in recent days regarding the property tax and how it will affect certain people in certain areas.  I admit that some people will be affected, but until this year's budget those people who lost benefits when they came off social welfare and entered into low paid employment found themselves in a new poor category.  I do not wish to knock the unemployed.  The majority of people who are unemployed want to work.  We must give them the incentive to get to that level, and the only way we can do that is by encouraging them through lower bands so that they will earn more money from working than from not working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is required is a radical and fundamental overhaul not only of the tax code but also of the welfare code.  They are not mutually exclusive but rather they are mutually inclusive and have to be reformed side by side.  I welcome the measures in this budget and the move regarding the residential property tax.  It will have to be looked at and the anomalies will have to be sorted out in the Finance Bill.  What has been stated is a proposal which can be changed in the Finance Bill.  It is up to us to put forward the fairest viewpoints to represent every <Col N="293" /> section of our community, not just people who live in Dublin city or Cork city or in my town of Bandon, or pensioners who have lived in a house that has shot up in value over the past few years.  We must also ensure that low paid employees get a fair break.  That is what they got from the budget with the widening of the tax bands and the reduction in employers' PRSI.  This is a move forward.  The future direction will be to help ensure that people have the incentive to work and are given the incentive to employ others. If that means that people such as I and other Members have to pay some more because we come into the residential property tax net, then so be it.  We have a moral duty to ensure that we make the system as fair and as equitable as possible.  Those who have more should pay more than those who have less.</P>

      <P>I would like to put on record one of the points outlined in the Minister's speech.  He claims it is easier for tax payers to assign a value to their houses using a value banding system. What we are talking about here is self-assessment. People can pay an auctioneer to value their house and it may be under the £75,000 limit.  Let us remember that the Revenue Commissioners, at the press of a button, can get a print out on every person who has an income in excess of £25,000.  It will automatically be assumed that any person earning over £25,000 must have a house worth over £75,000.</P>

      <P>I have here the Fianna Fáil manifesto from 1977.  It is a wonderful document and the present Taoiseach got elected to the Oireachtas on the strength of it.  One of its promises was to do away with rates because it wanted people to have better homes and improve the quality of their houses.  Now it is bringing in the residential property tax. In the same budget Fianna Fáil did away with car tax.  According to the new Road Traffic Bill, if a person is unemployed and cannot tax their car it can be confiscated and sold.  That is a treble somersault. That is a good one even for Fianna Fáil &mdash; to take a car from a person because it is not taxed.</P>

      <P>Luckily I was not.  If one looks at some of the Circuit Court lists one can see the different building societies and banks seeking orders for repossessions of dwelling houses. Recently it has not been as bad, but family homes were threatened because people were unable to pay their mortgages.  Now we have a further tax on people which I feel is wrong.  The Minister has too many advisers and receives too much advice. He is a highly intelligent man.  If he listened to his intuition instead of these advisers he would not have imposed that tax.  He says he wants people to put their money into productive investment.  Perhaps I am old-fashioned but I believe one of the best investments a person can make is to buy and improve a family home.  These changes constitute a retrograde step.</P>

      <P>The Kilrush-Ennis-Kilkee route is an important road because it is the network which carries the main bulk of traffic from west County Clare to Ennis, the county's main town.  In recent years there has been a severe deterioration in the condition of the road.  This was partly due to the increase in heavy traffic during the construction work at Moneypoint.  A sizeable number of people are employed at the Moneypoint generating station and the resulting heavy traffic on the main route has meant that in many places the road has collapsed entirely.</P>
      <P>There are some important areas of population along the route.  For example, at Lissycasey, a small village along the route, the situation is dangerous due to the inadequate lighting system and the poor condition of the road.  I draw the attention of the Minister to that section of the roadway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately two years ago a start was made in undertaking a major reconstruction and development of the road. Some work was undertaken on the Kilrush side and around Ennis.  I compliment the county council staff on the way they proceeded with that work.  With a small budget they succeeded in making a major improvement in the road in the environs of Ennis and Kilrush.  The Kilrush stretch needs to be resurfaced urgently, given the volume of traffic, the <Col N="299" /> amount of work undertaken in the area and the importance of the route itself.</P>
    <P>The high volume of traffic resulting from the Moneypoint development and from the Killimer car ferry, the substantial number of large buses taking students to the universities and colleges at weekends and the normal school bus traffic along the route results in heavy traffic on the road.  In consequence, there has been a number of serious accidents where heavy vehicular traffic has left the road.  This has been a danger to people in business and has resulted in severe losses.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of this road is that from the viewpoint of Kilkee and the west it is vital for the development of the tourism business.  Much of the work on the development of tourism has been hampered by the lack of suitable access routes to places such as Kilkee.  From the perspective of the development of tourism and business in the west, where there are many small businesses striving hard to succeed, it is of vital importance that a big effort be made to have funding provided to the county council to undertake the necessary remedial and reconstruction work required on that stretch of roadway.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the efforts he has made since taking up office in having substantial funding made available to the local authorities to undertake development work on the county and regional road network.  Through his efforts the Minister has been successful in obtaining substantial EU funding.  In view of this, I direct his attention to this roadway to ensure that in the forthcoming allocations he will find it possible to make a meaningful contribution to the county council to enable it continue the work it started a couple of years ago and to undertake work now which will help avoid substantial costs in the future.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Daly for sharing his time with me and I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support Senator Daly's remarks in relation to the Ennis-Kilrush-Kilkee <Col N="300" /> road, a national secondary route.  As a member of Clare County Council, I confirm that sufficient money is not available to undertake substantial improvements on the road.</P>
      <P>As Senator Daly has outlined, it is a very important road.  It is the artery to the west Clare area and the route to the lower Shannon estuary.  It is hoped substantial development will take place in the lower estuary in the future, but unless there is a proper network of roads and an infrastructure in the area, this development may not take place.  I ask the Minister to compare the difference in the quality of the road from Ennis to Kilrush with that from Limerick to Listowel and Tarbert.  The road in the area referred to should be brought up to a proper standard.</P>
      <P>As Senator Daly said, this road is important to the tourism industry in Kilkee.  He pointed out that further investment would take place in Kilkee and more people would come to the area if there was a better access route.  This Government has placed great emphasis on the development of tourism.  It is important that a proper network is in place in the Kilkee and the scenic Loop Head peninsula area.  If the Government is serious about the tourism, the Minister for the Environment must work closely with his counterpart.  It is not enough for the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Deputy McCreevy, to promote the product. A joint effort must be made to coordinate the effort and to ensure places like Kilkee and west Clare reach their full tourism potential.  These areas face other difficulties, including a reduction in dairy farming and emigration.  The only way that situation can be reversed is by putting in place a proper roads network in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I thank Senator Daly for sharing his time.  I hope the Minister is in a position to give us good new this evening. I understand this road may come under the new National Roads Authority.  If that is the case, I would like an assurance that we will not be dependent on who we know in the authority to secure the money.  There should be a definite and <Col N="301" /> clear allocation of moneys to secondary roads in need of repair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for the welcome back to the House.  Members know how much I like to come back to the Seanad because of the relaxed and secure atmosphere. I thank Senator Daly and Senator Taylor-Quinn for raising this important matter.  It gives me the opportunity to say how glad I was when reading reports from the various estimates meetings from all local authorities to note Clare County Council had increased the allocation for roads from its resources by over £0.5 million.  It is a definite indication that elected members in that area see road development as essential to tourism, agriculture and industrial and commercial development throughout the county.</P>
      <P>I have travelled on the Ennis-Kilrush-Kilkee road on a few occasions and I accept there are patches along it which are deficient and need to be radically improved.  I responded in the past couple of years to representations from Senator Daly.  In 1992 I allocated £150,000 for work at Darragh and in 1993 £190,000 for work at Tullycrine, Moyadda and other locations.  I hope the National Roads Authority which is now responsible for primary and secondary routes will continue that work.  I will ask my officials to communicate with officials and technical staff in Clare County Council to see how we can continue to promote that work.</P>
      <P>Although there is an enormous commitment on the part of the Government to road development which is evident in Bunratty and other places, there is concern about the need to accelerate this programme.  Often people do not understand the changes which have taken place in recent years.  Never before has there been so much money to spend on roads and we have never had such an opportunity to improve them.  There was never a time in our history when there was so much to do.  This is largely due to the growth in the density of traffic, which in one way is good because it means we are doing a lot more business and exporting more products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> The growth in car traffic since I started driving in the early 1960s has increased from 160,000 to 900,000 cars.  At that time there were 100,000 four to eight tonne trucks on the road.  There are now 500,000 trucks which are able to carry 40 tonnes and over.  Many road foundations were laid in the last century and we tried to build over an inadequate foundation. The National Development Plan sets out plans for building and restructuring.  I appreciate comments made in relation to progress and I understand the anxiety of both Senators in ensuring that work progresses.  I will give a commitment to this House to ensure as far as possible targets are met.</P>
    <P>I could indicate that this is primarily a responsibility for the National Roads Authority, which legally it is, but when matters like this are raised, it is not a question of who you know.  Matters are dealt with on the basis of equity.  Senator Taylor-Quinn might have difficulty understanding how things are done.  We are on a purification trail and we will take on board anyone who wants to go to church to confess their sins at least once a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister a question about the allocation of funds this year?  Will the final decision in relation to the allocation of funds be within the ambit of the National Roads Authority this year?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  First, I offer my congratulations to St. Louis Secondary School in Carrickmacross on their victory in the All-Ireland senior B basketball championship today.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education, Mr. Aylward, may be aware it is an old and established centre of learning. Indeed, it might be appropriate for the Minister and the Cathaoirleach to send a note of congratulation to them.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the condition of two of the three schools in the parish of Errigal Truagh, in north Monaghan.  I will outline the problems which they face and ask the Minister for assistance in that regard.  The parish of Errigal Truagh is situated in an exceptional part of Ireland in beautiful rolling landscape under the shadow of what is locally known as the Bragan mountain.  Other people may not consider it to be a mountain, but it is our mountain and we love it.  Everyone knows about the hills of Monaghan, which are like the tops of eggs.  This part of Monaghan is drained by the Black-water and its tributaries and some of the soil in this area is fertile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Minister of State will visit it.  There is an enterprise of some sort around every bend.  There are mushroom units, poultry houses, shoe and furniture factories.  This is the kind of place it is.  The people are hard working, honest and very ambitious.  No other part of Ireland has this kind of profile.  The community, being the type it is, built a fine community centre attached to the football field.  In Carrickroe, which is a village in one part of that parish, a meeting will take place tomorrow night to discuss the condition of their own local hall with a view to upgrading the facilities there.  People who are serious about creating employment &mdash; and many people are &mdash; would do well to carry out an indepth study of the <Col N="304" /> people in this part of County Monaghan and their practices and activities.</P>
    <P>The parish of Errigal Truagh has been largely untouched by grants and subventions. It is now looking for attention regarding the condition of two of its three schools.  Knockconan is the oldest of the three and was built in 1902.  The Minister would be able to surmise from this date, even if he had not seen the school, that it is entirely unsuited to the demands of the new curriculum.  In today's terms it is primitive in the extreme.  I visited it the other day.  I know it well but wanted to familiarise myself with it again.  I found it has two classrooms and a prefab.  All three rooms are overcrowded.  There is very little space for the pupils.  Teacher pupil contact is difficult.  One to one contact is almost impossible.  The school does not have a remedial teacher and this exacerbates its problems.  The windows in the old part of the school are very high and little natural light comes in. Although the pupils are very happy there, the atmosphere is not conducive to the work schools must do today.</P>
    <P>A report on the school shows the classrooms are too small.  The infants room is exceptionally small and totally inadequate for the number of pupils in it.  The toilet block is inadequate.  There are no storage, staff, medical or cloak rooms.  There is no library space or office. When I visited the other day, the secretary's desk was situated at the end of the corridor beside the door to the toilets. This is entirely unsatisfactory.  There are no sinks or running water in the classrooms.  The tiles in the corridor are very slippery, which is dangerous.  The yard is very small.  The boundary wall is broken and dangerous.  There is a makeshift perspex shelter in the yard which the parents put there to offer shelter to the pupils.</P>
    <P>The board of management is doing its best to keep the building in good condition and the atmosphere is excellent. There are books everywhere, but in an unco-ordinated way, because there is no place for them.  There is a computer in the corner.  All the mod cons which the board of management can supply are <Col N="305" /> there.  However, a bucket of water is needed for art, the classroom has to be rearranged and all the furniture moved. It takes a half an hour for the art class to get underway.  One can see how inadequate this is.  It is a lamentable situation. I believe the Minister will agree it should be remedied at once.</P>
    <P>Clara national school was built in 1972 and is not the subject of any serious complaints. Deravoy school was built in the 1960s and is relatively modern.  However, there are difficulties in that the design is inadequate and inferior.  The school needs redesigning and refurbishing.  The third classroom is a 33-year-old prefab. It has been in the school for about 14 years.  When it arrived it was in tatters and is now in a terrible mess.  I do not know how the glass stays on the windows. The roof is hanging by a thread, which is not unexpected when a temporary building has been used for the past 33 years. There are rotten windows and all sorts of problems in that classroom.  It needs to be replaced by a permanent structure. There is no staffroom, office or storage space in Deravoy.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that people are entitled to a little dignity and the staff and pupils should not have to work in those conditions.  I can verify that the boards of management have kept the schools in good condition.  They have spent whatever was necessary to do this. The pupils are very happy and contented, which is incredible given the situation I found in the schools, particularly in Knockconan.  I pay a special tribute to the principals and staff in each of the schools.  These are Mrs. Devlin, Mrs. Joanne Deery and Mrs. Eimer Brennan in Knockconan and Mr. John Mullen, Mrs McCormack and Hilda McManus in Deravoy.  I assume the Minister, having received a report from his officials, will agree the situation is bad.  I want him to offer support to the people of that parish, who deserve it.</P>
    <P>The parish is near the Border.  The Border roads are closed and freedom of movement is difficult.  All the consequences of being a Border community militate against this parish.  Its people can <Col N="306" /> see fine, well equipped schools across the Border.  This gives them a feeling of unease.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to send some of his staff to meet the boards of management, look at the schools and discuss the situation with them at the earliest opportunity. They want this to happen within a few weeks.  If the Minister agrees to this, I can speak to him later and we can arrange it.  I look forward to the Minister's co-operation.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with Senator Cotter in extending congratulations to the St. Louis school basketball team which won a competition today.  Perhaps you, a Chathaoirligh, would convey our good wishes to them. I am also wearing my hat as Minister with responsibility for sport.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Cotter for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, who has responsibility for the school building programme. I appreciate all the points made by the Senator and will bring them to the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>As the Senator stated, Knockconan and Deravoy national schools are situated in the parish of Errigal Truagh.  They are located approximately three miles apart.  They are both three teacher schools with a combined enrolment this year of 162 pupils.  There is one other school in the parish, St.  Patrick's national school in Clara.  This is also a three teacher school with an enrolment of 80 pupils this year.  The Clara school is a four classroom one with a general purpose room also.  It was built in 1975 and is in good repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the fact that existing facilities at Knockconan and Deravoy national schools are in need of upgrading.  It had been proposed to provide an extension at Deravoy national school to replace a prefabricated classroom and to refurbish the existing two classrooms.  In April 1993 the Department's architectural staff were asked to prepare sketch plans in order to enable <Col N="307" /> the chairman to obtain planning permission for the proposed extension.  It was not possible to include the building project in the 1993 primary schools capital programme because of other demands of a higher priority which had to take precedence.</P>
    <P>At a meeting in the Department in May 1993, the chairman of Knockconan national school, who is also chairman of Deravoy school, submitted an application for a new school to replace the existing one at Knockconan.  The reasons for the application were stated to be: the inadequacy of the existing building, which consists of a two classroom unit built in 1902 and one prefab in need of roof repairs; the inadequacy of the play area; an expectation that future enrolments will remain at a level sufficient to support three teachers, that is a principal and two assistants catering for 60 pupils; and the availability locally of a suitable site for a new school.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that both schools are situated in the same parish and having regard to the demographic trends, it has <Col N="308" /> been decided in the Department to examine the possibility of amalgamating the two schools into a single school and providing the required accommodation as an alternative to proceeding with works to both school buildings.  Pending completion of this examination it would not be possible to say precisely what facilities will be provided for the pupils of the schools in question or to give a time scale for the provision of such facilities.</P>
    <P>A meeting was held locally this week to discuss the future development of the schools in the parish.  Contact will be made with the school managements shortly regarding the outcome of the meeting.  The Senator requested that we would expedite that meeting and I can assure him that we will see to that.  Every effort will be made in the Department to have the matter concluded as speedily as possible.  The Senator will appreciate that we must take fully into consideration the views of the parents in whatever decision might be arrived at.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 February 1994.</P>
