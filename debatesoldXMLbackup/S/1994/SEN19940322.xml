      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to take immediate action to redress the deterioration in postal services in Dublin and countrywide.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposed closure of St. Anne's girls' national school, Milltown, Dublin 6.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to have moneys provided for the Kells by-pass, Kells, County Meath.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cosgrave and Doyle as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Farrelly as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Items 1 and 2; Item 1 is the Committee and all Stages of the Industrial Training (Apprenticeship Levy) Bill, 1993.  Item 2 is the Terms of Employment (Information) Bill, 1993, Second Stage.</P>
      <P>As Members will be aware, the Order of Business has been changed from the original Whips' notice.  That happened before and this was not within the control of the office.  The first Bill we will discuss requires early signature and must be dealt with within the next week.  There are amendments to the Bill so it must go back to the Dáil where it will be dealt with on Thursday before being sent to the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>My party does not agree with today's Order of Business.  I understand why Item 1 must be dealt with today.  However, there should have been notice of the change.  The Department responsible for the legislation should have been aware of that and should have communicated earlier with the Government side of the House.  This is another example of the business of the House being messed about because of a lack of competence and foresight in Departments. It is not good enough.  It is unfair to the Opposition groups.</P>
      <P>Three Items were ordered for today and spokespersons were so informed. Members had made their preparations. At mid-morning yesterday we were informed of the change; some Members of the Opposition only heard of the change today.  It is not only unfair to the Members but also to the Bills which will not receive the scrutiny they deserve. This has not occurred previously in this term and I accept that the Leader of the House is embarrassed about it.  It is not his style of running the business of the House.  Nonetheless, the House cannot be treated in this way and should not be forced to alter its work because of lack of planning and competence in Departments.</P>
      <P>We will oppose the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is entirely unsatisfactory.  It is one matter to change the Order of Business, and I can understand why such a change might be necessary, but I do not understand why it is not done in consultation with the other parties.  I first became aware of the change in the Order of Business at about 11.30 this morning when I telephoned the Government Whip's office.  I was advised that notification had been faxed.  I never received such notification. Given the size of the Progressive Democrat Front Bench, the alteration does not, perhaps, create the same problems it would for other parties.  However, the Leader must accept that this is not the way to order the business of the House. The House decides its business not the Government parties.</P>
      <P>One of the Matters on the Adjournment relates to An Post.  This matter should be fully debated in the House. Perhaps deficiencies in the postal system were the cause of us not being informed of the change in arrangements for today. Communications from this House to our private residences do not reach us in time.  Last week's notification of a sitting day did not arrive to my house until about 12 o'clock on the day of the sitting.  That was not the fault of the staff of the House, but the fault of the postal system and it must be addressed.</P>
      <P>We were given an undertaking that East Timor would be debated today.  It is a very important topic and the need to debate it has been raised by Senator Norris and myself on several occasions. Time was allocated but now this issue will not be debated.  When will it be debated? Will it be discussed before Easter as it should be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Leader allocate time for a debate on Northern Ireland?  Such a debate has been requested several times. It is a matter of urgency and must be discussed.  On the one hand people are using the airwaves to peddle their propaganda; and on the other, when a policeman is killed in front of his pregnant wife at a dog track and when mortars are launched into Heathrow Airport with the potential to cause loss of life, those <Col N="1380" /> people are not accountable on the airwaves. We must discuss that issue in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>According to a report in the newspapers this morning a large sum of sponsorship money has been offered to the GAA &mdash; more power to the GAA, I am delighted it can receive large sums in sponsorship.  The reported sum has since been denied.  However, I noticed that only football and hurling were mentioned; camogie was not receiving anything. Would the Leader discuss this matter with the Minister for Sport and the Minister for Health?  The Irish Ladies Hockey Union has secured the world women's hockey championship for Ireland.  Tens of thousands of overseas visitors will be going to this event in July. The House will be glad to hear that I have no complaint with the Government because it has given it excellent sponsorship.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader ask both the Minister of State with special responsibility for Sport and the Minister for Health to point out to firms that sponsoring women's sport is also worthwhile? An example of this will be the large numbers of tourists who will come to this major event.  Most of the money had to be raised by the Irish Ladies Hockey Union, but it would be good if sponsors looked at sports other than traditional Irish sports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the sentiments expressed by Senator Manning on the Order of Business.  Changing the Order of Business at such short notice is not satisfactory.  The House does order its own business.  However, there are occasions &mdash; it has happened in Governments of which both Senator Manning and I were part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Magner, will you put your question to the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us would like to see a system introduced where one would be dealing largely with <i>ad hocery.</i>  We did not plan this situation; it was outside our control.  The Opposition should accept that in good faith.  We accept its legitimate criticism and concern.  We will respond to that on our side by saying that we will do everything possible to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's statements.  We have tried to have a reasonable relationship with the Leader and the Whip when it comes to conducting business in this House.  However, this situation brings matters to an all time low.  While we welcome Senator Magner's address to Senator Manning, a similar address may be in order to those waiting in the ante-room.</P>
      <P>The change in today's Order of Business has caused much difficulty to Members on this side.  Senator Dardis referred to delays in communication.  A party or group leader deserves better than receiving a fax at 5.15 on a Friday evening.  Contact should have been made by telephone and not by indirect forms of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will oppose the Order of Business. The report on Oireachtas Library facilities, the situation in East Timor and the Developing the West Together report were to be discussed today.  There may be legitimate reasons for taking these new matters, but they did not arise recently.  Maybe the Leader can tell the House the date by which the legislation must be passed, if a motion for earlier <Col N="1382" /> signature is involved.  When does the Leader envisage the introduction of the local government Bill to the House?  In light of a report in a paper yesterday, it appears that more Members of this House may be taking an interest in the matter than they would have a week to ten days ago.</P>
    <P>Finally, I support Senator Dardis' call for a debate on the postal system which has caused great problems both to businesses and individuals in Dublin city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I also oppose the Order of Business.  Nothing Senator Magner could say would change my opinion on this matter.  This is an appalling state of affairs.  Senator Manning may have known about this change at 11 a.m. yesterday but I did not know until 12.45 p.m. today.  I have a telephone in my office and someone could have telephoned me to say that the Order of Business was being changed.</P>
      <P>The delay in sending mail through the system or the delay in An Post may be attributed to the Government parties. Representatives from An Post spoke in my area yesterday.  Senator Magner said it was an edict from the Government and that in order for An Post to become more profitable, people had to be made redundant. That is causing a delay in postal deliveries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I had to respond because of the manner in which this important matter is being dealt with by Government spokespersons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the tourism industry as soon as possible because, according to the newspapers, there will be structural changes in Bord Fáilte and more support for the regions.  We would welcome such a development, but we would like to have a debate prior to this restructuring.  Such a debate is of paramount importance, especially in areas which have not been developed.  We look forward to the changes <Col N="1383" /> in the structure of Bord Fáilte and regional tourism and we would like a debate before these changes take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I received notification about the original Order of Business last Thursday week.  I was going to write to the Leader to congratulate him on his efficiency because it seemed the Government side was getting its act together. However, on Monday morning I discovered things were not as they seemed and that there was a major change to the Order of Business.  When announcing the Order of Business, the Leader said the changes were outside his control and the Order of Business had been changed on other occasions.  I accept that, but this time it is wrong; it is an offence to the House.</P>
      <P>One item on the original Order of Business for today was statements on East Timor.  This matter has been raised continuously. There has been gross abuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of human rights in East Timor.  Tortures and killings are taking place and in one incident more than 200 people were killed.  It is an affront to this House not to debate this issue today as arranged.  I do not know why we cannot debate it because we are prepared to facilitate the Leader and the House to discuss this issue.  When will this debate take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Leader any plans to debate the incidents which took place in Grafton Street on St. Patrick's Day?  Over 40 or 50 arrests were made by members of the Garda Síochána, but only five were detained and charged.  The remainder were released and will be summonsed at a later date.  However, some of these people will never receive summonses because, according to a survey carried out by the gardaí, many summonses are never served.  It is important to debate this issue in this House because it is an affront to the people of Dublin and of Ireland that <Col N="1384" /> a riot should take place in Dublin city especially on St. Patrick's Day when there are so many tourists here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he will have an immediate debate on this issue. Will he, through the Office of the Attorney General, contact the Director of Public Prosecutions to find out why those people were not detained in custody and did not have their offences heard the following morning?  This is a serious matter.  This party believes that people in Dublin should be entitled to enjoy the national day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that what has happened in East Timor is an affront to human rights and time should be made available to discuss the matter.  I ask the Leader to make time available to discuss another heinous affront to human rights, namely, today's decision by Her Majesty's Government to throw further bureaucratic impediments in the way of inquests into the trials of people who were the subject of injudicial murder in the case of the shoot to kill policies in the North of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As we are on the issue of human rights, we should be concerned about the human rights of citizens on all parts of this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that time be made available to discuss the extraordinary situation where, 12 years after official murder was performed on this island, there have still not been inquests.  I ask that we have a debate on that issue to try to assist the families concerned and bring an end to their trauma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put the record straight about the Order of Business for today.  It was three weeks ago today that the Government Whip discussed with me what today's business would be and, at that stage, his difficulty was trying to accommodate Members of the main Opposition party.  He asked me to agree to a particular change on the Order of Business to take the original proposed plan for today.</P>
      <P>I have always called for long term planning, but when I talk about long term planning I do not mean inflexible planning. I recognise the need to change now and again.  I accept the need for changing today's Order of Business, despite the fact that the call for the debate on East Timor came from these benches in the first place and has come from these benches repeatedly over the last five or six years.  It was necessary to do so and it is important that we come back to those issues again, but I never seek good notice of issues on the basis that it might never change.  I accept the Government Whip's good faith in trying to address those serious human rights issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of human rights and equality, I never thought it would be necessary for me in the life of this Government to raise the question of equality and human rights, not 3,000 miles away or even in the northern end of this island but in this town.  It is a disgraceful affront to democracy and to our Constitution, which forbids invidious discrimination, that outside the gate today is a group of blind workers seeking equality with sighted workers.  It is extraordinary that in this day and age that <Col N="1386" /> matter should have to be raised by any elected public representative.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House should take on board the consideration that people suffering from disability and handicap deserve our support at all times.  They should not be required to take such a stand and I ask that this matter be raised immediately with the Minister for Health or, failing that, it should be raised as a matter for debate in this House.  It is not good enough that people should have to fight for equality on the basis of their being unsighted or suffering some disability or handicap.  It is an untenable position for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss the ongoing problem for VHI members.  There are 1.3 million people who are not well enough informed about exactly how much they must pay for consultants.  A third of all consultants will not now take part in the VHI scheme when it comes to patients' costs.</P>
      <P>A serious situation exists in the Southern Health Board area; two floors of the regional hospital in Cork have been given to private consultants.  Neither the Department of Health nor the health board can say what is the cost of one of these beds.  That is a serious matter because we are talking about public beds.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Garda and the Defence Forces on the arms find in Sligo this morning.  When one considers the size of the find and the death and destruction which could have accrued they deserve praise.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader if time can be made available to discuss Somalia.  The Americans are now pulling out and we must be concerned for our Defence Forces and their families.  There should be a debate on this matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Leader on numerous occasions to make arrangements for a debate on drug abuse. It appears there is no great urgency about doing so at present but I ask him to ask the Minister for Justice to ensure cooperation between customs officers and the Garda.</P>
      <P>We all welcome the seizures of large amounts of drugs by customs officers. However there has been a suggestion in recent days that because of premature intervention by customs officers in seizing pornographic and paedophilic videos, the gardaí will not be able to bring charges and no one will be brought to account and I fear the same may happen in some of the large drug seizures.  I ask the Leader to ensure a co-ordinated and cooperative approach by both bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that difficulties arose on today's Order of Business. However, there are few Senators on any side of the House who have not been accommodated in debates, legislation, Private Members' time or their own concerns over the years.  We on this side of the House have always endeavoured to accommodate Senators where possible.  It has happened on this occasion that the position is reversed and we are asking the other side of the House to accommodate our request to change the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>East Timor will be debated next week.  To answer the question from Senator Burke, we will be sitting next week and we will be dealing with that subject and many others.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry that women's international sporting events should be highlighted as much as men's events.  The Minister and the Government should be congratulated for the money given to the world hockey championship. It will be a tremendous event and, having seen the facilities which will be provided, I know it will be of the highest international standard.  The GAA Congress is being held at Easter weekend and the Senator will be able to make her views known to the general secretary, Mr. Mulvihill.</P>
      <P>We will take the local government Bill before the summer as the Minister announced yesterday.  I am sure there will be a lively debate on the issues in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The House as a whole would welcome a debate on tourism and Senator McGowan can be assured there will be one in the next session.</P>
      <P>Many other issues were raised by Senator O'Toole, Senator Roche, Senator Maloney and Senator McGennis.  I assure them that the Ministers involved are well aware of our concerns and our desire to have a debate on those issues.  It is a matter of fitting such debates into the Order of Business and we hope to do so between now and the summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>During Report Stage in the Dáil I accepted an amendment from Deputy Quill, which is now section 3 (1) (b).  I pointed out to Deputy Quill that I was partial to what she put forward and that I would accept her amendment, but that the wording would be subject to change in the light of views expressed by the parliamentary draftsperson.</P>
      <P>I accepted the amendment on the floor of the House without putting it to the draftsman for any textual changes which would be needed.  Deputy Quill graciously agreed that it would be subject to such scrutiny.  I have since received the advice of the parliamentary draftsman and a number of changes are necessary. The officials in my Department went back to Deputy Quill with these changes and she agreed they were in line with the thrust of her amendment.  I say this in case the House thinks I am trying to pull a fast one on what Deputy Quill had proposed in the Dáil.  These amendments do not detract from the thrust of Deputy Quill's proposal and she has agreed to them.  They are necessary to ensure the wording is legally correct.  It was necessary to change the preamble to the subsection as the original wording suggested that the factors outlined in paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) would have to reflected in any designated sector.  This would not be possible and is not what Deputy Quill sought.  My amendment, which provides for what she advocated, proposes that the Minister of the day will consider the various factors in paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) and, where appropriate, take them into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further amendment deals with the emerging needs of women.  I have been advised that this cannot be provided for in law.  I have, therefore, produced an alternative form of word to signal that the potential for recruitment of men and women will be considered.  The revised wording in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) reflects in legal language the terms Deputy Quill sought in relation to new <Col N="1392" /> and emerging areas of industrial activity and the potential for gaining multiple skills.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn's amendment also deals with this.  He proposes that the scope of apprenticeships be extended to the widest practicable range of industrial activities.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, I am considering the development of a traineeship system &mdash; I know the Senator does not have any difficulties with this terminology &mdash; which will be similar to, but more flexible than, apprenticeship training.  This new system will introduce training and certification into a whole series of work activities, for example, retail sales.  I know in his retail outlets Senator Quinn has already engaged in this process, as have other retail outlets in sectors other than the grocery and allied trades.  I am having talks with people in these trades.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; means a period during which one learns a trade. Apprenticeships in Ireland have been linked to physical trades, such as plumbing, baking and candlestick making. These are fine trades which have been, and will always be, needed.  I want to extend the system to wider areas, such as banking, retail sales, hairdressing and other activities.  If I called this scheme an apprenticeship one, I fear it would be linked to a great deal of bureaucratic arrangements, which I want to simplify. I will call them traineeships but they will be in the spirit of what Senator Quinn proposes.  Where appropriate, the new apprenticeship/traineeship system will be developed in new areas of industrial activity.  In this connection, subsection (ii) of my amendment provides that before making an order designating a sector for the purposes of the levy, the Minister shall have to consider whether the sector to be designated is a new or developing area of industrial activity.</P>
    <P>I feel &mdash; and I hope Senator Quinn and the House will agree &mdash; that in this amendment we have managed to the best of our ability to put the thrust of Deputy Quill's amendment into the form proposed by the parliamentary draftsman. <Col N="1393" /> We explained this to her and she agrees with it.</P>
    <P>Second, the thrust of Senator Quinn's amendment has been encompassed in subsection (2).  His amendment expands this idea into new and emerging needs, and I agree with him.  Our young people need authoritative certification which can be verified and will be a passport, at home and abroad, for them to ply their business or trade.  This is the purpose of this legislation but also the wider remit of the national certification in education and training which will be a matter for discussion on another day.  I would like to think that what I have put forward here encompasses the views of Deputy Quill and Senator Quinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taking a long way of saying that based on what the Minister said I would consider withdrawing the amendment.  I was making two points in the amendment which I was anxious the Minister would understand &mdash; not just extending the scope of the apprenticeship approach but it being a matter of <Col N="1394" />&ldquo;urgency&rdquo;.  The Minister would probably have some difficulty accepting the word &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; in legislation but it is necessary to reflect the urgency in the legislation as well as the broadening of the scope.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the value to young people of a certificate which says they have served their time in an apprenticeship or have achieved a certain level of training, especially when they leave Ireland.  The scope of the apprenticeship approach needs to be widened a great deal and I am happy to accept the Minister's words.  I have not yet heard her views on the second aspect of my amendment which deals with urgency.  If she could put my mind at rest on that I would consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on speedily acknowledging that there may be a fear about the narrow definition of &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo;.  She said that we must extend the scope of what apprenticeship means.  We must take into account not alone training in the craft but the wide ranging skills required so that these people will be ready to deal with all aspects of skills and technological changes when they are working at home or abroad.  The Minister is aware of that and has intimated that she will acknowledge the urgency of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In extending the scope, does the Minister envisage discussing this matter with FÁS, the employers, etc., and returning to the situation where a far greater number of people and companies are involved in taking on apprentices?  I mentioned local authorities on Second Stage.  I have details of a proposal that would, in real terms, lift the hearts of many young people around this country, in the cities and areas of high unemployment. At no real cost to the State, it would provide the opportunity for people from different areas, at different stages of their apprenticeships, to get involved in building a small number of local authority houses.  Many people who have completed two or three years of their apprenticeship have been unable to find <Col N="1395" /> further work to enable them to finish.  I suggest that the Minister will enter into negotiations because this is an opportunity to give hope to thousands of young people who do not have any at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for his positive approach towards wider designation.  He asked me to show my <i>bona fides</i> in relation to the words &ldquo;proactive&rdquo; and &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; which are used in his amendment.  It is easy for me to show my personal <i>bona fides</i>, and I do so gladly and willingly.  I am inclined to be proactive and urgent about many things but I am not always able to bring everybody with me.  Some of the answers to Senator Quinn will also be relevant to remarks made by Senator Farrelly and Senator Ormonde today and on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>What have we done to engage people in wider discussion about involving more young people in trades?  In preparation for the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> our section of the Department proposed that a wider designation of trades be included in the programme. The officials with me today were very active in that area.  The words &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; and &ldquo;proactive&rdquo; are not in the programme but it does provide that there is to be a wider designation of trades.  We have again received word from Europe that they are keen on our standards based apprenticeship system.  They also asked when we are going to implement the rest of it and provide for wider designation. There is an imperative both at home and abroad that we do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the next phase of our talks with IBEC, ICTU and CIF, we are arranging a series of meetings with Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the county councils, Bord na Móna, the ESB, the Defence Forces and the Naval Forces, areas which deal with apprenticeships.  I will ask them to a meeting in my Department and put it to them that not taking on apprentices represents a loss to the country and to their organisations.  Following on from the positive remarks made, in particular by Senator Farrelly in that regard, we <Col N="1396" /> have taken this step with the county councils and a number of other organisations.</P>
    <P>To return to Senator Quinn's point, it would be difficult to provide for urgency and proactivity in legislation.  I am, however, both urgent and proactive about this.  There may be others who do not feel the same way but I am pursuing the remit of my job, which is to move forward on this standards based apprenticeship/traineeship.  I am prepared to come back to the House and report progress.  I suggest that we mark time for three months or until early autumn to see what progress we have made in the area of apprenticeships.  I would then be able to give an account of myself and the scheme.  I thank Senator Ormonde for her positive remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to say that I am withdrawing the amendment to amendment No. 1 on the grounds that the Minister has assured me of her personal commitment.  I hope that by stitching this into the record of the House as the Minister has done we will also ensure that this principle will be passed on to future Ministers, although I am sure the Minister will hold her present office for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the bringing together of all these people and the county councils, the Minister must have clear in her mind where the councils can actually employ apprentices.  Many councils are not directly involved in building their own houses at the moment.  The building of these houses is out on contract. We are aware of many qualified tradesmen who are unemployed and who could be employed training apprentices on sites.  Houses will be built on several sites in my own county this year.  Meath this year will provide 90 new starts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An apprenticeship system taking about two to three months longer to complete the houses, employing 60 apprentices in total, could look after 30 houses, one third of the number of houses being built. If that was applied across the country it would amount to 3,000.  This is realistic; it is not a figure pulled out of the sky.  It <Col N="1397" /> can work by having one scheme in each county and a number in the cities and by asking the councils involved to zone in on the areas where there are huge numbers of young people unemployed who want an opportunity to do something positive.  The councils do not have any idea at this stage about going down this road.  The Minister has to lead them in that direction.  That is the only comment I wish to make.  Ask the county councils to examine this proposal to see how it would work in each county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>At a meeting with CIF we got a similar proposal into the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> It will be under review.  The possibility of making it a term of public sector construction contracts that an agreed number of apprentices should be employed on such contracts will now be examined by the Government in consultation with the relevant interests.  I intend to make that the agenda for the county councils and all the other agencies I bring in.  I hope to work on that, but I realise that I will be told that people do not have the money and do not have the opportunities.</P>

      <P>Amendment to amendment No. 1 not moved.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  ensure that under the proposed apprenticeship arrangements for the designated trade, all suitably qualified applicants will have an equal chance of obtaining a place on an apprenticeship, decided against <Col N="1398" /> criteria which are clearly set out and available for public inspection.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We know what the position is with FÁS: they are put on a list and employers arrive asking for somebody.  They get an opportunity to look at the list, they say that no one on the list is suitable and then they go outside and pick somebody; or they come into FÁS and say they have someone picked without looking at the list. There is a problem here.  Could we have a situation where FÁS would not be blamed for not being forthright with builders and other interested people who are looking for apprentices?  They could have interviews carried out, with shortlists of suitable people in each category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is talking about FÁS?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, asking FÁS to do this, so that when a person arrives to the office looking for somebody, the FÁS officer would have interviewed and short-listed the most suitable people concerned. I wonder whether the amendment could be accepted so that we might ensure that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip and eliminate the situation where the employer arrives with the name of a person who is not on the list but who is placed on the list and is then taken on by that employer.  This is an opportunity to try to ensure that this practice ceases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I touched on this area on Second Stage.  The Minister acknowledged that perhaps there is a role here for the guidance counsellor.  We can play a very big role in co-operation between the school and the employer.  Most young people are aged 16 when they begin apprenticeships, so they are coming from the school system.  Therefore, if they are to go into FÁS they cannot just walk out of school without some guidance as to where they should go in order to get an apprenticeship.  The employer can go to FÁS, but FÁS has got the information through us as guidance counsellors, through the educational system.  FÁS are <Col N="1399" /> not needed to that extent; employers can go directly to the schools, as apprentices begin training at 16.</P>
      <P>Guidance counsellors can play a role with the employer.  FÁS should have a role in the recruitment possibilities for this age group because we are talking about training and apprenticeships.  Perhaps there is a looseness there.  I know the Minister referred to it in her reply the last day and Senator Farrelly is touching on it again, so the Minister knows what we are getting at in relation to that looseness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms Senator Farrelly's amendment deals with the problem of equity in the recruitment of apprentices.  During the course of the Second Stage debate on this Bill in this House I dealt in some detail with my concerns about the issue of equity.  I outlined how I intended to approach the problem.  We have already introduced certain measures in that regard.  In their response most Senators expressed similar concerns; indeed everyone who spoke expressed concerns about the non-transparency and the perceived inequity of access to apprenticeships and agreed that something needed to be done.  Rather than go through the entire debate again I would like briefly to outline what we now intend to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill will enable the Minister of the day to make regulations governing the recruitment of apprentices to ensure that such recruitment is undertaken in a fair and equitable manner. Section 4 (2) provides that a resolution approved by both Houses will be necessary before the regulations can be introduced; accordingly, Senators would have the opportunity at that time to discuss those proposed regulations.  This is all new.  This was not in the Bill or in the system of access to apprenticeship.  At this stage, however, we intend to develop and operate over a trial period of two years a code of practice to be followed by employers in the recruitment of apprentices.  The code has been developed and has already come before <Col N="1400" /> the board of FÁS.  It is now being discussed by the major social partners involved in the apprenticeship sphere, following which they would adopt, endorse and promote the code among their members.</P>
    <P>The new <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will ensure that the social partners would be committed to the adoption to this code of practice as it is enunciated in the programme.  I recognise quite clearly that there is a degree of doubt and scepticism when one talks about codes of practice.  I found this myself when I was dealing with the Consumer Credit Bill because the finance houses said they have a regulatory body looking after their own activities.  I said to them: &ldquo;Well, tell me another&rdquo;, &ldquo;You would, wouldn't you?&rdquo; or words to that effect.</P>

      <P>Self-regulation goes back to the Latin tag, <i>Quis custodiat custodies</i>? Who guards the guards?  Of course, in self-regulation that is the answer one gets.  Even though public money is going into the apprenticeship system via Europe and the Exchequer and private money from employers, it is still an individual contract between an employer and an employee.  How far you can go down the road of interference in that is something that I am going to test out by having this voluntary code of practice whose implementation will be endorsed and monitored by the central review committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deference to the concerns expressed by the social partners about the compulsory route, I am prepared to give the code a trial period.  In dealing with IBEC, the CIF and ICTU, I have received a measure of positive reaction to the voluntary code, though it took some time. I would hope that the debates in the Lower House and in this House would be mandatory reading for every member of the FÁS board and the apprenticeship sub-committee of FÁS.  I really mean that, because when I set out to bring sense and shape into this system there <Col N="1401" /> were many who said that we could not even go down the road of a voluntary code of practice.  I am glad to think that now we have brought it around a bit.  The compulsory approach remains a possibility if over a trial period the code is not seen to be effective.  In conjunction with the central review committee I will be monitoring this very carefully and if we are not convinced that it is working I will have no hesitation whatsoever in introducing appropriate regulations to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on what Senator Ormonde said about the need to involve career guidance counsellors.  As part of a wider consultation I am going to meet the official group representing the guidance counsellors.  Senator Ormonde said, perhaps inadvertently, that FÁS would not have to be involved to the degree that they are.  FÁS has the statutory responsibility, endorsed by both Houses, of being the agency with responsibility for career guidance, following advice from other agencies, including the Department of Education. Much as other agencies or organisations might request that it would be otherwise, this is and will remain the case.  In general, FÁS has a fine, open approach to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly's amendment states that:</P>
    <P>.....all suitably qualified applicants will have an equal chance of obtaining a place on an apprenticeship, decided against criteria which are clearly set out and available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>The voluntary code of practice will be set out clearly.  I would have reservations about making people available for public inspection &mdash; by that I mean individuals and their circumstances.  I do not think that would be correct and that is why I have queried the words &ldquo;public inspection&rdquo;. I think, however, that Senator Farrelly meant the criteria which would be involved in such access and I share that viewpoint.  FÁS will have lists of those that present themselves.  Because it is an employment contract there has to be some involvement by the social partners <Col N="1402" />&mdash; the employer and employee &mdash; in it. That is recognised in the board of FÁS and its apprenticeship sub-committee. We are going to put the voluntary code of practice in place and I would like to see that avenue work satisfactorily.  We will regularly monitor and evaluate how it is working.  If it is found to be unsuitable we will take the legislative route of compulsion. I want to give the voluntary code a chance in deference to the current spirit of agreement on this matter.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister has gone some way down the road and a voluntary code of practice is certainly a help.  The point I raised, however, was in connection with FÁS being given a new role to set up interviews.  Will that be part of a code of practice the Minister would ask FÁS to follow?  I raise the point to ensure that people would not put their name on a FÁS list and then not be heard of again.  FÁS staff are not to blame for that, it is the volume of people.  They are busy dealing with the day to day demands of people looking for staff.  However, I would like to know if within the voluntary code of practice people will be interviewed and short-listed as being eligible for a particular job or company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public inspection aspect in the amendment was not meant for the mass public.  It would be there for the benefit of the employer so that when people have been interviewed they are found to be suitable for a job.  I am not pressing the amendment.  We will go down the road on the basis of a voluntary code of practice and I would hope that the views expressed by Members will be taken into consideration.  We will have the opportunity of reviewing it in a short period of time to see how it is working.  I am sure we will develop a situation so that when people go to FÁS they will not be left on a shelf.  Somebody should contact them and interview them for the area of work they are interested in.  After that they should be interviewed by an employer. The problem is that everyone is on the same list and there is no way an employer can interview everybody.  This is where we have been failing.  We should improve <Col N="1403" /> the situation so that people feel it is worthwhile taking this route.  Every apprentice is not going to be taken on on the first day they are interviewed.  That is a fact of life, but they are gaining experience of interviews and feel that they are that little bit more important as a result.  It is better than just leaving their names on a list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points the Senator has made.  I did not get an opportunity of reading it into the record on Second Stage, but this is how we envisage the situation.  The board of FÁS has accepted our proposal that a number of applicants should be sought for each apprenticeship vacancy, thus providing a range of possible candidates.  There are lists from which a choice can be made.  It is stipulated (1) that advertising should be public and on a scale which will attract an appropriate number of applicants; (2) that advertisements should confirm that the employer supports equal opportunity and should include a statement that canvassing will disqualify; and (3) that the FÁS employment service can provide employers with lists of applicants who have advised FÁS of their interest. Senator Farrelly's point that FÁS should have the lists is included in the code of practice.</P>
      <P>I accept the point that was made about young people who put down their names and declare their interest in being, for example, a plumber and who never hear anything further about it from anybody in that sector.  It is soul destroying.  A teenager at 16, 17 and 18 years of age is bright and he or she thinks the world is ahead of him and her.  It is.  However, it is defeatist when that young person never hears again about that job.  FÁS, it must be said, is swamped by the numbers. Although the number of vacancies is limited, people would feel better if they were allocated fairly.  It would, at least, lessen the feelings of angst.  We hope the voluntary code of practice will do this.  I will encourage FÁS in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lists are a good idea.  They were mentioned by Senator Ormonde on Second <Col N="1404" /> Stage and Deputy de Valera mentioned them in the Dáil.  It is a fair system.  We have included it in our options for the voluntary code of practice for FÁS. Employers and FÁS should ensure that young people will be answered when they apply.  It is soul destroying to receive no response.  When a young person writes a letter seeking information on or consideration for apprenticeships, the letter is of great importance to that person and it deserves a response.  The list system, which was central to Senator Farrelly's remarks, will be part of the voluntary code.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 3, as amended, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Nothing in subsection (1) shall be construed so as to prevent a recruitment practice that is intended to achieve a better gender balance in the intake of apprentices to any designated industrial activity.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to section 4, which states that &ldquo;such recruitment is carried out in an equitable and fair manner&rdquo;.  The thrust of this section is to require fairness and equity in recruiting apprentices.  We all accept that it is a major issue.  Apprenticeships must be open to everybody.  I am concerned that in legislating for such fairness and openness, we may inadvertently make illegal something that is a sensible course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is a lack of gender balance in many occupations.  Women are woefully under-represented in some occupations, although technically those occupations may be open to them.  In general we should seek to achieve a gender balance in most occupations.  To do so it may be sensible for FÁS to encourage applications from women for <Col N="1405" /> particular apprenticeship schemes and to allocate a number of places specifically for women to ensure that there is representation from both sexes.  Such encouragement might be illegal under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not making a case for positive discrimination.  However, we should not inadvertently make it illegal.  We can have the intent of fairness and equity, as outlined in this section, and ensure through this amendment that positive encouragement of women applicants is not outlawed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's comments.  Although we should not necessarily have a quota of female apprenticeships, there should be positive thinking on the matter without calling it positive discrimination.  I would go a step further.  Although I may sound like a broken record, I must mention education again.  The problem arises in that area to a certain extent.  We must encourage the person to go for the apprenticeships.  The parents must be educated that the apprenticeships are available.  They should be given a positive philosophy about trades, educated that such apprenticeships may provide opportunities for girls, that girls will have no difficulty in serving those apprenticeships and that if girls apply to FÁS they will be received in the same way as boys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must face up to the way people think about this issue.  It is one matter to instruct FÁS about it.  However, we must take a broader strategy.  We must involve the community because the attitude starts there.  I can give an example of that.  Last year I asked an employer to take on a student apprentice.  As he knew me well he agreed to do so.  The student was female; but I did not mention that but told him I would send the student to see him.  When she arrived all hell broke loose because the employer maintained that he would not take on a female student.  I had to talk the matter through with him before he accepted it.  We must educate people that apprenticeships are available to every student.  Saying male or female implies discrimination and division. <Col N="1406" /> We must say that all students of 16 years of age can seek apprenticeships. That is the positive approach.  The Minister should approach it in that way also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not apply to health boards.  However, it reminds me of the recruitment of students for nursing.  In one health board area about 18 or 20 students were taken on in two training areas each year.  If 18 students were recruited, 17 of them were females and one was male.  It was the same in the following year.  The gender balance also works against men.  I am sure the Minister will address that matter.</P>

      <P>We are a group, not a club.  We are not allowed to have sexist clubs.  Did the Senator not know that the Minister responsible for the legislation is a member of his party?  The Senator's point is fair and I cannot quibble with it.  I am glad that one gentleman was accepted on each occasion.  The world is mightily unbalanced in all spheres of activity.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde impressed me when she said that speaking of &ldquo;male or female&rdquo; polarises the issue.  It implies confrontation.  In the course of visits to Senator Maloney's county and others I was brought to see factories involved in sheet metal fabrication or carpentry or other trades.  The local FÁS representative would introduce the apprentices of whom one would be a girl while the remainder were boys.  He would make a point of introducing the girl to me.  Young women do not like that.  Yesterday the same thing occurred and I said to the young woman concerned &ldquo;I know you hate this as much as I do&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, she said, &ldquo;I do not like being pointed out as an oddity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> Most women want to be there as of right not because they are different. Many young women have told me on other occasions that while they get on well with their male peers, they are different. Women often have to muscle into conversations between their male colleagues. It is a wider issue and it is difficult to encompass it.  It was said on Second Stage that this widening of the designated traineeships/apprenticeships will bring more than the butcher, the baker and the candlestick-maker into the situation.  It will mean employing many more women.</P>
    <P>I understand the thrust behind the amendment suggested by Senator Quinn which seeks to be preventative so that the equity we seek for all will not obstruct the gender balance equity. However, I would be hesitant to deal with the issue of gender balance in a section which is designed to ensure equity of recruitment for all.  As I have already stated on a number of occasions, I am conscious of the need to deal with the general problem of equity in apprenticeship recruitment and I decided to introduce section 4 into the Bill to enable the Minister of the day to make regulations which would provide for general equity in the recruitment of apprentices and such regulations will be in the code of practice, etc.</P>
    <P>I have also made it clear that I am conscious of the need to create more apprenticeship/traineeship opportunities for women.  FÁS provides a bursary system.  This is positive discrimination &mdash; I do not know whether this is legal or right &mdash; where each eligible employer who recruits a female apprentice will receive an extra total grant of £2,400. Employers do not seem to realise that this covers the whole period of their apprenticeship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the other cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information here but employers get an extra sum if they take on a female apprentice <Col N="1408" /> yet they still seem to be slow to do it.  There are still cases where people like Senator Ormonde have to nudge the employer's elbow.  In addition, there are pre-apprenticeship training courses available for women.  I saw a good example in Shannon Aerospace.  Women in hitherto male preserves of apprenticeships are brought together to work through issues, such as isolation, being different, peer pressure, etc.  That is the preparatory ground for the rough terrain ahead for women in the physical trades.  I am not saying they cannot do these jobs, but this is perceived by some to be the case.</P>
      <P>I am confident the code of practice on recruitment will result in an increase in the number of females who will qualify under the apprenticeship system.  Equity in the code of practice means equity of access.  If this equity is followed through correctly, as I hope it will, then both women and men will make the grade on merit because the results will be based on list suitability, qualifications and interviews. This will bring in its wake the gender equity Senator Quinn wishes in his amendment.</P>
      <P>Having due regard to the main objective of the code, which is to get the best qualified person for the job, we will also promote the recruitment of persons from groups which have traditionally been under-represented.  Like Senator Quinn, I am trying to ride two horses, a difficult feat.  Places will be apportioned correctly and fairly and there will be public scrutiny in the terms of which Senator Farrelly spoke.  That is a good principle we have tried to incorporate in the code of practice and if it does not work, it will be done through compulsory measures.  If we seek to have within that provision a tighter code of gender balance equity, will we upset the wider equity of which I speak?  In encouraging FÁS in giving this bursary of £2,400 if a company takes on a woman over her period of apprenticeship, am I doing this?  FÁS has gone as far as it could, both statutorily and legally, within the code.  This opens up the wider issues of quotas and list systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> The British Labour Party recently drew up a list system for the next general election where certain constituencies can only put women forward as candidates.  I think that strategy is unwise.  One will then start to think that women will only have a chance if such provisions are in place.  If we want broad equity of access, it should be fair.  Will those getting apprenticeships at great expense to the EU, the Government, our people and employers, get them on merit?  We would say yes.  However, if one distorts that broader equity into providing tighter legislation to ensure more females are employed &mdash; and there is a need for this &mdash; is one obtruding on the wider debate? I know Senator Quinn is trying to anticipate and prevent this issue from being lost within the wider debate.  I was currently examining a traineeship model which will be similar to, but more flexible than, the apprenticeship training scheme which will be applied to a series of different areas that currently employ more women, such as Senator Quinn's own business, banking etc.  Proper training and certification will be available which will encourage and assist progression &mdash; I hope a ladder of progression &mdash; through that system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to convince the Minister of what I am trying to say in this amendment.  It states: &ldquo;Nothing...shall be construed so as to prevent a recruitment practice&rdquo;.  The less legislation in many of these areas the better.  If we are to encourage employers to take on apprentices, we should not force their hand by introducing so many tight, constrained and narrow paths.  Taking that into account the amendment says &ldquo;Nothing... shall be construed so as to prevent a recruitment policy that is intended to achieve a better gender balance...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall a court case in America last year.  A university in Los Angeles recognised they had almost no black students applying for medicine.  They decided to allocate a small proportion of the student intake &mdash; 10 per cent &mdash; to black people. No one could disagree with that but a <Col N="1410" /> white man who was placed 91st was not allowed in because of this guarantee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He took the university to court and won his case.  He claimed the decision to allocate a certain number of places to black people meant he was being discriminated against on racial grounds.  I will not go into the details of the case, but allocating 10 per cent of places to black people seemed fair and equitable at the time and the university and the population in the city thought likewise.  However, they had not realised that by doing so they were being unfair to the person who was placed 91st.</P>
      <P>Nothing we do in this legislation should prevent some effort being made by FÁS or an employer to get a fair gender balance. My amendment seeks to prevent such an imbalance.  It could be accepted because it states that &ldquo;nothing in subsection (1) shall be construed so as to prevent a recruitment practice that is intended to achieve a better gender balance in the intake of apprentices.&rdquo;.  If the Minister thinks about this she will be able to accept it because it does not force the hand of people nor does it make it more difficult for an employer to take on future apprentices.</P>

      <P>During the Second Stage debate I asked the Minister how she would ensure that a percentage of women would be recruited as apprentices.  When we pass this legislation there is no guarantee that what happened in Senator Ormonde's case with the employer will not happen again.  The Minister told us today that an extra £2,400 has been made available for the employer who recruits a female apprentice.  How many employers know about this?  I did not know about it until today.  Employers must be made aware of this incentive.</P>
      <P>I agree with the amendment, but it seems it will not be accepted by the Minister. There is no guarantee that extra females will be taken on as apprentices unless we do something about it and this is part of the legislation.  I will evaluate the overall scheme and what should be done in this area when I discuss my own amendment.</P>
      <P>We have failed to make people aware of what is available and part of the blame rests with the bodies concerned.  The Minister made an interesting point about a visit to an area where one person was singled out because she was a lady.  That is sad because nothing would have been said if four or five ladies had been employed.  We have failed to sell the message that both genders are capable of doing the job and employers have not accepted that fact.  People must be educated in this area.  We must ensure that the debate in both Houses conveys that message to employers.</P>

The chairman of FÁS, Mr. Chris Kirwan, and I toured some of the centres and IBEC was told about the scheme.  I take the Senator's point that I, the agencies and the employers have not talked enough about it.  How many employers know that IBEC is representative of employers throughout the country?

The officials of the Department discussed each amendment with the parliamentary draftsman.  We were advised by the parliamentary draftsman that we could not legally include Senator Quinn's requirements in legislation.  In the draft voluntary code to FÁS, which has been discussed and is now being agreed, the last paragraph states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this code of practice [which was the overall code of equity] shall be construed as preventing employers taking appropriate steps to achieve equality of opportunity in recruitment by positively promoting the recruitment of persons from groups which have traditionally been under-represented in apprenticeship.</P>
      <P>That mirrors what Senator Quinn has put forward.  All that we have included in the draft voluntary code will take the compulsory route if the voluntary code does not work.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a)  A procedure of evaluation of the operation of the apprenticeship programme shall be established and carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute, which shall, <i>inter alia</i>, report on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> (i)  the equity of entry to apprenticeships,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the balance between numbers of new apprentices taken on and employment opportunities for which there are not already trained workers,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the responsiveness of the programme to changing training needs, such as the need for multiskilling,</P>
    <P>(iv)  the effectiveness and the methods of certification of standards achieved,</P>
    <P>(v)  the success of training when measured against the best international standards.</P>
    <P>(b)  Each year the ESRI shall report progress made against the annual performance targets set by An Foras.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to all these schemes and legislation in which the Oireachtas is involved an evaluation is long overdue.  This week we have had the report of the Committee of Public Accounts on a particular development in Clare and it proves forcefully that we should have an evaluation of this scheme and the operation of apprenticeships.  It is easy when a scheme is launched to announce that there will be 4,000, 5,000 or 10,000 places available for apprentices.  Ministers do it and, I am sure, will continue to do so.  They may all be taken on but nobody ever knows the number of apprentices who finish; maybe the relevant officials of FÁS would know.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the number of young people who have two or three years done and have no opportunity to finish their course.  That stems from our not having had an evaluation of the workings of apprenticeship schemes.  Now is the time that we should evaluate, within reason, after one year how the different schemes are working and how the proposals in this legislation will work.  We all hope that the changes made will improve the overall position for the apprentices and for the applicants for apprenticeships, will give them more of a say <Col N="1415" /> and ensure that when they apply they will feel that they will be looked after by the officials as best they can.  We should also have an evaluation of the balance between the number of apprentices taken on and employment opportunities for which there are not already trained workers.  We should evaluate all aspects of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Returning to the point I made earlier about the councils getting involved, there is no point in their getting involved in the scheme if we do not evaluate at the end of a year or two years how successful it is, whether it can be improved and how successful it will be.  There will be major successes in areas once the scope is expanded and an opportunity is given for an increased number of apprentices.</P>
    <P>A greater number of school leavers were trained from my generation compared with the small number who are being trained at present from the same schools, from classes which are, perhaps, in most cases larger.  A smaller number is being trained and we do not really know how successful the classes of 1993 or 1994 have been.  In order to do our job properly we must have an evaluation of the position on a yearly basis and make the report available for debate.  I believe the Minister gave a commitment in the other House that she would make the information available.</P>

It would give us a say and a commitment to ensuring that we do not pass this legislation and hear no more about it for five or seven years or more.  However, as the Minister said in the Dáil, she did not expect to be around in 20 years, at least perhaps not in the same position.</P>

The FÁS officials who will be in charge of this scheme will have a greater urgency about it if they have targets to ensure the success of the scheme if it is to be discussed at the end of the year to see how we can make improvements.  I have no doubt that some areas of the country will outshine others.  Let us bring the benefit of the areas which will be successful to the other areas around the country.  I hope the Minister will consider some of my points and my amendment. It will improve the legislation and give us the opportunity to review the matter in whatever timescale the Minister might consider feasible &mdash; I would not insist on a year.</P>

      <P>I listened attentively to Senator Farrelly's contribution and I go along with the broad concept that we must have a follow up on our schemes, in the context of equity of recruitment and whether the number of apprentices will match the number of jobs available afterwards.  I agree also that we have to take into account the technological changes which are taking place, the standards required and the certification which is being put in place.</P>
      <P>I am allergic to bringing in another new body to assess this.  FÁS should give the feedback on all of this.  It is working on the scheme in terms of the recruitment, the number of apprenticeships and the number of apprentices who qualify.  FÁS is in a position to say at the end of the four year apprenticeship how many will get jobs and how many will be waiting for jobs.  It is also in a position to know whether today's technological needs relate to the apprenticeship scheme and whether we match up to international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bringing in another body to do this assessment is an indication that we are becoming &ldquo;committee-ited&rdquo;.  We should <Col N="1417" /> keep it tight, keep it within the bodies working on it, and if we cannot do so I would fault FÁS, the educational system and the employers.  They are dealing with apprenticeship.  We also have the National Educational Certification and Training Board and the various new bodies which are there to assess certification. They can be included. However, I disagree that we should bring in the ESRI to monitor the overall assessment of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I would not like to think that at the end of the day, when we are all exhausted from our contributions, that we would walk away and that this would be put on the shelf.  If that is the case in 12 months' time I will eat my words.  I do not want that to be the case.  We should give the responsibility to FÁS which should be able to carry out the relevant assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points in support of Senator Farrelly's amendment. The first point echoes that made by the Minister earlier: who is to guard the guards?  We need someone to evaluate and that person or body must be outside FÁS.  The second point is that what gets measured gets done.  That is true in all aspects of life, all structures and all businesses. If it is possible to find some way to evaluate the quality of the work done by FÁS, it should not be FÁS who does so.  I do not have the answer but I support the concept behind the Senator's amendment. The Minister might respond to the concerns expressed in it.</P>

      <P>There is great sense and merit in the amendment.  I will go through the five points in it and in so doing I will outline what has been done and what needs to be done.  First is the equity of entry to apprenticeship.  We have had much debate on that point in relation to the voluntary code of practice. In the end there was agreement in the House to adopt the voluntary code, evaluate how it fares and impose a compulsory code if it does not work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator. The second point refers to the balance between numbers of new apprentices taken on and employment opportunities for which there are not already trained workers.  The Senator is raising the matter of forecasting available opportunities and whether the work force will be able to take such opportunities.  This is a good point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If one followed that path one might limit access to BA degrees or prevent people becoming doctors or vets.  To a certain extent we limit access to colleges because if we did not there might be more people in a course than could fit in an auditorium.  For the most part, however, the number of BA graduates is limited only by the number that can fit into the universities or for tutorial purposes.</P>
      <P>We do not seek to match people to available courses because we must bear in mind the wider world and that we are Europeans.  I would prefer to see young people having a dowry, meaning a skill. If that person has unfortunately to go away to get a job one would hope he or she would come back having had the training enhanced.  We should try to have as many people as possible with skills.  If we are broadening other areas of traineeship or apprenticeship we should not limit people to what may be available.</P>
      <P>From time to time I find the economic forecasts to be academic twaddle.  What they say will happen often does not happen.  I was in the Department of Education for five years and at different times I was told the numbers would be down, or would be up, or that there would be increases in a given place.  In the end my commonsense taught me a good deal. Forecasts of what might be available in job opportunities may not be precise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have had experience of daggers in my back but I hope that time has passed.</P>
      <P>The third point in the amendment relates to the responsiveness of programmes to changing training needs, such as the need for multi-skilling.  That was embraced in Deputy Quill's amendment in the other House.  She used the word &ldquo;multi-skilling&rdquo;.  We altered her amendment slightly to take cognisance of the draftsman's requirements but its thrust was contained in my first amendment in the Dáil, which referred to the multi-skilling ethos or principle.</P>
      <P>The fourth matter is the effectiveness of the methods of certification of standards achieved.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains the ideal of the National Educational Certification and Training Board.  Many vested interests are involved here, but we will endorse this principle.  This board will certify not only the standards of apprentices but standards for all training in industry, CERT, Teagasc, VPT and elsewhere.  We are proceeding with that plan and within the next few months we hope to have that board in place to certify education and training courses.  That body will endorse standards of certification but, as the Senator says, it does not exist yet.</P>
      <P>The last item relates to the success of the training when measured against the best international standards.  FÁS has signed agreements with France, the UK and Germany, although the latter has not been concluded.  These are mutual recognition agreements of the comparability of the apprenticeship and training courses.  We are already succeeding in measuring ourselves against international standards.  Through these agreements the idea of standards based rather than passive time served apprenticeships was developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> Under Senator Farrelly's amendment the ESRI would report progress made against the annual performance targets set by FÁS.  I agree with the idea, but the advice given to me is that FÁS has set up a board to deal with apprenticeships.  This is somewhat like examining one's navel; it may be comforting but if one is only doing so oneself it is not of much use.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise and Employment has set up an evaluation unit which has now been recognised by Europe.  Some may say this is more bureaucracy, but the EU has adopted this unit as a model for other countries in distributing EU moneys.  I am interested in this matter because the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Mitchell, has been giving close scrutiny to a certain project along with his colleagues.</P>
    <P>The unit has highly trained staff and they have given us many presentations relating to their work.  The EU has said it approves of the work of the unit and it will adopt the results of the unit as standard practice.  Europe will encourage other countries to follow our example. This is not personal praise but a commendation from outside.  We are happy with the work being undertaken by the evaluation unit.  I mentioned this matter earlier when speaking of urgency and pro-active implementation on Senator Quinn's amendment.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate on a similar amendment I said I would consider making future evaluation reports available to both Houses.  I see no reason for them to be locked away in an evaluation unit within the Department of Enterprise and Employment or in Brussels, where they make delightful reading for bureaucrats. These Houses are where accountability lies because we are the final evaluators and are elected to be so.</P>
    <P>In some respects we have complied with the points in this amendment.  Some points remain to be decided.  For instance, we do not know if the voluntary code will work, whether other countries will become involved in international standardisation, or how quickly we will set up the certification board.  We have <Col N="1421" /> some work to do on those matters.  I am prepared to make the unit's evaluation reports public through discussion in the House.  I ask the Senator to accept this.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  I am delighted to hear from the Minister of State that people from other areas have been <Col N="1423" /> seconded in real terms.  How often will we receive a response on the evaluation? Will it be yearly, every 18 months or every two years?  It will probably take a minimum of 18 months to get an idea of how things are proceeding.  There are always teething problems for the first six to eight months.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that we will have a response?</P>

      <P>That is a fair question. Given that the voluntary code will take two years, there will be a response within 18 months to two years.  We cannot wait until the two years are up and then make a swoop on the voluntary code.  I give a commitment to the thrust of Senator Farrelly's amendment, which was evaluation, monitoring and the production of results, warts and all.  I wish this debate had taken place some years ago and that I had had the opportunity to be at the centre of developments.  This has been such a productive debate.  Where else have amendments been accepted and, where they could not be accepted, their thrust has been accepted?  Where else could we say that a Bill, which started as a minute matter dealing with a levy, a gleam in some Revenue inspector's eye, has provoked such debate and unity in a discursive and cautionary sense and through advice to me in general.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House, I will go through details of the Bill.  This is a technical Bill and I hope we will be able to isolate the main points. <Col N="1426" /> The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the provisions of the EU Directive on an Employer's Obligation to Inform Employees of the Conditions Applicable to the Contract or Employment Relationship.</P>
      <P>The Bill obliges employers to provide their employees with a written statement of particulars of their terms of employment and to notify them of any changes in those particulars.  The Bill also provides for a system of redress for any employee who considers that he or she has been denied entitlement to information under the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As regards the intent and effect of the Bill, one point I would like to emphasise at the outset is that the Bill is primarily concerned with the provision of basic information.  The Bill simply requires employers to give their employees a written statement of their terms of employment. It provides a system of redress where the particulars of the terms of employment contained in the written statement are incomplete or inaccurate. The availability of a clear and unambiguous statement of the terms of employment will ensure a high level of transparency in the employment relationship. This will help to ensure that the employee and the employer will have a good understanding of their respective obligations to each other and it will eliminate any misconceptions about the employment relationships.</P>
      <P>This level of clarity will be of significant benefit to the employer and the employee.  It will help to avoid subsequent disputes as to the employee's and employer's entitlements and obligations and it will facilitate continuing good relations in the workplace.  All good employers would agree that the provisions of such information represents a positive approach to proper management and cannot fail to contribute to the development of a proper sense of openness and mutual trust between people in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A requirement to provide information to employees about their terms of employment has been enshrined in legislation for some time.  For the past 20 <Col N="1427" /> years most employees have been entitled to a range of information about their terms of employment under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  However, the range of information required by this Bill is somewhat more extensive and it reflects the needs arising from developments in employment arrangements over the years. Accordingly, the provisions of this Bill builds on provisions contained in the 1973 Act.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention some of the main differences between the 1973 Act and the provisions in this Bill.  The scope of the Bill is wider than existing legislation as it applies to all employees other than those who work less than eight hours each week or have less than four weeks' continuous service.  The 1973 Act, as amended by the Worker Protection (Regular Part-time Employees) Act, 1991, excludes those who work less than eight hours each week or who have less than 13 weeks continuous service.  It also excludes certain limited types of employment. The range of employment particulars to be included in the statement required under this Bill is more extensive than is required under the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces for the first time a complaints procedure which gives employees access to the rights commissioner and, on appeal, to the Employment Appeals Tribunal if they believe they have failed to secure their entitlement to full and accurate written information on their terms of employment.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the specific provisions of the Bill, I take this opportunity to mention the background to the introduction of the directive and, in a broader context, to reflect on Ireland's position on European Union measures designed to protect the employment rights of workers.  The directive, which gives rise to this Bill, has its origins in the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights for Workers or, as it is more commonly known, the Social Charter.  That charter identified a number of measures necessary to promote improved working <Col N="1428" /> conditions for workers in the context of the establishment of the Internal Market. One of those measures was that employees should be given written information on their conditions of employment. Arising from that provision, the EU Commission proposed this directive which requires member states to put in place the necessary legislative provisions to ensure that employees are provided with information.</P>
    <P>As a signatory of the Social Charter, Ireland is committed to the development of initiatives designed to improve economic and social cohesion.  We have consistently adopted a constructive and positive approach to the development of social policy while taking account of the need to avoid the imposition of costs and obligations which would adversely affect competitiveness and employment.</P>
    <P>In the debate on social policy and its relationship to employment creation, it is fair to say that many responses are often overly simplistic and can distort the true position.  I believe a balanced approach between measures designed, on the one hand, to stimulate employment and, on the other, to protect workers' rights can provide the desired consensus for the purpose of achieving an efficient and just labour market.  A business environment which is both economically efficient and socially just is most likely to give rise to social and economic benefits for all.</P>
    <P>In that context, it is appropriate to refer to the White Paper on Employment Growth and Competitiveness and the Green Paper on Social Policy which have been published by the EU Commission. The publication of these documents has led to a widespread debate on how to proceed in the broad industrial and social policy area and on the economic environment in which these are set.  As part of that debate I am hosting a major conference on the Green Paper in Dublin Castle on 28 March, aimed specifically at encouraging responses from interests on how the European Union should proceed in the social policy area.  A feature to note in both documents is the stress placed on links between economic and industrial <Col N="1429" /> measures on the one hand and social measures on the other.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government and the recent <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> have struck a balance between initiatives aimed at economic expansion and employment creation and those dealing with employment, law and labour affairs. It is through this process of consultation and consensus at national level that we have been able to balance our approach to labour legislation.  I hope a similar approach, aimed at achieving a high level of consensus, will continue to provide the basis for the determination of future priorities in the social policy area at European and national level.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to the provisions of the Bill, I consider that a balanced approach to legislation, which we have achieved with this Bill, does not impose any real threat to or burden on employers.  On the contrary, I am convinced this Bill, which is based on and reflects the consensus agreed by the member states in adopting the directive, will contribute to the development and maintenance of proper and constructive employment relationships between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is the interpretation section.  The definition &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo; has been designed to encompass not only the traditional contract of service but also contracts under which workers are engaged by employment agencies.  The decision to bring employment agency workers within the scope of this legislation follows from a commitment already made and this is enshrined in other legislation, including the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for exclusions from the provisions of the Bill.  It shall not apply to an employee who is normally expected to work for less than eight hours a week or who has been in continuous service for less than four weeks.  This is consistent with the terms of the directive and achieves the proper balance between the protection of the worker and the need <Col N="1430" /> for flexibility on behalf of the employer. Section 2 also contains an enabling provision to allow other classes of employment to be excluded by order from any provisions of the Bill.  In that regard, I accepted an amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide that any such exclusion will only be put into effect after consultation with the social partners.  I must stress, however, that the power to exclude classes of employment from the Bill is restricted by the terms of the directive to employments of a casual or specified nature and the exclusion must be justified.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a key provision.  It specifies the particulars of the terms of employment which an employer must give in writing to an employee and provides that the information must be given not later than two months after the date of commencement of employment.  Certain particulars may be given by the employer through reference to legislation or collective agreements governing those particulars, provided they are reasonably available.</P>
    <P>Many of the particulars specified in section 3 of the Bill are already specified in section 9 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, which is being repealed by this Bill.  The 1973 Act required that particulars be given to the employee on such matters as the date of commencement of employment, remuneration, hours of work, holidays, sick pay and pensions and notice periods. This Bill extends the list of particulars to include the name and address of the employer, the place of work, the job title, the expected duration of temporary contracts of employment and a reference to any collective agreements.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also requires that the written statement be signed by or on behalf of the employer and that it must be retained for one year after the employee's employment has ceased.  The requirement to provide a written statement only applies to employees recruited from the date of commencement of the legislation. Section 6, to which I will come shortly, deals with the rights of existing employees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> Section 4 deals with employment outside the State.  It provides that, in the case of employees assigned to work abroad for a period of not less than one month &mdash; such cases are numerous &mdash; an employer must provide, prior to the employee's departure from the State, the complete written statement described in section 3. Also, the employer must provide certain supplementary information which includes the period of employment outside the State and the benefits in cash or kind resulting from that employment. This is a recognition of the growing trend of employment contracts to provide for periods of employment in other countries.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with changes in the particulars of the terms of employment and provides that any such changes must be notified to the employee within one month.  However, where the change is related to the employee being assigned to work outside the State, the change must be notified before the departure of the employee from the State.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for existing employees.  It provides that where an existing employee requires his or her employer to furnish a written statement of particulars of terms of employment, the employer must supply it within two months of the date of request.  It would not be reasonable or administratively feasible to require employers to automatically furnish a written statement of employment terms to each existing employee on the date of implementation of the directive in national legislation.  It was decided as a compromise that employers would only be required to provide particulars of the terms of employment to existing employees if so requested and that the employer would have two months in which to do so.</P>
    <P>The directive requires member states to put in place adequate measures to allow employees to pursue complaints if they consider that their employers have not given them their entitlements. Sections 7, 8, and 9 deal with the adjudicative process.  In summary, the system of redress which I have incorporated in <Col N="1432" /> these sections of the Bill is a right of access to the rights commissioner in the first instance, with a right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and enforcement of determinations of the tribunal, if necessary, in the District Court. This will allow an inexpensive and readily accessible system of redress.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that an employee may refer a complaint to a rights commissioner and it allows the rights commissioner a range of options.  In addition, the rights commissioner may order the employer to pay to the employee compensation of a maximum of four weeks remuneration.  In relation to the powers of remedy, I refer briefly to one specific provision, that is, the power of the rights commissioner to alter or add to the details in the written statement.  Following concerns expressed to me about this provision, I was pleased to include an amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil to make it explicit that the purpose of this provision is to allow the rights commissioner to correct any inaccuracies or omissions in the written statement, and that is all; in other words, the rights commissioner will not have the power to adjudicate on terms of employment.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides an avenue of appeal from, and enforcement of, recommendations of a rights commissioner to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The tribunal is empowered to issue a determination which affirms, varies or sets aside the recommendation of the rights commissioner.  This is similar to a provision which was included in the recent Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993, based on the operation of the unfair dismissals legislation over the past years. The intention of the provision is to discourage employers from ignoring the rights commissioner procedure.  This section also provides for a fine of £1,000 for failure to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, refusal to give evidence or failure or refusal to produce documents.  This is consistent with the level of fines included in other legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with enforcement of determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It provides that, <Col N="1433" /> where an employer fails to implement a determination, the Minister or the employee concerned or the employee's trade union may apply to the District Court for an order directing the employer to implement the determination.  Section 9 also empowers the District Court to include in the order interest on the amount of any financial compensation awarded.  This mirrors a provision of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with evidence in relation to prosecution of a person for failure to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It also mirrors a provision of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act.  It is intended to resolve problems which have arisen in the past. Section 11 is a standard requirement relating to orders and regulations made under the legislation.  Section 12 is a standard section dealing with expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 13 repeals sections 9 and 10 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  Section 9 of the 1973 Act specified the details of the terms of employment to be provided by an employer to an employee and the timescales for the supply of that information. Section 10 provided that an employer who failed to comply with this could be prosecuted.  Those provisions of the 1973 Act are overtaken by the provisions in this Bill, particularly the ones dealing with more extensive information.  Section 14 is a standard provision dealing with the short title and date of commencement.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I reiterate that this Bill represents further evidence of Ireland's commitment to implementation of measures adopted by the European Union in the context of the social dimension enshrined in EU policy.  Moreover, I am satisfied that the legislative requirement to provide written information on the terms of employment will be seen as a positive step in establishing greater transparency in the employment relationships between employers and employees. The good employer has nothing to fear from this legislation and I am confident its provisions will be seen as an asset to <Col N="1434" /> the continued development of harmonious relationships in the workplace.</P>
    <P>While I may, perforce, have dwelt at length on the specific sections of the Bill, we are talking about a simple form enshrining a relationship between employers and employees.  To portray it as a huge restriction on employment is incorrect. Most employers and employees are good. We do not seek to spancel business or curtail its expansion but to provide for harmonious relationships.  The Treaty of Rome refers to economic and social cohesion and this is enshrined in legislation here and in other countries.  An incorrect view has developed that proper worker protection legislation is leftist and should not be entertained.  I can inform the House that from my brief experience of 15 months in dealing with the consideration of directives at European level and their translation into national legislation, it is a long and sometimes tortuous process.  You deal with each of the social partners and see their points of view.  It is a general easing along the road which goes on endlessly at European level with officials and politicians.  Formal and informal meetings take place and great cognisance is taken of the viewpoints of all of the social partners.  Europe is not blind to the need for a flexible approach to employment.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to read about the recent debate at the G7 summit.  I briefly had the opportunity to talk to some people who participated in it &mdash; they were not from this country as we are not one of the richest countries of the world. There is clearly a growing recognition in the US that they have achieved a great deal of employment in recent years at the expense of a huge growth in an underclass of society.  That has been clearly acknowledged by American policy makers.  I spent last Monday and Tuesday in Boston.  I was not away for St. Patrick's Day but was attending my home town festivities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke in Boston to two people who were involved in that debate and there is a growing concern in the US that job creation has been at the expense of marginalising huge areas of population.  We are trying to ensure that those who work have decent standards but not at the expense of extra or consolidating employment.</P>
      <P>We came late to development.  For example, we came late to many curriculum developments in education and I remember going through this when I was in that Department.  We have come late to development because of lack of money and so on and have therefore not gone down the seemingly primrose path which turned out to be quite bizarre.  Curriculum developments in other countries are scrambling to get back to what we wanted, which was general good standards, broad subjects and no early specialisation.  Similarly, with labour legislation we did not go down any obtuse routes but chose instead the route of balance and consensus.  People say that consensus is cosy, not creative, and blinds one to job creation.  Where would we have been over the last six years without that sense of consensus between the social partners?  We quickly forget the chaos which might otherwise have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jobs without rights or rights without jobs are meaningless.  We are seeking to bring in a balanced approach.  Our nearest neighbour across the water makes great play in Europe that it is <Col N="1436" /> opting out of the Social Charter in favour of jobs.  This is endlessly paraded in front of us.  However, it is a charade for domestic political purposes.  It is done so that the atavistic nature of some of the members of the ruling party can be satisfied and not on the rational basis of proper intellectual scrutiny of the legislation in hand.  I particularly resent the idea that this would gain ground here.</P>
    <P>Last year a well known firm of accountants brought out three monthly surveys of ten issues about which employers have worries.  They polled a range of employers and concerns about labour legislation came consistently in the last third of the ten issues.  Much more concern was expressed about ready access for a sustained period to cheap money. We all know that if employers could get that they would willingly forego all sorts of things.</P>
    <P>What I am putting forward today is a result of administrative and political consensus in Europe and at home and consensus in the Dáil and, I hope, the Seanad via debate and amendment.  I agree with and strongly commend clarification, which I know we will be discussing later.  Simplification and clarification in words and a form which people can understand is the type of deregulation with which I agree and not the type which strips the veneer off what should be proper social behaviour between employers and employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us will have any more grey hairs over whether this legislation is passed, with all due respects, because it is a directive dated 1991 which should have been passed in the middle of last year.  Perhaps if so much time had not been spent on trying to form a Government it would have been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any real problem with asking the employer to provide, if he is so requested, written information on the terms of employment.  Is the commissioner a new type of officer who will be appointed as a result of this legislation? We have the system of the <Col N="1437" /> employment appeals tribunal in place, which we all know about.</P>
    <P>There is provision for a fine, which I presume will be levied on the employer if he does not provide the information which is requested, or refuses to give evidence or produce documents at the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  What about an employee who brings false allegations against an employer?  The whole thrust of this seems to be totally biased towards the employee.  I am not saying that there is a conflict but just posing the question.  The Minister rightly said that the majority of employers and employees are excellent.  However, there is always the odd case which makes the headlines. Is there any redress for an employer who is accused by an employee of doing something which it is subsequently proved he did not do?</P>
    <P>We were very interested in recent EU directives and what would have happened with regard to all the directives which had been passed since 1973 if a certain court case had not gone the right way.  We would have had some fun in this and the other House if that had been the case.  It is good for the country long term that did not turn out to be the case, as many good things have been done.  A few mistakes were made but we are part of the European Union and we have to ensure that we have the best possible circumstances for employers and employees.  It works both ways.</P>
    <P>The legislation itself is not going to create a problem and nobody is crying out for it.  It is another EU Directive which we are implementing as required. I do not believe many employers are going to worry about this legislation because they are doing their job as it should be done.  The only problem is that this is another task for somebody in an office who will have to supply the information as requested.  The terms of employment of the majority of people I employed in the past were on a one to one basis.  That is how it worked in reality, and I am sure Senator Quinn will inform us how it was done in his company.  Trust was basically the order <Col N="1438" /> of the day and we are not moving away from that basic trust in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not going to delay the House because this legislation does not pose any conflict.  I ask the Minister to address in her reply the question of an employee bringing a false case against an employer to the tribunal.  This legislation will not cause any of us to have any more grey hair than we already have.  Some of us had not had the good luck to discover which magic bottle works.  I hope this legislation is only enhancing the overall development of what we agreed when we joined Europe and that it is not going to harm companies or anyone thinking of employing people.  It will in reality help employer/employee relations and nobody could disagree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about grey hairs at this stage.  We will not go down that road now.  I welcome the Minister back with this Bill.  As has been said, the purpose of the Bill is to implement the 1991 EC directive.  It is welcome in the context of the new way of work which involves more than the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job.  That seems to be yesterday's talk, as modern life has introduced flexitime, job sharing and contract work.  While I hope every job will be pensionable, the concept of permanency is not as obvious as it was in the old style of employment.  In that sense legislation which will copperfasten terms and conditions of employment for those working in that environment is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to have a contract, particularly for those who may be more vulnerable in the context of employment. Most employers are good employers but we have to legislate for those who may take the short cuts when dealing with employees.  As the Minister said, the Bill requires the provision of information and openness in employment situations.  The meaning of words used must be capable <Col N="1439" /> of being understood by the parties to the contract of employment, and the conditions of employment will cover the various aspects of employment, including holidays, sick leave and the nature of the work.</P>
    <P>The 1973 Act did not mention the nature of the work or the name and address of the employer.  I am pleased this has been tightened up.  There are employers who do not wish to disclose where they are working and the people employed by them are one of the most vulnerable groups in society.  It is often difficult to pin this down, so I am glad this legislation will tighten that up.  It will be difficult to define the nature of work. In the area of communications skills or public relations, it is difficult to describe the nature of the work in legislation.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the definition of the nature of work which is to be included in the contract.  It is a little broad and I know the Minister will take my points on board.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for redress where any of the conditions are not fulfilled by the employer.  This is to be welcomed, as is the fact that one can bring proceedings to a rights commissioner, on appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and ultimately to the District Court.  Some people may not like this as it will not encourage good working relationships.  The legislation introduces openness between the employer and employee and tries to dispel the feeling that the head of the institution and the body of workers should never work together.  This thinking derives from the disciplinarian or authoritarian approach which existed in the 1940s.  One example of this is the Catholic Church.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better watch what I say on that.  The Army is another example.  One did the job one was asked to do without discussion and the conditions were never laid down.  I welcome the openness which will allow an employee to know exactly where he or <Col N="1440" /> she stands in any work relationship.  The work environment will be more harmonious and people will understand each other.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation.  The points about which I am concerned are the nature of work in section 3 and the need to spell out the requirement that the employer give his name and address.  A weakness may arise in the latter area. The issue of compensation should also be addressed.  There are certain jobs where employees are moving from place to place and I wonder how much insurance cover they have.  The Bill is another step which brings us in line with Europe and modernises our thinking.  It acknowledges the new work ethic and the need for legislation to recognise that we are no longer dealing with 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It does not present a problem for a large business such as my own as we have a personnel department which deals with the task of compliance with such legislation. However, I am concerned about the effect it will have on small businesses and I have a practical suggestion for the Minister which would make compliance easier for small businesses.  Most enterprises in this country are not big.  The overwhelming majority of businesses in Ireland are very small.  There are about 160,000 businesses in the country, 98 per cent of which are small businesses.  These are the companies we want to nurture because they offer the best hope of creating jobs in the future.  I am not suggesting that small businesses should be exempt from the legislation.  Knowing one's terms of employment is a basic right and it would be wrong to deprive anybody of that right just because they were working for a small business.  We can make it easier for small businesses to comply with this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister puts herself in the position of a person running a small business she will realise that on top of all the bureaucratic impositions on the employer, this is another requirement, but unlike a lot of what is required by the State, in this case there is no form to fill <Col N="1441" /> in.  This time the employer has to sit down and draft a letter to each new employee. What must be in that letter?  To know that, the business person will have to buy a copy of this Act and wade through the legal English of it.  If the company is a member of IBEC, that organisation will probably do all that for them but the vast majority of small firms are not members of IBEC, they are not even members of either of the associations representing the small firms.  Most small firms rely totally on their own assets.  How can we make it easier for them?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Department draw up and publish for just a few pence a standard form that small business people can go into a stationery shop or into the post office and buy, as people can do now when they want to make a will.  Another precedent would be the model articles of association that form part of the Companies Act.  The small business could take the form and fill in the gaps, striking out any of the standard provisions that did not apply in a particular case and adding anything special that did apply.  It would then be just a question of making a photocopy of that form, giving one copy to the employee and keeping the other for the files.  In this way compliance with the legislation would be easy and practical even for very small business.</P>
    <P>If we do not do something like this the legislation will be largely ignored by small businesses.  I cannot see where the resources necessary to enforce it on a large scale would come from; if that happened the employees of small businesses would be the losers.  I suggest that on Committee Stage the Minister bring forward an amendment to add a Schedule to the Bill incorporating a model letter setting out standard forms of employment. I also suggest that the Bill incorporate a requirement on the Minister to publish this Schedule at a reasonable price so that it can be readily purchased by the many thousands of small firms who would benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I wish to add a couple of points about the Minister's interesting speech where she explained the social legislation that was responsible for the introduction of <Col N="1442" /> this Bill.  I read an article last week &ldquo;More jobs or good jobs&rdquo;.  This was precisely the point the Minister made.  I do not think anybody could disagree with this.</P>
    <P>Let me tell the Minister of an incident about which I have spoken before because it impressed me.  In America in January I met a very successful North American businessman who sits on the boards of a number of companies.  He introduced me to the people around the table and told them I come from a country which is a marvellous place to visit on holiday.  He told the others there that if they get a chance to visit Ireland for their holidays they should do so.  I felt very good.  Then he said he is a member of the boards of a number of companies and that he has made it a policy that no board of which he is a member will ever again employ anybody in Ireland.  I was aghast. He explained that, in his view, when a company of which he was a board member had to close or decided to close a factory in Ireland they found it very difficult to do so.  He described how the Taoiseach spoke to the chairman of the company, how the trade unions and legislation made it difficult, and that the nation as a whole did not seem to understand that not all businesses can succeed for all time.  He said we made it so difficult for his company to close a factory and to put people out of work that he has determined that no company of which he is a board member will open a factory in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was jolted by this but it was useful for me to be reminded &mdash; I am not talking about this legislation &mdash; that every time we bring into being a piece of legislation to protect those of us at work, we must be very careful that we do not at the same time inadvertently act against the interests of those who do not yet have a job.  I am happy to say that I do not see any sign of that in this legislation.  I am very happy that this legislation should go ahead, but it is a reminder to us that when we legislate for those in work, we must ensure that the legislation will not mean that those who are out of work are less likely to get a job.  I am very happy <Col N="1443" /> with this Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister who is in the House.  She always seems to be happy here.</P>
      <P>This is a fairly simple Bill.  It gives effect to an EU Directive so it is probably welcomed by most people in the labour and trade union movement.  I concur with most of what has been said.  In terms of the structure of the modern workforce, it is a fact that what are referred to in the Minister's speech as atypical workers are becoming more numerous.  The days of the nine to five job, predictability and permanence are, unfortunately, behind us.  The growth in the number of atypical workers is a phenomenon of the modern economy.</P>
      <P>It is not entirely unfortunate inasmuch as I acknowledge that, in addition to meeting requirements of employers and assisting towards objectives of competitiveness and so on, atypical working hours can also meet the requirements and suit the needs of workers.  Many workers have adapted to this, perhaps not willingly initially, and have grown to accept it because it suits their personal or domestic circumstances.  A great number of women are in these categories.</P>
      <P>I note the provisions of redress to the rights commissioners.  The rights commission as an institution has worked with remarkable success in industrial relations and, to my knowledge, this facility is not available in any other country, certainly not in Britain.  Its informal nature and conciliatory role has contributed enormously to the maintenance of good industrial relations, and is entirely appropriate that it would become the first step towards redress.  It is a simple Bill and one which is to be welcomed by most people.  I agree with the points most other Members have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and her Bill to the House.  Like Senator Quinn I feel that the less legislation and bureaucracy there is on employment the better, and I speak here as an employer as <Col N="1444" /> well as an employee.  As Senator Quinn said, this Bill is nothing but beneficial and it seems odd that we have to bring in this legislation because of EU regulations. I have been amazed to find that employees may not know the name or address of their employer.  This legislation is essential.</P>
      <P>While the legislation will affect all workers, I believe it will affect women even more than men.  Apart from the construction industry, the employment practices of which I cannot understand, women are much more likely than men to be in atypical employment.  Some 77 per cent of women's employment is in the service sector and it is in this sector that job description, expected hours of work, place of work and overtime, for example, are often far more vague than in the industrial sector.  This is very much to be welcomed.  The percentage of married women working has risen from 30 per cent of the female workforce in 1981 to nearly 50 per cent today.  A large number of married women are more likely to work part-time in agency or contract work, in seasonal jobs or other casual employment.  This legislation will be important for them.  I am glad to see that agency workers are being included in this and other legislation, because for a while there was an extraordinary gap where workers employed through an employment agency hardly appeared to be covered by legislation at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention women who work in the services sector, such as nurses, nurses' aids and those in catering.  All these women are on call but they are not paid for the time they are on call.  In addition, they have very little idea what the job they are called on to do will entail. We have to be flexible and try to legislate for all eventualities.  If a tour bus comes in late and all the passengers want high tea, I can understand why the hotel or restaurant owner has to keep workers on for a certain length of time, although we hope it would not happen on a regular basis.  I have been shocked by the way some nurses are treated by agencies.  A nurse told me that when she was on call she was told to report to work at a <Col N="1445" /> hospital at 8 o'clock.  It was not a public hospital in the city I am glad to say.  But she was not told whether she would be working until midnight or all night until she got there.  This is a ridiculous way to organise any nursing schedule and shows very little respect for the employee or those she was supposed to be minding.</P>
    <P>A couple of things in the Bill worry me, although I do not know if the Minister can do anything about them.  On average women work fewer hours than men, so women are more likely to be affected by the eight hour limit than men.  I am worried about women who may be working three mornings a week, which would probably be nine hours, being reduced to eight hours to avoid the legislation.  Three mornings per week is a common amount of work for a part-time woman worker. This could also happen with job-sharing &mdash; in teaching, for example &mdash; where the number of hours worked in a job-sharing position may not be all that much.  It would be regrettable if they were excluded from the legislation because of that, although I realise that there has to be some sort of time limit.</P>
    <P>Regarding the four weeks, I am worried about people working part-time who could be employed four weeks on and four weeks off.  Regrettably, at the moment a lot of major firms keep people on temporary employment for years and years by laying them off for six weeks every now and then.  I hope this sort of thing would not negate the legislation. Home workers are not covered by the Bill although they are most vulnerable and do not seem to be protected by any legislation.  Nearly all of them are women and, while home workers are less common in Ireland than in many other EU countries, a considerable amount of home working is done here.  I would like to see if the Minister could cover them. Their place of work is their home but their work is often delivered by a middle person.  The home worker may have no idea whom they are working for, even though the end person might be a large employer.  Can the Minister do anything to make sure these workers would at least know the name and address of their real <Col N="1446" /> employer?  This is important from the point of view of knowing if their PRSI/PAYE is being paid.  Perhaps the Minister could include them because they are in a vulnerable position.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that in section 4 the Minister has addressed the issue of workers who are sent abroad to work. Many people have gone abroad with great ideals to work for an Irish-based firm, looking forward to a glowing future, but have come to a sticky end.  It was important for the Minister to take such people within the ambit of the legislation. Quite a number of them went off to work overseas and ended up without even having their return fare paid for.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and cannot see it being considered other than as a good step, both for employers &mdash; the vast majority of whom are honourable &mdash; and employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join other Members in welcoming the legislation.  In my view it will not be an impediment to the creation of employment despite the fact that in recent times the view has been expressed that the multiplicity of legislation in this area is inhibiting the creation of industry and business, especially in the small business sector.  It has been said that further chapters of legislation, rather than protecting those in employment, will have the opposite effect.  This legislation is desirable and fits into the overall approach the Minister has adopted on social policy, an area which is topical both here and in the European Commission.  The Minister's Green Paper on Social Policy will provide something similar to what we have in education; a focus on the priority areas that need attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like further clarification on some aspects of this legislation.  For instance, section 8 mentions the District Court while section 9 mentions the High Court.  I am not sure about the purpose of the difference in the court's jurisdiction. One complaint I have made previously is that in giving effect to rights commissioners' or Labour Court judgments, if an employer decides to down tools <Col N="1447" /> and not comply with a recommendation, private litigation has to be embarked upon in the High Court by the aggrieved person.  I felt this was an omission in previous legislation.  Some employees found to their cost that even though they had a rights commissioner or a Labour Court decision granting them awards, they were not able to claim them if an employer ignored them.  The employee then had to have recourse to the High Court, which is very expensive.  It is evident also that the High Court might not necessarily be bound by the decision of either the rights commissioner or the Labour Court.  Could a similar situation arise in relation to sections 8 and 9?  In the event of an employee going through all these procedures in the District Court, can they be sure of getting whatever entitlements they were granted?</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about cases of transfers, buy-outs or takeover bids by companies in relation to existing companies that have been in operation for many years, There is widespread anxiety among the employees of Shannon Repair Services &mdash; a wholly owned subsidiary of Aer Lingus &mdash; about negotiations by Aer Lingus to sell off that operation.  The workers want to know how their pension rights and other entitlements will be protected in a new arrangement.  While the employees would have no particular objection to a new arrangement, they feel they could lose out substantially.  Some employees could lose up to £50,000 or £60,000 in the event of a new company making the employees redundant in a year's time rather than getting redundancy under the terms of the Cahill plan. Such information is necessary, particulary in small firms like this one which has about 110 employees.  Some of the employees gave 40 years' service to the company and may be faced with severe loss as a result of the takeover bid.  Can this situation be covered in legislation? Will this legislation be retrospective or does it apply from the date it is passed? How does it affect the 1973 legislation? It is 21 years since we debated that legislation <Col N="1448" /> in the Oireachtas.  Until this legislation was introduced, I understood that these matters were covered by the 1973 legislation.  There were inadequacies in that legislation and I understand the necessity to amend the 1973 Act to deal with them.  However, I am not certain how this legislation relates to the 1973 Act.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.</P>
    <P>A system of good employer-employee relations through the provision of comprehensive information to employees is in the best interests of industry generally, of owners, management and employees. Now we have an opportunity to deal with some of the inadequacies in previous legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for introducing it.  I also compliment her on her initiative in organising the conference to be held later this month.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I wish to make some observations on the Bill.  I support the Bill.  It is sensible to have formal arrangements between employer and employee, provided they are simple and that the language is explicit.  This is the era of EU directives and we must abide by them. However the question of how many <Col N="1449" /> directives we have not complied with arises.  We have ignored many of them. One could ask if this directive is one with which we should deal.  Directives are issued in succession so it is appropriate that we should.</P>
    <P>My reservation about the Bill is similar to that expressed by Senator Quinn.  At a time when we have almost 300,000 people unemployed, when we are trying to create an enterprise culture and to encourage employment we are introducing another impediment to potential employers.  This is particularly relevant to the small business sector which Senator Quinn mentioned.  That sector accounts for 98 per cent of employment.  I can understand its relevance from personal experience being a farmer who, until two years ago, had one employee.  At one time the same farm employed four people and most people involved in agriculture remember such a time.  However, that is a sign of the times.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I had one employee but it reached the stage where a person spent so much time in the office that he was no longer a farmer.  We have become a collection agency for the State; we are involved in the collection of PRSI.  I accept that we must be involved in the PRSI system.  However, it reaches the point where the system descends upon us at such a rate that we throw up our arms in despair.  The handiest thing to do is to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Small employers face this problem.  It astonishes me, when observing the Leader groups throughout the country in my journalistic capacity, to see such energy in communities, individuals and small businesses.  Ideas are bubbling all over the country.  Our people are not <Col N="1450" /> deficient.  We sometimes talk ourselves down as if we were not capable of formulating ideas and creating jobs.  The ideas are there.  What prevents those ideas from coming to fruition?  What prevents people from taking the risks involved?  As Senator Quinn said, what is wrong with failure?  If a company must unfortunately go under, we should pick up the pieces and carry on.  There should be no stigma attached to such failure.</P>
      <P>In that context I consider another layer of legislation &mdash; not the provisions of this Bill &mdash; on top of many other layers as counter productive to the enterprise culture we are trying to foster; it is counterproductive to creating jobs.  That is not to say that people in employment should not be protected.  I agree with the Minister's comments on the Social Charter in the Maastricht Treaty.  It is not right that the British can unilaterally withdraw from something that is to the benefit of workers throughout the EU in their own selfish domestic interests.  We had further evidence of that this week, although I do not wish to diverge from the content of the Bill.  Once again the British do not seem to understand the consensus approach to European politics.  On the issue of enlargement &mdash; which we all support &mdash; they again have the dog in the manger attitude which I find difficult to accept.</P>
      <P>There is a serious obligation on the State to make legislative provisions easy to understand and easy to implement.  I get very uncomfortable with some of the language in this Bill.  Recently I read the provisions of old legislation in the Library.  It would be worthwhile for the parliamentary draftspersons to examine old legislation &mdash; some of which was drafted when we were ruled by Britain &mdash; and see how clear, simple and explicit the language is.  I wonder if we are creating industry for lawyers rather than creating regulations for the benefit of society.  The Bill states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;employer&rdquo;, in relation to an employee, [we are back to &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; again.  It is a phrase I avoided for several months because it caused problems <Col N="1451" /> for me.  However, it is included in the Bill although I do not understand why we must always use the phrase.] means the person with whom the employee has entered into or for whom the employee works under (or, where the employment has ceased, entered into or worked under) a contract of employment subject to the qualification that the person who under a contract of employment referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo; is liable to pay the wages of the individual concerned in respect of the work or service concerned shall be deemed to be the individual's employer;</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  I can imagine a poor shopkeeper who is employing a shop assistant burning the midnight oil trying to tease out whether he is an employer under this Bill.  He would have a fascinating time trying to work that out.</P>
    <P>The ultimate abuse of the English language is to say that a &ldquo;reference to 21 hours shall be construed as a reference to eight hours&rdquo;.  This marks a new departure in the ability of the State to redefine time.  We have now reached the point where the State can say that 21 hours is no longer 21 hours but eight hours.  I congratulate the State on having achieved that state of enlightenment.</P>

      <P>I do not share Senator Ormonde's reservations about the nature of work because, in this instance, the language is explicit.  It refers to the title of the job or the nature of the work.  If one puts down the title of the job, it would seem to imply the nature of the work does not then need to be defined. That may overcome Senator Ormonde's difficulties with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that any terms or conditions relating to pensions and pension schemes come within the scope of the Bill.  It is a major difficulty for employees in certain areas of employment <Col N="1452" /> to find out what their rights are, to what they are entitled under pension schemes and the status of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have a reservation about tribunals, commissioners and additional layers of bureaucracy.  Section 8 (6) (a) refers to the&rdquo; ...recommendation of a rights commissioner in relation to a complaint under this Act... without hearing the employer concerned...&rdquo; I am prepared to accept that several steps will have to be taken before that point is reached. However, it seems to be contrary to natural justice that an employer could not present evidence, even at that point.  I ask the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    <P>I appeal to those who are drafting legislation, especially in an area like this to use language as it is meant to be used and not as a device for lawyers to bring actions to higher courts so that the legislation can be challenged.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis and I seem to be singing the same song from the one hymn book.  If only I could get the Senator over to the parliamentary draftsmen's office.  My officials are laughing because this is also a constant theme of mine.  Complaining about simplifying the language in Bills only seems to come up in this House when I speak; it seems to be a protest against me.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked how 21 hours could suddenly become eight hours in this Bill.  This is due to the Part-Time Workers Bill, 1991, which gave rights to those who worked eight hours or more. In one neat sentence, it gives a person working under eight hours the same eligibility as one working 21 hours.  Senator Dardis was making the point in the wider context of gobbledegook as I called it when I came to this House last May. Legislation could be couched in words which are understandable and normal. There might not be as many cases if the legislation could be simplified.  I echo Senator Dardis' sentiments.  I hope that in some dusty recess, the draftsmen are listening and will seek to implement it, but I would not hold my breath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate; all were welcome.  Senator Farrelly referred to the rights commissioners who have been with us for some time.  He asked what would happen to an employer who would refuse to attend.  He also asked if an employee who made a false claim would be subject to the £1,000 fine?  Experience has shown that it is not the general practice of employees to bring spurious claims to adjudication bodies.  It takes up too much time and requires a lot of knowledge. Generally, the cases brought involve employers &mdash; I stress they are a small number &mdash; who have employed workers under spurious conditions.  The Senator said it should be a matter of trust between employers and employees.  We heartily echo that view, but trust has to find a legislative outlet.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde referred to the new era of flexibility in employment.  Senator Maloney and Senator Henry also said that an increasing number of women are entering this type of employment because it suits them.  I understand that argument because many women want to job share. However, I caution women against rushing into what could be seen as marginalised employment.  There is a difference between flexibility and one's rights inherent in that.  Women take upon themselves the burden of being constantly in flexible employment with their rights not being guaranteed.  There is a balance to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Because of young children, aged relations, the need for more leisure time or declining health, it may suit one's domestic requirements to work in this type of employment.  It is good if it can be brought forward, but there lies within it the seeds of danger.  More women will take that route to employment and will not be seen to have rights and standards of employment, and more importantly, ladders of progression within proper professions. It is too easy to say that is the type of employment women want and send them along that route.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn brought forward an interesting proposal.  Rather than having employers wrestling with this legislation, <Col N="1454" /> the Department could issue a standard form.  This is a simple and good idea. This matter will be discussed further on Committee Stage because it is a conduit of practical compliance which would be interesting for employers.  When a Bill is brought out, a smaller and clearer version of what it contains is also made available. Introducing a model form for employers in tandem with that should also be examined. A simple booklet and standardised forms for small businesses were brought out, for example, in the health and safety area.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney referred to the Bill, the rights commissioners and said the Labour Party would support all it contains. He also said that women want atypical work situations.  Senator Henry said that since 77 per cent of female employment is in the services sector the need to protect this employment is stronger. I am glad agency workers are covered under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Nurses were referred to on Committee Stage of this Bill in the Dáil.  When nurses are on call they have to be ready to go on duty at a moment's notice.  They cannot make simple domestic arrangements; they do not know if they must get a babysitter.  They may need to plan ahead because they could be working up to eight hours when they are on call.  Senator Henry also mentioned the necessity to provide an atmosphere of serenity for those in their care.  Would the nine hours be cut to eight to obviate the needs of compliance?  In many cases, all sorts of stratagems are put in place to obviate legislation.  I am sure there are many tax people who try to get around the tax measures the State seeks to implement. It seems an industry is created from each piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I had not thought about home workers, but I know what the Senator is talking about.  People who work in their homes are given work by middle persons and their location is well known.  We were glad we were able to include contracts abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned the focus on priorities and the differences between the District Court and the High Court.  I gave <Col N="1455" /> the Senator a note which says that a point in law goes to the High Court.  He also asked me about a company buy-out and what happens when it goes into other hands.  I will discuss that on Committee Stage.  It is a relevant question and one which was mentioned on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  The legislation is not retrospective.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly also asked me about a take-over, particularly in relation to an aircraft maintenance company in Shannon, which is a fully owned subsidiary of Aer Lingus.  It was reported there was disquiet among the workers at present. They would be reasonably satisfied with a take-over if their rights were guaranteed. I will ask the officials from my Department to refer this issue to the relevant section in the Department and to reply to the Senator directly.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde was perplexed about the nature of the work.  As Senator Dardis pointed out, this is an either or situation.  Either one relates to the nature of the work, or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Senator Dardis apologised for his colleague, Senator Honan, who is interested in this legislation.  While welcoming this legislation, he wanted to know if it would impede small businesses because people would be snowed under with forms which needed to be completed. Senator Quinn's practical suggestion seeks to redress that situation.  I take the Senator's point about the need for simplification and I hope the parliamentary draftsman will bear it in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, for allowing me to raise an important national matter and I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, to the House.  While he does not have direct responsibility for this area, I have no doubt he will take my points on board and ensure that action is taken.</P>
      <P>The delivery of post in this country has become a second national lottery game because one does not know when, where or if the post will arrive.  The deterioration of the postal services to, from and in Dublin in recent months is a national disaster.  An Post is implementing a programme which will save approximately £9 million a year and this fact was mentioned by the Minister in the Dáil over a month ago.  However, at what cost have these savings been made?  Unfortunately, customer service standards have now dropped and businesses are suffering greatly.  The reliability which was part and parcel of the service provided by An Post over recent years has disappeared.</P>
      <P>Like many of my colleagues, I have received complaints from constituents, business people and from various people who depend on An Post for postal deliveries on a daily or weekly basis.  It is criminal that vulnerable people such as pensioners have been denied pensions on a weekly basis because they did not arrive when they should have.  Last week various semi-State pensions which were posted on Wednesday to people who were depending on them arrived only at lunchtime yesterday.  This is not good enough even when one takes into consideration the national holiday last week. I ask the Minister to address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> General medical practitioners have to endure long delays in the return of test reports and this causes unnecessary worry and hardship for their patients. It is time this matter was sorted out. Members of this House have also endured long delays and various notices relating to local authority meetings or matters which may arise here often arrive after the due date.  This has nothing to do with our reliable staff, but with the inadequate system which now exists.</P>
    <P>Over a month ago the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, informed the other House that the disruption of services had been remedied and that next day deliveries would be back to normal.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Recently on RTE a representative from An Post boasted that the sorting of post was now untouched by human hands.  However, it appears the computer has been programmed incorrectly or programmed not to deliver on time.  Some people in the Dublin area are now getting deliveries at 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, but not the following afternoon, which is an achievement.  This is happening on a regular basis and I am sure letters to County Kilkenny, where the Minister of State comes from, are taking longer.  It also takes six or seven days to deliver a letter from one part of Dublin to another. The Government is equating recent moves with its so-called efforts to create employment.  Surely some of the £9 million savings could be used to ensure that other people do not leave their jobs.</P>
    <P>Yet again men and women have been replaced in the workplace by machines, with the usual disastrous consequences. It is time for the Minister and the Government to speak to An Post.  Recently Mr. John Hynes was quoted as saying that various matters were being sorted out. They have not been sorted out and the great computer which was meant to sort out the difficulties seems to have created more problems than it has solved.</P>
    <P>In this day and age it is not good enough that individuals are suffering and businesses are being left in a quandary. In certain areas postmen are now saying <Col N="1458" /> that not alone are they doing what they did before the change over but they are covering extra area.  Surely we will not have to consider the reintroduction of carrier pigeons.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at the matter and come back to us on it.  There is general concern and I would ask the Minister to communicate this to his colleague.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising this matter and I am glad to be able to respond on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, who cannot be here this evening. All of us have experienced the serious difficulties which are present in the postal deliveries and I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications the valid points raised by the Senator.</P>
      <P>As Senators may be aware An Post, as part of its recovery measures aimed at reducing costs and improving profitability, recently implemented a programme of changes in the arrangements for distribution and delivery of mail.  The changes affected operations in Dublin and in country areas and were fully agreed with the appropriate trade unions before implementation.  The recovery measures are part of a major programme to make An Post more cost efficient &mdash; they are expected to show savings of £8 million to £9 million a year &mdash; while maintaining standards to all customers.  They were developed against a background of accumulated losses of £14 million in An Post in recent years and the prospect of further losses in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in Dublin are the most far reaching since the introduction of the postal services.  They involved the start of operations at the new Dublin Mails Centre in January 1994, with the transfer of over 400 staff from the old Central Sorting Office in Sheriff Street, the opening of new Dublin 1 and Dublin 2 mail offices, with the transfer of a further 200 staff from Sheriff Street, and revised delivery arrangements involving single delivery in Dublin postal districts.  The <Col N="1459" /> scope and complexity of these changes made it unavoidable that there would be some disruption to services until the new operational arrangements settled down. However, the settling down time is taking longer than An Post anticipated.</P>
    <P>An Post is making strenuous efforts to improve matters, including rostering more staff to work at peak times; encouraging customers to segregate the mail as between the provinces and Dublin so that it can be sorted faster when it arrives at the Dublin Mails Centre; additional information leaflets to explain the need for correct presentation of mail; and an increased use of radio communications in the transport fleet.</P>
    <P>Surveys carried out on behalf of An Post show that the percentage of mail delivered next day is improving, albeit slowly, and An Post is monitoring the situation on a daily basis.  The company is at present considering what further steps it can take to improve matters and is hopeful that the next two weeks will see an end to its problems and a return to the quality of service it provided before the change over.  Another area that has provoked criticism relates to the time mail is delivered, particularly in Dublin 2.  While matters have improved here also, it is clear that there is a need for further improvement and plans are being drawn up by An Post, in consultation with its customers, to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned that the postal service today is not up to the standard he would expect.  However, he would ask the forbearance of the public to allow this highly complex system to be further adjusted by An Post.  He is in regular contact with the company and the company is in no doubt about the Minister's anxiety to see the quality of service return to its former standard.  I assure the Senator that I will bring the matters raised to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise <Col N="1460" /> this matter and I thank the Minister of State for being present.  If Senator O'Toole arrives before I conclude, I would like to share some of my time with him.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Sisters of Charity at St. Anne's national school, Milltown, Dublin 6, who are the trustees of the school, have given notice to the board of management that it is their intention to close the school.  This has caused anxiety to parents who have children attending the school and it is an anxiety I share.  I have to admit that over 50 years ago I attended that school myself.  It was the first school I went to and it was the centre of education in the south-east of Dublin for many years.  I pay tribute to the Sisters of Charity for the excellence of their educational programme in that area over many years. They run an excellent primary school and, attached to it, a secondary school.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State might remember that last October I made a case for a multidenominational school at Ranelagh. Since then the Minister for Education has kindly put that school in this year's capital programme.  I made the case because of the long waiting lists at that school and at other schools in the catchment area, including Donnybrook and Sandyford.  There is a need for more schools in that area, which is extraordinary, because I imagine that the Department of Education has schools with a lot of empty rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this area there is a demand for primary education and there are two reasons for that.  First, a number of private schools in the area that had junior schools have closed their junior schools over the last two or three years.  This put great demand on the national schools in the area.  Second, and it is to be welcomed, it is part of Dublin Corporation's policy to bring back more people to live in the inner city, and many houses which were in flats have now been changed back into family houses and people have come to <Col N="1461" /> live in this area of the city.  That is welcome, but their children have to have places to be educated and that leads to an extra demand for primary schools in the area.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish for the Department to allow a school of this nature to close. The board of management fully acknowledge the right of the Sisters of Charity to opt out of primary school education if they so wish.  However, it wishes that some arrangement might be made with the diocesan authorities to keep the primary school running as a normal primary school, or, failing that, that some arrangement could be made with the board of management to allow them to run the school in the same way as the multidenominational school at Ranelagh &mdash; to give the parents an opportunity to run the school.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated, it would be a retrograde step to close the school at Milltown.  It is a special school.  It has 150 pupils and has a higher proportion of teachers per pupil than anywhere in the rest of the country because it has some special classes.  Over a long number of years the Sisters have paid special attention to certain categories of young people who require education.  They were first in the area of educating the children of travelling people and great credit is due to them for that.  There are two classes in this school for mildly mentally handicapped children who progress through the primary school at Milltown and can then take their place in the attached secondary school and fulfil a secondary programme. This is a tribute to the educators of these children and the Sisters of Charity who run the establishment.</P>
    <P>If I was the parent of a mildly mentally handicapped child who was at this school I would be anxious for the school to stay open.  This school has a special role to play as well as being a normal national school and for that reason I ask that every avenue be examined by the Department to keep this school open.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for raising this matter and <Col N="1462" /> for being so quick off the mark.  I have to answer this same matter later tonight on the Adjournment of the Dáil.  I appreciate his sincerity in the points made and I assure him that there has been extensive consultation between the board of management and the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>St. Anne's national school for girls, Milltown, is a convent school, the trustees of which are the Irish Sisters of Charity.  For a number of years the trustees and board of management of the school have been considering the future of the school in the light of difficulties which have arisen.</P>
      <P>First, the school has experienced a sharp decline in enrolments in recent years, down from 450 to 128 in the current school year and projected to decline further.  Up to 85 per cent of the pupils come from outside the Milltown parish, so it cannot be regarded in any sense as a parish school.  Second, there is a considerable debt arising from the day to day running of the school and this is increasing annually.  Third, there are separate financial difficulties involved in maintaining a large building to cater for a relatively small number of pupils.  It has also been estimated that significant capital expenditure would be required to bring the building up to a reasonable standard.</P>
      <P>Taking all these factors into consideration, the trustees of the school have now announced that the school will close from the end of the 1994/95 school year. The Department is aware that this decision is not acceptable to parents and teachers in the school and I appreciate the concern expressed on the part of both groups.  However, the final decision regarding the closure of the school rests with the patron and trustees.  Every effort will be made to ensure that pupils will be adequately accommodated in other national schools.  The position of the teachers currently serving in the school will also be given careful consideration.</P>

      <P>There is no difficulty in having further consultations, but there have been a number of meetings.  It also appears there is no possibility of amalgamating <Col N="1464" /> the school with another school in the area, which has been a problem.  I will ask for a further meeting but I would be doubtful about its outcome.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 23 March 1994.</P>
