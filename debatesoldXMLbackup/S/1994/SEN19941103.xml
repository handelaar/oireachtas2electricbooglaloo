      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of many serious injuries caused to children, the need for the Minister for Justice to take appropriate action in relation to the availability and sale of fireworks and standards relating to same.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>We will be happy to facilitate the Leader of the House in making as much progress as possible on the Adoptive Leave Bill, 1993. However, as the Government has approximately 100 amendments on Committee Stage, progress may be slow.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House consider giving time, when the House meets again, to allow the Seanad to welcome the initiative taken by the US Government in providing the recently announced package of economic aid to Northern Ireland and the Border counties? I am not seeking a debate on Northern Ireland, which is important in itself and is a separate issue, but the House should recognise and welcome the role played by the US Government in providing this package, together with the general role which it and President Clinton have played, and are playing, in the peace process.  Will the Leader of the House provide time for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement, specifically on the role of the US Government in this area?</P>

      <P>Yesterday I raised on the Order of Business the question of an ethics committee.  There may be some misunderstanding about what I said.  I want us to address this issue as a House of the Oireachtas.  It is a matter which we could deal with as an item on the Order Paper.  The idea of people criticising the actions of people inside and outside the Government is misunderstood. Many people in both Houses do not quite understand what is expected of them in public life.  The only simple way to deal with that is to set clear standards which everybody understands, so that if there is a breach it is clearly understood.</P>
      <P>I raise that issue again this morning in the hope that it will be addressed.  Perhaps, the first place to address it would be in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is a serious issue.  It does not do the business of public representation any good for these issues to be dealt with solely in the media without us addressing them in a responsible way and without making any political capital. I am not putting this forward in a critical way.  I believe, as an Independent looking at both sides fighting with each other on these issues, that there should be standards which everybody, from the public to elected public representatives, understands.  A committee to determine standards and ethics in public life and public office needs to be established.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator O'Toole has said.  Recently we invited the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to this House to listen to statements on the North of Ireland.  Every Member without exception asked them to promote peace and do everything possible in that respect.  In that context the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach went to the US, Canada, Australia and Brussels. They were remarkably successful in obtaining goodwill and cash to fund the peace process.  They were successful beyond our wildest dreams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> When they returned that aspect seemed to be missed.  All that was taken up was the cost of the Government jet. It reminds me of small boys throwing mud at a wall.  At first a small amount sticks, but if they continue to do it for a long time a lot sticks.  That is what is happening in this case.  Since we sent the Taoiseach and Tánaiste there to do what we asked them to do &mdash; and they did a very good job &mdash; I think that rather than pick loopholes in what they did, we should be praising them.  I support what Senator O'Toole has requested.</P>

      <P>Following on from what Senator Neville said, I ask the Leader of the House to try to pass on to this and other Departments that the way in which amendments arrived here in the last couple of days is totally unsatisfactory. I know that it is not his fault and that he shares my concern.  It is not fair to either our spokespeople or the staff here.  Amendments are probably dropped into Leinster House by the staff of Departments on their way to the DART station.  They then have to be processed by the staff of this House.  We will not oppose the Order of Business today.  However, if in future a whole string of amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If there is already agreement on this, as there appears to be &mdash; Senator O'Toole referred to the empty seats on this side of the House &mdash; we are setting a very bad example to the nation.  We have been in recess for three months and are back only a couple of weeks.  It now appears that the Leader is likely to suggest that we do not meet next week.</P>
      <P>Last week the Leader gave us a list of the legislative plans for this session, which are long, detailed and in great need of debate.  To immediately then set out a standard that we are not going to meet for another two weeks seems to be a decision which we should reconsider. I urge the Leader to give serious consideration to this.  I will be accused of being naive, as I was the last time, but I believe that this is something to which we should give serious attention &mdash; our image before the nation.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Neville's request for this House to get an opportunity to discuss the American contribution to the peace process. However, we should try to keep it in proportion.  A cartoon in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> very vividly portrays that the American contribution is £12 million spread over two years.  The British Government has poured £3.5 billion per annum into Northern Ireland.  In financial terms, the American contribution is not all that marvellous.</P>

      <P>With regard to Senator Neville's and Senator Wilson's call for a debate on the US package, I would welcome such a debate insofar as it is not the monetary aspect which is most important but the absolute commitment of the President of the United States to the whole peace process.  I am sure that every Member of this House would like an opportunity to expand on that.</P>
      <P>With regard to an ethics committee, I am sure that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges may well get a chance to discuss the possibility of forming such a committee.  We also have an information officer to whom we may want to speak again in relation to some of the Senator's comments.

      <Col N="767" /> Government amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 4, to delete from and including &ldquo;, and where&rdquo; in line 27 down to and including &ldquo;of placement&rdquo; in line 32.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments will broaden the entitlement of an adopting father to adoptive leave in circumstances where the adopting mother has died.  The amendments will bring the provisions of the Bill in line with the Maternity Protection Bill in this regard.  The amendments replace provisions in the Bill as circulated which would have confined the adopting father's eligibility to cases where the adopting mother already had an entitlement under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am aware that it is most unusual to take so many amendments together in this way.  I appreciate the indulgence of the Seanad on this occasion.  The only mitigating circumstance I can offer is my concern to ensure correspondence between the provisions of this Bill and the Maternity Protection Bill, which was only published in recent weeks.  As a result, I hope that Members will understand the circumstances that have given rise to my having to bring forward such a large group of Government amendments.</P>
      <P>I would like to explain the details of the amendments proposed.  The substantive amendments are amendment No. 28 in section 9, amendment No. 35 in section 10 and amendment No. 41 in section 11.  I propose to deal first with the three substantive amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 is the first of three substantive amendments that will modify the terms of the Bill so as to give adoptive and additional adoptive leave to an adopting father where the adopting mother has died, irrespective of whether the adopting mother was herself eligible for adoptive leave.  Amendment No. 28 replaces section 9(1) of the Bill.  The amendment will entitle an adopting father to leave from the time of the death of the adopting mother <Col N="768" /> until ten weeks after the day of placement. The amendment also provides that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, with the consent of the Ministers for Social Welfare and Finance, may vary the period by order should there be a need to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 35 is the second substantive amendment which broadens the scope of the existing provision relating to additional adoptive leave for fathers in section 10 (1) in line with the earlier amendment No. 28.  The amendment also assigns powers which enable the Minister, with the consent of the Ministers for Social Welfare and Finance, to vary by order the period of leave provided in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 41 is the third substantive amendment which broadens the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill as they relate to additional adoptive leave for fathers in similar circumstances where a foreign adoption is involved.  The text of section 11 (1) as it stands allows an adopting father to take additional adoptive leave in circumstances where the adopting mother who had an entitlement to additional adoptive leave has died.  The present amendment would broaden the scope of the section to extend entitlement to leave to an adopting father in circumstances where the adopting mother is not employed and so would have had no entitlement to adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>I will now take the Members through the various consequential amendments. Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 modify the definitions of &ldquo;adopting father&rdquo;, &ldquo;adopting mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;adopting parent&rdquo; and insert a new definition, &ldquo;employed adopting mother&rdquo;, to take account of the substantive new provisions in sections 9, 10 and 11.  Amendment No. 1 removes the restriction on the definition of &ldquo;adopting father&rdquo; in the Bill as circulated, which confined eligibility to cases where the deceased adopting mother had an entitlement to adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 changes the definition of &ldquo;adopting mother&rdquo; to reflect the new interpretation of &ldquo;adopting father&rdquo;<Col N="769" /> in the Bill.  Amendment No. 3 introduces a definition of &ldquo;employed adopting mother&rdquo; to distinguish the case of an employed woman who would have an entitlement to leave from work from that of an adopting mother who is not employed but whose employed spouse would be eligible for the leave in the event of her death.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 69 and 73 are identical. The amendments propose to substitute the terms &ldquo;employed adopting mother&rdquo; for &ldquo;adopting mother&rdquo; in each appropriate place in the Bill.  The amendments are consequential to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which insert definitions of adopting mother and employed adopting mother in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 29 merely deletes subsection (2) of section 9.  Amendments Nos. 30 and 34 are technical amendments which replace the references in subsections 9 (3) and 9 (4) of the Bill to subsections (1) and (2) with references to subsection (1) only.  This amendment arises because subsections 9 (1) and 9 (2) have been replaced with a single subsection, the new subsection 9 (1).  Amendment No. 31 broadens the scope of the subsection which had been confined to cases where the dead adopting mother had been on adoptive leave to all cases where an adopting mother has died after the day of placement but within the ten weeks period where adoptive leave is allowable under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 36, 37, 38 and 39 are technical amendments which replace the references in sections 10 (3), 10 (4), 10 (5) and 10 (6) of the Bill to subsections (1) and (2) with references to subsection (1) alone.  These amendments arise because subsections 10 (1) and 10 (2) have been replaced with a single subsection, the new subsection 10 (1).  I ask the House to assent to these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept these amendments, which improve the Bill.  It is now <Col N="770" /> 12 months since the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  In my experience in this House it is unique to have a Bill waiting for that length of time for Committee Stage.  In fact, 12 months ago we were promised that Committee Stage would be taken within two weeks of Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I am also surprised at the number of amendments from the Government. Some 100 amendments in a relatively small Bill is again without precedent in my time in the Seanad.  Many of these amendments have come in during the past week.  The Minister and his Department had 12 months to examine this situation and supply us with the amendments. I do not have any problem with dealing with the amendments, but we should have had more time.  The time was there; this is not a rush job.  We could have had the amendments a month ago.</P>
      <P>I do not know what happened with this Bill.  It may have been introduced too quickly, or something may have happened in the Department, but the Bill has been substantially changed.  To a large extent it has been improved and extended, which I accept, but many of the improvements should have been in the Bill as published.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to explain why there has been such a change in the Bill and, in the spirit of transparency, to explain what happened in the Department which required that such extensive changes, amounting to 100 amendments, had to be proposed by the Government to make this Bill complete the job it was supposed to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Senator Neville, but I believe that if Committee Stage of the Bill had been taken within a fortnight of Second Stage, as the Minister originally hoped, it would not address the issue which it was intended to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, things have happened in the interim. The Maternity Protection Bill was not anticipated at the time and has made many changes to the type of leave which is to be made available to mothers and fathers on the birth of a child.  This Bill puts leave for adopting parents on the same footing as maternity leave for couples who have had a natural birth in the family.  It was worth waiting for this Bill.  If we had not waited we would now be amending legislation which was enacted 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one small correction. The Maternity Protection Bill was anticipated this time last year.  The House may recall that I strongly urged that changes be made to the Unfair Dismissals Act.  The Minister was intent on waiting for the Maternity Protection Act to deal with all matters covered by the European Directive on maternity. Therefore, the Maternity Protection Bill was anticipated.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville's point about the short notice on the amendments is a justifiable objection, with which I agree. However, I do not have any objection to the number of amendments.  I welcome them and support the Department which, having examined the legislation as drafted, believed that it should be improved and set about doing so.  That is how legislation should work.</P>
      <P>The amendments have arisen in the context of debate that has taken place outside the House as well as items which were raised on Second Stage.  I welcome very much the content of the group of the amendments we are discussing. Many people will see them as a determined, sensitive and supportive attempt to deal with a particular problem.  A number of consequential changes are required throughout the Bill to make it work.  I believe that all angles have been covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adoptive leave is very important. Adopting parents often feel that they are not as well regarded by the State and the rest of us as are natural parents, but this Bill is a clear signal of the <Col N="772" /> importance we give them.  Representations have been made to me by teachers who adopted and believed that they were treated less well than colleagues who were natural parents.  This Bill gives a great sense of status to adopting parents and also makes them feel that they have all the support available to other parents.  Why should they not have the same support?</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments and I congratulate the Minister for grasping this nettle.  However, I agree with Senator Neville that in future we should be given more time to read through so many changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Senators' comments on this issue.  What we are doing here is in the best tradition of the legislative process.  This process is about getting the legislation right.  We have Second Stage, Committee Stage and so forth to ensure that we can incorporate amendments in our legislation where necessary.  The five Stages allow time for reflection and for the evolutionary process, as it were, to take place.  That happened in the case of the Maternity Protection Bill, which we had to align with this Bill.  The Maternity Protection Bill has been before the Dáil during the last few days.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that there is a large number of amendments.  However, this block of amendments is a major slice of the total number.  The important consideration is that the amendments are achieving major improvements in this important and sensitive legislation. We are extending the scope of the legislation and that will be welcomed by many people.  I am grateful for the Senators' co-operation in that regard.</P>

      <P>This amendment, together with amendment No. 6, will bring the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in this Bill into conformity with that in the Maternity Protection Bill which is at present before the Dáil.  The definition in the Adoptive Leave Bill as published reflects the definition in the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, which is about to be replaced in the new Bill.  The substantive differences between the definition in the Bill as published and the new definition involve a broadening in the scope of the definition to encompass persons <Col N="774" /> employed through employment agencies.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 defines &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo; for the purposes of the legislation.  Paragraph (b) of this amendment, together with subsection (2) (c) of amendment No. 7, will provide for the application of the Bill to persons employed through employment agencies. Paragraph (a) of the definition specifies that contracts of employment will include all contracts of service or apprenticeship.  Amendment No. 7 provides for the deeming of a public service appointment as a contract of service for the purposes of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 inserts definitions of employer and employee into section 2 of the Bill.  The amendments are technical in nature and similar to that provided in other labour protection legislation. Amendment No. 7 will insert a new subsection in section 2 of the Bill. Paragraphs (a) and (b) are standard provisions common in employment protection legislation and will extend the scope of the definition of &ldquo;contract of service&rdquo; to public servants by deeming their terms of service to be contracts of employment for the purposes of the Bill.  Paragraph (c) designates the person who pays the wages of the agency worker as the person who would be deemed to be the employer for the purposes of the legislation.</P>
      <P>This amendment, together with amendment No. 4, will admit agency workers to the scope of the Bill.  I ask the House to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16 to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) having, as soon as practical but not later than one week after having registered with an adoption society for the purpose of adopting, caused her employer to be notified in writing of her intention to adopt.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to cater for a situation where a person obtains less than four weeks notice of adoption.  At present adoptive parents are often given very short notice that a baby is available for adoption.  From an employer's point of view four weeks notice would be necessary.  However, in practice it would be difficult for adopting parents to give the employer four weeks notice of a placement since few adoptive parents are themselves given four weeks notice of the adoptive placement.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 attempts to counteract the difficulty employees might have in giving employers notice that they had applied for adoption or that they had registered with an adoption society for the purpose of a foreign adoption.  They would give one week's notice of the adoption taking place.</P>
      <P>My fear is that adoption societies which are placing foreign adoptions might decide, if a person is in employment and must give four weeks notice, to opt for somebody who is not in employment so that an adoption can take place immediately or within a few days.  If a person is in employment the adoption could take four weeks because of the need to give four weeks notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Neville for his useful contribution to the consideration of the Bill.  I understand his concern to ensure that adoptive parents can secure adoptive leave as soon as they need it and that employers are <Col N="778" /> given adequate notice of their expected absence from work.</P>
      <P>Having examined the amendments I am concerned about how they might apply in practice.  There may be a considerable timelag between the application to a registered adoption society or health board and the placement of a child for adoption.  Notification of an employer for anything up to two or three years before the employee takes adoptive leave would not be of practical benefit to her employer and it might, indeed, prejudice the position of the employee.  Secondly, for various reasons not everybody who makes an initial application for the placement of a child with a view to an adoption adopts a child eventually.  A person who is considering adopting a child might wish to maintain confidentiality about their intentions at least until it is clear that a child will be placed for adoption.  It would be better if this legislation placed no obligation on an employee that might interfere with that confidentiality. It should be noted that the Bill provides for notification of an employer at least four weeks before the expected day of placement.  The legislation does not prevent an employee from giving a longer period of notification to her employer.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I ask Senator Neville to review his approach to this issue and to withdraw his amendment. It may be useful to note that persons wishing to adopt a child do not register with an adoption society but rather make an application to a registered adoption society or a health board in the case of an adoption in Ireland.  For foreign adopters a declaration of eligibility and suitability must be obtained from our health board or a registered adoption society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point on amendment No. 14.  However, on amendment No. 10, does the Minister not accept that, given current practice, it is unusual for adoptive parents to get four weeks notice of the adoption? It is not unknown for parents to receive <Col N="779" /> one day's notice of the placement.  An adoption society rings them up and says they are pleased to inform them that they are now in a position to place a child with them.  I know of people who received one or two day's notice of the placement.  Four weeks in such circumstances does not gel well with the present practice.  I agree that employers must get notice and one week's notice should be acceptable under the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I fear a situation developing where adoptive societies &mdash; we discussed the deficiencies in the whole adoption process on Second Stage &mdash; will say that they cannot place a child with a person who is employed.  They may say that they have a child but cannot wait four weeks because that person must give four weeks notice, so they may look at the other applicants and find somebody who is not employed and who can adopt immediately.  There might be a certain discrimination by adoption societies towards employed people who have requested adoption.</P>

      <P>It is important to distinguish between knowledge of the fact that the employee will adopt, which must be communicated no later than four weeks beforehand under section 7 (1) (a), and knowledge of the date of placement, which must only be notified as soon as is reasonably practicable under section 7 (1) (b).  The difficulty with Senator Neville's amendment is that it would breach confidentiality.  It would involve the applicant, the adopting mother, notifying her employer that she had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was also unsure that I read it correctly.  I know exactly what Senator Neville is trying to achieve.  If I thought that this was not incorporated in the Bill, it would be useful to a large number of people, particularly mothers who are working, to ensure that it was covered.  However, my reading of section 7 (1) (b) is that it covers exactly what Senator Neville intends to achieve.  If a couple seek to adopt a child, presumably the mother can inform the employer at any period. Subsection (1) (b) covers the eventuality of short notice of a baby becoming available.  This is my reading of it and it covers what Senator Neville is trying to achieve in his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my reading of it.  Section 7 (1) (a) states:</P>
      <P>...entitlement to the minimum period of adoptive leave shall be subject to an adopting mother... having, as soon as is reasonably practicable but not later than 4 weeks before the expected day of placement,...</P>
      <P>If an adoption society telephones parents, as they do, and informs them that in one week a placement will take place, they will not then be in a position to give four weeks notice to their employer.  They will not be in a position to get their full adoptive leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if one week is inserted, it will not cover the case mentioned by the Senator.  I may be wrong, but section 7 (1) (b) strengthens the aim the Senator is trying to achieve.  If one gets a telephone call saying that a baby is available and one requires leave after a week's notice, it still will not cover the <Col N="781" /> eventuality mentioned by the Senator. Subsection (1) (b) states &ldquo;as soon as is reasonably practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully that it does not cover the situation, but it improves it from four weeks to one week.  I appreciate the point, but it is unfair to ask an employer to allow somebody to take leave on a day's notice.  Given the way adoption societies act at present, the necessity to give four weeks notice may discriminate against working parents obtaining an adoption.  My understanding is that to obtain leave one must give four weeks notice and then confirm the placement date within that four weeks.  One must get information of the expected date of placement.</P>
      <P>The adoption society says &ldquo;This is the expected date&rdquo; but in the main at present they do not talk about the expected date and say that a child is available.  It is most unsatisfactory but that is the way it operates.  In most cases they do not get one week, but one week is reasonable.  There should be a rule that adoption societies must give a period of notice.  They do not do so at present.  I agree with Senator McGennis that even one week will cause difficulties for some.  However, four weeks could put people outside the scope of adoption with some of the societies.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 11 would in the case of a domestic adoption have the effect of requiring an adopting mother, or sole male adopter, to give her employer only one weeks notice of her intention to take adoptive leave.  In drawing up this legislation I was conscious of the need to strike a balance between how its provisions would affect both employers and employees.  I consider that I have struck the right balance in providing that an adopting mother, or sole male adopter, must give her employer four weeks notice of her intention to take adoptive leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This notification period, which is similar to that contained in the maternity legislation, will enable the employer to make any arrangements which may be necessitated by the absence on adoptive leave of the adopting mother, or sole male adopter.  At the same time, the four week notification requirement for the employee cannot be considered too onerous an obligation, particularly since subsection (1) (b) is even more flexible from the point of <Col N="783" /> view of the employee as regards notification of the actual date of placement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to strike a balance between the position of the employee and the employer.  The employer's position has to be considered. He must get a reasonable notification of a change in circumstances in the employment that might radically affect his business and the people working for him.  We have struck a reasonable balance in section 7 (1) between paragraphs (a) and (b).  We are saying that notification should be &ldquo;as soon as is reasonably practicable but not later than 4 weeks before the expected date of placement&rdquo;&mdash; note that it says &ldquo;the expected date of placement&rdquo;.  It would be an unusual circumstance, as far as I am aware, where one would have the expected date of placement and the placement coming up within a week. From what I know it would not all happen that quickly with the application and a placement happening within a week or two.</P>
      <P>The requirement is reasonable in that the notification has to be given as soon as is reasonably practicable but not later than four weeks before the expected date of placement, and then as soon as is reasonably practicable the employer must be notified in writing of the date of placement itself once it has been given to the adopting mother.  That is a reasonable balance.</P>

      <P>It would not be open and it would not be reasonable to expect it to be open to an employee to come to an employer who does not know anything about an intended application for adoptive leave and say that they would be off the next day on that account. That would not be reasonable.  I would imagine that if a person applies to an adoption society it would be a long time before something happens; the first stage would be that a communication would be sent to say that something is happening and a possibility is coming up for the applicant.  At that point it is reasonable enough for the employee to go to the employer and inform them of the situation and notify them that they will be taking leave within a month or two.  The next stage would be that the society would communicate with the <Col N="785" /> adoptive mother and notify her that the placement would take place on a certain date.  She can then immediately notify the employer as that would be &ldquo;as soon as is reasonably practicable&rdquo;.  It is a fair balance.</P>

      <P>My point is that if an adoption society gives less than four weeks notice of the expected date of placement, does the parent have to give four weeks notice under this Bill?  If the adoption society gives two weeks notice, for example, to the parent of the expected date of placement, the parent will not be in a position to give the four weeks notice.  Will they have to tell the adoption society to postpone it for a further two weeks to comply with the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to give four weeks notice.  From the time the employer knows nothing at all about the adoption, knows nothing about the intention or the application to adopt, the employer must get at least four weeks notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In the example I have given the parents would have to inform the adoption society that they could not accept the child for a further two weeks because they have been given only two weeks notice of the expected date of placement and the parents must give four weeks notice to the employer.  My concern is that adoption societies will look at this and may discriminate.  If the adoption society wants to have an adoption for a child within the four week period, they will look at people other than those in employment who must give four weeks notice and, thereby, discriminate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment would reduce the notice time to one week.  I accept that under all circumstances four weeks notice should be given to an employer, but because of their procedures the adoption societies do not on all occasions give four weeks notice of the expected date of placement.  If the notice period is left at four weeks there <Col N="786" /> is likely to be discrimination.  Adoption societies would be tempted to look at parents who do not have the restriction of giving four weeks notice to their employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would doubt that any adoption society would exercise discrimination in that manner or would make their decisions as to whom they place a child with on that basis.  I would not accept that that would happen.  I take the view that while it could be that the actual date of placement given by a society to an intending adopting mother could be in less than four weeks from the date, the expected date of placement, which would be at an earlier stage in the process, would in the overwhelming majority of cases be conveyed well before the four week period.  That being so, it is perfectly reasonable to strike a balance between the position of the employee and the employer whereby at least four weeks in advance of that employee taking the ten weeks adoptive leave the employer would be aware of the position.</P>
      <P>In the overwhelming majority of cases, if not in all cases, the adopting mother would have an approximate idea given to her of the expected date of placement.  The actual date of placement, which is the follow up position, could come at much shorter notice.  I would imagine that that would hardly be a phone call the day before; rather more notice would be given.  Adoption societies know that the arrival of a new child in a household requires preparation.  It is not something that would be imposed at a moment's notice; it requires mental preparation and preparation of the physical conditions that would be necessary for the child.  They act responsibly and in most cases the appropriate notice would be given to enable the adopting parents to make the proper provisions.

      <P>This amendment will address a lacuna in section 8 (6) (a) of the Bill as published.  This paragraph sets down the arrangements for notifying the employer with which an adopting mother or sole male adopter should comply in order to avail of additional adoptive leave before the day of placement in certain foreign adoption cases. The section as drafted would allow notification of the employer without any indication of the intended date of commencement of the leave.  The proposed substitution through this amendment would fill this lacuna, thus giving the employer the necessary basis for putting arrangements in hand to cope with the employee's absence on leave.  I recommend the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to add a new subsection to section 8.  The section deals with entitlement to additional adoptive leave, which may be taken immediately after adoptive leave in a normal case; or some or all of the leave may be taken before the day of placement in the case of a foreign adoption. The subsection will clarify that additional adoptive leave, whether taken before or after the day of placement, should be continuous with the period of adoptive leave.  Section 8 (1) makes clear that additional adoptive leave taken after adoptive leave must immediately follow that leave.  The new section 8 (8) will provide similarly for additional adoptive leave which precedes adoptive leave.</P>

      <P>This amendment makes an insertion into section 9 (3) (b).  This paragraph requires an adopting father to inform his employer of the day of placement of the child.  The paragraph might be more broadly interpreted than intended in a case where the child had yet to be placed with the adopting father.  In such a case the paragraph could be interpreted as allowing the adopting father the option of informing his employer either of the expected day of placement in advance or wait until the child had been placed before informing the employer of the date. Such latter interpretation could leave the employer without information about <Col N="792" /> the timing of the placement that would otherwise be available to him.  Insertion of the words &ldquo;as may be appropriate&rdquo; removes the ambiguity of interpretation when the paragraph is read together with subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of the earlier paragraph (a).  I ask the House to assent to this technical proposal.</P>

      <P>As drafted section 9 (3) (d) would require an adopting father who wished to avail of adoptive leave to provide documentary proof, by way of a death certificate of the adopting mother, of his eligibility for adoptive leave.  This amendment limits the requirement to produce such evidence to cases where it is requested by the employer.  Amendment No. 42 is identical in effect in respect of a similar provision of section 11 (2) (c) of the Bill.

      <P>This amendment replaces the word &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo; in section 12 (3).  The subsection is intended to deal with the return to work of an adoptive parent who has taken leave before the date of placement in connection with a foreign adoption but who fails to secure the placement of a child with him or her. The text as drafted confines the term of the section to a case where no adoption has taken place.  However, many foreign adoptions involve placement of a child <Col N="798" /> with adopting parents for some considerable time before the actual adoption. The amendment would broaden the scope of the provision to include such cases by substitution for &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; of the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo;, which, by virtue of the definition in subsection (2), would cover either an adoption or a placement made with a view to adoption.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 64 is a technical amendment which alters the reference in section 20 (2) to &ldquo;the rights commissioner&rdquo; with the more appropriate reference to &ldquo;a rights commissioner&rdquo; since there are a number of them. Amendment No. 65 is a technical amendment which addresses two points in section 20 (3).  One point is identical to that in amendment No. 64, that is, the replacement of the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; for &ldquo;the&rdquo; in the reference to a rights commissioner in the section.  The second point relates to a lacuna in the Bill as circulated which does not include a reference to the Circuit Court in relation to the powers assigned in the subsection. The reference is necessary since the Circuit Court is the court of appeal in relation to cases under unfair dismissals legislation.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments. However, under the 1977 Unfair Dismissals Act, as amended, there are three options of which the Employment Appeals Tribunal can avail: reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation. We should hope that in all cases this would be reinstatement.  Nobody should ever lose a job because of circumstances surrounding adoption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the substantive amendments Nos. 103 and 104 first.  Amendment No. 103 inserts a new section 42 in the Bill.  Section 42 sets down transitional arrangements for the grant of adoptive leave in the initial period following commencement of the legislation.  Subsection (1) establishes a right to adoptive leave for adopting parents with whom a child has been placed in the ten weeks before commencement of the legislation.  The leave allowable in <Col N="803" /> any case will be equal to the amount of the ten week period after placement or is left to run after the commencement date.  Subsections (2) and (3) require an adopting parent to commence the leave within seven days of the coming into operation of the legislation and to inform the employer of the date of commencement of the leave as soon as is reasonably practicable.  Subsection (6) allows the employer to defer the date of commencement of the leave for up to two weeks.  Subsection (4) sets down alternative notification arrangements relating to the certificate of placement and analogous documentation in the case of foreign adoptions, as the normal time frame for notification may not be achievable in some cases covered by the new section.  Subsection (5) sets out the notification requirement for an adoptive father under this section.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 104 inserts a new section 43 in the Bill.  Section 43 sets down the transitional arrangements for the grant of additional adoptive leave in the initial period following commencement of the legislation.  Subsection (1) establishes a right to additional adoptive leave for adoptive parents who have taken adoptive leave under the new section 42.  Subsection (2) requires that the leave should commence immediately after adoptive leave and sets down the arrangements for notifying the employer.  Paragraph (a) requires that the adopting parent notify the employer of her intention to take additional adoptive leave at the same time as notifying him or her of the date of commencement of adoptive leave under section 42, unless the time allows the employee to give notice in accordance with the normal advance notice period of four weeks which was set out in paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 62 is a consequential amendment which arises from the insertion of the new Part VI, Miscellaneous and Transitional Provisions.  That part provides, among other things, for the taking of leave under the legislation during the period immediately following commencement of the legislation.  As it <Col N="804" /> stands, section 17 renders void notice of termination of employment after the employer has been made aware of the employee's intention to take the leave provided for in sections 6, 8, 9 and 11 of the Bill.  The section now needs to be extended to take account of the notice provisions in the new Part VI.  Rather than add reference to the new sections to the existing list of four sections, the amendment makes general reference to adoptive and additional adoptive leave.</P>

The time period for notification in subsection (1) differs from that in an equivalent provision, section 28 (1) of the Maternity Protection Bill, 1994, which is before the Dáil at present.

      <P>Section 21 of the Bill provides for return to work arrangements in circumstances where layoff, strike or other circumstances prevent the adopting parent from returning to work immediately on cessation of the period of adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave.  The latitude to return to work at a later date in these circumstances is given only to adoptive parents who return to work in the normal course after notifying the employer of the intention to return to work under section 20 of the Bill.  The minority of adoptive parents covered by the arrangement provided in section 12 of the Bill, those who return to work after the termination of a placement or where there has been no placement, are outside the scope of the Bill.

      <P>I will discuss amendments Nos. 71 and 72 together.  When section 25 was originally drafted, the provision followed closely the line adopted in the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, relating to the amendment of section 6 (2) of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  The 1981 Act is currently being amended by the Maternity Protection Bill, 1994, which is required to meet obligations arising under the EU pregnant workers Directive.  In responding to such obligations the Maternity Protection Bill, 1994, will remove certain exclusions under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, which up to now precluded its application in respect of a number of groups of employees.  This Bill should also remove exclusions under the 1977 Act in respect of dismissal arising from adoptive leave. Accordingly, these two amendments have been prepared so that the categories of workers excluded under the 1981 amendment of the 1977 Act and now included under the Maternity Protection Bill, 1994, can also be covered in this Adoptive Leave Bill, 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment will bring all employees, except members of the Defence Forces, within the scope of the redress and remedy provisions of the Bill.  In the Bill as published only employees within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, come within the scope of the redress mechanism of the Bill.  Public servants were in general excluded from these provisions, for example, members of the Garda Síochána, civil servants, local authority officers, etc.  It has now been decided to bring these categories of employees within the scope of the Bill, in line with a similar provision in the Maternity Protection Bill, 1994.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces will continue to be excluded from the redress and remedy provisions of the Bill because they have their own statutory redress system. Section 114 of the Defence Act, 1954, provides that any member of the Defence Forces who thinks that she or he is being wronged in any way whatsoever may submit an application for a redress of wrongs.  This section of the Defence Act provides that such an application for redress should ultimately be submitted to the Minister for Defence for final decision.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this statutory provision which has worked well since 1954 and which is compatible with the military system provides a more than satisfactory system for redress for members of the Defence Forces in the highly unlikely situation of their requiring it in connection with the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 32 of the Bill deals with the initial reference of disputes only and provides that any dispute under the legislation is referred initially to a rights commissioner.  Section 35 provides for an appeal from a decision of a rights commissioner to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The proposed amendment would have the effect of allowing the dispute to be referred initially to either a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I thank Senator Neville for his contribution on this amendment and for his comments in the course of the debate generally.</P>
      <P>The question then arises as to the appropriate locus for appeal from a decision of the tribunal.  There may be a view that a review of the structure of the tribunal may solve issues such as these, but I think the current legislation is not the vehicle for such broad ranging change.  In any event, the limited nature of the issues is probably more appropriate to a rights commissioner in the first instance, with the right of appeal to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>Section 34, as circulated, provided a notification period for a referral of a dispute that might have <Col N="814" /> been very short in some cases.  This is because that six month period allowed for appeal would have dated from the first notification by the employee to the employer of her intention to take adoptive leave.  The proposed amendment makes a more flexible provision by allowing the referral period to run from the date of the initial notification to the employer of intention to take leave or from the date of placement, whichever is appropriate.  Special provision is also made for an adoptive father.</P>

      <P>Section 35 (2), as circulated, requires the Employment Appeals Tribunal to give a copy of the notices of appeal to the other party within a week of receipt of the appeal in the case where the appeal is lodged at the last moment.  This amendment sets no specific deadline of this nature but requires the tribunal to give a copy of the notice to the other party as soon as may be after receipt of the notice. The amendment arises from concern expressed by the tribunal that in the extreme case &mdash; for example, over the Christmas break &mdash; it might not be possible to serve the notice in the time specified and the appeal might fall on that ground.  The text of the amendment is in line with a similar provision in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1993, and with an amendment of the maternity legislation which is under consideration in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Section 35(4)(d) makes provision in relation to persons who do not attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and who fail to give evidence before it.  The text of the paragraph in the Bill as circulated requires the Minister to prove that the person refused or wilfully neglected to attend before the tribunal or refused or wilfully failed to produce evidence in order to secure a conviction.  This level of proof would be very difficult to secure in practice and so it is proposed to require only that the Minister show that the person has failed without just cause to attend before the tribunal or to produce evidence. This amendment deals with two issues by the insertion of two new subsections into section 35.  The new subsection (5) specifies that it is the Minister who may bring and prosecute proceedings for an offence under paragraphs (b) and (d) of subsection (4). The new subsection (6) sets out certain evidential information required in order to establish a case against a person who has failed without just cause to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal or to furnish evidence.  The text is similar to that employed in recent labour <Col N="817" /> legislation such as the Industrial Relations Act, 1989, in respect of the Labour Court and the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993, in respect of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>

The period for an appeal set down in section 35 (2) is four weeks.  There is considerable logic in providing that the latest date for implementation of the finding should coincide with the latest date for appeal, so that on that date the party against whom the finding is made either complies with the finding or appeals it. Accordingly, I propose to change the implementation date specified in section 39 (1) (b) from six weeks to four weeks to coincide with the end of the appeal period.

    <P>(5) An employer, who receives a notification under this section within 2 weeks of the notified day of commencement of the leave, may require the adopting parent to delay commencement of the leave in respect of which the notification was given for up to 2 weeks from the day on which the notification was received.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with two exceptional circumstances in which an employee could not be in a position to comply with the notification requirements for eligibility for leave under the various sections of the Bill. The amendment involves the addition of a new section, section 41, which provides for alternative notification procedures in these cases.  Subsections (1) and (2) of the new section deal with one of the exceptional circumstances: the case of an adopting parent who wishes to take adoptive leave in the weeks immediately following the commencement of employment.  Subsections (3) and (4) deal with the other exceptional circumstance: the case of an adopting parent who wishes to take adoptive leave in the weeks immediately following commencement of the legislation.  In either case the adopting parent will be unable to comply with the four weeks advance notice required for eligibility specified in Part II of the Bill.  The section will allow such an adopting parent to give notice of intention to take the leave to her employer as soon as is reasonably practicable but no later than the date of commencement of the leave. These notice arrangements are favourable to the employee and could leave an employer without an employee at short notice.  To minimise disruption to the employer, subsection (5) will allow the <Col N="825" /> employer to defer the date of commencement of the leave for up to two weeks if the employee has given the employer less than two weeks notice of the date of commencement of the leave.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 105 inserts a new section, section 44, into the Bill.  Section 44 sets down the notification arrangements which will apply in relation to the return to work of adoptive parents who have taken leave under sections 42 and 43 of the Bill.  Subsection (1) requires that the adopting parent should notify her employer if she intends to return to work after the leave either at the same time as she notifies him or her of her intention to take the leave or, if time allows, in accordance with the normal advance notice period of four weeks.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) ensures that section 20 of the Bill will be construed so as to include a reference to an adopting parent returning to work after taking adoptive leave under sections 42 and 43. Section 20 (2) is of particular relevance since it allows the rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal to examine the reasons an employee may not have given the appropriate notice of return to work and to extend the period for notification in exceptional cases.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact the Bill has gone through the House.  We all agreed that it should pass as quickly as possible because it is necessary that it be on the Statute Book; as we said on Second Stage, it should have been on the Statute Book for the past ten years. I am pleased the Minister referred to the fact that issues relating to adoption in general are being looked at and that legislation is being considered.  I ask him to look at the amendments which were ruled out of order because they do not relate to adoptive leave but with adoption <i>per se.</i></P>
      <P>Issues such as property rights are of concern to adopted children and adoptive parents.  One of my amendments attempted to correct the issues which have arisen around that.  I understand the Minister is addressing the issue of tracing parents and discrimination in adoption, particularly age discrimination and, indeed, against employed mothers.  I ask the Minister to look at that area, although I appreciate it is not in line with this Bill.  We welcome this Bill going through and hope it has a speedier passage through the Dáil than it had through the Seanad because it took 12 months.</P>

      <P>I also thank the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House.  I promise this will be a less emotional contribution than on the last occasion I spoke on this issue.  As Senator O'Toole said, this is important legislation because it gives the lie to the view that the parents of adopted children are held in less regard by the State. Under this legislation they are entitled to the same treatment as other parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Neville said.  I know it is not the purpose of this legislation but I have been inundated with letters and submissions from individuals because of the introduction of this legislation and the Minister is aware of the details of some of these cases. There is a need for a contact register. <Col N="830" /> Over 90 per cent of adoption cases go through the Adoption Board and work well but there are a small number of cases in which the birth mother does not sign the final consent and the adoption is left in limbo.  Not alone is maternity leave not available but they must pursue the final adoption to the High Court.  A myriad of difficulties are associated with the adoption area.</P>
    <P>I met the Minister and the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and I know this Government has a huge legislative programme and priorities with which it must deal &mdash; including the Child Care Act and the need to protect children but because this is an area which causes anguish to birth mothers, adoptive parents and children, I hope the Minister will work with his colleague, the Minister for Health, to try to progress the issues which Barnardos, adoptive parents and the Adoptive Parents Association have highlighted.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Cathaoirleach and Senators for their considered and speedy consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I appreciate the facility given to me by the Seanad in view of the lack of haste in bringing the Bill back on Committee Stage and I apologise for that.  I noted the concerns of Senator Neville and Senator O'Toole as regards the timing of Committee Stage and the publication of the amendments. Particular circumstances gave rise to that which I regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I allayed the fears of Senator Neville about the notice periods in section 7.  The approach taken on this section was decided after due consideration of the adoption process and in <Col N="831" /> consultation with Department of Health.  I will, however, review the matter further as agreed in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Neville, Senator McGennis and others for their helpful interventions.  I express my appreciation for the cordial way I have been received on this occasion, as I always am.  I appreciate the informal yet efficient way in which the House conducts its business. I am pleased this important legislation has signally advanced and it is my intention to process it finally through the Dáil with all possible speed.  It is a measure which should have been on the Statute Book many years ago but at least we have made substantial progress with the co-operation of the House.</P>
    <P>Many intending adoptive parents are waiting for this legislation to be enacted. It is an important piece of social progress. I express my thanks and appreciation to members of my staff who worked long and hard on the complex amendments before the House today and I appreciate their contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this important matter, Sir.  Regrettably once again this Halloween weekend we read that a number of young children and youths have had to attend hospital following injuries received from fireworks; some, unfortunately, will have permanent injuries.  I read in the paper of people sustaining serious injuries to their fingers and their eyes and of serious scarring.  It is regrettable that these accidents can arise from what is supposed to be a happy, lighthearted event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one wants to be a spoil sport but we read of old people being terrified by <Col N="832" /> the placing of fireworks and bangers in post boxes.  These activities cause great distress, particularly to old people living alone.  As I said, no one wants to spoil the normal fun and festivities associated with Halloween &mdash; the dressing up, knocking at doors, etc. &mdash; but it is clear that the Minister should examine the availability of fireworks, their sale, and in particular the standards of safety in relation to their use.</P>
    <P>Some of these fireworks are imported and they are not safe.  Where cheap imports are used, innocent consumers have no recourse should there be an accident, or if the fireworks are faulty or unsafe.  The Department should examine this matter and liaise with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The way these cheap fireworks become available also leaves room for improvement.  Last weekend some young people lost their sight and others suffered extensive damage to their faces and hands.  Action will have to be taken. There should be an immediate investigation into area.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there was rowdy behaviour at some bonfires and gangs ran riot.  People were injured, there was damage to property, cars were set alight, etc.  These activities are far beyond the normal enjoyment of the traditional fun at this time of the year and put an unnecessary strain on the emergency services.  I read in one report that at times there was one call every minute for the emergency services over the Halloween weekend.  Some of these were hoaxes but the emergency services have to respond.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond positively to my request.  Before next Halloween, certain safeguards should be in place regarding the standard of fireworks and their sale, it should be illegal to sell cheap and dangerous imports. This is not an easy problem to resolve but I am sure the Minister, like myself, has read about some of these accidents. When we see some of our young people <Col N="833" /> permanently scarred and the hardship and sadness this has brought to their parents and relatives, it is clear that action is required.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond positively, to investigate the matter and to report to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has raised a very important and topical issue today and one which the Minister for Justice addressed very recently. However, let me now take the opportunity to outline again the position in relation to the importation of fireworks.</P>
      <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875, a licence is required to be issued by my Department for the importation of fireworks. It is a longstanding policy that such licences are only issued for organised fireworks displays conducted by competent, professional operators.</P>
      <P>That said, it is clear to everyone that not all the fireworks entering the country are destined for such controlled use and that quantities of illegally imported fireworks, some of very dubious quality indeed, are finding their way on to our streets and into the hands of young people and children in particular.  For obvious reasons, the problem is more acute at this time each year when certain traders seek to maximise their profits by importing illegally as many fireworks, bangers, etc., as they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice indicated recently that measures are being taken by the Garda to deal with this problem and it is worth taking this opportunity to reiterate these measures which include the setting up of a special Garda unit in Dublin to combat the sale and distribution of illegally imported fireworks, the deployment of personnel to known trouble areas to deal specifically with the problem as well as liaison with local authorities and the fire brigade service.  Warnings on the dangers connected <Col N="834" /> with fires and fireworks were also broadcast on all local radio stations in the days leading up to Halloween.</P>
    <P>The vigilance of the Garda means that substantial quantities of illegally imported and potentially dangerous fireworks are seized and subsequently destroyed.  Last year's seizures were valued at approximately £116,000 and this year the gardaí in Dublin kept up the tempo and confiscated substantial quantities.  A round figure of £120,000 can be put on the value of these fireworks, and during October £65,000 worth were seized in the Henry Street, Dublin, area alone.  A very close eye is kept on this illegal trade and the Garda will not hesitate to take appropriate and swift action to counter it.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that seizure by the Garda is the best way of protecting the public from the inherent dangers of fireworks. However, it is only part of the solution to this perennial problem.  Parents in particular and adults in general also have a responsibility to ensure that children are aware of the dangers posed by bangers and other fireworks and that they are strictly supervised where fireworks of any description are being used. All too often children are left to their own devices with fireworks and at bonfires with no proper adult supervision.</P>
    <P>We all saw the horrific results of some of the dreadful accidents involving fireworks which happened to children in the last few days.  It makes me wince to think of the numbers of young people and children in particular who are brought to hospitals at this time each year with torn flesh, injured eyes or fractured bones.  Halloween is a time for fun and games, not for suffering. However, it is not only children and young people who suffer.  The old and infirm can also suffer terribly through fear and apprehension caused by loud bangs when the fireworks explode.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the gardaí will, this year as every year, take all necessary <Col N="835" /> measures to deal with this illegal trade to ensure as far as possible that these items do not end up in the hands of the young and innocent.  I appeal to everyone, young and old, parents and guardians alike, to take a share of this responsibility and thereby keep the <Col N="836" /> number of dreadful injuries to an absolute minimum so that all children can fully and properly enjoy what should be a very happy, celebratory time.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 12.40 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 16 November 1994.</P>
