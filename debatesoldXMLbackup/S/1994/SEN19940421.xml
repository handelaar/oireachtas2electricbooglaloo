      <P>I have notice from Senator Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding as a matter of urgency for the Castlepollard Vocational School, Castlepollard, County Westmeath, to replace the existing outdated prefabricated structures.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline his Department's policy regarding air services to the midwest region, whose economy is highly dependent on a regular and efficient air service.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to clarify the funding being provided for the water supply to Ashbourne, County Meath, as his Department's allocation to Meath County Council of £2.61 million represents 90 per cent of the cost; and if <Col N="126" /> local householders will have to make up the difference.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Cassidy's and Taylor-Quinn's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Farrelly may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>I wish to make two points on the Order of Business.  Yesterday the House condemned Loyalist terrorism.  We strongly condemn the murder of an RUC man in Derry last night and the serious injuries caused to his two companions.  It is difficult to see how the IRA can persuade people that it is seriously considering the Downing Street Declaration and looking for peace when it continues to engage in such murderous activities.  In that context I ask the Leader of the House to take into account what I said yesterday about an early debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Next week the Government will honour the 75th anniversary of the founding and first meeting of Dáil Éireann. Earlier this year I asked the Leader of the House if it would be possible to have a two hour debate to commemorate the founding of Dáil Éireann to give us an opportunity to look at what has been achieved in Parliament since that time and to rededicate ourselves to continued reform and growth of the two Houses of Parliament.  I would like an opportunity to have a short debate in this session to commemorate the first meeting of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Senator Manning mentioned the killing in Derry last night.  I was in Derry six times during the past month in connection with the peace initiative.  For the past 18 months the people of Derry felt that peace had arrived by capillary action or osmosis throughout the community.  On a number of occasions I heard Senator McGowan speak about the co-operation between the different local councils in that area. The only evidence of the troubles in that area during the past year was the Greysteel massacre, which happened some distance outside the city, and a weak attempt to make a point at the end of the earlier ceasefire at Christmas.</P>
      <P>In addition to conveying our sympathies on the death of a member of the RUC, the heartfelt feelings of this House go out to the people of Derry because they will feel let down and we must share that feeling.  Derry has become more optimistic in the last 20 years.  It has been described to me as the fastest growing city in western Europe.  It is disgraceful for people to wreck that sense of optimism and destroy the people's hopes.  We must convey our sympathies to the public representatives on all sides in that city.  It is impossible to try to explain or justify such senseless killing.</P>
      <P>The Government was criticised yesterday about the appointment of the Ombudsman.  It was an extraordinarily sensitive, well timed and well judged appointment.  Mr. Kevin Murphy will prove to be a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the two other Senators in expressing sadness at the killing of an RUC man in Derry last night.  This comes at a time when the local authorities on both sides of the Border are outlining a programme to spend £150 million in the Border areas which have been devastated by the IRA. This programme will be sent to the EU <Col N="128" /> and to the British and Irish Governments. It is of no comfort to those living on the Border when a policeman is slaughtered in Derry.  We have often criticised the police in Northern Ireland, but 99 per cent of them are ordinary people, protecting those who have suffered so much.  We must continually condemn these actions.  We have asked for a debate on the North and I hope the Leader of the House can arrange for the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste to come here in the near future so we can have an opportunity to unite in condemnation of the continued killings in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the future of the fishing industry in view of current developments in Europe.  If everything reported in the media is true, the position is serious.  We know the Minister for the Marine is doing excellent work, but there are many obstacles in his way.  The future of the fishing industry is important to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning of a commemorative debate is worthy of serious consideration by the Whips.  At the foundation of the State we were a small offshore island, which was poor and underdeveloped.  Now we are a modern nation, although all our Governments have made mistakes through the years.</P>
      <P>The day to day business of the House is concerned with legislation and there is little time to look back, consider the past, examine the present and contemplate the future.  This House should undertake the worthwhile endeavour of looking at the past in a completely non-partisan way. These events are long behind us now and we can look at them as mature people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made many mistakes.  Senator McGowan mentioned fishing and I have always thought that the lack of a strategic plan for fishing under all Governments over many years to be one of the great shames of Irish Administrations.  I have always believed there was tremendous potential in developing our fisheries, <Col N="129" /> although that may no longer be the case because of our membership of the EU.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to consider such a debate because it would be worthwhile. When one sees the younger generation in the House this morning, it would be good if legislators looked back, examine what we have done, consider the present and chart the future.</P>

      <P>I add my voice to the condemnation of the killing in Derry last night.  The hopes of the vast majority of people in that city are being destroyed by the actions of these people.  I also call for an early debate on Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has given good expression to our feelings about the killing in Derry last night. When one talks to people from Derry and other parts of Northern Ireland, one senses a feeling that the time for peace has come.  We have felt and expressed this in the South, but when one speaks to people from the North one realises the hope for peace is genuine.  Only when one speaks to people from the area does one see what is and is not possible.  Last night's events were a real setback, especially as it occurred in Derry. Obviously, this is to be condemned wherever it happens; but one would have hoped it would not have happened where there has been so much co-operation.</P>
      <P>In considering Loyalist killings, as we did yesterday, about last night's killing in Derry, as we are today, we must remember these people are totally out of step with the feelings of the vast majority of people in the North and elsewhere.  We must condemn all these actions and hope these people will realise how isolated they are from the hopes of people in the communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, rise to condemn last night's shooting in Derry.  We in the South should be seen to do everything possible to alleviate these murderous actions in the North.  I remind the House there was a shooting in another Border area last night.  I wonder whether the increased military occupation around <Col N="130" /> Crossmaglen is adding to or reducing tension?</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because I have a treasured association with the Crossmaglen GAA club, including the late Gene Larkin and the late Gene Duffy.  I have had sympathy with them because of the occupation and harassment they have endured from the British Army on their GAA grounds.  The Irish Government should discuss this increased military occupation with the British Government and ascertain whether it is increasing or decreasing tension in the area.  I appeal to the Leader to use his influence with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the House I join in the condemnation expressed by all Senators this morning about the killing last night.  Senator O'Toole mentioned the disgust felt in Derry and we also share that.  I hope the Tánaiste will come into the House as soon as possible so this House can give its views about current events in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning suggested a debate on the 75th anniversary of the First Dáil. We will deal with that before the end of the term, as soon as possible.  We agree with the suggestion.  Senator McGowan expressed concern about the fishing industry.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill is due in the House soon.  This should allow us to express our views on the current state of that industry.</P>

      <P>This short Bill will regularise the right to Irish citizenship of persons who applied to have their births abroad entered in a foreign births entry book at an embassy or consulate abroad or in the foreign births register at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin in the transitional six month period, ending on 31 December 1986, provided for in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, but who were not registered by 31 December 1986 through no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not make any substantive changes in our citizenship laws.  Its sole objective is to deal with the applicants who wished to obtain Irish citizenship by descent but whose applications were not registered by 31 December 1986.  For the benefit of the House I will give background detail on our citizenship legislation.</P>
      <P>The last basic Act on citizenship is the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  The Act provides for five ways in which Irish citizenship can be obtained. These are: by birth in Ireland; by a declaration of acceptance of postnuptial citizenship by the spouse of an Irish citizen; by the granting of a certificate of naturalisation; by the granting of honorary citizenship; or by registration of a birth abroad.  This Bill is concerned with the fifth category, that is, registration of a birth abroad of a person who wishes to obtain Irish citizenship by virtue of descent from a person born in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing legal provisions as regards citizenship by descent are contained in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986.  The 1956 Act provides that a person born abroad of an <Col N="132" /> Irish born parent is entitled to Irish citizenship automatically.  The grandchild of an Irish-born person is also entitled to Irish citizenship provided his or her birth is registered for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The registration can be made in a foreign births entry book at an embassy or consulate abroad, or in the foreign births register at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin.  Great-grandchildren and subsequent descendants of Irish-born people are entitled to Irish citizenship provided the birth of the parent through whom they claim citizenship has been registered in either a foreign births entry book or the foreign births register.</P>
    <P>The main provisions as regards registration are contained in section 27 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  Under that Act the right to citizenship can be maintained from generation to generation provided the births in each generation are registered. However, if the birth of a grandchild or any subsequent generation is not registered the link is broken and subsequent generations would not be entitled to Irish citizenship by descent.  A crucial point in maintaining the link from generation to generation is the requirement that for grandchildren or subsequent generations the parent through whom the right of citizenship flows must be an Irish citizen on the date of birth of the applicant.</P>
    <P>In the period 1956 to 1986 the citizenship of the person whose birth was being registered was backdated to his or her date of birth or the date of coming into force of the 1956 Act, whichever was later.  If the mother of a child wanted the child to have Irish citizenship but the mother herself had not registered by the time of the birth, she could always register after the birth of her child and the mother's citizenship would apply retrospectively. Her child's birth could then be registered as the mother's citizenship would predate the birth of the child.</P>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, brought about a number of changes as regards citizenship.  These related to citizenship of spouses of Irish citizens and, of most interest to us today, the date from which the citizenship of <Col N="133" /> people registering foreign births applied. As I said, under the 1956 Act once a birth was registered the citizenship of the person registered was backdated either to his or her date of birth or the date of passing of the 1956 Act.  Under the 1986 Act, however, citizenship applies only from the date of registration.  This did away with the retrospective aspect of citizenship and gave much greater significance to the actual date of registration.  For a great grandchild of an Irish born person to be entitled to register his or her birth, the birth has to be subsequent to the date of registration of the birth of the parent through whom he or she wishes to obtain citizenship.</P>
    <P>The reasoning behind the change brought about by the 1986 Act is more easily understood if one looks at the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935. Under section 2(2) of the 1935 Act, the birth of a person born outside the State to an Irish citizen also born outside the State had to be registered within two years of the birth or else that person lost the right to be a &ldquo;natural-born citizen of Saorstát Éireann&rdquo;.  That law was changed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  The requirement to register a birth within a certain period was not maintained and it was apparently the intention that a person would only acquire citizenship on and from the date of registration of the birth.  However, in 1966 legal advice was obtained to the effect that, for the purposes of derivation of citizenship under section 6 (2) of the 1956 Act, registration of the birth under section 27, as required by section 7(2) of the 1956 Act, dates back to that person's date of birth or to the passing of the 1956 Act, whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that the 1986 Act restored the situation to that originally intended, that is, citizenship would not be backdated.  Under the 1986 Act births must be registered before the birth of next generation if the entitlement to citizenship by descent is to be maintained from one generation to the next. If a person who has to register to obtain Irish citizenship by descent does not register prior to the birth of his or her <Col N="134" /> child then that child is not entitled to Irish citizenship under the provisions of the 1986 Act.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Act was passed on 1 July 1986.  It included the following transitional provision in section 8: &ldquo;For the period of six months commencing on the passing of this Act, any person who but for this Act could become an Irish citizen may continue to do so.&rdquo;  The six months period provided for in section 8 was the six months running from 1 July to 31 December 1986.  When the provisions of the 1986 Act became known abroad the number of applicants for foreign birth registration increased enormously.  The Consulate General at New York and the Consulate at Johannesburg, in particular, received greatly increased volumes of applications.  The Department of Foreign Affairs took exceptional measures to deal with the upsurge in applications.  It employed more staff and sanctioned overtime.  As a result of the extra staff, 4,200 applications were processed in 1986.  By comparison 925 were processed in 1983, 1,270 in 1984 and 1,650 in 1985.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 4,200 applications actually processed in 1986, there was a further 10,000 applications which had not been attended to by the end of 1986. About 6,000 of these were from third generation applicants &mdash; for example, people with a grandparent born in Ireland who generally had no children and therefore were not adversely affected by the deadline.  These applicants were registered in 1987 and 1988.  However, there is a residue from the 10,000 applications, amounting to 3,773 valid applications received in 1986 from third and fourth generation applicants which were not registered.  Some 2,010 of these applicants are from South Africa and 1,341 are from the United States.  The remainder are from New Zealand and Canada.</P>
    <P>Before the end of 1986 the Department of Foreign Affairs realised that the backlog of applications could not be dealt with by the statutory deadline of 31 December 1986.  It therefore sought legal advice. The legal advice was to the effect that applicants could not benefit from the more favourable regime provided for in <Col N="135" /> the transitional provision of the 1986 Act unless the applications were actually registered by 31 December 1986.  This was of vital significance for many fourth generation applicants whose right to citizenship was dependent on registration of their parents' births by 31 December 1986.  These fourth generation applicants would not be entitled to Irish citizenship unless their parents' births were registered by that date.  They are adversely affected by the failure to register their births by 31 December 1986.</P>
    <P>These people made valid applications, including paying their fees, and it was no fault of theirs that their applications had not been registered by the statutory deadline. It was evident, therefore, that legislation was desirable to provide for these applications being regarded as registered by 31 December and, accordingly, work on the processing of such applications was suspended on 1 January 1987.</P>
    <P>These applicants are the main concern of this Bill.  The Bill provides for the registration of their births and for the registrations being regarded as having been completed by 31 December 1986. This in turn will enable their children to be registered as Irish citizens where they had made applications for registration and the registration of the children had been held up due to the inability to register the parents' births by the statutory deadline of 31 December 1986.</P>
    <P>I am sure there will be agreement in the House that it is only equitable that eligible persons who applied should be entitled to obtain Irish citizenship.  I received representations on this matter from public representatives here and, indeed, from abroad.  I am glad to be able to sponsor this legislation which will ensure that the applicants in question will receive their entitlements as regards Irish citizenship.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the sections of the Bill.  This is a short Bill which contains three sections.  Section 1 provides for definitions.  Section 3 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and construction. Section 2 is the operative section of the Bill.  The heading of section <Col N="136" /> 2 is &ldquo;Registration of Births outside Ireland&rdquo;.  As I explained, the Bill is concerned only with applications for registration made during the transitional six month period provided for in the 1986 Act but which were not registered by the end of the six month transitional period provided for in the 1986 Act and which ended on 31 December 1986.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) deals with two different circumstances.  Paragraph <i>(a)</i> deals with the outstanding 3,773 applications for registration made during the transitional period which have never been registered. It specifically provides that all such applications may now be registered.  This provision is necessary to cover those fourth generation applicants who but for this Bill would not be eligible for registration. There were many family applications by parents who where third generation Irish and their children who would be fourth generation.  The right of the fourth generation applicants to registration was directly dependent on their parents being registered by 31 December 1986.</P>
    <P>Paragraph <i>(b)</i> deals with persons who applied for registration during the transitional six months period but who were registered after 31 December 1986.  It allows such persons to apply for re-registration if they so wish.  Most of these are unlikely to apply for re-registration as there is no particular benefit to them. However, I understand that in a small number of cases where there were family applications by parents and their children, the parents, on learning that they had not been registered by 31 December and that their existing children were not therefore eligible for registration, insisted on their own registration proceeding. The result was that the parents were registered but the existing children could not be registered because the citizenship of their parents was not backdated.</P>
    <P>I understand the concern of such parents who decided to proceed with registration to ensure that any future children they might have would be entitled to Irish citizenship even if it meant that their existing children might lose out.  Paragraph <i>(b)</i> means that such parents can <Col N="137" /> remedy the situation by applying for re-registration so that the applications made during the transitional period for the registration of their children born before 31 December 1986 can be processed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) provides that any person registered or re-registered by virtue of subsection (1) shall be deemed to have been registered on 1 July 1986.  In effect that will allow every person who made a valid application for registration during the transitional period but who was not registered by 31 December 1986 to be put in the same position that they would have been in if they had been registered during the transitional period.</P>
    <P>The transitional period in the 1986 Act commenced on 1 July 1986 and ended on 31 December 1986.  A date during that period had to be picked for the purposes of section 2 of the Bill and it was decided to pick the date which would be most favourable to applicants.  This is the reason for the date 1 July 1986 being provided for in section 2(2) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 2 is a direct consequence of subsection (2).  As we are providing in subsection (2) that valid applications made during the transitional period but not registered by 31 December 1986 shall, under the Bill, be deemed to have been registered on 1 July 1986, it is only reasonable that applications actually registered during the transitional period should not be treated any less favourably. Accordingly, subsection (3) provides that such applications shall also be deemed to have been registered on 1 July 1986.</P>
    <P>In most if not all cases the actual date of registration within the transitional period should be of no significance.  There is, however, the possibility that the date of registration during the transitional period could be of importance in a small number of cases.  This could happen, for example, if a woman applied for registration during the transitional period but after submitting her application and before it was registered she gave birth to a child and did not have an opportunity to submit a further application for the registration of that child by 31 December 1986.  I am not aware of the existence of any such case <Col N="138" /> but, to avoid any possibility of a grievance, the Bill provides that all relevant applications are deemed to have been registered on 1 July 1986.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I want to refer to another Bill in the area of immigration and citizenship; this is a Bill to provide a statutory framework for refugees and asylum seekers.  In recent months I have mentioned on a number of occasions that this legislation is in the course of preparation and that it would be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Government recently approved a draft scheme of the Bill to deal with refugees and asylum seekers.  The Bill is being drafted at present and I intend to have it published and through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the near future.  As the Bill has not been published I cannot go into detail on it at present.  I can say, however, that the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee set up to examine this whole area and which have been published form the core of my legislative proposals to deal with refugees and asylum seekers.  When the Bill is processed and comes into operation our system for dealing with refugees and asylum seekers will be open, impartial, humane and will allay the fears of those who have expressed concerns about the present non-statutory system.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention my legislative proposals on refugees and asylum seekers is that I do not want the House to be under the impression that the Bill before the House today represents the totality of my proposals in the area of immigration and citizenship.  The Bill before the House is a short Bill and it has not delayed in any way work in my Department on the topic of refugees and asylum seekers and the preparation of legislation in that area.  Work on a Bill on that topic is proceeding as quickly as possible. When the Bill comes before the House, Senators will see that it is a major piece of reforming legislation and it will ensure that our international obligations are maintained to the highest standards.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me repeat that the Bill before the House does not make any substantive change in our legislation as <Col N="139" /> regards citizenship.  However, it is very important for the 3,773 applicants who could not obtain citizenship at the end of 1986 through no fault of their own.  The Bill enables them to obtain citizenship as is their right.  It also ensures that there will be no anomalies as regards those who applied for registration prior to 31 December 1986 and who decided to have their births registered subsequently.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As the Minister said, it is an enabling Bill and is non-controversial.  The purpose of the Bill is to regularise the citizenship rights of persons who made valid applications to have details of their birth abroad entered in a foreign births entry book at an embassy or consulate or in the foreign births register at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin during the transitional six month period ending on 31 December 1986 provided for in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986. These people, through no fault of their own as the Minister said but probably because of the number of applications, were not registered by 31 December 1986.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that thousands of people in many countries who applied for Irish citizenship as far back as October and November 1986 find that their application has not been dealt with until 1994. At the time of the expiry of the statutory deadline at the end of December 1986 thousands of legitimate applications plus the required fees were lodged in our overseas diplomatic and consular offices but were not processed because of difficulties with the legislation.  Those fees are still with the Department of Foreign Affairs. As the Minister said there are 3,773 applications outstanding from people seeking Irish citizenship by virtue of the fact that they are descendants of an Irish born person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, was passed it was envisaged that Irish citizenship would be extended to as a broad a range of people as possible. It mainly gave great-grandchildren <Col N="140" /> of Irish people who emigrated to the United States during and following the Famine period an opportunity to regain the citizenship their ancestors had prior to their enforced departure from this country.  It is unfortunate that, having regard to the manner in which we have pursued the United States in relation to visas for Irish citizens, we have taken this approach to the problem of American descendants of Irish citizens who wish to regain Irish citizenship.  I am pleased that the Bill will right that situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the difficulties Irish citizens experience when obtaining visas for the United States.  Everything must be done by the Minister and the Government to assist moves to introduce a Bill in the US Senate which would remove the regulations regarding the visitor visa scheme for the Irish.  We must do everything in our power to mobilise the full political and diplomatic support we have in the US to ensure that the US visitors visa scheme as operated for Ireland is changed.  It is absurd that nationals of other countries, including people in Northern Ireland and the UK, can come and go to the United States without complying with visitor visa requirements.</P>
    <P>It might be suggested that the present scheme is due to the serious unemployment problem here and the possibility of a large influx of people from Ireland if the situation was changed.  I do not accept that because there is a greater unemployment problem in Spain, yet there is no similar requirement for Spanish nationals travelling to the United States.  I commend the American Ambassador, Mrs. Jean Kennedy-Smith, and her predecessors who have done much work to remove this anomalous situation.  A message should go from this House fully supporting the efforts of Congressman McCloskey and wishing him success with his Bill which asks that the overall penalty on Irish people travelling to the United States be removed and that our nationals visiting the United States are treated in the same way as US nationals visiting Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael fully supports the Bill before <Col N="141" /> the House.  It is not a contentious Bill and one for which we have been asking for many years since the difficulties arose. The only reservation we have is that it took so long to bring the Bill before the House.  As the Minister said the Bill does not make any substantive change in the current legislation regarding citizenship. It is important for the 3,773 applicants who could not obtain citizenship at the termination of the 1986 period because of an influx of applications and a failure to deal with them.  The Bill also ensures that there will be no anomalies as regards those who applied for registration prior to 31 December 1986 and who decided to have their births registered subsequently. In this context I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill and we on this side of the House will facilitate its quick passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  I commend her for bringing forward this piece of legislation because it was long awaited.  It took this Minister to process it and I congratulate her.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with citizenship rights for persons with valid applications to have their births registered at an embassy abroad or with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Some applications are still in limbo as a result of the six month transitional period.  It was unjust that these people were left in limbo and I am glad the situation is being rectified.  It is welcome because many people came to us as public representatives and asked about the position in relation to applications that had been submitted but which had not been processed.  I often wondered how one would handle the situation and the Minister has made it easy for public representatives.  The Bill makes it clear that people who have applied will not be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a little complicated.  When I read it I realised that it dealt with third and fourth generation Irish-Americans. Grandchildren, the third generation, will have to be registered at birth.  Great-grandchildren will also have to be registered at birth; but the kernel of the Bill <Col N="142" /> is that their parents must have been registered, according to the 1986 Act, before those children are born.  Many people may not fully understand the Bill because it is quite detailed.  One would have to read it a number of times to comprehend it fully.  Up to 1956 one could backdate it and have a right to Irish citizenship. However, the key point is that, under the 1986 Act, the parents must have been registered before the children were born. If fourth generation children were born before their parents were registered, they would lose citizenship rights by virtue of Irish descent or connections.</P>
    <P>Most of the applications came from the United States, but a huge number also came from South Africa.  This is interesting. Perhaps the fear and turmoil that existed there over the years prompted people to connect once more with their Irish roots.  We all like to return to our roots.  Our country of origin is most important to us if we ever encounter difficulties. American citizens of Irish descent can also have an Irish passport.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome.  I ask the Minister how long it will take to process the remaining approximate 3,700 applications. The legislation has been set in motion, but in 12 months we should not be in the position of having to ask if there is a sufficient number of staff to process it and how long it will take.  I want to be able to tell the country that this is a new piece of legislation to be welcomed.  All our Irish connections in America and other countries would like to feel that they have rights to Irish citizenship and can have an Irish passport.  This should be so and the Bill endeavours to do that. However, I want the Bill processed quickly so that I can tell people it has been passed.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister regarding the Bill she intends to introduce to provide a structure for refugee status.  Many refugees are seeking asylum in this country, particularly Bosnians.  I welcome the introduction of that piece of legislation because there are many people in limbo seeking acknowledgement of their plight. I congratulate the Minister for speeding <Col N="143" /> up this legislation and I hope it will not take too long to process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Wherever one is, it is a great day for the Irish.  I expect there is a tape in the background of Bing Crosby singing &ldquo;Does your mother come from Ireland?&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an uncontroversial piece of legislation and has been welcomed by all sides.  I am sure it is also welcomed greatly by the people waiting for the word.  The holding of an Irish passport is a great honour and it is also a marvellous shield.  I have been in some most unusual places around the globe and I was very glad there was a harp on my passport rather than anything else.  It ensured a warm welcome, as Colonel North discovered when he decided to take a trip to Tehran.  If one has to travel safely, one is best travelling on an Irish republican passport.  Its value is well recognised.</P>
      <P>I am not at all surprised that the number of applications from Johannesburg has soared.  I am sure that, post independence, the holding of an old South African passport will not exactly be a badge of honour or welcome. Obviously, if one has any chance of getting an Irish passport, now is the time to do it if one is taking out an insurance policy on the future of South Africa.  Who would blame them?</P>
      <P>Many of the applications from Americans are prompted by nostalgia.  They like to retain their roots.  It would be nice to think that when votes for emigrants are finally introduced, the Minister might be elected from New York and Swaziland rather than Galway.  I am sure she would do equally well.  Perhaps that is what she intends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Senator Neville's point about American visas, I have always found that process humiliating to some extent.  I do not wish to appear anti-American, but these people annoy me at times.  Senator Neville referred to entry requirements for Spaniards.  They are far worse off than us in terms of employment but they have open entry.  When one <Col N="144" /> considers that most of the Donnelly visas and others are not taken up, what is the problem?  There is a group in the American immigration department who are back in the 1920s.  I appreciate the efforts of the American Ambassador, Mrs. Kennedy-Smith, and others; but it is time these people in the State Department grew up a little and recognised that our modern economy will be capable in a short time of catering for all our people. Any time I am in America I cannot wait to leave and I often wonder why people want to go there in the first place. However, people want to go and the Americans should rethink their policy.  It is outdated and outmoded.  They are very lucky to have people that have gone through one of the best educational systems in the world.  They are getting our graduates for nothing and I sometimes think that they should be paying us rather than charging for visas.</P>
    <P>My final point is in relation to refugees. I have faith in the Minister and I said this a long time ago when Deputy Geogh-egan-Quinn became the Minister for Justice. So far my faith has been justified in everything that she has done.  The status of refugees here is a sign of our type of country.  France lived for many generations on its reputation for receiving people who were under pressure in their own country, political prisoners, etc.  It was an honoured reputation.  The Swedes also lived on its reputation for its concern for others around the globe.  I hope the Minister will be brave when that Bill is introduced, and I know she will be brave. People need a beacon and a country that has no interest other than the pursuit and protection of liberty and of ordinary people.  Any Bill the Minister brings before the House in relation to offering succour, and in many cases a homeland for a new start safe from death, would be welcomed by all sides.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new South Africans, the new Americans and whoever else the Minister decides to catch in the net.  We will have some fun when we give them votes.</P>

I raised it with the Tánaiste and he gave us an assurance that legislation would be prepared by his colleague, the Minister for Justice.  I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill so expeditiously.</P>
      <P>A specific problem needed to be addressed, that is, the issue of the deadline in the 1986 Act which created difficulties for many people.  Almost 4,000 applications have been stuck in no-man's land for the past number of years.  Many of these people found this to be an inconvenience. The application was made, the money paid but the goods were not delivered. This caused a lot of concern to some of those who had submitted applications. Some of them were concerned because they needed an Irish passport, so it was important to amend the legislation and bring this Bill to the House.  The Minister is to be complimented on what she has done.  In her speech she gave an outline of the history of the 1956 Act and all the legislation and regulations that cover citizenship for people other than those born in Ireland.  The legislation is welcome and I wish to thank the Minister for introducing it so quickly.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> Senator Magner welcomed me to the House.  I have been here so often in the past few weeks that I feel like a piece of furniture in the Seanad at this stage.  I said to Senator Neville yesterday that there would not be any easing up of the pressure on him or on myself over the next couple of months.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with the welcome this legislation has received.  This anomaly has existed since 1986, as Senator Taylor-Quinn said.  As Senator Ormonde said, there has been a lot of pressure on all politicians in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  People who were caught in the anomaly made representations to their local Members of Congress in relation to it.  I know that there has been a long delay in bringing this Bill before the Oireachtas.  Since I became Minister for Justice I have discovered that one has to be ruthless in setting priorities for legislation.  It would be very easy to get involved in 15 or 16 different pieces of legislation at the same time.  Unless one is ruthless and decides what one's priorities are going to be, very little is achieved.  I was glad that in the course of setting priorities I was able to give priority to this legislation.  I know that the 3,773 people or thereabouts involved will be very happy with it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point raised by both Senator Magner and Senator Neville, that is, visas for the United States, I happened to be in the other House yesterday when this issue was raised on the adjournment with the Tánaiste.  This issue concerns all of us.  Both Senators are correct in saying that we are sending to the United States some of our best educated young people, who make an enormous contribution to the economy of the United States when they get there. I am sure that all of us have relatives who went to the United States in times of great difficulty and great economic deprivation and who got a very warm welcome there. These people went on to earn a very good living there and to play an important role both in the economic and in the political affairs of the United States.  We always have to be appreciative of that and everybody here today is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> There is enormous pressure on all public representatives in relation to young people, very many of whom are students, who would like to visit the United States, or young people who are working in lower paid or part-time employment who would like to go to the United States for a holiday.  There seems to be some doubt in the minds of the authorities as to whether they are legitimate visitors or not.  I pay a very special tribute to Ambassador Kennedy-Smith in this regard because, of all of the recent United States diplomats resident in the Phoenix Park, she has shown a real personal interest in this issue.  She seems to understand it better than any of her predecessors.  She has grasped the nettle and has been very supportive.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials have had many discussions with her in relation to this issue and that she certainly has smoothed the way during her term of office here.</P>
    <P>I also support Senator Neville's statement that we should be supporting in every way we possibly can the Bill that is being put through Congress at the moment.  The Tánaiste indicated that very strongly in the other House last night.  We have been lobbying our friends on Capitol Hill and urging support for it. Our Ambassador, Mr. Dermot Gallagher, has been very active in mustering support from Congress Members for this legislation.  It would be very welcome legislation.  It would solve some of the difficulties some of us as politicians from time to time have had in relation to the whole question of visas for the United States.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde and Senator Magner both raised the question of refugees.  That has been a controversial issue for a long time.  When I became Minister for Justice 15 months ago the issue on which I got the most representations during the first number of months was in relation to refugees and asylum seekers.  We have got bad publicity in this country and abroad in relation to the perceived treatment &mdash; it is a perception rather than a reality &mdash; of refugees and asylum seekers.  I was <Col N="148" /> very anxious that it should be put on a statutory footing, that it should be at arm's length both from the Minister and the Department officials.  We want to make sure that it is seen as an open system and that it is independent and impartial.</P>
    <P>We want to maintain the high standard of welcome we have for people in this country, and that should also apply equally to asylum seekers and refugees. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees have been extremely helpful and co-operative with us and were with the interdepartmental committee set up to look at this area and to offer suggestions and give support for the legislative proposals we were putting in place.  That is now with the Attorney General and I hope that it will be back to the Government and through the Houses of the Oireachtas in this session.  Everybody on both sides of the House has welcomed this.</P>
    <P>I personally support the giving of votes to Irish immigrants.  Senator Magner will be aware that I do so for a very personal reason, because I visit Boston every year to see a huge percentage of my constituents who have emigrated.  They have Morrison or Donnelly visas or they emigrated long before these visas were available. I am sure that, like Senator Taylor-Quinn or anybody else from the western seaboard, we all have many constituents there and we would be delighted if they were included on the register of electors. The Government is looking very closely at this question and investigating the possibility of how and whether it might be done.  On a personal level I support that very strongly.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde raised the question of the processing of the applications.  As Senators know, that will be a matter now for the Department of Foreign Affairs. Senators will notice that there is no set commencement date for the Bill, so as soon as it goes through both Houses and is signed by the President it comes into operation, which is a good thing.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Tánaiste have assured me that there will be no delay in the processing of the applications. <Col N="149" /> They hope to get stuck into them straight away and that is important.</P>
    <P>The people out there know about this legislation.  I publicised this Bill during the course of my visit to the United States on St. Patrick's Day and I asked my Government colleagues to indicate at any public function or engagement they attended that the legislation was going through, that we expected to have it through very shortly after Easter and that the 3,773 people affected would be contacted. I do not see that there will be any delay.  It suits all of us that it should be done as quickly as possible.  I thank the Senators for their welcome for this legislation. It is important and although it only affects a small number of people it is righting an injustice which has existed for a period of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this historic document in Seanad Éireann today and I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for providing the opportunity to have this debate and I thank also the proposers of the motion.</P>
      <P>This is the first ever in-depth report on small businesses in Ireland.  It is also a benchmark report, bringing together many new and previously unpublished facts about small businesses.  For instance, there are not 100,000 businesses in Ireland, as many have previously stated, but 160,000 businesses, 145,000 of which have fewer than ten people employed.  They are predominantly service companies, approximately 80 per cent, and they account for 50 per cent of the private sector employment in Ireland. It will be noted from this that we are truly a nation of small businesses.</P>
      <P>The report also destroys many myths about small business which had gained currency in recent years.  No, we do not have half the start up rate of developed economies, as has often been said.  We can match them and we can also match the more advanced EU economies in our total number of businesses <i>per capita.</i> Again, the opposite was often assumed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that is where the similarities end.  We tend to fall between two stools. We neither achieve the extraordinary number of small businesses <i>per capita</i> that southern European countries achieve, nor do we get the number of fast growth companies that northern European countries achieve.  We also tend to experience high failure rates, with up to 40 per cent of businesses failing within the first five <Col N="151" /> years, a staggering figure revealed in the task force report.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking features in the analysis in the first two chapters of the report is what the more developed economies in the world &mdash; the US, Japan and Germany &mdash; do to help small business. All of them have a powerful large firm sector.  Between them they account for the great majority of the world's largest companies.  Despite this, all three countries have attached a high priority to small business and have consistently supported them with substantial resources.  There is a long term commitment which is evident now for several decades.</P>
    <P>The question we must ask ourselves is that if the world's largest economies have seen the advantage of supporting small companies, how much more compelling is the case for a small, less developed economy like ours to do likewise.  As we state clearly in the report:</P>
    <P>They had the option only to think big, but the foresight also to think small.  We have the option of thinking big only to a very limited extent and must place an even greater emphasis on thinking small.</P>
    <P>This is where we are today.  We have never had formal consistent policies specifically for small businesses in this country.  We never properly differentiated between small and large, we merely differentiated between manufacturing and services.  This has now changed.  The Government has accepted one of the key recommendations in the report, the setting up of the small business division, and extra staff have been approved.</P>
    <P>This division, which I announced publicly yesterday afternoon, commenced a few day ago and will oversee the implementation of the task force recommendations, will champion the cause of small business across Departments and will report annually on the state of small business in Ireland.  When I say small businesses, I include services, which have been left out in the cold for too long.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> The report runs to over 180 pages.  It consists of seven chapters, the first two of which defines small business as having 50 employees and a turnover of £3 million, and measure for the first time the numbers of small businesses in Ireland, which I have already outlined.  It also states the case for supporting small business, which is primarily a jobs case, since 70 per cent of all new jobs being created in the EU at present come from this sector.</P>
    <P>The chapters also review what other countries do for small businesses and how imaginative programmes are now in place and have been for the past 30 to 40 years. The next five chapters look at what we should do to support our small businesses and there are almost 100 concrete proposals outlined.  A number of them have already been accepted by the Minister for Finance in the budget and will be put in place by the Finance Act.</P>
    <P>We disagreed somewhat with the Culliton report when it pointed out that there was a substantial equity gap in small business. Based on the view of the 14 small business owners/managers who sat on the task force and confirmed by the views of the representative organisations, we saw the need as primarily a financing gap rather than an equity gap.  No, there is no shortage of finance, as such, in this country.  But yes, there is a shortage of affordable finance at realistic rates of interest with long term facilities.  For example, there is now a 4 per cent margin between the prime rate and the AA rate which applies to small business, so large businesses can obtain money, generally speaking, at 4 per cent below what small business can obtain.  The State can also get its money at 3 to 4 per cent below what small firms will obtain.</P>
    <P>We therefore decided to begin to fill this gap in the array of financial options available.  We negotiated the £100 million loan fund with the ICC which provides funds at 3.75 per cent fixed and over a ten year period.  We persuaded the Minister for Finance to approve this package and he provided for it in the budget.</P>
    <P>I see this as only the first step in a definite direction.  I believe we need more <Col N="153" /> and more financial institutions to follow this trend.  I welcome the Bank of Ireland's £25 million fund, provided without Government subsidy.  But we need more low cost funds being made available and in this regard I would welcome any proposals from the commercial banks to our new small business division.</P>
    <P>The £100 million ICC loan fund has already received some 1,100 applications for funding of £195 million.  In other words, the fund at £100 million established applications for funding now running at almost £200 million.  This means the fund is oversought to an amount doubling the original fund, which indicated the extent of demand for that form of financing and to an extent confirms our view in the report that it was this type of financing that was sought by small business rather than perhaps the traditional equity type of funding.</P>
    <P>Despite the widespread perceptions, the services sector does qualify for these subsidised loans, but only services that have the potential for export revenue. Imitation services or locally delivered services do not qualify for this fund. Recently, for example, we brought to the attention of the ICC the fact that hauliers who trade internationally qualify under the conditions agreed.</P>
    <P>The processing of each application is a matter for the ICC and normal commercial criteria apply, that is, the ICC is carrying the risk element.  In this respect a strong message emanating from small business entrepreneurs is their preference for lower taxation rather than increased grant assistance.  In addition, we have argued strongly in the report that the services sector must be treated more seriously and that the 40 per cent corporation profits tax rate should be reduced over a period.  The Minister for Finance has moved swiftly to lower capital gains tax and the revised 27 per cent rate he announced in the budget is very welcome to small businesses.</P>
    <P>Of the 12 EU countries only Ireland and the UK do not pay interest on late payment on public contracts.  Even in the US late payment legislation has been in force for the public sector since 1982.  The <Col N="154" /> State here in general is not good at paying its bills on time.  The £100 million allocated by the Minister for Finance in the budget to bring the health boards' accounts into order is a welcome development. It is simply not good enough that small business should bear the brunt of the State's cash flow problems.  It is self-defeating for the State, through its development agencies, to assist firms on the one hand while at the same time the payment practices are actually hindering them.  It is inconsistent for the State to insist that business remit taxes on time while at the same time we are not prepared to pay for the goods and services provided.  The introduction of maximum payment time would involve a once-off cash flow Exchequer adjustment.  At the end of the day a strong and thriving small business sector is the best guarantee of a strong and solvent Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of work involved in improving the lot of small business in Ireland.  However, an excellent start has been achieved through the task force report.  The opportunities for increased economic activity and employment are immense.  For instance, we have lost 14 percentage points to imports in our own market since 1980.  It is estimated that up to £2 billion of imports could be replaced by Irish companies.  Of the £3.3 billion spent by the Government on public procurement &mdash; this figure relates to 1991 &mdash; over 50 per cent is sourced outside the State.  This is another area of potential business, particularly for small companies. These are just two instances of opportunities that are available for small business if we deliver the right structures, financing and advice.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that, as the Minister with responsibility for small business, I will continue to drive the agenda in this area and will not rest until the recommendations of the task force are implemented.  By doing this we will have radically improved the lot of Irish small businesses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to speak about the report of the Task Force on Small Business. <Col N="155" /> The introduction to the report states that &ldquo;The moment has come to give small business a central place in the making of public policy in Ireland so that the sector can realise its full potential for contributing to economic development and job creation&rdquo;.  It is an indictment of all of us in this House who have advocated job creation and of all the efforts made over the years that nothing was done until mid-1993 to protect and improve the position of small businesses. Ireland is a nation of small businesses. Our definition of a small business is one with fewer than 15 employees and a turnover of less than £3 million.  This definition applies to 160,000, or 98 per cent, of non-farming businesses.  Around 90 per cent of them employ fewer than ten people.  Our achievements have not been as good as they should have been.  If we spent less time trying to attract the big multinationals who spent a short time in Ireland and invested some of our funds in small business, we would have a great deal more to show for it at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>There is emphasis in the report on raising money for small businesses.  The Minister mentioned the moneys which have been made available by financial institutions such as the ICC and the Bank of Ireland.  What criteria must small businesses satisfy to qualify for loans?  I can give the Minister a list of four or five people who in the last eight weeks went to banks with decent proposals, investment in which would have resulted in extra people being employed.  However they were refused funding.  Without doubt the reason for this is that the banks believe these individuals and companies are able to pay higher rates of interest.  Is there any way of redressing this problem? Applicants who are refused funding by banks have no redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government did not decide on the composition of the country enterprise partnership boards until the end of 1993. Many people waited with bated breath for these boards to be established.  They had ideas and because of commitments to produce products they could not wait <Col N="156" /> until the boards were set up and had to borrow money at rates higher than those available under the new schemes.  Only £9 million of the £21 million provided in the 1993 budget for the boards was used because of the delay in establishing them. I welcome the strategy whereby small companies, which heretofore were not in a position to receive any kind of help, can now be helped by the boards.</P>
    <P>Is it the policy of the Minister's Department that the boards do not supply information on the number of applications they receive and approve each year?  If there is to be accountability, we should be given this information and the number of jobs which it is intended will be created on the basis of approvals.  If this information is not made available to the House and the public, how can we assess whether these boards are successful?</P>
    <P>Rewarding risk has not been satisfactory over the years.  Owning a small business requires major personal commitment. The task force report points out that research shows that owners work more than 55 hours a week.  They put at risk their personal resources, often including their family home.  A few evenings ago somebody rang me to say he lost his family home as a result of his business not doing well.  The real problem is that financial institutions to date required too many signatures and a commitment that family homes would have to go if businesses failed.  I hope the new approach of the banks and the county enterprise partnership boards will result in such commitments and personal guarantees not being required for people with good ideas who want to start up a business.  This practice has proved to be disastrous in real terms for many people and as a result, the State ends up carrying the can by having to provide those people with homes, etc., after their businesses collapsed.</P>
    <P>The tax system has played a major part in the problems which many small businesses encounter.  There is a need for radical change in that regard.  With regard to the PAYE allowance, I find it incredible that if a husband and wife own a business, if their son or daughter is <Col N="157" /> unemployed and registered with FÁS and if they are taken into the family business, there is no PAYE allowance for that son or daughter, there is no subsidy in real terms from FÁS or anywhere else for them.  That proposal must be widened because there are many companies and individuals who find themselves with that problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister why a dividend income to full time directors of companies has not been allowed in the Finance Bill.  If a reasonable amount of £7,000 was allowed it would be an incentive to people who are prepared to put their head on the block.  The Minister informed us that capital gains tax for small businesses has been reduced to 27 per cent.  Is there not a real case for reducing that further to 20 per cent for assets held for over five years to give people an opportunity to get up and running? The first year in business is tough, the second perhaps evens out but in the third, fourth and fifth years firms are only getting off the ground, establishing markets and depend totally on help.</P>
    <P>Families should not have to pay capital acquisitions tax on inherited family businesses. Here we are penalising the normal transfer of property.  Much more should be done in the Finance Bill and I hope the Minister will accept some amendments to the Bill in connection with this.  There should be an exemption for family members as long as the operation is an ongoing concern.  If we went down that road, many younger people might take charge earlier with new ideas which could, in the long term, prove beneficial to the State.</P>
    <P>With regard to corporation tax, people are liable to pay 40 per cent on profits of up to £80,000.  This should, at least, be reduced to a standard rate of 27 per cent. I ask the Minister to take note of this and to have discussions with the Minister for Finance in this connection.</P>
    <P>We spend a great deal of time talking about small businesses and I have no doubt there is a greater future in small businesses in this country than in the multinationals.  Unfortunately, when there is an announcement of 400 jobs <Col N="158" /> being created, the following week a major multinational announces it is reducing its number of jobs; this happened in the last two weeks.</P>
    <P>With regard to mushroom growers, they are all small industries created to supplement income from other farming activities.  The Government decision to increase CPT from 10 per cent to 40 per cent for the mushroom industry is nothing less than outrageous, and to these people it is a draconian measure. It is wrong and the decision should be reversed.</P>
    <P>Our mushroom growers mainly export their products.  It is only a year since the currency crisis nearly put a substantial number of them out of business, especially those who export to the UK. Yet, one year later, the Government is proposing to wipe them out altogether &mdash; the full time and part time jobs, the people who get up at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. to pick mushrooms.  According to my information, many of them will not be in a position to make the repayments on the new investments they have made.  The new tunnels cost about £30,000 each.</P>
    <P>I wonder what this Coalition Government has against the mushroom growers. We are looking at devastation.  I can name 25 people who, in the last six months have invested substantial amounts of funds adding two tunnels to their businesses.  This would mean extra pickers and part-time workers, money that is used to help to send children to school and make necessary purchases.  I ask, at this late stage, for a decision to be made by the Government to reduce this proposal, even to bring it in line with the European average; this 40 per cent rate is 13 per cent higher than the average in the UK.  The Minister is looking at devastation in real terms.</P>
    <P>With regard to withholding tax, it has, in particular, a negative impact on personal practices with employees in activities such as engineering consultancy.  The amount of tax being withheld across the board is far more than the amount individuals would have to pay.  For example, doctors invest in their surgeries; they have to employ secretaries, etc., and provide <Col N="159" /> a service to people who would otherwise have to go to hospitals where they would clog up outpatient departments. We have a situation developing where doctors in rural areas are financing the State.  The task force has recommended that changes be made in this area.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the task force's proposal on special commercial rates for a two year period until the companies are up and running.  The Minister mentioned the cost of complying with the State's regulations and administrative requirements. This is higher for small businesses than large ones.  In the case of PAYE, for example, compliance costs firms with under 25 employees around 4 per cent of their total PAYE liabilities; the cost to major firms with 100 employees is only 1 per cent.  Extra administration costs are a problem.  Administration costs decrease as the number of employees increase.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister did not use his visit here today to announce the establishment of the new small business division. This is the Upper House of the Oireachtas and the Minister should have made his announcement here.  I am sure no Senator would have objected to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to late payments. Our 100,000 farmers should be classified as small business people.  Farms should not be treated differently from the 160,000 small businesses.  The Minister mentioned the late payment to small companies by health boards.  That was a serious problem because the health boards were under-funded by the Government during the last five or six years.  The problem of under-funding grew and small companies carried the can for the State which the Minister correctly said they should not be doing.</P>
    <P>Where late payments are concerned the Minister should take not only the 160,000 small businesses into consideration but also the farming community. Only one and a half hours ago I was on the telephone seeking a payment which was due to a farmer in December 1992.  That section of the community, <Col N="160" /> no more than small businesses, should not be expected to carry the can for inefficiency or for the Government's lack in ensuring that this work is carried out promptly, efficiently and effectively on behalf of all the people involved in small businesses.</P>
    <P>Not one public representative, whether a Member of the Oireachtas or councillor, would disagree that somebody who is running their own business has daily costs which must be paid.  If money due is not paid the small business cannot pay its bills; everybody is left short of money as a result of late payment.  The same is true of the farming community and suppliers of farm goods.  Ten days ago a farmer told me he owed substantial amounts to co-operatives and other institutions on the basis of promised subsidies and other State payments.  The money due to farmers is in the Department and a blanket payment of all such subsidies should be made.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report.  I look forward to the Minister's response to making available information from the county enterprise partnership boards because they cannot be properly assessed if we do not know the exact number of applications, approvals and the job potential on the basis of such approvals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>To alleviate Senator Farrelly's anger at the Minister for not making his announcement in the Seanad, perhaps the Minister might invite us for champagne later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a welcome debate.  It is particularly appropriate after the publication of the ESRI report and its expectations of how the economy will perform in the foreseeable future.  Every small business owner or manager would agree that the 100 recommendations proposed by the task force are necessary if we are to expand and encourage the development of small business, job creation, exports and the competitiveness of our economy. I compliment the Minister and welcome him to the Seanad.  It was important that, on publication of the report, the Minister sought and received funding for the <Col N="161" /> establishment of the new division in his Department to oversee and implement the recommendations of the task force both through legislation and the establishment of agencies.</P>
    <P>The report acknowledges that small businesses are the only hope for this economy if it is to reduce unemployment and increase competitiveness.  The task force has acknowledged this in its proposals. The Minister has also acknowledged it in setting up the new division to implement the report.  Through small business we can stimulate growth and take advantage of the current exceptional prevailing circumstances of low inflation, low interest rates and a competitive economy. For too long too much emphasis was placed by Governments and job creation agencies on large multinational companies which were over-grant aided. As we have acknowledged that small business is the way forward we must not hesitate in removing the shackles on small businesses.</P>
    <P>It was a commonly held perception that this country did not have a high start-up rate in small business.  The Minister has pointed out that we are on a par with the European average.  Unfortunately we have a very high failure rate.  While the report proves that there is an entrepreneurial spirit in this country, it also proves that we do not have the support, necessary funding and proper taxation system that will allow such enterprises to develop and grow to the extent that they may leave the small business sector.  The task force's taxation proposals are very important and should be implemented immediately.  This year's budget was a first step.  I compliment the Minister and his Department for pursuing as many realistic proposals as possible and the Minister for Finance for accepting the proposals.</P>
    <P>The major complaint of small businesses has been the fact that they cannot secure adequate finance at cheap competitive rates to start up or to alleviate cashflow problems.  The £100 million funding scheme, through which money is available at a fixed rate of 6.75 per cent, is very good.  Unfortunately, the funding <Col N="162" /> is mainly available to the manufacturing sector.  We must get away from the philosophy that manufacturing is the only sector in which employment is created. The services sector must expand.  Our economy needs services; it is expanding and developing and service industries must be encouraged.  The task force report and its recommendations accept that there is great potential for growth in the services sector.  Some banks have admitted that their criteria for sanctioning loans to small businesses are too stringent.  An individual may be asked to offer his home as collateral on a loan.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the problem is that our taxation system does not encourage saving.  If personal taxation was reduced people would have the opportunity to save money which could be invested.  We must acknowledge that taxation is crippling the economy.  I raised this issue when discussing the Social Welfare Bill and I will continue to raise it.  As the economy improves we must revert to low taxation.  The report and recommendations of the task force acknowledge this.  Since the late 1970s every country with a successful economy has acknowledged that fact and implemented measures immediately.  That is true of the Japanese, British, German and American economies.  The recently successful economies, such as those of Canada and Australia, have acknowledged that fact and have implemented that policy.  Even if we do not take advantage of the proposed upturn in the economy, this report should also be put on the shelf because this is our last opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly welcomed the broad thrust of this report.  However, the budget acknowledged it by extending the PAYE allowance to children working full time in a small business.  There was also a fund set up to alleviate the financial burden experienced by such businesses during the currency crisis last year.  One must be realistic about the currency crisis.  It was an international crisis very much outside the control of any individual state.  I congratulate the Government on its speedy implementation of <Col N="163" /> that fund, which saved many small businesses from a serious financial situation.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to limited financial resources.  The £100 million scheme has been successful, but it is only a drop in the ocean when one looks at the overall borrowing content of our small businesses.  The Minister must ensure that more funding will be made available. The fact that companies are seeking a total of £195 million from this new scheme indicates that there is great interest in it.  Unfortunately, many of them will have to be turned down.  I referred to the services sector during another debate last year.  This sector does not need as much investment as other sectors to create more jobs.  Indeed, I know both the Minister and the task force have acknowledged this fact.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House too long on debating this report because the thrust of it is acceptable to everybody concerned.  It was welcomed by the Small Firms Association and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association.  When one has the support of such bodies, this indicates that the report must be acceptable. However, the ISME pointed out that funding is also required to ensure the momentum is not lost.  I ask the Minister to ensure that this new division will have adequate funding and will be correctly overseen so it can pursue the implementation of all realistic proposals at minimum cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I compliment all those involved with the Task Force on Small Business.  As the Minister said, this is an historic document. It is the first time that small business has been examined in a serious and practical way.  I hope both the Department and the Minister will pursue this matter and ensure that every proposal will be implemented as soon as possible. If they are implemented, our economy may create a lot of employment and sustainable jobs.  The one major advantage a small business has is that it does not cost much money to set up.  Therefore, if it does not succeed, less money would have been lost.  By comparison, if large multinationals fail, they end up leaving a <Col N="164" /> large number of unemployed.  Losses from a small business can be absorbed easier into the economy.  Many small businesses are currently failing, but we could have a successful next century if these small steps are taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Task Force on Small Business.  It is an uncommonly good report and is one of the most impressive I have read on any issue of economic policy over the past two decades. This is partly because it is clearly written, which counts, but has also been well researched.  The recommendations seem to be based, to a disproportionate degree when compared to many other reports, on evidence.  It is not simply a series of opinions being presented, resulting in conclusions which, however emphatically expressed, are not based on fact.  Indeed, these opinions may be right but one has no way of knowing this.</P>
      <P>A particularly impressive factor of this report is that the sources are cited repeatedly. That is not an academic observation, but means that the authors of the report have sufficient self-confidence in what they are doing.  If anyone wants to disagree with their conclusions, they can simply check and assess the quality of the evidence from which they are basing their recommendations.  It is important for public confidence in Government that there should be confidence in the calibre of public servants.  One way to achieve that is if public servants were more prepared to present their evidence for public scrutiny.  Sadly, that has been lacking in many recent reports on economic affairs. That factor alone enhances confidence in the likely commonsense and validity of the recommendations and I compliment the authors for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister correctly points out, the report has exploded a number of mistaken assumptions.  Even the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> said there were approximately 100,000 small busi-take <Col N="165" /> nesses in the country.  It is currently around the 160,000 mark, although I would warn against that becoming a new definitive figure.  The report presents that figure as being a broad approximation between 145,000 and 175,000.  That should serve to warn us about the amount of continuing work that needs to be done to reinforce or, where necessary, to modify these conclusions.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to see the task force has calculated figures which give reasonably reliable estimates of the total number of firms in the country.  Therefore, they have largely destroyed the widespread assumption, which was becoming the basis of policy both in industry and in my own area of education, that we were somehow a people lacking in enterprise and that our number of start-ups was only half that of European or OECD economies.  There was also an assumption that there was something peculiarly wrong with the Irish psyche and the educational system which required immediate and drastic correction. Exploding that myth of itself has been an important contribution.</P>
    <P>It behoves us to ponder how such misunderstanding about the size and the scope of the small business sector and of the alleged lack of enterprise came to be official gospel for many years.  IBEC, for example, in its response to the Green Paper on education and university presidents, when discussing the promotion of enterprise, could cite the assumption that we were so lacking in enterprise as a demonstrated fact.  Important policy conclusions were proposed to be based on extremely fragile evidence, plucked out of a report that was not subjected to the type of scrutiny that one would expect. The fact that these types of conclusions could be drawn so easily in a debate on small business should act as a warning to us.  I hope there are not many analogies in other areas of public policy making.</P>
    <P>It is important to get the diagnosis right before one proceeds to give the prescription. I know there is a reluctance to indulge in diagnosis in this country.  We are told to delegate it to a report, which simply keeps repeating matters.  If only <Col N="166" /> we were action oriented, these problems could then be solved.  Had we proposed measures on small business a couple of years ago based on the assumptions that have now been proved incorrect, we could well have embarked on a great deal of public expenditure based on nothing but the most vacuous and factious of opinion.  I hope this will act as an example of how to improve the quality of thinking on policy making in a major area.</P>
    <P>One would have to agree with most of the specific proposals in the report.  More weight should be placed on the proposals concerning tax credits for job creation.  If it is agreed that the tax system is an impediment to small business formation and job creation, which is the end objective &mdash; and many examples suggest it is &mdash; then the more specific the tax policies are and the greater the focus on job creation, the more effective they will be. There are problems with devising specific tax credit policies, but it is worth thinking about the potential in this area and about asking the Minister for Finance to appoint a small group of experts, including business representatives, to devise and cost a workable scheme of the type they are suggesting.  Perhaps there is no such workable scheme, but it would be a worthwhile effort, rather than relying on the broad incentive of improving the tax system by abolishing a number of hindrances. We should not go as far as Signor Berlusconi in suggesting that every small firm could instantly produce an extra body, even to do some simple things.  However, the potential which is there could be activated more effectively if there is a workable tax credit policy.</P>
    <P>We should not treat small and large businesses as mutually exclusive because there is great interdependence between them.  One of the main problems for small businesses in Ireland is that we have few large businesses in this country by international standards.  Internationally, large firms &mdash; and I do not mean the firms which employ 500 or more people and which we call large &mdash; provide the main markets for small firms.  The greatest problem with developing the small firms sector in Ireland is that it does not have <Col N="167" /> the cadre of large firms which other advanced industrial countries have. Often we do not compare like with like when we ask about their capacity to sell. In this context State procurement policy becomes doubly important, because the State is the largest firm we have for small companies in the absence of a cadre of large firms.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the report emphasised the possibility of revising, at least in part, State procurement policy, or perhaps even devising State procurement policy for the first time in a number of areas with a view to assisting the growth of small firms and providing the type of market incentive they require.  As the report states, small firms in Ireland must think about export markets at an earlier stage in their product cycle development than is the case with many countries with which we compare, usually unfavourably, our small firms development.  They are facing more difficult circumstances. Given the continuing absence of large firms, the State is the main potential large buyer.  Some of the import penetration, to which the report brought attention, involves selling to the State in a variety of guises.  No one is suggesting the State should only buy from itself.  If this was suggested it would be prohibited by EU rules.  The potential can be exploited further in existing EU legislation and it should be considered.</P>
    <P>I am hesitant about endorsing the proposals on the relaxation of standard labour legislation in relation to small firms.  That legislation could create difficulties for small firms, but I would be slow to assume <i>a priori</i> that a major contribution to the development of the small firms sector could be achieved along that path, apart from what the other potentially undesirable consequences might be.  Too often that is a cop out for the failure to effectively manage in other respects.  It may be a problem in certain circumstances, but it smacks too much of the British route of creating a cheap labour offshore island off the coast of Europe which, at best, would only be briefly competitive in most sectors most <Col N="168" /> of the time.  I question this area of the report in terms of proceeding too rapidly without careful investigation of the consequences and without relying on opinion in that area.</P>
    <P>The references to education for the small firms sector and other proposals in the report are not necessarily well judged, although there are good ideas about what FÁS could do.  It refers to the Green Paper on Education, which the Minister is familiar with, and to its uncritical endorsement of the enterprise culture ethos in chapter five.  I strongly support the idea of enterprise culture. However, what is enterprise culture and how does one define and operate it?  It is too narrowly defined in the Green Paper on Education, but I will not enter into a philosophical disquisition about it.</P>
    <P>The programme for enterprise culture in the Green Paper on Education was based on the assumption that we lacked enterprise and that we only had half the number of start ups which our rival economies could produce.  The basic assumption underlying it is invalidated by the research in this document.  I do not doubt we need enterprise, but because our main problem is not start-ups but growing firms and precluding firm failure, the emphasis must be placed on managerial skills, which are not identical to enterprise skills.  There is an overlap, but our problem is not trying to start firms but keeping them going and allowing them to grow. This requires a different thrust in terms of education from fostering self starters.</P>
    <P>There is no point having a large number of self-starters if they fail after a couple of years because they did not have the capacity or the techniques to harness their enterprise potential through effective management in order to overcome obstacles and to grow.  One of the main objectives of having a vibrant and viable small firms sector is that a sufficient number of small firms grow out of it to become larger firms.  We should not romanticise the potential for job creation in this sector.  If we rely solely on the small firms sector for job creation, then we are in real trouble in terms of job creation over the next ten years.  There <Col N="169" /> must be a blend of job creation in the small, medium and large firms sectors if we are to grow each sector into the next one.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the report emphasised the services sector.  Services are not a panacea, but they are a crucial component of an overall economic growth plan.  Services also require types of labour and management which are not necessarily provided by an enterprise culture as defined in the Green Paper on Education. The Green Paper on Education was orientated towards manufacturing industry and the type of labour which manufacturing industry required.  The services sector requires a different orientated type of enterprise and personality.</P>
    <P>I must reluctantly dissent from the overall commendation because in many ways it is an alpha report.  The references in it to the Green Paper on Education are a little hasty, facile and simplistic compared with the depth of research and thought which has gone into the rest of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate him and the backup team who compiled this report.</P>
      <P>My first point relates to the clear recognition of the willingness to accept failure. I remember a type of cycle race, which may still be popular, called &ldquo;devil take the hindmost&rdquo;.  Twenty cyclists would begin the race.  At the end of the first lap 19 cyclists would stay in the race and the 20th would drop out, at the end of the second lap the 19th cyclist would drop out and the eventual winner was the last cyclist left in the race.  Business is like that in that it is highly competitive.  It is likely to remain competitive; and this report recognises that if some businesses are successful, others will fail.  It would be worthwhile for the nation to recognise there will be failures and we should not be ashamed of failure.  That message came from the report and I was delighted to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lee touched on the issue of family firms.  It appears from the report that such firms last longer than non-family firms.  They are much more likely <Col N="170" /> to have roots in the nation and in their respective businesses.  They are also more likely to continue to exist when problems arise; non-family companies tend to move somewhere else and give up more easily.  There is a need to encourage family firms, not by grants or support but to avoid any handicaps such firms may face.  Perhaps we should not address this issue today because the Finance Bill deals with this matter.  I was delighted to see how much attention was given to this report in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the central findings of the report is that this country is bad at helping businesses to grow.  This point was also made by Senator Lee.  The problem is not getting businesses set up, rather that companies grow bigger at a below average rate.  This is a vital failure in our economy.  The number of businesses established is satisfactory in that it is equal to the average, but we are not good at getting such business to grow.  If the report did nothing other than highlight that crucial fact, the effort will have been worthwhile.  It is important to get companies to grow because there is no virtue in being small as such.  There is a danger in all the attention now being focused on this sector because it may put small businesses on a pedestal.  That is dangerous because we would be focusing on the wrong aspect of the issue.</P>
    <P>For that reason I will say what the report has not said and what none of the commentators on the report has yet said: there is no special virtue in being small. If a small business continues to be small it does not grow to the limits of its potential, which is not good.  If after all the years of neglecting small businesses we now go to the other extreme, we serve neither the small business sector nor the wider economy.  If we decide to lionise small businesses just because they are small, we will be making a mistake.</P>
    <P>Our emphasis should be not on small companies but on growing companies. There is a world of difference between those two words.  If a company is small but growing, it is making an important contribution to the economy and it is <Col N="171" /> deserving of State encouragement and, where appropriate, of State support.  If a company is small but not growing, that is a private matter for the people who own it.  If that is what they wish, it is their own business.  We should not object to that but we should not encourage it.</P>
    <P>The growing companies are the ones we must encourage and we should focus our attention on them.  We must encourage them to grow and remove any barriers preventing their growth. Occasionally we must assist them with know-how and other resources.  I would not be in favour of the Department of Enterprise and Employment devoting a special division to small businesses; however, I would support a division for growing businesses.  The distinction should not be between big and small companies, but between growing companies and companies which are not growing.  If we make such a distinction we will have our priorities right.  The virtue is not in being small but in growing and we should at all times send a message to that effect.</P>
    <P>My last point concerns a specific proposal in this report which is worth pursuing and may be lost among the other worthy suggestions and proposals.  That is the proposal to target a job creation incentive specifically at the owners of small businesses.  This idea is quite revolutionary &mdash; I had certainly not heard it before.  It is suggested that the owners of businesses should get personal tax relief for each extra job they create.</P>
    <P>This is so different from job creation incentives in the past that it is like a breath of fresh air.  Previous schemes have been targeted at larger companies, which was the wrong place.  Large companies carefully control their staff numbers and in recent years many of them have been ensuring success by reducing their employee numbers.  However, small business people often say they could take on one to three extra people but do not want to do so because of the trouble and difficulties involved.  This is where the accumulation of disincentives, so well documented in the report, comes into play.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> The key here is numbers.  It was interesting to hear Senator Lee refer to Signor Berlusconi, because he may have a solution.  We could ask a small number of large companies to take on a large number of employees each.  We saw an example of that in Ballymena yesterday, when a Korean company took on 250 people.  That is marvellous and should be encouraged.  However, if 160,000 small businesses took on one person each, or if even half those companies employed an extra person, that would have a great impact on our economy.  We have not focused on this idea before and I congratulate those who produced the report for including it.</P>
    <P>The potential is so exciting we should look at possible incentives.  There would be no special motivation for owners of small businesses by offering them free PRSI for a period.  However, one could motivate them by reducing their own income tax.  That could be funded from the savings to the State which result from taking a person off the live register.  Presumably the mandarins in Merrion Street threw their arms up in horror at that suggestion but I believe it is one of the best ideas in the report.  When one thinks of the vast potential for job creation involved, most people would say we should do whatever necessary to make that happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the task force report and I also welcome his announcement yesterday that a small business division has been set up in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  As Senator Lee said, one of the reasons why this is such a well researched and well constructed document is because of the composition of the task force.  Other than representatives from the Department, it was made up from people running and working in small businesses who know the problems and the issues.  That also explains why it is a practical report.  The suggestions made are sensible and based on reality, there is little hot air or idealising.  It is concerned with the practical problems of businesses, <Col N="173" /> therefore it is useful and should be taken seriously.</P>
      <P>The points made by Senator Quinn at the end of his contribution are important. Simply setting up a business is not enough.  One has to maintain it and if possible make it grow.  Unless we do that we will not make inroads into the unemployment figures.  It is essential that we concentrate on all those areas, not only the setting up but also the maintenance and growth of small businesses.</P>
      <P>In that context it is interesting to see figures from the past.  Indigenous Irish industry has performed badly in job creation terms.  There has been a decrease in employment in that area. One set of figures show that half of the grant aided indigenous industries set up in 1983 have gone out business.  We must ensure that firms which have been set up survive and grow.</P>
      <P>Duplication, an issue we discussed in the House in regard to the services industry, etc., must be avoided.  There is no point producing something in one area and duplicating it ten miles away because the first person will be put out of business. We must not take that approach.  Given the Department of Enterprise and Employment's commitment to those involved in business and its efforts in trying to identify and solve their problems, it is clear that the Department is taking its role in relation to job creation and this report seriously.</P>
      <P>Funding is one of the main issues which has been identified, particularly in relation setting up businesses.  Members referred to the £100 million loan fund which is available through the ICC at a rate of 6.75 per cent.  The Minister indicated that the fund is now oversubscribed and the 1,100 applicants are seeking more money than is available.  I support other speakers who said more money should be made available but there must also be an onus on the commercial banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately after the Government announced the £100 million fund, the Bank of Ireland advertised in the media that it was providing a fund at similar rates.  However, its fund only amounts to <Col N="174" /> £25 million.  No other commercial bank has indicated that it will supply money to small businesses at this rate.  Commercial banks make substantial profits, they operate in the world of business and, to a large extent, they may pick and choose their customers.  There is an onus on them to match the Government's commitment in regard to small businesses.</P>
    <P>Commercial banks should devise workable schemes which would provide finance at an affordable rate.  The Minister pointed out that money is available, but those running small businesses cannot always afford it.  Small businesses do not have large amounts of disposable cash.  I support what Senator Farrelly said &mdash; this was also mentioned in the report &mdash; that people should not have to put up the family home as collateral thereby putting it at risk.  Most Members have probably been approached by desperate individuals who have brought their ideas to a certain stage and have received support from the county enterprise partnership boards but want to go further. These people are not in a position to raise more funds and they are worried about their home and family.  They must be supported.  I pay tribute to the county enterprise partnership boards, Forbairt and other bodies involved in this area. However, as I said, commercial banks must play a greater role in this regard.</P>
    <P>The mentor system referred to in the report is useful.  It helps to maintain enterprise and it helps firms to grow. Someone who has already gone through the system will help others.  Clustering is also useful.  A number of firms are clustered for the purposes of advice, education, training and marketing and they are helped by Eolas or another body.  It is economically viable to bring a number of firms together for this purpose but it would not be viable for a small firm alone. It offers tremendous support in terms of saving money in areas such as marketing and in the exchange of information and advice where firms may learn from each other's mistakes.  The report also recommends ongoing discussions between the Government, the banks and a forum for <Col N="175" /> small businesses.  That supports the point I have been making.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals in relation to tax, for example, tax credits for job creation which Senator Quinn mentioned, a reduction in corporation tax and the extension of relief for reinvestment have been made.  Although these practical proposals will cost the State money, the Department of Enterprise and Employment in conjunction with the Department of Finance should investigate them.  I welcome the changes in the budget which eased the burden on businesses, including VAT on cash receipts as opposed to invoices which has helped cashflow, the increase in the VAT threshold, the simplification of tax clearance and tax registration forms, the inclusion of sons or daughters of owners in the PAYE net and the reduction in employees PRSI for incomes up to £9,000.  These changes, which were brought about by recommendations made by the task force are helpful.  There has been an immediate and substantial response to the task force in many areas. Given that a small business division has been set up in the Department, we may be confident that this will continue.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the setting up of a type of data base which would gather information.  It would be a one stop shop and those setting up a business or trying to maintain or increase their business would not have to go from one place to another seeking information.  As regards marketing, I was disappointed that little emphasis was placed on foreign markets.  I appreciate the importance of the home market cannot be over-emphasised, but our population comprises 1 per cent of the EU.  More emphasis should be placed on helping small firms get into European marketing networks.  Marketing at home and abroad, State procurement, which was discussed earlier, and the fact that public bodies and the State try to buy local products is a complicated area.  Recently my local authority spent a substantial amount of money on a product which it was unable to get in Ireland because the Irish product <Col N="176" /> did not reach the technical EU standard. I believe hundreds of the technical standards must be complied with in many areas of the manufacturing industry.  A number of subcommittees in the EU set these standards and we have not always been represented on them.  I ask the Minister to seek information on that.  If Irish firms are prevented from supplying components, for example, to large firms, the matter should be seriously investigated.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is potential for growth in employment if we increase our share of the world market and, in particular, the EU market.  Because we have such a small population, even a small percentage increase in the market of other European countries would make a huge difference in terms of the growth of small businesses and job creation.  We must overcome any obstacles in relation to standards and getting into networks.</P>
    <P>As regards service industries and food producers, it is essential that we get into the existing distribution network.  There is much work being done in that area already but I ask that we do whatever we can to expand our markets.  We have the capacity to make things and to provide services and there are plenty of people with skills who are unemployed. However, there is no point making something or providing a service unless there are customers.  There are not many customers in Ireland because we have such a small population and we need to look to customers in other parts of the world. I support the progress that has already been made, according to the report, in relation to standards, for example, the ISO 9000.  It is now a little easier for small firms to afford the steps that need to be taken to get an ISO 9000 qualification and there has also been progress in relation to the cost of electricity, telephones, etc.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Lee's concerns about labour law and the Unfair Dismissals Act which is referred to in the report.  The suggestion is that the onus of proof, for example, in the Unfair Dismissals Act should be taken from the employer.  This should be examined because it would be almost impossible for an employee to <Col N="177" /> produce the records needed to prove his or her case if the onus of proof was put on the employee.  I realise the report is suggesting a balance, but I would be concerned about any attempt to modify that legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report overall.  It shows a real commitment to job creation in the Department of Enterprise and Employment and I congratulate all involved, including those who compiled the report, the Minister of State here today and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. There has been a small reduction in the unemployment figures in the recent past and this offers hope for greater improvement in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the opportunity to debate the report of the Task Force on Small Business.  The report contains many practical and constructive suggestions and I hope there will be speedy action in its implementation.  I warn against sitting on the report because we need action.</P>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of the small business division in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I also welcome the statement of the Minister of State that extra staff has been approved. This division will oversee the implementation of the task force's recommendations and will champion the cause of small business.  It will report annually on the state of small business which is important because we need to monitor what is happening and to see what other changes should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's assurance that services, which have been left out in the cold for too long, will be looked after by this division.  We had a debate here last November, at which the Minister was present, which concentrated on the service sector.  For far too long we laid too much emphasis on jobs in manufacturing. The ESRI medium-term review predicted that the overall major increase in employment is expected in the market and non-market service areas, <Col N="178" /> so this is obviously an area on which we must concentrate.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister state that raising money tends not to be as big a problem as we had originally anticipated and that the financing gap and affordable finance was people's main area of concern.  There is a difficulty in financing especially for people who move from the PAYE sector into business. They find it difficult to save money from their after tax income.  The only occasion on which many people receive a lump sum is if they are made redundant.  This tends to be a difficult time for them and not the easiest set of circumstances in which to plan a business.</P>
    <P>Providing equity is vital and I welcome what the Minister said about arranging lower interest rate finance for small industry; this is vital.  One of the ideas brought forward by the Government for seed capital was tax refunds for new enterprise.  This scheme was introduced in the 1993 Finance Act.  It was a means of refunding tax immediately to the promoters of new enterprises.  It was a brilliant idea but tended to have many restrictions.  The report stated that very few people had taken up this option.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to take risks with some of their schemes and not be so defensive when they are put in place.  One of the restrictions in the aforementioned scheme was that the person could not have had a previous equity involvement. In Ireland people do not seem to be allowed to fail; Senator Quinn spoke about this earlier.  We have to develop a culture like that in the United States where people are allowed to fail again and again and eventually they are successful. This scheme was very restrictive for people who had previously been involved in enterprise.  I understand why the Government is so defensive because many tax incentives have been abused in the past.  They have been used by high earners looking for tax avoidance schemes rather than the entrepreneurial small business people for whom they were intended.  We have to examine this area again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> The county enterprise boards are a welcome development because, for the first time, they are giving grants to service industries.  I agree with many of the recommendations made by the task force in relation to the county enterprise boards.  As a member of the Laois County Enterprise Board I have some experience in this area.  The boards fill a long standing gap in the provision of seed capital to small businesses.  It is regrettable however, that the amount allocated has been reduced this year.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the task force &mdash; and it is one that Laois County Enterprise Board supported &mdash; is the allocation of mentors to all firms receiving financial support from the county enterprise boards.  Mentors were provided by Forbairt who had a similar scheme.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment should provide resources for the county enterprise boards to extend this scheme to new companies, start ups, expanding companies and any company receiving financial assistance from the county enterprise board.</P>
    <P>The task force referred to equity capital for companies.  One of the recommendations in relation to county enterprise boards was the significant scope for the use of informal equity capital provided by individuals who would take an equity stake in a small business. The problem with this is that it is difficult to sell off a minority interest in a small private company because there is no market mechanism for it in this State. One of the problems that came to my attention in relation to this tax refund scheme is that one of the conditions is that one receives a certificate from Forbairt saying one is eligible for grant aid from Forbairt.  Many of the companies that would have previously obtained funding from Forbairt will now be getting it from the county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make change to allow these people avail of this scheme. We have experienced this in Laois.  I have spoken about this to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and officials in the Department of Finance.  The Department <Col N="180" /> of Finance officials do not seem willing to change it but if we are setting up schemes and want people to set up their own businesses, we should be doing everything we can to encourage them. We must get away from this defensive attitude.  People may have exploited and abused these schemes in the past but there must be some way this could be sorted out between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  Another difficulty experienced by the promoters coming to the county enterprise boards is that if their plans are rejected, they do not have any contact with the members of the board making this decision.  This could be examined.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations with which I thoroughly agree and which was referred to by Senator Quinn, is the rewarding of job creation and the use of a system of tax credits.  The task force spoke about giving a tax credit of £1,000 per extra employee taken on.  They also looked at the area of surcharging undistributed income and asked that it be abolished. The tax incentive could be given to the company itself which would allow the company to build up a capital reserve. At present it is difficult for companies to build up a capital reserve because of this surcharge on their undistributed income. Linking this to the creation of employment would be a welcome development. A fund that is retained in the company's capital reserve rather than passed to the individual who owns the company means that the company is in a much stronger position and is more likely to survive, expand and employ more people.</P>
    <P>The task force also examined withholding tax.  This is deducted at the standard rate from all payments for professional services by public sector bodies.  The task force stated that it has a particularly negative impact on professional practices with employees and activities such as engineering consultancy. The amounts withheld are sometimes out of all proportion to the eventual tax liability.  I have some experience of this as my husband is a general <Col N="181" /> practitioner in the GMS and he is subject to withholding tax.  I constantly listen to general practitioners and other professionals, such as engineers and architects, whinging about the amount of money that is withheld in this way.  The task force recommended that, as everybody is on a current year basis, perhaps this system of withholding tax could be changed.</P>
    <P>I would consider it in terms of linking it to job creation.  For instance, general practitioners in this country could employ many more people.  Their counterparts in Britain employ perhaps two or three people but there is nothing like that here. Perhaps the withholding tax could be used to grant concessions, provided more people were employed.  Senators Quinn and Lee spoke about the number of small firms in this country and that if all, or even half, employed an extra person, it would have a major impact on our employment problem.  Perhaps areas affected by withholding tax could be examined to see how jobs could be created by giving incentives through that system.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned with the national priority of job creation.  Our actions must reflect this priority and we should do what we can to reduce unemployment.  We should look to small business because, as Senator Quinn said, it is much easier for small business to take on one person rather than seeking some firm to employ a huge number of people in towns.  General practitioners, engineers and architects are spread all over the country. Every area of the country would benefit from the additional employment that they could give.</P>
    <P>I heard Lorraine Sweeney on the radio this morning.  She welcomed the establishment of the division within the Minister's Department.  She felt that the success of the task force and its report was due to the number of people involved in small business who were on the task force.  She felt if the Minister used the same formula in his division that it would be very successful.  I agree.  They should discuss the situation with people who are working on the ground regarding the <Col N="182" /> changes they want.  As Senator Lee recommended, perhaps the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment should appoint a small group of experts, including the business community, to devise and cost a workable scheme of tax credits such as in relation to withholding tax, as I mentioned, rewarding job creation and the surcharge on undistributed income.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats welcomed the task force report.  We felt it emphasised specific, practical recommendations. There are other matters that are not included in the report which, if linked to it, would help to create employment. One is the development of a more neutral corporate tax regime so that the combined corporate and personal tax on company dividends does not exceed the equivalent tax on income.  Any conflict between the operation of the county enterprise partnership boards and Forbairt regional offices in promoting indigenous employment growth must be resolved.  Many small firms required assistance in kind rather than cash.  Premises, expertise in marketing, business planning, etc, are most important to small business starting off.  This is why I support the recommendation of the mentor programme.  More enterprise units must be developed, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  The organisations which operate these enterprise units should get the same taxation benefits given to initiatives such as enterprise trust and first step.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Sullivan and Lee mentioned labour law.  I heard an item on the radio this morning about the number of new companies setting up which do not allow or do not have unions.  I recall discussing labour law earlier this year in the House with Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke.  Many employers are ignorant in this area and they should be given training and information.  Sometimes it is simply an impression they have that labour law can be a disincentive to employers.  It is an area that must be examined.</P>
    <P>Apprenticeship schemes should be widened to cover the training of production <Col N="183" /> technicians and operators required by high tech manufacturing and service industries.  We also discussed this area with Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, when she was here dealing with the extension of the apprenticeship scheme.  If these proposals were acted on, along with the many sensible recommendations in the task force report, we could see an upsurge in enterprise and job creation in this country.  This would be welcomed by all.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State said in his speech, the role of small business is recognised in even the most developed countries.  The contribution small business has made to developed economies, such as Germany, Japan and the United States, is well documented. Small business is the driving force behind developing economies and the small joins such as on the Pacific Rim and particularly Taiwan.  Yet, as Senator Lee and others pointed out, Ireland has largely overlooked or grossly underestimated the role of small business.  This report is most welcome because it lays this issue open for debate.  If Minister of State, Deputy S. Brennan, achieves nothing else in his term of office, he will have achieved a huge amount by elevating the debate on small business to its current point.  We now have truths as opposed to myths and reality as opposed to clouded generalities.  This cannot but help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report is well written and well presented.  It is evidently written and produced <Col N="184" /> by people who understand both the problems and potential of small business. The task force has laid out its report admirably under the five pillars that support small business: raising money, rewarding risk, reducing the burdens, providing help and establishing a new deal for small business &mdash; or ultimately reducing bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The issue of raising money has been a perennial problem for business, small, medium and large, since the foundation of the State.  The earliest Governments had to establish State venture capital agencies, the ACC and the ICC, because of conservatism and the simple obduracy of the commercial banking sector.  The commercial banking sector has come a long way since then.  In recent times I have been full of admiration for the major banking groups because they have made a real effort in this area.  However, it must be admitted that they are coming from behind.</P>
    <P>The task force recommendations in this area cover a broad range of issues. One of its first recommendations is reform of the scheme on tax refunds for new enterprises and removing the scheme from the Revenue Commissioners. This is a good recommendation because regardless of the quality of the Revenue Commissioners in the raising of tax revenue, I do not think anybody would regard it as a development agency.</P>
    <P>More representation for small business on the county enterprise partnership boards is suggested.  I have made this proposal on a number of occasions in my own county.  More support from the State sector for companies, such as First Start, is an admirable recommendation.  So are those advocating common codes of practice for commercial banks as a number of speakers mentioned, and a code that would take the family home out of the collateral area.  All of the recommendations under this heading are well focused and well intentioned.  If they were followed they would have a major impact in what has been a particularly difficult area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> I suggest that the Minister take a serious look at the composition of county enterprise boards.  I agree with the comments of the task force in this regard. County enterprise boards are dominated by local officials or by officials of various State agencies and some councillors, the councillors being included almost as an afterthought.  This is a mismatch of the needs on those boards.  I suggest that the board membership should be exclusively limited to councillors, who would provide a democratic input, and to people who have business experience which would provide the relevant amount of business perspective.  I do not believe that with the best will in the world people who have served all of their careers on county councils, corporations or various State agencies have the requisite skills to service those boards either in terms of dealing with the public or dealing with business realities.  We need to look at that.</P>
    <P>The pillar which deals with rewarding risk is an area which I fully support.  The extension of PAYE allowance to people who are self-employed and to their families is clearly just and equitable.  The other proposals in this section of the report concern VAT or proposals which we have all heard and which we have all probably echoed from time to time.</P>
    <P>The report under the third pillar speaks of reducing the burdens.  The Government and the State can help to promote development, but can equally crush it. The problem today is that we are faced with a bewildering array of State agencies. Let me give an example.  In one case a number of years ago a friend of mine came up with the bright idea of processing a certain type of seafood.  He had to go to a whole range of Departments and agencies.  He went to the Department of Transport and Power for a foreshore licence.  He went to the harbour commissioners for a licence to dredge a particular harbour.  He had to go to the county council to get a licence to develop and he had to get county council planning permission for an on-shore structure. Across the river he had to get planning permission from an urban district council. <Col N="186" /> From the health board he had to get permission relating to food processing and specific permission relating to shellfish processing.</P>
    <P>He had to approach the IDA for support for the plant.  He went to An Coras Tráchtála for support for the European market development programme.  He went to BIM, first of all for assistance for funding his on-sea activities and secondly for support for product development and brand development.  He went to the county development board for general assistance, to the Revenue Commissioners for his tax clearance.  He had problems with his telephone lines and went to the local TD as well as going to Telecom Éireann.  He went to FÁS for help with training programmes.  At the end of this exhausting odyssey, the extraordinary thing is that the man actually established a very successful business. We need a programme of debureaucratisation in this whole area.  We need to look at our overall bureaucratic structures, their needs, their number and their imposition on the citizen.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal in this report which deals with an area close to my heart &mdash; the area of forms.  A few years ago, before I went into politics, I wrote a report for the OECD and in it I pointed out that perhaps there are few official communications which cause more angst than the official form.  Throughout a number of OECD states in the 1980s form audit agencies were established to ensure that the forms did not create problems for the general public, for the business public, or indeed for the bureaucracy itself.  The French example was one which we could emulate.  In France it is now illegal to use a non-audited form.  All forms are regularly subject to audit scrutiny, for their language, their scope, their scale, the level of contact they have and for their size. We could do that too.  This task force provides us with yet another good reason for doing that.</P>
    <P>Pillar five deals with providing help. The task force recommends a whole series of things which are eminently suitable. We have to accept that we have too <Col N="187" /> many major players in this whole field of development.  An increasingly frequent query in my clinics, and I am sure in the Minister's, is which agency does what in the development area.  Not only does the multiplicity of State aid institutions confuse us, but it swallows up a huge amount of money in administration.  There is also a very real possibility that the overlap will bring about territorial hostility in the end result, with nothing positive to show for that hostility.  Some attention is clearly needed in this regard.  The report makes the point that we should have one stop shops.  I know the Minister himself is of that view.  We need a one stop shop for development in every county in the country.  We should not tolerate a situation where people have to travel from one end of the county to the other before they find out who does what, where, and when.</P>
    <P>A number of other specific proposals are made which are very welcome.  The Minister has made reference to mandatory payment periods.  That is long overdue. It is a major scandal that State agencies lean on the trade to the extent they do.  This happens right across the board, from small suppliers right across to nursing home owners.  It is time that scandal was brought to an end.  We need a small business division and I recommend very strongly that we put in place an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Business in order to give small business a continuous focus in this and in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on this very good report.  It is an historic report simply because it is the first time we have a report before us written by ordinary people who are in the business.  Every report I ever read in my time in this House was written by professors from universities or consultants and experts, the kind of people whom I have often referred to as being able to write 40 pages of foolscap about the shape of a new penny and never say it was round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> This report is solid, but it lacked one thing.  I have been in the small industry sector for the last 20 years.  I built the first small factories out of my own pocket because I believed there was a need for small industries in rural Ireland.  We lack a marketing arm for small industries.  We have many great craftsmen who produce very good pottery, glassware etc., but they are not good salespeople.  They do not have the time to go out and sell. We should commission a survey of the different types of industries in each county and then market all these different products together.  If that were done we would be more successful, but we are not doing that and unfortunately An Coras Tráchtála is not doing it either.</P>
    <P>The second thing we must do is concentrate on our youth.  Many people are unemployed, but many of those do not want jobs because they are getting good social welfare benefits.  I will not go into detail here but we know that is a problem. We must concentrate on encouraging the work ethic among the youth, the people who are now leaving schools and colleges, so as to get them out of the social welfare system.  Their problem when they go looking for a job is lack of experience. How can they have experience when they have never had a job to work in?</P>
    <P>I recommend that more of our FÁS money be spent on work experience.  In years gone by an apprentice went in to serve his time.  He got experience while he was serving his time and when he went to do a job the employer knew he could do it.  Now a student comes out with a bale of certificates, but that is no guarantee that he or she can do the job because he or she has no practical experience. Some of this money should be given to industries to give young people work experience of six or 12 months.  Then when they apply for a job they can say they have work experience.  We must work hard to create an atmosphere where our young people get work experience so that when they apply for a job, they are not refused work on these grounds.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the hauliers are being brought into this group, because they create a lot of work.  They bring our <Col N="189" /> products to the continent and elsewhere and deliver them on time.  For a long time they were not recognised.  Now they are recognised and are getting assistance. Hauliers are very important because if we do not get our goods to the point of sale we are lost.</P>
    <P>The report says that small businesses should get two years' rates remission. Every young entrepreneur starting up should also get two years' tax remission. When I started in business in 1964 all I wanted was a considerate bank manager, which I had.  While many people would blame banks down the years, I must say I can speak highly of them.  I never put all my eggs in one basket and if I did not get good value from one I got it from another; I played one against another.  I cannot say anything against the banks. But for them many people would not be in business today &mdash; I certainly would not.  In 1964 I found the banks easy to deal with.  If one honours one's word with them, they honour their word; and if one cannot meet commitments to them it is best to go and tell them rather than ignore their letters.</P>
    <P>I have created many small industries in rural Ireland.  However, small industry cannot work without big industry, so we must also have the multinationals.  In my village there are eight industries.  It is probably the only small village in Ireland that has a small rural industrial estate &mdash; they are usually found in the larger towns.  Those rural industries, by and large, provide services to larger companies. Therefore, it is important to remember that we need the big companies so that the small ones can service them and thereby create jobs.</P>
    <P>I am glad the report also deals with work conditions.  If an employer employs somebody they have to get rid of the person in six months or keep them for life, or face redundancy payments or unfair dismissal actions.  This militates against employment.  Environmentalists will have to be more realistic.  Many of the small industries in north Sligo could not be built today because at that time one applied for planning permission, which cost nothing, built a shed and put <Col N="190" /> people to work there.  Today one has to apply for planning permission, carry out an EIS report, which can cost up to £20,000, and one can face environmentalists' objections.  While I know that they are high-minded people who want to keep the country looking well, they are, by and large, in good jobs.  They are not worried about the young people who are trying to get jobs.  We have to marry the economy, industry and the environment.</P>

      <P>I welcome this report and I congratulate the Minister and his staff. There is a wealth of opportunities with the rising tide in the economy, as evidenced by favourable reports for the next few years.  If the Minister gives an incentive to the employers he will get a response, particularly from the small business sector.  What Senator Farrell said is true.  The biggest problem is taking on staff and then having to pay more and more taxation and other liabilities. Employers will create jobs in the small industries if they are given the tax incentives, and there are thousands of jobs waiting to be created.</P>

      <P>I have but a few minutes so I will not be able to deal in detail with the questions put to me.  I will perhaps do so at another time.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators who gave the report a strong welcome and for their constructive criticisms of aspects of it.  It provides us with an agenda for action. There are about 100 proposals in the report.  Seven or eight of those have been put in place since the budget and another put in place yesterday.  It is my ambition to systematically drive the section in the Department of Enterprise and Employment on a day to day basis to ensure that we get as many of these proposals implemented as we can.  All of them are possible and we will report to the Oireachtas on our progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICC criteria were mentioned by Senator Farrelly, Senator Kelleher and Senator O'Sullivan.  We will keep that <Col N="191" /> matter under day to day review.  About £25 million of the £100 million is already committed, so we are a quarter of the way there with the scheme.  I take the points made about the criteria and the need to include some services and to take some risks with the scheme, and I will bring that to the attention of the ICC.</P>
    <P>This is costing the State £3 million in a year, but it is excellent use of State funding and support for industry.  The ICC figures indicate that there have been over 1,000 applications, although the number of jobs which will come from that is not quantified.  However, if for £3 million one can get such a fund in place to make money available to small industry, it is good value compared to a £3 million one-off grant, for example, given to one industry.  We have over 1,000 applications from different firms who will benefit from it.  It is a novel and effective way of helping small industries.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly asked me about the county enterprise boards' data.  My understanding is that it is intended to provide the kind of statistical data one would get from the IDA or Forbairt relating to the number of grants, the average amounts, the number of firms, the geographical locations, the sectors etc.. Without consulting the Minister for Enterprise and Employment I cannot say whether it is intended to include the names of the firms involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I checked the figures recently and I was told that there is about £6 million already committed by the 35 county enterprise boards to about 800 projects.  The initial figures indicate that it is good value for money.  If one can get £6 million spread over 800 different projects that makes an average of about £7,000 per project, and my information is that there is at least one job per project <Col N="192" />&mdash; which is not over ambitious &mdash; and that works out at £7,000 per job.  That is a dramatic improvement on what we normally pay for employment.  It is early days for the county enterprise boards and I stress that I got these figures from the Department at short notice and I will have to recheck them.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher talked about the need for low tax and we all agree with that.  There was a welcome for the £800 allowance.  With regard to the question of mushrooms raised by Senator Farrelly, I will take note of what he has said and I will bring it to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  Senator Farrelly and Senator Honan commented on withholding tax.  The task force more or less agreed with them and I understand the points made, particularly regarding the potential in GPs offices or surgeries for additional service employment.  That issue is addressed by the task force and I thank Senators for their support on it.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche and others raised the question of late payments.  It is not good enough for the State not to pay its Bills and we plan to take some action in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would give a special word of thanks to Senator Lee, who made a thoughtful contribution, particularly in his demand that we get the diagnosis right before we start prescribing.  It came as a shock to me when I chaired the task force and we gave the matter a lot of consideration over many weeks.  The statistics emerged that we have as many start-ups as elsewhere but they do not last.  One figure that emerged is that of all the companies grant-aided in 1983, 56 per cent were no longer there after ten years.  That is not unusual but seems to be the general pattern. In the first five years 40 per cent of firms fail.  If we learn nothing but that, it will change public policy to help start <Col N="193" /> ups, but especially to help those firms to keep going.  I also thank Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Farrelly and Senator Quinn for their thoughtful contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me the time to express my opinion on this matter and to put before the Minister the serious problem that exists at Coláiste Cionntorc at Castlepollard, County Westmeath.  This is the only second level school in north County Westmeath and it is very important to the community at that end of the county which is rural in make up.</P>
      <P>The school was built in 1937 and has had little investment in the last 30 years. The only investment made in this period has been the erection of eight prefabs; in 1984 some of these prefabs were second hand.  The structure of prefabs is, by definition, temporary in nature. However, ten years later the school faces a serious situation with an increase in pupil demand but, because of lack of facilities there is no space available to meet this demand.</P>
      <P>The school has 11 teachers and four job sharing.  The record of the school is illustrated by the fact that 60 per cent of those who sit leaving certificate examinations go on to third level.  In the mid-1980s the school was upgraded from intermediate certificate to leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am putting this case to the Minister on behalf of the subcommittee of the vocational education committee under Mr. Ciaran Temple, and the committee, under our hard working chairman, to ask <Col N="194" /> the Department of Education to replace the existing prefab structures.</P>
    <P>The school has no assembly room, no changing room and no gym facilities. When the principal wishes to address the students he is obliged to address each class.  This is not good enough.  The subcommittee has considered the possibility of a green field site and has had discussions with the Department of Education. The view appears to be that the existing prefab structures should be replaced by new buildings.  I am calling on the Minister for funding in the region of £600,000 which could be spent over two financial years.</P>
    <P>The classrooms and the buildings required are essential if we are to continue teaching in the school in the coming years.  It is not an issue that can be put on the long finger; it is a matter which must be dealt with by the Department before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Education was not available to attend the House this evening, although the House is fortunate to have in attendance an excellent Minister of State, Deputy Aylward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Minister for Education is responsible for the school building programme and we, in the rural part of County Westmeath, require immediate action on this matter. It was difficult for teachers and students to move from one building to another to take classes this year, given the bad weather since November last, and it was not unusual for them to have to wear overcoats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be alarmist because the teachers are excellent, the school is producing excellent results, the parents support the school and the community recognises the great contribution the school is making.  Although we do not have a playing field, the school has won the Leinster Hurling Championship two years since the school gained leaving certificate status.  In addition, the school has <Col N="195" /> won an all Ireland gold medal in the Community Games.  Everything is being done in this area except for a commitment from the Department, to provide the necessary funding.  The prefabs are a disgrace and I invite the Minister to visit Castlepollard and view for herself the conditions there.</P>
    <P>When I consider the hundreds of thousands of pounds that have been spent on other areas and the fact that our proposal has been with the Department since the late 1980s, with deputation after deputation to various Ministers, I fail to understand where value for money can be obtained and acknowledged.</P>
    <P>These prefabs were erected as a temporary measure, yet 20 years later they are still there.  This situation should not be allowed to continue and I look forward to the Minister of State's reply and to the Minister for Education accepting my invitation to visit Castlepollard at an early date.</P>

      <P>I will pass on Senator Cassidy's invitation to the Minister. I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I appreciate his genuine concern regarding accommodation at Castlepollard vocational school.  I can readily identify with the problems of inadequate accommodation in any school, especially where a school has a number of prefabs.</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to give some brief details on the background to this case. Castlepollard vocational school is the only post primary school in the catchment area and currently has an enrolment of 183 pupils.  The present accommodation consists of a small permanent block and a block of prefabricated classrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 a proposal to provide an extension to the school was sanctioned and preliminary planning was initiated. However, enrolments at the school were falling and in 1989, in line with all other major projects, the proposed extension at Castlepollard vocational school was subjected to critical review in the light of all relevant factors, including the most up <Col N="196" /> to date statistical data and demographic trends.</P>
    <P>According to a report by the Central Statistics Office, County Westmeath was one of the four counties most severely hit by emigration in the period 1986 to 1991. In fact, the number of births recorded for County Westmeath in the period 1980 to 1991 fell by 36 per cent.  In the circumstances, the long term viability of Castlepollard vocational school had to be seriously examined.</P>
    <P>In May 1993, the Minister met with a deputation from County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee and the position of Castlepollard vocational school was discussed.  At that meeting it was indicated by the Minister to the deputation that the provision of an extension as originally planned could not be justified in the light of the foregoing information.</P>
    <P>Following this meeting, the vocational education committee sought approval from the Department to provide a completely new school building on a new site to replace the existing facilities at Castlepollard vocational school.  In order to assess how best the accommodation needs might be addressed, the vocational education committee has been asked to undertake a technical examination of all the existing accommodation at the school.  When this is received, officials from the planning and building unit of the Department will consider all the options regarding the future of the school in terms of enrolment, future viability and cost implications.</P>
    <P>Based on the outcome of these considerations a decision can then be reached on the best way forward for Castlepollard vocational school.  The points raised by Senator Cassidy will be fully considered when this examination takes place.</P>

      <P>Of the 24 pupils who left Castlepollard national school last year, 21 enrolled in this school.  Many pupils are going to other schools and have to travel 20 miles in hired buses because services are not provided.  This does not make sense.  Castlepollard deserves a <Col N="197" /> school of its own as much as other areas and should be allowed to develop.  This is a disgrace and a scandal.  The Minister has a duty to the students of this area and has slighted them and their parents by not coming to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for affording me the opportunity of raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>Air services to and from Shannon are of huge concern in Clare and the mid-west. Two weeks ago the sudden and unexpected announcement by Ryanair that it is withdrawing its Shannon to Stansted service was a complete shock and astounded people in the mid-west.  It sent shock waves throughout the community. The service operated successfully for over two years and transported 60,000 passengers.  There was a 70 per cent take up of its passenger seats.  The withdrawal of the service means that over 30,000 people will not come to the mid-West. The timing of the withdrawal was particularly serious.  Many of those who booked with Ryanair for the next few months are tourists who would have come to the region for holidays.  The loss of these visitors to the tourism sector will have a significant impact on the finance generated from tourism in the area.</P>
      <P>I strongly request the Minister to instruct his Department to approach other airlines and encourage them to operate on this route, for which there is a ready made market and a guarantee of success.  A number of airlines can be approached, including Aer Lingus, which should be able to compete successfully on this route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, people are becoming disillusioned with Government policy on <Col N="198" /> Shannon.  The unprecedented introduction by Aer Lingus of a summer schedule, which commenced in Dublin on 27 March and will not commence in Shannon until 6 June, is a typical example of the cynical way in which Shannon is now being treated.  Never in the history of transatlantic scheduling has this occurred.  The summer schedule automatically came into operation at the end of March for both Shannon and Dublin. The excuse given by Aer Lingus was that the Airbus was not delivered from France in time.  I and the people of the mid-west will not accept this.  In previous years we were able to operate transatlantic services from Shannon and Dublin without an airbus and we still have the fleet which was used for this purpose.  A withdrawal of services should have been applied equally to Shannon and Dublin.</P>
    <P>Under the summer schedule, direct flights from Shannon will not start until 6 June even though the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and his cohorts came to Shannon at the end of January to announce that there would be direct daily flights from Shannon to New York throughout the year.  There was glee and delight in Clare and the mid-west at this announcement. It was assumed, and suggested, that this would come into effect on 27 March but it will not happen until 6 June.  This behaviour deserves to be condemned, the people of the mid-west feel very cynical about the way they are being treated. The Minister and the Government stand guilty because they have been negligent in looking after the interests of Shannon.</P>
    <P>There was an increase in the number of those travelling through Shannon in March because Easter fell two weeks earlier than last year.  Unfortunately, sales in the duty free shop in Shannon have substantially decreased due to a fundamental change in Government policy on Shannon.  The onus is on the Minister to act.  We have heard many statements and platitudes and many false promises. It is time for constructive action from the Minister and his Department.  He must publish the task force report on Shannon, which has been on his desk for some time, and act on its recommendations.  It is <Col N="199" /> time that a marketing co-ordinator was appointed to promote Shannon and the efforts of SFADCo. and Aer Rianta to market the airport.</P>
    <P>The Minister must review the change in policy on the Shannon stopover announced by the Government some months ago and establish if it is in the national interest.  One has to question if it is in the national interest to allow American airlines, such as Delta and Tower to openly compete with Aer Lingus on the transatlantic route.  The Minister has responsibility for this area and he must examine it.  The success or failure of Shannon will depend on Government policy.  Unless the Minister issues a directive on Shannon to the national airline and other interests and unless he, the Department and the Government take a specific position on this issue, Shannon will face very serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>In recent times Translift and Ryanair have pulled out.  The withdrawal by Ryanair from the Shannon-Stansted route will result in a reduction of visitors to the region.  The Minister must succeed in finding another airline to operate on the route immediately to ensure that those who wish to visit the region, particularly during the tourist season, will be able to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The air of pessimism and defeatism which the Senator espouses, unfortunately with continuing regularity, in relation to Shannon Airport is not shared by people to whom I talk down there.  Great uncertainty and a sense of crisis has been replaced by a far more decisive and optimistic approach on the part of the people who are interested in the development of Shannon.  I am confident that they will rise to meet that challenge and that those who stated that there was no solution and went back into the trenches talking about problems and old attitudes will be proved wrong once again by those who work for and seek the development of Shannon now and into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> To listen to the Senator one would not realise that new and additional services through Shannon this year are to include a new carrier &mdash; Tower Air &mdash; which will operate a weekly service between New York and both Shannon and Dublin; Aer Lingus has scheduled a 19 per cent increase in its transatlantic capacity through Shannon; US airlines have planned for a substantial increase in charter flights through Shannon from New York, Boston, Chicago, Orlando and two new destinations of Philadelphia and Los Angeles; and there will be four new charter series from Italy.</P>
    <P>I listen to people who are worried about the development of other airports complaining about the increasing market share which Shannon is acquiring <i>vis-à-vis</i> their activities and asking me if there is anything I can do for them.  The Senator will appreciate that I have to look at these issues in the round and policy decisions have been taken which have solved problems people thought were insoluble.  These policy decisions are my responsibility and I have no problem standing over each and every one of them.  When I visit Shannon &mdash; which is my local airport and when I fly transatlantic I always go through there &mdash; I find that the people are very happy that this uncertainty has been lifted and they now have an idea where to go from here.</P>
    <P>The Irish aviation policy document which I published last February sets out comprehensively our aviation policy for the country as a whole.  The document acknowledges that a strong, competitive and efficient network of airlinks is vitally important for developing our trade and tourism links, particularly given our island status and our peripheral geographic location in Europe.</P>
    <P>Against that background and the irreversible world trend towards free trade in aviation, the document sets out the main objectives of the Government's aviation policy which are to improve competitiveness by facilitating a wide range of safe, reliable and regular commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry at the lowest economic cost; to promote direct job and wealth creation <Col N="201" /> in the Irish airline and aviation industry through opening up new market opportunities for Irish based aviation operators; to have at least one substantive, domestically based and financially viable airline capable of providing air services between Ireland and all our main export markets on a year round basis; to promote airline traffic to the regional airports; to ensure that Irish airports are cost competitive and have adequate high quality infrastructure and to ensure that the standards, safety and security of aviation inspire confidence in the use of Irish airspace and technical infrastructure by air carriers.</P>
    <P>I should point out that since 1 January 1993, any European Union carrier can fly on any route within the EU into any Irish or EU airport and without any restriction on frequency, provided slots are available at airports.  I have no statutory function in this matter.</P>
    <P>The provision of transatlantic services by Irish and US airlines is governed by the Ireland/US Air Transport Services Agreement.  Designated airlines of both countries are free to provide services on the routes specified in the agreement. The recently negotiated change to the agreement was managed in a way which takes account of the overall interests of the Irish economy and particularly the interests of regional development and employment in the west and mid-west regions.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant benefits to Shannon of the change in the agreement is that following the Government's approval of the Aer Lingus fleet replacement proposals and the subsequent acquisition by the airline of two A330 aircraft, Aer Lingus is now in a position to provide a daily, year round direct service between Shannon and New York. Aer Lingus has mounted a very successful promotional campaign in North America and says that bookings for the summer are extremely encouraging.  However, Aer Lingus has made it clear that the support of all concerned in the mid-west is vital to ensuring the success of its new year round service Shannon/New York direct service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> Shannon Airport continues to have many advantages as a gateway, particularly its proximity to the major tourist destinations on the west coast of Ireland and the industrial and agricultural strength of the surrounding region.  As part of its overall regional development strategy, the Government is committed to building on these strengths.</P>
    <P>To take advantage of future opportunities in world aviation, the Government is committed to developing Shannon Airport to achieve its maximum potential.  The Government also recognises the need to develop other transport infrastructure in the region both as a support for Shannon Airport but more importantly for the purposes of improving its existing attractiveness for industrial and services developments.  In addition to investment plans for Shannon Airport, the National Development Plan includes provisions for substantial infrastructural development in the west and mid-west regions.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the airport and the region was again demonstrated by the establishment of the Shannon Task Force in June 1993 which was asked to look at ideas to develop additional passenger and freight traffic through Shannon Airport.  Its report contained a number of far-reaching proposals, the implications of which warranted detailed consideration by my Department.  That assessment is nearing completion and I hope to be in a position to announce the Government's decision on the task force's recommendations soon.  I thank those who worked on the task force for the excellent job they did on our behalf.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the statement which Bernie Cahill made in Toulouse when the Airbus was being launched?  The Minister stated again here that: &ldquo;Aer Lingus has made it clear that the support of all concerned in the mid-west is vital to ensuring the success of their new year round service Shannon/New York direct service.&rdquo;  How can this be done effectively and successfully when Aer Lingus is actively promoting <Col N="203" /> special fares from all the regional airports to Dublin Airport to ensure that people fly from Dublin to the United States?  By this promotion they are actively discriminating against Shannon and actively promoting all the regional airports.</P>

      <P>I am not aware if questions after the Adjournment are in order.  The Senator exhibits a persecution complex about Shannon which is not shared by the industry and certainly not shared by people there.  The main recommendation of the task force, which will be out shortly, is that it is time for everybody in the Shannon region &mdash; tourism interests, aviation interests and so on &mdash; to pull together, and to get out and sell their excellent product and their prospects for <Col N="204" /> future success are assured.  I hope I will be in a position to announce positive constructive measures which we will implement to facilitate that happening. However, the idea that someone else will always sort out the problems is a thing of the past and is against the whole idea which has made Shannon such a success over the years.</P>
