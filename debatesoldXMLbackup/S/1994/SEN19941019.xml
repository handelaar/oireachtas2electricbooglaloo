      <P>I welcome you all back after the summer break.  We are looking forward to doing hard work from now until Christmas.</P>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Honan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The absence of a full epidural service for pregnant women in the two maternity units in the Midland Health Board.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Honan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>For this expression of sympathy we will, as usual, have one speaker from each group; there may be one or two others who had a friendship with the former Senator, the late Jack Fitzgerald, who might like to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, unfortunately, my duty to express our sympathy to the family of the former Senator, the late Jack Fitzgerald.  He was a Member of <Col N="234" /> this House for 16 years and a member of the Meath County Board for 30 years.  He was a life long member of the GAA and a former chairman of the Meath County Board.  I know the House will join with me in offering our sympathy to his family and to our colleagues in the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the expression of our sympathy to the family of the late Jack Fitzgerald. He served in this House from 1961 to 1977; he was a member of Meath County Council for 46 years, and was chairman of that body on a few occasions.  He served with distinction in all walks of life in which he was involved.  He was chairman of the Meath County Board and first chairman of the Meath hurling board; he was also a member of the Central Council of the GAA for close on 30 years representing County Meath and he was involved with the first Meath team to win the All Ireland in 1949 and the teams that won in 1954 and 1967.</P>
      <P>Over the years the late Jack Fitzgerald played his part in representing County Meath and bringing many tributes to the county.  I served with him on Meath County Council for a number of years and my late father, who was a member of this House, served with him here.  They became Members of the Oireachtas in the same year &mdash; 1961.  We sympathise with his family and with his nephew, Deputy Brian Fitzgerald.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour group I join in the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Jack Fitzgerald.  He served in this House for many years and on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  He served his county well.  He was a member of the General Council of County Councils and chairman of the eastern region of the RDO.  He had a wide involvement in the GAA at local, county and national level and he had a long time interest in agriculture and rural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> He was a very popular man in the Labour Party in County Meath.  He built up the party in that county and the flag is now being carried by his nephew, Deputy Brian Fitzgerald.  I send the sympathy of our group to his family.</P>

      <P>The Independent group would like to be associated with the condolences expressed and we extend our sympathy to the family of the late Senator, Jack Fitzgerald.  No Member of our group had the privilege or pleasure of working with him or of knowing him so we cannot add a personal comment. However, I understand that he was instrumental in depriving Kerry of an All Ireland at one time.  We recognise his contribution to Irish life and we wish to be associated with the remarks that have been made.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I join in the vote of sympathy.  I extend our sympathy to the late Senator's family, to his colleagues in the Labour Party and to his former colleagues on Meath County Council. He had a long and distinguished record of public service as a politician and as a sportsman and, indeed, in the agricultural sector and for that we must be grateful.  It is a sad occasion and we extend our sympathy.</P>

      <P>When Senator Jack Fitzgerald was involved in the Meath GAA County Board there were never rows in that organisation. However, I must let Senator Rory Kiely &mdash; who is creating havoc in Limerick &mdash; say a few words.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy for the former Senator Jack Fitzgerald.  I knew Senator Fitzgerald through our association with the GAA We were chairmen of our respective boards at the same time and we used to meet at congresses. We had something else in common. <Col N="236" /> Three county GAA chairmen contested the general election in 1969 &mdash; myself, the late Jack Fitzgerald and Sean Browne of Wexford.  None of us was successful, although the latter two won election to the Seanad.  I scrambled into the Seanad a few years later.</P>
      <P>However, the year of my arrival, 1977, was the year when the former Senator Jack Fitzgerald retired from the Seanad so I did not have the experience of serving with him in the House.  I understand he was a great contributor and his contributions enhanced the work of this House.  We developed a mighty friendship.  That friendship was a source of pleasure to me and I was grateful for his advice whenever I sought it.  I convey my sympathy to his family and particularly to Barry &mdash; I know him well &mdash; and Des.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible &mdash; and I am aware that this request is made at the beginning of every session and is rarely answered &mdash; for the Leader of the House to furnish us with a list of the legislation it is proposed either to introduce or to process during this session? It is important to the orderly planning of business for the Opposition parties that such a list be furnished in good time.  It may be that there is a dearth of legislation &mdash; there is certainly a light amount this week.  However, we hope that will be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> I welcome the announcement that the courts Bill will be published.  Could it be introduced introduced in this House?  If that is not possible, perhaps this House could take the Labour Party version of the Bill and the Lower House could look at the Fianna Fáil version and maybe somewhere down the line we might get it together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a strongly held view in my party and, I suspect, in most parts of the House that it is important that the Government be made aware that there is great outrage and annoyance over the way the Alliance Party is being treated with regard to the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. This is the only unionist party which will take part in the forum.  As such, it is taking a great risk but it is also providing a beachhead for the unionist community in the North across which the other unionist parties might eventually &mdash; and maybe not too far into the future &mdash; travel.  The insensitivity with which their representation has been handled is something we should regret. It should be rectified straightaway and, if necessary and if there must be an imbalance, the party should be given more representation than the broadly nationalist parties.  I ask the Leader to convey our sentiments to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1982 the Government received the Gleeson report on pay awards to higher civil servants, politicians, the judiciary, etc. but it has never been considered by the House in any great detail.  It is crucial to bring to the attention of participants in the political process the reason for the increases and the process which was followed. This should be done in order to <Col N="238" /> make it clear in this House that arbitration awards presented to the Government by independent arbitrators should be implemented in full and immediately.</P>
      <P>People should be take on board the seriousness of what is involved and the diminution of the political process which has taken place through many of the discussions on this issue in recent times.  However embarrassed or uncomfortable people feel in dealing with this matter, it should be addressed. There is an industrial relations issue here, as well as a need to give a clear understanding of the political process and the method of determination of salary awards and increases.  I would like this to be discussed in full in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in asking the Leader to outline, if not today then in the near future, the Government's legislative programme between now and Christmas.  At the outset you, a Chathaoirligh, expressed the hope that we would work hard this term.  I share that hope but there are only three Bills on the Order Paper, one of which we will deal with today.  After three months one would expect there to be more legislation on the Order Paper. I ask the Leader to indicate when it is proposed to introduce the Bill on occupier's liability and if it is intended to bring it to the Seanad before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support Senator Manning's remarks about the Alliance Party.  Without it, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will be almost worthless in that it will primarily be people of the nationalist tradition speaking to one another.  Given the party's representation at local authority level in Northern Ireland, and on the basis of equity alone, it should at least have parity with Sinn Féin in the forum.  I appeal to him to put that view to the Taoiseach and the Government to ensure people who will bring a unionist or similar perspective to the talks will be fully represented. We can say with certainty that over a long and distinguished history the Alliance Party has been one of the voices of reason in Northern Ireland <Col N="239" /> and for that reason alone it should have full and adequate representation on the forum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the recent publication of the operational programme on tourism by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.  I ask the Leader if we will have an opportunity to discuss it in this House soon.  The plan will have a major economic impact on tourism and on the development of employment in that sector. It is a vitally important plan and we should have an opportunity to discuss it here.</P>

      <P>Almost two years ago I requested that the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the growing drug problem in this city and throughout the country, which at the time I thought an urgent matter.  This is Drug Awareness Week and I again ask that he arrange such a debate.  It is not sufficient for one Minister to come into the House.  We need an input from the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Justice because people need to know how we are going to tackle the growing drugs problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks made about the number of seats given to the Alliance Party on the forum.  Over the summer the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, gave a number of interviews about bank charges.  Is it intended to introduce legislation to deal with the exorbitant charges levied by the main banks?  If this legislation is not forthcoming soon, will it be possible to debate the matter in this House?  Everyone is affected by this and we all have constituents who have suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reinforce the requests to the Leader that he say firmly to the Taoiseach that the allocation of two seats to the Alliance Party is not enough.  This is sending out all the wrong signals to the Ulster Unionist <Col N="240" /> Party and the Democratic Unionist Party who will, it is hoped, eventually join the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. When they see that the Alliance Party only has two seats, they will not be encouraged to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On foot of the announcement last week of the renunciation of violence by the loyalist groups, this House, as it had during the last term, will have an opportunity of expressing its views on the peace process.  I thank the Tánaiste for this.  From 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. tomorrow there will be statements on Northern Ireland.  I am aware that the Taoiseach is meeting the Leader of the Alliance Party.  I hope the views expressed here today will be part of those discussions and that a suitable resolution to the matter will be found.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that Senator Manning suggested I am not always forthcoming with a list of legislation.  As soon as this list is available from the Chief Whip's Office, it will be available to Members. The courts Bill will be debated in the Dáil next Tuesday.  Senator O'Toole mentioned the Gleeson report.  The Whips may agree that this issue should be discussed.  As this report is being implemented, now may be the time to discuss a future presentation to the Gleeson committee.  The occupiers liability Bill will be initiated during this session.</P>
      <P>At the time of the debates on the national plan, I mentioned that we would have a chance to discuss each operational programme.  I suspect that we would need one or two days to discuss the fact that £652 million will be invested in tourism over the next five to six years.  I am sure the Whips will agree that in the next few weeks the Minister for Tourism and Trade should be in the House to discuss this most important industry and the recent announcements on it.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis asked for a debate on drugs and said that the Ministers for Justice, Health and Education should be involved in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> Senator Farrelly spoke about bank charges.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, has been prominent in dealing with this issue, which has been to the forefront in the Committee Stage of the Consumer Credit Bill, which I hope will be with us soon.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="243" />&ldquo;&lsquo;archaeology&rsquo; means the study of past human societies, either as a whole or of various aspects of them, through the material remains left by those societies and the evidence of their environment, and includes the study of, searching and prospecting for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith ar ais arís chun an Chéim Choiste den oidhreacht seo a chuir ós bhur gcomhair.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to insert a definition and it is an attempt by me to respond to a number of points made on Second Stage.  The Bill will benefit from such an amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 22 states:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 16 and 18, to delete paragraph 9 (2) and to substitute&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Council shall establish standing committees on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  wildlife, and</P>
      <P>(b)  archaeology,</P>
      <P>and the Minister may appoint three persons who are not members of the Council to each standing committee.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> The existing National Heritage Council has an archaeological committee and the council is of the view that a standing committee dealing solely with national monuments would be unduly narrow in focus.  Accordingly, I now propose that the standing committee to be established should be a standing committee in archaeology which, by definition, will encompass monuments but will also include matters related to archaeological excavations and to the presentation of archaeological objects.  A definition of archaeology is therefore necessary. This is structured in such a way as to take account of the generally accepted view of what modern archaeology is and the provisions of Irish law which relate to archaeological matters.</P>
    <P>The definition of archaeology as being the study of past human societies through their material remains is universally accepted by archaeologists and it is also generally accepted that environmental evidence must be taken into account in any such study, in other words, context.  Having given an overall definition of archaeology, it is then necessary to list what is included in the study of archaeology, such as archaeological objects, monuments, landscapes, seascapes and wrecks.  These are defined in section 2.  Apart from the definitions of landscapes and seascapes, which are new, the definitions are the same as those used in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.  I have stressed that I am bringing forward a corpus of legislation which should be taken together.</P>
    <P>It is made clear that the study of these things can also include searching and prospecting for them because this could be an important aspect of archaeological research.  I have included &ldquo;buildings. or parts of any buildings, habitually used for ecclesiastical purposes&rdquo;.  Since these were excluded from the definition of &ldquo;monument&rdquo;, in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, the archaeology standing committee should not be precluded from dealing with issues relating to the remains of early <Col N="245" /> structures, which form part of churches in regular present day use.</P>

      <P>Before paragraph (a), to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) architecture,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The description of archaeology is bizarre because archaeology is a remote issue for most people.  This is an important Bill because it puts the National Heritage Council on a statutory basis.  As far as a large number of people are concerned, the National Heritage Council deals with what is around us.  I do not understand how this definition of archaeology enables us to take care of the heritage of the last three centuries.  The Minister has expanded the definition of archaeology here and it is a very full definition compared to that in many of the dictionaries I checked.  Archaeology is usually regarded as megalithic and one could say that national monuments came up to the year 1700.  I can see how national monuments have been taken into account here but we are leaving out architecture from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.  To most people walking around Dublin Merrion Street would not come within the definition of archaeology.</P>

    <P>Under the amendment the council will establish standing committees. <Col N="246" /> These committees are important.  I realise the council can establish other committees, but the committees they say they must have are really the Minister's. If we cannot have a separate standing committee on architecture, perhaps we could cover archaeology and architecture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here on one of my rare visits before Christmas &mdash; I will be teaching in Trinity College until after that time &mdash; but I was contacted by the college and it made representations to me.  However, I am sure it will not be aggravated by my public appearance here.</P>
      <P>The points made to me were roughly similar to those made by my colleague, Senator Henry, which were principally the need to recognise specifically the built environment from the year 1700 on.  I am happy with the Minister's explanation of archaeology and what is taken to be archaeology.  It does not really matter what the popular conception of archaeology is; what happens within the Bill is that it defines its own terms.  Therefore, what the Minister says here goes.  However, I do have some concerns.  I will probably anticipate putting down an amendment which I would like the Minister to consider: would he establish one of these committees specifically on architecture?  This would be extremely valuable and I will explain why.</P>
      <P>This is an unusually cultivated Minister and he has a good Department.  In the past we have suffered from a situation where the apparent attitude of the State was that the only things of significance were structures built up to the year 1200 and after that period, there was nothing.  There was a particular insensitivity to the development of 18th century architecture, with which I have been involved in a long campaign to help to preserve in this city; but it is not just in Dublin terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 2, there is a definition of a &ldquo;heritage building&rdquo;, which is welcome indeed, and this covers some of the <Col N="247" /> areas raised by Senator Henry.  It says &ldquo;heritage building includes any building, or part thereof, which is of significance because of its intrinsic architectural or artistic quality or its setting....&rdquo;. Says who?  would be my attitude to that. I know there are buildings designated by the Minister as heritage buildings, but what about buildings that are not? Are they automatically to be deemed as of no architectural significance?  When there is a difference of opinion, what is to protect these buildings, specifically buildings from the 17th to the 20th century on?</P>
    <P>May I put on the record something that occurred while I was abroad convalescing. However, being a hoarder, I have managed to save all of the newspapers. I read with great interest in the <i>Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 22 September 1994, something which I am sure will interest the Cathaoirleach because it is really from his part of the country.  I am referring to the proposed demolition of the courthouse in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim.  Frank McDonald, the environment correspondent, has a very interesting article here saying that a 1989 report on the building by Shaffrey Associates, the Dublin architectural and historical building consultants, said it had &ldquo;strong presence and exudes importance&rdquo;, adding that it was still useful and can continue to serve the needs of its occupiers for as long as they would wish.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members of the House are aware of the work of Paddy Shaffrey. He played a significant role in the revitalisation of the city of Kilkenny, which is now one of our jewels, &mdash; and in particular &mdash; quite a modest thing &mdash; the removal of these awful plastic fascia boards which revealed the architectural beauty of that wonderful city.  Mr. Shaffrey is recognised internationally as an authority, and he says that this is a building of considerable architectural significance.  However, on 22 September, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that the previous week at a county council meeting the acting county engineer, Mr. <Col N="248" /> Dick Walsh &mdash; no relation, I am sure, of the political correspondent of the same name &mdash; said the old building had no architectural merit.  That is very worrying and I am sure that the Minister would share my concern.</P>
    <P>Whatever about including architecture formally in the opening preamble &mdash; and it appears to be covered by &ldquo;heritage building&rdquo;&mdash; I would urge the Minister to consider the possibility of establishing a particular committee dealing with architecture.  I will be tabling an amendment to this effect which I hope the Minister may consider. To continue with the argument on this briefly, this takes over some of the work of previous bodies.  The composition of the membership of some of the previous bodies, as Senator Henry also mentioned, was routinely filled by the Department circulating departments of archaeology and so it was heavily weighted in favour of archaeology.  This is a concern, not with this particular Minister; but unless there is a catastrophe of global proportions this Bill will outlast the present Minister and we must make provision for things further down the line.  I would also be concerned that the spread of expertise may inadvertently be narrowed with an archaeological bias.  In my opinion the best way to redress this important point is by accepting the idea of a standing committee dealing specifically with architecture.  I will be tabling this amendment and perhaps the Minister will consider it later.</P>

      <P>From my knowledge and reading of the definition of what archaeology is, I believe it would simply embrace all the points.  I cannot accept Senator Henry's amendment in relation to that.  If you single out one aspect then you will have to single out others as well.  You would have to talk about the landscape and other aspects.  You are actually encompassing in one word the whole definition of our culture and heritage. This definition is broad enough to encompass everything to reflect what we mean by our heritage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment to section 2 and in particular the part which deals with wrecks.  This area has not been covered properly until now.  I am sure the Minister is aware that an amount of material has been removed from the seabed and probably out of the country.  To my knowledge, people around the coast are plying for hire and taking people out diving.  Will it be necessary to rope them all in and grant a licence to them for diving?</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment moved by the Minister because it is an improvement on the term &ldquo;archaeological objects&rdquo; which was included in section 2 of the Bill.  It clearly defines everything relating to archaeology, and having specifics put into the Bill at this stage is welcome.  I can appreciate Senator Henry's concerns in relation to architecture and perhaps the Minister might be in a position to accommodate some of them.  Subsection (c) of his amendment refers to &ldquo;buildings, or parts of any buildings&rdquo;. The only problem there is that it is confined to buildings &ldquo;used for ecclesiastical purposes&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister might consider extending that subsection of his amendment to include buildings of national importance or historical significance, including buildings from the Georgian and other eras which are of significance.  I can understand Senator Henry's particular concerns. The actual specifics of architecture are not included in the Bill.  The Minister may be able to accommodate that by including it in subsection (c) of his amendment.  The amendment tabled by the Minister is a welcome improvement on the original.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In broad terms, I welcome this amendment.  However, I share Senator Henry's view that it would be desirable to include architecture in addition to the other matters which are mentioned.  Our built heritage is very important.  I am prepared to accept the point that &ldquo;heritage building&rdquo; covers some of this ground.  However, it would <Col N="250" /> be desirable to have it included in this section.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the amendment on which I seek the Minister's views is the question of landscape.  There is a definition of landscape later in the Bill which includes &ldquo;areas, sites, vistas and features of significant scenic, archaeological, geological, historical, ecological or other scientific interest&rdquo;.  The point is that the landscape which we have is actually a product of much more immediate activity as well as of long term activity.</P>
      <P>As a practising farmer, I can say with certainty to the Minister that we all committed crimes &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; in the past 20 years out of a lack of knowledge.  The Bill will help us in terms of that knowledge.  However, we destroyed hedgerows and sites of castles or whatever because modern farming practices drove us in that direction. The question then arises of how we protect the landscape, which is probably the most intrinsic thing we have and which we all take for granted.  We take Georgian squares less for granted but the landscape is just as important a part of our heritage.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that representations have been made to him and to other Ministers to develop a national landscape policy.  I think that I am correct in saying that there will be a major conference in the Royal Hospital at the beginning of November to discuss landscape and landscape policy.  There has to be a vehicle to protect the landscape, which is intrinsic to what we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council is given discretion as to the standing committees it can establish. Then, having given it that discretion, we are now going to tell it to establish two standing committees on wildlife and archaeology.  Are there others which might be considered?  One which immediately springs to mind is one on waterways &mdash; canals, locks and buildings which were put up on our canals and rivers.  I mentioned on Second Stage the question of the weirs on the rivers and whether they are within the scope of the Bill.  I suspect that they are under the definition of monuments.  Is the Minister <Col N="251" /> prepared to consider additional standing committees?  If so, is that just a matter purely for the discretion of the council or would the Minister have any input into that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my gratitude to the Members for the spirit in which they are approaching this legislation. I have listened with great care to the points which have been raised and I can see the position from which Senators are coming.  I want to try to address it as positively as I can.</P>
      <P>First, I will dispose of something about which I must restrain myself, which is the boundaries of academic disciplines. I have a very extreme view on that.  The sealed walls around the narrow definitions of disciplines have not been to the benefit of either teachers or scholars in the past.  That is a personal rather than a ministerial view.  I am totally happy with my broader definition of archaeology.</P>
      <P>There is a gap between the definition which someone researched a long time ago in preparation for being a university teacher and the definition of intellectual curiosity that is facilitated by the media allowing greater access to subjects and so forth and I was trying to strike a balance. I am happy with the my inclusion of archaeological objects, monuments. buildings, or parts of any buildings which are habitually used for ecclesiastical purposes, landscapes, seascapes, wrecks and climatological, ecological or geological factors.</P>
      <P>I am not being difficult.  It is one view as to where the boundaries of a subject are, and I am not suggesting that there are not practitioners with a different view; there may be some.  People differ as to where the subject begins and ends but I took my stand with its wider definition.  I believed this was the way to frame a legislative space in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wanted to emphasise a point which is important to me.  I defined &ldquo;monument&rdquo; quite widely in the national monuments legislation and I believe it is necessary to take these Bills together. <Col N="252" /> The new wildlife Bill which I hope to introduce next year will address other issues in relation to landscape.  I am trying to maintain a balance between the three pieces of legislation as each has its separate remit.</P>
    <P>The important point is that I am making the Heritage Council statutory and independent of me.  It is given a mandate in the legislation but there is nothing to stop it meeting and suggesting that new legislation is needed in a certain area.  If that is the case I will not be slow to respond.  If one allows people autonomy and responsibility, one must be willing to let them debate the existence of deficiencies.  I will legislate where I am satisfied that there are deficiencies.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the arguments and will examine them further.  Rather than amending the text at this stage I would prefer to allow the Bill go to the Dáil and be reported back to this House.  I will explore the possibility of having additional select committees to deal with both architecture and waterways.</P>
    <P>One must remember that the heritage council inherits &mdash; that may be the wrong word &mdash; what we state in the Bill. It will be obliged to have the committees we specify but it is not precluded from having any other committee it wishes.  It would be my intention that as the Heritage Council and its committees, both standing and non-standing, deliberate on different issues, they may well identify spaces that have not been covered.  However, the general thrust of this legislation is an attempt, in conjunction with other legislation, to cover all the territory.</P>
    <P>One of the issues brought to my attention during the summer relates to fossils and rocks on cliffs.  People are hammering them off and selling them for gardens.  When I examined that problem I concluded that it can best be dealt with in the forthcoming wildlife legislation.  I introduce most of my material in the Seanad and have said that the Bills should be taken together as a package.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> In response to the reasonable arguments made by Senators by the time the Bill completes this process, I will seek to accommodate these two further standing committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his amendment that ecclesiastical buildings which have been in use for ecclesiastical purposes will be covered.  He will be aware that at different stages I raised the fact that buildings which were being used for ecclesiastical purposes were not being grant aided or supported financially by the Commissioners of Public Works, for example.  Does this amendment cover buildings like St. Mary's Cathedral in Limerick, which sought financial commitments from the Commissioners of Public Works but which was deprived of them as it did not qualify because ecclesiastical services were taking place in the building?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings such buildings into the remit and consideration of the new Heritage Council, which will be able to consider this.  I do not want to mislead the House in any way: the position remains the same in the national monuments legislation, although it is being changed in this legislation. The Heritage Council will be entitled to consider this, prepare policy and respond to the needs, which is appropriate.  The national monuments legislation is not affected by the change I am making here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartened by the Minister's positive response.  Would it be possible for him to accept an amendment on Report Stage to include a standing committee on architecture? Generally speaking, this is something which the public strongly urges.  If I may expand, taking into account the previous discussion about ecclesiastical buildings and so on, such a committee could deal with not only the building as defined.  One can never totally or satisfactorily give a definition which covers all circumstances.  There is a constant loss and attrition of articles of considerable <Col N="254" /> merit from inside buildings, not only from ecclesiastical ones but from other historical buildings, which have not always been covered by legislation &mdash; for example, St. Mary's Church, Mary Street, where the beautiful reredos, the altar, the pulpit and the furnishings were ripped out and there was no come back.  The 18th century box pews, pulpit and stained glass in St. George's Church are apparently not covered.</P>
      <P>A standing committee on architecture, with the type of expertise which is clearly available from architectural historians and some archaeologists, is needed.  I welcome the Minister's breach of the academic boundaries because we are often too confined in university life in little watertight compartments.  There is the practical matter of attrition and I mentioned two or three important ecclesiastical buildings in the city.  I welcome what Senator Daly said about St. Mary's Cathedral in Limerick which is a beautiful building, and I am glad that it may be covered.  However, this concerns not only ecclesiastical buildings and their contents, including altars, stained glass, etc.</P>
      <P>The biggest scandal in this city concerns the rape of 18th century decorative material, principally fireplaces.  A Bossi fireplace discovered in a house, which could have been bought a few years ago for £25,000 or £30,000, could be sold in Sotheby's or Christie's for £276,000.  It is difficult for a business person to resist the temptation of maximising his or her profit.  By and large, buildings in this jurisdiction have not had their interiors listed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it is appropriate to go into that type of minutiae of detail in this legislation, which I welcome. However, I strongly believe that a standing committee on architecture would be a useful addition.  The Minister has kindly indicated that he may take up my suggestion in this area.  May I make a parochial plea which I am sure the Cathaoirleach will endorse?  This is the reforming and amending House of the Oireachtas.  That is our function and <Col N="255" /> we are very frequently criticised for not performing our function adequately.  A number of us have raised matters and, listening to Senator Henry, I assume that she has also been briefed by university colleagues.  Quite a number of us have made this case.</P>
    <P>The case for a standing committee on architecture is generally supported.  The Minister has said that this is interesting, he has listened carefully, as he always does, to the arguments, he is sympathetic and he will consider altering the legislation himself by the time it gets to the Dáil.  I make a plea for the dignity of this House, that perhaps the Minister might give an indication that it would not be regarded as tendentious if I were to put down this amendment on Report Stage and he might even consider accepting it and giving recognition to this House of the Oireachtas of the function for which it is appointed.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise one other matter, which is completely divorced from the central body of what I was saying, although it does occur in the same section so I presume I am entitled to raise it.  The Minister says that heritage objects are objects over 50 years old.  I assume there is some very good reason for them having to be over 50 and since I have just turned 50 myself, I would qualify as a heritage object.  There are works of art of very considerable significance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would.  I am extremely grateful to the Minister for his response and I am very grateful to Senator Norris, Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Dardis for their support.  I might have been wiser to follow the <Col N="256" /> path Senator Taylor-Quinn suggested. Architecture is very important.  Senator Ormonde said that if we mentioned architecture we would have to mention everything else, but we do mention everything else &mdash; landscapes, monuments, seascapes, wrecks, etc.  Coming from a discipline which is just too keen on having precise definitions, that is important.  The Minister saying he will reconsider the matter and Senator Norris saying he may put forward an amendment on Report Stage gives me great heart.  I would like to think this would be possible.</P>
      <P>What Senator Norris said regarding heritage buildings is important.  I have been reading the explanatory memorandum and the Bill together and I am left in some confusion.  Is it in order to speak about this, a Chathaoirligh?  Is it only a heritage building if it is designated as such by the Minister?  If so, the Minister had better start compiling lists at once, otherwise how will we know which are heritage buildings?  I am confused about that.</P>

I was interested in his comments on the protection of fossils.  By way of aside, perhaps he might consider some of the fossils in here and protect us when our time comes.  I thank the Minister for his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to explain one or two points.  The answer to Senator Henry's last question is yes.  Having said yes in relation to heritage buildings that <Col N="257" /> I might specify, on page five of the Bill, lines 33 to 38, it will be seen that the Heritage Council itself can have a much wider consideration, in fact that is already in the legislation:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;works of architecture&rdquo; includes structures, buildings traditional and designed, and groups of buildings including streetscapes and urban vistas, which are of significant architectural or engineering quality, or of intrinsic, historical, aesthetic or scientific interest, together with their attendant grounds, amenities and contents;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1 seeks to insert &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; at the head of the list of areas to be taken into consideration.  I have offered to go further not merely to proceed in this way but to include it as a standing committee as I propose to do with waterways.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by Senator Norris with regard to the functions of the House, and it is in response to the arguments made in the House that I am willing to consider it.  My difficulty, however, is that I hope to have this legislation enacted quickly as I wish to establish the mechanisms and have it in place because it fits with other legislation. That is my only consideration. Whatever decision is made on that, I would prefer to indicate to the Seanad that I will &mdash; not may &mdash; make those changes regarding the two standing committees.  The House may take that as an assurance so that when the legislation is completed in the other House and reported back to this House, it will include the amendments sought.  I would prefer to take this approach rather than have to accept the text as presented to me, because I can go further and, for example, include the other area which arose in this debate &mdash; waterways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is indicating that he will do what we wish.  I am happy that there is to be a standing committee on architecture and in this <Col N="258" /> respect the Minister has given a firm assurance to the House for which I am grateful.  It would, therefore, be pestilential on my part to proceed with an amendment at this stage.</P>
      <P>The importance of this issue is clarified and made more particular by the Minister's remarks when he acknowledged that heritage buildings protected by this legislation are heritage buildings which are designated.  This leaves a wide range of buildings exposed and the Minister, who has a wide variety of responsibilities, cannot be expected to spend all his time designating buildings.</P>
      <P>The balance of the Bill is in favour of archaeology, and many people are glad that is the case because of the pillage of very valuable and important elements of our archaeological heritage.  However, there is a concern that without the specifications of a committee on architecture, some buildings would inadvertently be exposed, including some of their contents, such as fire places and so on.  This is especially true in the conflict which obtained between a leading architectural expert, Mr. Shaffrey, and the agent of a council who wished to demolish in order to erect other buildings as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 22 September 1994.  If that building was not specifically designated by the Minister, it would not be protected.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a standing committee on architecture would go some way to resolve this situation.  I will not be difficult and I will not proceed with the amendment because I accept the Minister's bona fides and congratulate him on the Bill.  I am also happy with the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 24 and 25, to inset the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;cultural heritage&rdquo; includes language, music, dance, song, folklore, paintings and photographs;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not accommodate a wide ranging area in our heritage.  I appreciate there is a wide debate as to what cultural heritage entails.  There can be many definitions covering a variety of areas.  However, part of our heritage and part of us as a people and a nation is what is inherent in our language, music, song, traditional folklore and the old paintings, pictures and photographs which are available.  These are fundamental to our heritage and could be lost unless the necessary legislation is introduced.</P>
      <P>While the Bill before the House deals with heritage, and especially the built heritage, it does not deal with what is a more fundamental heritage, that is, what we are as a people.  Nothing in the Bill addresses this.  The purpose of this amendment is to deal with cultural heritage &mdash; language, music, song and so on.</P>
      <P>There are wide variations from one province to another with regard to types of music, style of dance, etc. and unless something is done to protect, maintain and at least keep some account of these important matters we could lose everything. This is also true of photographs and pictures.  Senators will admit that they no longer see today many sights which were commonplace in their younger days.  The only way this history can be preserved now is through pictures, but in many instances, for example, with regard to the traditional ways of farming, they are no longer available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hopefully the Minister will accept this amendment because it is fundamental to us as a people.  It refers to the life of the nation and its people, our heritage and what has made us what we are <Col N="260" /> today.  It is an important issue which must be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to the case made by Senator Taylor-Quinn. However, I am talking about a corpus of legislation.  I wish to be as helpful as possible to Senators who have put a great deal of work into considering this legislation.  Lest anybody worry about the matter we have disposed of, that is buildings designated by me or in public ownership or whatever, the House will appreciate that those in private ownership can be very important, but it requires a more complex approach. However, if legislation is needed in this area, however complex, I will attempt it, but I want to see first how the other area works.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point made by Senator Taylor-Quinn, the Irish word for heritage is &ldquo;oidhreactht&rdquo;, which has a much wider definition.  In this respect there is a debate as to what constitutes heritage, and if we have inherited narrow definitions; in some areas &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; includes houses, parklands etc. However, the word &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; is much wider and includes folk history and so on.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendment proposes that &ldquo;&lsquo;cultural heritage&rsquo; includes language, music, dance, song, folklore, paintings and photographs;&rdquo;. Paintings and photographs are clearly encompassed in the legislation. However, if one refers to language, music, dance and folklore, it is not that they are, or are not, part of our cultural heritage; it is that they are part of our cultural heritage which it is appropriate to protect and sustain in this legislation. For example, in the case of the language, there is a statutory role for Bord na Gaeilge.  With regard to music, dance and song, two basic pieces of legislation dealing with the Arts Council contain functions dealing with these areas.  In addition, the Folklore Commission deals with folklore.</P>

    <P>I am unable to accept the amendment because at the outset I made it clear that we would concentrate on delivering <Col N="261" /> what protections we can for the physical heritage.  This is not to say that the cultural heritage does not include all the matters raised, but rather that they are better dealt with in other legislation, such as that encompassing the two statutory bodies referred to.</P>
    <P>Paintings and photographs come within the scope of the Bill, under the definition of &ldquo;heritage objects&rdquo; set out in section 2.  From a technical point of view, the definition of &ldquo;cultural heritage&rdquo; suggested in the amendment is not consistent with definitions throughout the Bill.  Regretfully, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister cannot accept the amendment.  However, I am delighted he stated that paintings and photographs are encompassed in the Bill under &ldquo;heritage objects&rdquo;.  I welcome that and I hope everything will be done to ensure maximum protection of those aspects of our heritage.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about folklore, music and dance.  Every year the local characters who have a wealth of tradition, whether music or folklore, die and only records of them that remain are interviews by RTE or others. It is unfortunate that we depend on such people to maintain our folklore and music.  The Minister comes from County Clare and is fully aware of the position to which I refer.  For example, what is the statutory mechanism to maintain records of the music of Michael Russell and the Crehans and keep it as part of our heritage?  The reality is that it is kept only if a recorder from RTE or elsewhere is sufficiently interested and make a tape which is subsequently played.  Otherwise, this aspect of our culture heritage is lost.  I hope the Minister will accept the broader dimension in the legislation.  I would appreciate it if he would examine this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that photographs and paintings can be included under &ldquo;heritage objects&rdquo; and I appreciate that language is already taken care of in other areas, such as the universities.  My <Col N="262" /> main concern is song, music and dance. This area is not taken care of and it is an important part of our heritage.  I hope the Minister will review it.  I appreciate the difficulty and that the Bill appears to be specifically taking care of the physical aspects of our heritage. However, I ask him to examine this aspect for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The views expressed are not exclusive.  Music, song and dance are important but they are different from physical heritage.  The Bill is structured in such a way as to look after physical heritage.  There are ways of dealing with the musical legacy of Michael Russell, and the Senator mentioned one way.  This can probably be best provided &mdash; and we have gone some way towards this already &mdash; by making adequate provision for the recording of music and song.  Recently I opened a new remastering facility which was assisted by my Department.  This will ensure that better quality original forms are available.</P>
      <P>These matters are better dealt with by the other legislation.  The Arts Council has specific functions in that regard.  The areas mentioned in the amendment have received significantly increased funding, over 32 per cent, since I came into office.  I have no difficulty expressing agreement in relation to these matters. However, I cannot agree that this Bill is the place in which to address them.  They are best addressed in legislation which stands behind the other bodies I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who is quite close to the arts, my first concern is to assist the music, songs and dance, being performed at present and to ensure that they are part of vibrant contemporary expression.  This is very important.  I know some of the musicians who are frequently referred to in this regard, such as the late Seamus <Col N="263" /> Ennis.  He would be horrified if he and his Morris Oxford car were put into the definition of a type of monument.  My point, which does not take from Senator Taylor-Quinn's, is that there is contemporary expression which draws from heritage behind music, song and dance. This matter is addressed through legislation governing the arts.  Recording and remastering techniques are important. These are considerations I will bear in mind in examining how the other legislation works.  However, they do not easily fit into this legislation.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 23, after &ldquo;country&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is non-contentious.  The existing definition of &ldquo;heritage building&rdquo; refers to buildings of architectural artistic significance or of local or national historical significance. In the course of the Second Stage debate, Senator Kelly stated that the definition of &ldquo;heritage building&rdquo; was somewhat narrow in that it did not include, in addition to buildings associated with local or national history, buildings associated with the history of other countries, for example, the birthplaces of people who became famous outside Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that such buildings are included in the definition of &ldquo;heritage building&rdquo;. I am responding to a point made on Second Stage.  Heritage buildings are referred to section 10 of the Bill which affords increased protection to such buildings owned by public authorities, that is the State, State agencies and local authorities.  Under section 10, the council may offer advice on the preservation and upkeep of such buildings and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht may, on the advice of the council, designate a building owned by a public authority as a heritage building.  A public <Col N="264" /> authority may not proceed with a proposal to demolish, alter significantly or dispose of such a building contrary to the advice of the council unless the Minister agrees to the proposal or to a modified form of the proposal or the Government agrees to the proposal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 30, to delete &ldquo;50&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;25&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Kelly is in the House. Having witnessed her victory on amendment No. 3, I am confident she will support this amendment because she recommended it on Second Stage.  This prompted me to put down this amendment and when we come to vote on it, it will be interesting to see how she votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a serious point which was well made on Second Stage. It relates to heritage objects, which are defined in the Bill as it stands as 50 years or more, whereas the amendment suggests a 25 year limit.  There are good grounds for this move, particularly in the case of industry which is included as part of the heritage objects.  The pace of technological change is such that we can all recall items which were quite common in the country 25 years ago but no longer.  For example, the steam engine would come well within the 50 year period and I regard some industrial items as part of our heritage.  If there is a deficiency in all the definitions in this section it is that it does not clearly define the industrial part of our heritage. Perhaps this is due to the type of our society, which was not as industrialised as our nearest island neighbour. There are items of farming machinery which, were commonplace 25 years ago but are extremely rare today and they are frequently found only on tourist farms around the country.  Unless they are looked after they will disappear and they are part of our heritage.  One could come to a ludicrous point and say that the Minister's tie is of such quality and <Col N="265" /> art that it might need to be protected within the year or even after dinner in Tinakilly House.</P>
    <P>The pace of technological change, particularly in items of industrial derivation, makes 50 years far too generous a time span.  It also applies to literature; limited edition books might be quite rare and of value yet be well within the 50 year limit.  I ask the Minister to sympathetically consider this amendment which was so well argued for on Second Stage by Senator Kelly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to support Senator Dardis as to do otherwise might leave me accused of hypocrisy.  I made this point on Second Stage and he has reiterated it.  I can only agree with him and ask the Minister if there was a particular reason why 50 years was chosen.  Was it just a convenient figure?  If so, perhaps 25 years might be equally convenient and he could concede to the amendment. Is there an historical or legal reason 50 years was chosen?  Perhaps 50 years is used in other legislation and to substitute something else in this legislation would negate other legislation with which I am not familiar.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Dardis and I am interested in what Senator Kelly had to say on the matter. If she wishes to have a reason to cross the floor of the House we could have a vote &mdash; it is as good an issue as who should be President of the High Court.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator Kelly have spoken with sense on this issue. Can the Minister explain why it is necessary to have any fixed term at all?  The Minister spoke earlier about academic compartmentalisation which can be arbitrary &mdash; boundaries can be set at a particular time and they remain and cannot be breached from that point on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we think historically we tend to think in compartments of 25 or 30 or 50 years and this strikes me when thinking about the troubles in Northern Ireland as against our own troubles.  We tend to consider 1919 to 1921 as a little compartment and, in the same way, we think <Col N="266" /> of the troubles in Northern Ireland of the last 25 years as a compartment in history.  Sometimes they are meaningful and sometimes not, but in this case I wonder if the intrinsic value of the object does not need to be tied down by a 25 or 50 year limit.  They are arbitrary limits and could at some later stage provide ballast for some bureaucratic interpretation which might work against the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he might save Senator Kelly from having to cross the floor of the House on this issue and incur all the associated wrath and penalties.</P>

      <P>I will have to stand alone on this at the moment.  That which is related to heritage should be old &mdash; I like old things and I do not like things around me that are only 15 or 20 years old.  I like antique furniture or that which is rare.  If I had something which is 25 years old I could still find it in the shops.  I know that the limits are arbitrary but I could not say that something which is 25 years old is of absolute heritage value.  It has to be old to be rated as heritage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis. There is an important point at which something is old fashioned before it is old, and something which is old fashioned can be quite valuable.  I am thinking of <i>art nouveau</i> in this context, an enormous amount of which was destroyed before it was considered to be of value.  I know that antique furniture is extraordinarily valuable and some things can become valuable due to technological changes and changes in fashions.  Perhaps therefore the Minister might consider dropping the age limit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> The Minister himself could be classified within the 50 year category.  I am not sure if the Minister would be recognised as an heritage object but many of his works would be on the way to becoming heritage within a certain number of years.  If he reduced the limit to 25 years or if he lifted the limit altogether, some of his works would enter into the classification sooner.</P>

Will this rule out the works of Mr. Gerry Adams, for example?  A limit of 50 years is reasonable enough, yet there are things which may need to be protected which would not be 50 years old and it would be a shame if that facility was not afforded these objects. Perhaps the Minister would examine the matter and a compromise might be arrived at &mdash; that is the best way in politics. I am thinking of objects that are not 25 years old yet might soon be &mdash; for example, the wood carvings that were done in the concentration camps in the Six Counties.  There are many things which might need to be protected as part of our heritage.</P>

      <P>There is a contradiction in the Bill as drafted.  It says that heritage objects mean objects of 50 years old which are works of art.  There is a huge subjective assessment as to what is a work of art.  On the one hand we are writing the 50 years in stone and on the other hand we are considering works of art.  It is rather difficult to define a work of art and because of that the 50 year consideration becomes more ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to have legislation with which people are happy. I will not delay on this matter but to explain where the figure 50 came from. There are commissions which reported on the matter of heritage objects.  I do not have the notes with me but if I recall correctly from memory, the Hamilton commission produced a figure of 50 years.  I take the point that when these commissions reported they were looking at a definition that might, at that time, have been overloaded in favour of art.  I must take account of one point about which I am in strong agreement with Senator Dardis.  It relates to industrial artefacts.  There is very fine documentation on the industrial archaeology of Belfast, for example, and I agree that there would be equivalence in the agricultural area.</P>
      <P>Members have asked why that figure is included at all.  It was included to ensure that there would not be wasteful arguments about overlapping between the Arts Council &mdash; which deals with the contemporary &mdash; and the Heritage Council.  I am not hung up on the figure 50.  I will accept the figure 25; I accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In the course of the Second Stage debate Senator Taylor-Quinn stated that the definition of national heritage in section 6 of the Bill did not specifically include the many valuable documents in institutions around the country.  Subsequently, I received representations from genealogical societies requesting the specific inclusion of the genealogical heritage in the definition of national heritage.  The purpose of amendment No. 5, therefore, is to include documents and records of cultural importance, such as genealogical records, for example, ecclesiastical records of births, baptisms and marriages and other documents of historical interest, in the definition of heritage objects.</P>
      <P>In section 2 heritage objects are included in the definition of national heritage.  In section 6, which sets out the functions of the council in relation to that heritage, if amendment No. 5 is agreed to amendment No. 5a would be unnecessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is moving in the direction my amendment intended to address.  I can explain briefly the reason for my amendment and the need it seeks to redress.  Like the Minister I was contacted by a number of genealogical societies, in particular the Dún Laoghaire Genealogical Society which is one of the premier such societies in the country.  Indeed, having Denis, The O'Conor Don, Prince of Connacht, as its president should certainly give it a standing among genealogical societies which perhaps few others, if any, could equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This society welcomes the Bill and believes it will make an important contribution. The society is concerned, however, at the absence of any provision <Col N="270" /> for the protection of what it calls our genealogical heritage&mdash;</P>
    <P>as represented by the documented record of the people of Ireland held by the State, local authorities. churches and various private collections. These records, many predating civil registration, are the only source for the study of Irish genealogy due to the great loss of the bulk of our public records in the fire at the Four Courts in 1922.</P>
    <P>The society continues:</P>
    <P>The information contained, for example, in church registers is the most comprehensive record of the people of Ireland in whom this Bill proposes to establish ownership of our national heritage and therefore vitally important to the study of the history, genealogy and social conditions of our people.  While ownership of the original documents is not in question the society proposes that the inclusion of our &ldquo;genealogical heritage&rdquo; would provide for the microfilming of all such records and their availability, as a national resource, in either the National Library or the national archive.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the proposal the Minister is making does not go far enough to meet the wishes of the society.  The Minister is anxious to meet the case being made by the bona fide genealogical societies and I suggest, if possible, that the Minister's officials or the Minister, meet these people between now and when the Bill is before the Dáil to see if their concerns can be met.  The wording I am proposing would go somewhat further but there is not a huge difference between what the Minister and I are proposing.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity we will not have again because I hope this Bill will not have to be changed or replaced for a long time.  There is a genuine case to be discussed and I would be happy if the Minister while going ahead with his own amendment, could arrange to see if something is missing from the scope of <Col N="271" /> this Bill which could usefully be incorporated into it.  I suspect we will not get to Report Stage today.</P>

If the wording is narrow there will always be those who will say that something is non-genealogical.  This facilitates argument and exclusion.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  seek to protect the national heritage.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill as drafted asks the council to do certain tasks and gives it certain responsibilities; all of them are worthy but many are aspirational.  The Minister is determined to protect the national heritage in addition to the other matters he asks the council to do in the Bill. That is the reason for suggesting the insertion of a clause seeking to protect the national heritage.  This will not impose an obligation on the council to protect the national heritage; it only asks them to seek to protect it, which is a slight distinction.</P>
      <P>The related amendment deals with the Title, which currently states this legislation is to promote knowledge and appreciation of the national heritage.  It should go further and include an aspiration to protect that heritage.  The Minister has said on several occasions during the debate that this legislation is not in isolation; there are other related Acts and Bills.  The National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1993, includes a provision for the protection and preservation of archaeological objects, so that is a precedent for this amendment.  It would strengthen the Bill considerably if the council was asked to do this and I know the Minister wants it to do so.  The amendments are moved in that spirit.</P>

      <P>I see Senator Dardis' point.  I will accept amendment No. 23, which is a good proposal and will strengthen the Bill, but I cannot accept amendment No. 8.  I believe an amendment to the Title to include protection in the aims of the Bill, together with the general provisions in section 6 (1), will meet the concerns of Senator Dardis.</P>
      <P>Other agencies, such as the Office of Public Works, are involved in the protection of heritage and the council's role in this respect will be to assist and support those agencies and the individuals and voluntary organisations also involved.  The council will also propose policies and priorities for the protection of national heritage.</P>
      <P>If I accept amendment No. 23 I would not wish to accept amendment No. 8 because that might diminish rather than expand the council's role in this area.  If the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo; is in the Title, the phrase &ldquo;seek to protect&rdquo; might be seen to be a lesser power.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> This is a difficult area.  There is an obligation on us to ensure that not only those items in public ownership but also those in private ownership can be protected and preserved and the council has a legitimate interest in those items. In County Kildare there are two great buildings, Castletown House and Carton House.  The Minister has been to Castletown and knows it is in public ownership, but Carton is not.  They are buildings of international stature and are a major national resource.  As I said to him on Second Stage, I would like to see Carton in State ownership because that is the most effective way of preserving it for future generations.  We can argue about the type of society which created those buildings and whether or not it was appropriate.  Those buildings are there and are of immense value.</P>
    <P>This is why I have attempted to widen the scope from local authorities to include &ldquo;persons or groups&rdquo;.  By &ldquo;groups&rdquo; I am thinking of things which may be in the ownership of PLC companies, for instance.  It is probable that industrial items may be owned by such companies.  This is why I have put down these amendments.  Amendments Nos. 10 to 17, inclusive, are for reasons of consistency because &ldquo;persons or groups&rdquo; must be referred to repeatedly throughout the section.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred earlier to the complexity of legislation and I am prepared to accept that point.  How can we achieve the objective I believe the Minister has, that is, to ensure that items which are in private ownership are, to the extent that it is possible, protected and preserved?  This applies particularly to these buildings, the architecture of which is of international significance.  It imposes a huge obligation on a private owner to try to preserve this type of building.  Enough of them have fallen down over the past 50 years, even the past 25 years, for us to ensure that more of them do not collapse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the amendment.  However, we must resist the temptation to try to <Col N="277" /> solve all the problems we have through this legislation.  The provision of section 10 is a major new initiative and will provide special protection for heritage buildings in public ownership.  There are other legislative codes dealing with the protection of built heritage such as the listing procedures under the Planning Acts and the provisions for making preservations orders under the National Monuments Acts.  These are the instruments we have and they provide protection for buildings of significance.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the existing legislation is not perfect and I assure the House that I am considering introducing further legislative proposals to deal with the situation.  However, I cannot do this in the way suggested by the Senator.  If I were to accept his series of related amendments, it would be welcomed by private owners of buildings of significance, who genuinely want them preserved and handed on, but it would be strongly resisted on a constitutional basis by other private owners.  There is an inescapable constitutional problem, but I do not believe this is insuperable.</P>
      <P>I would like to address what I can in this legislation, that is, buildings in public ownership, and later deal with this issue, in separate legislation if necessary. I will consider the opinion of the new Heritage Council on the matter.  I am not leaving matters as they are.  In response to the core of this argument, in an amendment I have tabled to section 11 I propose to enable the council to provide advice to the individual property owner, <i>inter alia</i>, and this may go some way towards meeting the concern expressed.  If my amendment to section 11 is accepted, the council will be available to the individual private owner in an advisory way and I will begin to look at the obstacles to addressing the issue of what is in private ownership and at overcoming in a fundamental way the constitutional difficulties this poses.</P>

      <P>I expected the Minister to raise the constitutional problem and I accept this is a problem.  To return to the specific case I have in mind, which relates to Carton House.  I mentioned this matter to the Minister on Second Stage.  There was a proposal before Kildare County Council for a material contravention of the county development plan so that Carton House could be developed into a luxury hotel and two golf courses.  This was an extremely difficult decision for the members of the council.  On the one hand, there is an absolute desire to preserve the building and the integrity of its parkland &mdash; the Minister spoke about parkland earlier &mdash; which is integrally associated with it. On the other hand, there is the possibility that if we do not allow this type of development, the whole edifice would fall down because of lack of funds.  The private owners, unless they have immense personal wealth, cannot preserve the building.  This is the difficult problem confronting the members of the local authority.  In addition, there is the question of the jobs which would be generated.  If we allowed this development to take place, some of us would be doing so on the basis that if we prevented it we could envisage circumstances in 15 years time where there <Col N="279" /> would be nothing but houses from Leixlip to Maynooth and just an island where Carton House is situated.  The ideal solution is one which I urge the Minister and the Government to take on board, that is for the State to acquire the property and it would then come within the scope of the Bill.  In terms of the substantive aspect of the amendments, I accept what the Minister says and will withdraw them.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point made by Senator Dardis.  I am not suggesting that my amendment to section 11 deals with all of the matters he had in mind when he tabled his amendments. My amendment links heritage buildings in private ownership to the Heritage Council in an advisory way.  I want legislation to be enacted in areas over which we have a clear and easy management process.  I then want to look at areas to which it is appropriate to extend legislation but which are more difficult.  I will have the opinion of the council on this.  I did not want to hold up the whole <i>corpus</i> of legislation.  I want all the legislation to hang together and to be on certain ground.  I will introduce further legislation in future.  I appreciate that Senator Dardis, by withdrawing his amendments, understands my difficulty.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to the definition of heritage buildings in the definition section.  Section 10 (4) refers to such buildings to which the legislation applies, which in this case specifies public ownership.</P>

      <P>In page 7, lines 40 and 41, to delete paragraphs (a) and (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the National Heritage Council giving advice on work <Col N="280" /> the local authority might propose to carry out which would affect a heritage building.  However, the Minister or the Government must agree to the proposal or to a modified form of the proposal. The amendment seeks to remove the Minister's discretion and to make it a matter for the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris said we have a cultivated Minister.  I was not sure if he meant that in an agricultural sense or in an artistic sense, but I accept that the Minister is a cultivated person.  Unfortunately, history teaches us &mdash; not only in respect of this legislation, but in respect of other legislation &mdash; that successors may not always be as enlightened as the people who bring the Bills to the House. Because the Minister's successor may not be as enlightened as he is, it should fall to more than one person to make such a decision.  That is why I propose to delete the two paragraphs which state that the Minister would be able to agree to the proposal or to modify the proposal, and leave it for the Government, which always acts in its collective spirit, to decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  As Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I, or whoever is the incumbent of this office in future, have responsibility for policy in relation to physical heritage.  Under subsection (4) I will have the power to designate buildings as heritage buildings on the advice of the council.  There is broad support for this in the Seanad.  It is, therefore, reasonable that any appeals by public authorities in relation to decisions by the council on proposals by such authorities about heritage buildings should be considered by me.  In this regard I will be able to call on the advice of my technical staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for all such appeals &mdash; and it will be all appeals if I accept this amendment &mdash; to go to Government in the first instance.  I am not aware of any precedents in law for such behaviour.  I put in a check so as to have a balance.  Under section 10 (3) (c) I have provided for cases to go to <Col N="281" /> Government in exceptional circumstances where the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, having designated a heritage building and wishing to protect it, finds himself in contention with the public authority responsible to another Minister, who can then refer the matter to the Government.  If I, as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, am running the Department and I set up a mechanism for identifying heritage buildings at risk, and if I accept the council's advice, which is autonomous, and it finds itself in contention with the local authority, then it is only reasonable that the responsible Minister should deal with appeals.  If the building is the responsibility of another Minister, then that Minister can go to Government in those exceptional circumstances. I have provided for this in the case of a contentious circumstance.  That is different from assuming that in all cases they should bypass the Minister who is responsible and automatically be considered by the Government.  I could not concede to that request.</P>

      <P>The exceptional circumstances worry me.  We discussed a hypothetical case of a courthouse in a provincial town, which was in an urban renewal area and which someone wanted to renovate, demolish or remove.  I foresee difficulties when one person can make such decisions and there is the opportunity to exert significant political influence.  I am worried about this.  I would prefer an independent body or even the council to make the decision.  However, if the council is selected, as this legislation suggests, by the Minister, then it is effectively the same thing.  I have serious reservations about vesting such power in one individual. By doing so, I foresee circumstances where something which should not happen, could and would be allowed to happen.</P>

      <P>The existing section 11 states that the council may co-operate with and provide assistance, including financial assistance, to persons or groups on matters relating to its functions. The purpose of this amendment is two-fold.  It provides that, in addition to co-operation and providing assistance, the council may also provide advice. <Col N="283" /> This would give the council specific power to advise planning authorities in relation to planning applications where heritage is affected.  This amendment also provides that such co-operation, assistance and advice may be provided to any person or body, including a public authority.  This will be a continuation of the current practice of the existing non-statutory Heritage Council.  It also addresses a point made by Senator Ormonde on Second Stage that it should be clearly stated that the council may provide assistance to local authorities. &ldquo;Public authority&rdquo; is defined in section 2 of the Bill and it means the State, a State agency or a local authority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (2), line 42, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and to be published by the Council&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Certain things have to happen to the accounts of the council.  When they have gone through the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and so on, they have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that is to be welcomed. However, I suggest to the Minister that if section 21 is to be consistent with section 22, the accounts should be published.  It is not clear to me from reading the Bill that the report of the council is the same as its accounts.  If it is the case that they are the same and contain the accounts of the council, then obviously what I am arguing for is already covered under the scope of section 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that they are two independent or separate matters and <Col N="284" /> there is only an obligation on the Minister to lay the accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas and on the council to publish its report which, from my reading of the Bill, need not necessarily contain the accounts.  The accounts should be published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting the amendment.  The reason for this &mdash; I know the point Senator Dardis is making &mdash; is that I consider that the amendment is unnecessary as the annual accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on them will normally be included, if available, in the annual report of the council for that year to be published in accordance with section 22.</P>
      <P>I take the point that section 22 deals with the publication of the annual report.  The annual reports should be published in a timely fashion and if they are unduly delayed, they become dated and lose interest.  Sometimes because of factors outside the control of bodies such as the Heritage Council, there are long delays in the auditing of their accounts.  I would not wish the annual reports to be delayed while the audited accounts are awaited.  The accounts should be included in the annual reports if the auditing is done in time, otherwise the report will be published without the accounts.  The council will be free to publish the accounts separately but it would be unduly onerous to require it to do so.  The provision requiring the council to present the audited accounts to the Minister, who must lay them before each House, is sufficient safeguard of the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the point Senator Dardis is making, but it is better to assure the annual publication of the report and not delay it if anything goes wrong with the accounts.  If the report is published and the audited accounts are not included, it is open to any Member to raise the question as to why they are being delayed.  If one does it the other way, one will put the annual report at the mercy of any obstacle that might be there to the auditing of the accounts.  I <Col N="285" /> felt on balance that this was giving more accountability so that in the normal way, one would have the report inclusive of the audited accounts.  If for any reason the accounts were not audited, the annual report would still go ahead and it would then be open to any Member in either or both Houses to ask the reasons for the non-inclusion of the audited accounts, which would then be published. If one does it the other way around, one will then be saying that one would make it more onerous on people. This is the most flexible way to do it.  I am giving accountability without at the same time putting in a demand on the council which would be impractical in application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's desire to have the report published quickly, but it is extremely unsatisfactory to have a report that does not contain accounts.  The shareholders of Guinness PLC, for example, would not be happy if they got an annual report which did not have the accounts.  They are central to the activities of the council. Whatever delays there are in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be speeded up.  The fact that it will be slow, thereby holding up the report, is not a satisfactory excuse.  I have established the point that the report, as defined in the Bill, need not necessarily contain the accounts and that is what worries me.</P>
      <P>I notice that the annual reports and accounts of Teagasc for 1992-93 have been laid before the House on today's Order Paper.  That cannot be regarded as satisfactory either, but in the spirit of transparency, the accounts should be published.  Even if the accounts are not with the report, that does not mean that they should not be published when the accounts become available and only then be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Of course they should be published.  The public are entitled to know what happens in these type of bodies.</P>

      <P>I am not in disagreement with the principle of transparency or accountability.  I have an active approach towards this matter.  I have said that it would be normal to expect that the annual report would include the accounts.  If one published the annual report a couple of times without including the accounts, it would be open, as I have already said, to any Senator or Deputy to ask why we are getting the report without an auditing of the accounts.  In that sense one is drawing the focus and attention of both Houses on this matter.  If I do it the other way, and I am not suggesting that semi-State and other bodies will not change, one could have a situation where because the accounts are not audited &mdash; circumstances could arise that are not really within the control of the body involved &mdash; and the report will be delayed as well.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty about ensuring that all information, including the accounts, be available to scrutiny.  I have said, and it is on the record of this House, that it is my interpretation that the reports would normally include the audited accounts and I repeat that. Therefore, it will be exceptional if it did not do that.  My approach is more flexible in practice.  It is a speedier reporting.  Senator Dardis mentioned, for example, the parallel with the private corporate world.  I am not so sure the idea of shareholders getting a report with good accounts every year is that general.</P>

      <P>In a curious way the Minister is arguing my case for me.  Let us take the case where the accounts do not appear for two years and a Deputy or Senator raises the matter as to why they have not.  The Minister of the day can tell them to look at section 21 of the Bill.  There is no obligation on them at all to publish the accounts; there is only an obligation on them to lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas. But I believe there is an obligation on them to publish the accounts so that when a Deputy or Senator raises a question <Col N="287" /> about the delay, the Minister can say &ldquo;Yes, under the terms of the Bill, we are compelled to publish them and to make them available separately from the report&rdquo;.</P>

If this is done, I cannot see for the life of me why use cannot be made of them?  We are here as legislators to respond to them being made available to the Oireachtas.  If there was something highly improper, any active Senator or Deputy could quickly ensure they went into the realm of public discussion.</P>

When I have to appoint councils, for example the Arts Council, different bodies usually write to me &mdash; and they are welcome to do so &mdash; making suggestions as to who might represent their interests in a particular area, but the members who end up being appointed are asked not to represent one interest but the totality of the functions as expressed in the legislation.  For example, someone with a background of dance appointed to the Arts Council is required and asked to address the issues in the mandate of the Arts Council in its most general sense.</P>
      <P>I understand the point the Senator has made but you could get into difficulties because the wording, as suggested, could be imprecise and a little dangerous.  Using the term &ldquo;a representative range of the functions of the council&rdquo;, one could easily end up having an argument as to which nominated and appointed member represented which function.  Or, if a vacancy occurred whose precise function was now not represented, you would have to some extent sacrificed the principle of generality for one of representation.  I have said openly that I am not allowing people to regard themselves just as constituencies for appointment to the different bodies.  I want them to suggest names as being appropriate but representing the general purpose of the legislation which is in place when they get there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> I prefer the wording of paragraph 2 (2) of the Schedule.  I am not suggesting that it is perfect but I think it is better. It refers to the members of the council having &ldquo;knowledge or experience of or in relation to the national heritage&rdquo;.  It is a better formulation than that suggested in amendment No. 21a which, reluctantly, I cannot accept.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the overall thrust of the Bill.  However, I want to ask the Minister for clarification of section 10.  I am raising this because of a somewhat unusual public intervention by the Minister in relation to a building in Carrick-on-Shannon which was referred to earlier in the debate.  The Minister reacted to a somewhat biased and unobjective report in <i>The Irish Times</i> in relation to ongoing discussions about the future of the courthouse in Carrick-on-Shannon.  I wish to put on record my extreme disappointment at the statement issued in the Minister's name without having had any prior consultation with myself, any of my parliamentary colleagues, or with the council. That placed us in the embarrassing situation in that we, as a council, are now pilloried by heritage protection groups throughout the country as somehow being philistines and cretins wishing to demolish a building that is 200 years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify under section 10 whether he intends to use his powers in this way in future in anticipation of decisions which have yet to be taken.  In referring matters to the Heritage Council, my interpretation of that section is that if a decision is taken by a local authority, with the best available evidence before it, and that is in contravention of the recommendation of the Heritage Council, the Minister can &mdash; if it is not already the case &mdash; designate the building as listed.  It will then require that local authority to receive the approval <Col N="291" /> of the Government as well as of the Minister.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the reasons and the Minister's thinking on this, I am concerned about the powers in this section.  I would like to be reassured by the Minister &mdash; not specifically the individual but by the Minister for all time &mdash; that these powers will be used in a sensible and practical manner, and that they will not result in an extremely large charge on the public purse because of decisions that would be forced on local authorities against the best available advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins) Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already discussed the general point on Committee Stage and I explained the process as to what would happen in relation to section 10 which speaks of consultation with a local authority. Where the Heritage Council and a local authority are in dispute over the future usage of a building, I resisted an amendment that would have automatically referred the matter straight to Government because that would not be the normal practice.  It would come to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to adjudicate between them.</P>
      <P>Where a courthouse is owned or used by the Department of Justice or a public building operated by the Department of the Environment, and if the relevant Minister does not agree with what the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht decides, the matter goes to Government to be adjudicated.  In other words, the final say &mdash; where both the Minister responsible for ownership of the building and the Minister responsible for heritage are not in agreement &mdash; rests with the Cabinet.  I thought that was only fair, so that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht would not be the final arbiter of a decision in a matter disputed by a Cabinet colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second and specific case, I regret if people are putting a construction on what I said that would in any sense make allegations against representatives <Col N="292" /> from Leitrim or elsewhere.  It would have been more appropriate if a better consultation had taken place. However, the information which was available at the time was that the demolition which had been reported was one option being considered.  The only advice which I gave at the time was that any decisions taken between now and the final passage of this legislation should take account of the spirit of what we are trying to do in the heritage legislation; in other words, that this process which is now being enacted under section 10 should be taken as a guide towards how the future is going to be.</P>
    <P>One would like to think that before the Heritage Council is finally signed into law and established its spirit will be observed in the case in question.  That was my only intention.  If any other place sought my advice on matters such as this, I would give the exact same advice.  If the public knows that legislation which requires consultation and has adjudication procedures is being established, it is only wise to comply with it in anticipation.  That was my only intention in the case.  I do not prejudge the options being available.  I am not a member of the local authority.  I am simply saying that in considering the full range of options, any option should take account of what the future is likely to be in relation to matters of heritage.</P>
    <P>Also, because I do not run away from any issues, frankly I believe that the consultation should have been better between officials in my Department and the local authority involved and I regret that.  This legislation enjoys a very strong measure of support from all sides and all parties.  I have found that support in relation to monuments and heritage is cross party and it has facilitated me in bringing forward that legislation rapidly, which I greatly appreciate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I am very grateful to the Minister for having clarified something which, at best, has caused extreme irritation in County Leitrim. I am somewhat disappointed but I do not want to go over old ground.  The Minister has explained why he reacted to a newspaper article without prior consultation by his officials with the local authority involved, which was at an extremely early stage of the process, as the Minister outlined.  However, that was not the interpretation placed on it by the newspaper article.</P>
      <P>What I am really concerned about is that the Heritage Council, with its limited budget, would ultimately be taking on board a very wide power.  I am somewhat concerned that the Minister talks in terms of properties owned by his Cabinet colleagues &mdash; in title rather than in person &mdash; whereas I would have thought that I and my colleagues, as elected members of a local authority, would have a far greater right, at least initially, to make decisions on buildings for which we are responsible.  Of course, ultimately, everything is vested in the people.</P>
      <P>However, it seems somewhat strange in a democratic context that, for example, the consultations in regard to the future of the building under discussion would take place above the heads of the local authority by the various Cabinet Ministers.  If there was a disagreement it would have been conveyed by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice has walked away from the building in question because of a report by the Office of Public Works which is not yet in the public domain.  This is another State body which has left us, as elected representatives, in a very difficult situation. The courthouse was built for courts and not for a civic office.  We tried for three years to get the Department of Justice to co-fund it.  However, it walked away from it six months ago and has left us holding the baby.  We do not want to close down or demolish that building.  I will be the first to stand, as was stated in a rather dramatic fashion by a non <Col N="294" /> elected person in that article, beside the bulldozers, as will my colleagues, if it comes to that.  However, that sort of emotive language gets us nowhere.  I am really concerned about the powers contained in section 10 as they apply to me as an elected representative.</P>
    <P>However, I accept what the Minister is saying.  I fully accept his bona fides.  I know that this matter is dear to his heart in a general sense and the widespread support about which he spoke would find an echo among my colleagues and myself.  I say that with the greatest of enthusiasm.  I regret taking up the time of the House but it is a very difficult and emotional issue, as is the whole question of public buildings.  I hope that this unsavoury development, which came about over the last couple of months, will be dealt with satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the powers inherent in section 10, because ultimately it is a question of finance, as the Minister will appreciate.  The council and his Department will not have the necessary financial resources if it is revealed that the cost of restoration, as in this case, is way beyond what the public purse can bear.  Where will the powers contained in section 10 be relevant if at the end of the day there is no money?</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for having clarified the position and I hope that he would not interpret my remarks in a personal sense.  I am debating section 10 purely on its merits.  I thank you, Sir, for your indulgence on this matter and if the Minister has anything to add, I would be most grateful.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for bringing this Bill to the House. I listened to the debate with great interest, both in the Chamber and in my office.  It is a timely Bill.  No Bill is 100 per cent perfect.  I am sure that in the years ahead it will rescue many historical buildings and items.  I believe that in rural Ireland we have been somewhat careless as a people, particularly since the State was founded, with many valuable historical items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> We all started in the humble national school where in recent items, with the amalgamation of schools and so on, the big, leather bound, roll books have been lost.  I am delighted that the preservation of such books has been included in the Bill.  However, many of them have been destroyed.  Computers are going to take over now.  That is part of history.  I had the honour of seeing the documents left by the late Eamon de Valera, the former President and Taoiseach.  His first thoughts on the Constitution were written in a penny copybook.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify section 10 lest there be any confusion about what is involved.  Senator Mooney might be getting one part of it wrong.  In the first instance, it is a matter for the local authority.  I am simply providing a framework in section 10 so that the confusion which arose will not happen again.</P>
      <P>A building will be designated by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the advice of the Heritage Council.  It will then be for the local authority to consult with the Heritage Council about any work to be done. Cases where the local authority are in dispute with each other or feel that an unreasonable demand is being made of them, or where the Heritage Council says that a matter is of great importance and the local authority is not acceding to it, will come for adjudication to the Minister responsible for heritage, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A building such as a courthouse would be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  I have allowed another <Col N="296" /> mechanism whereby the local authority can say that not only does it disagree with the Heritage Council but that it also disagrees with the adjudication of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht's and it wants the Minister responsible for the area &mdash; the Minister for Justice in the case of a courthouse &mdash; to go to Cabinet on its behalf.  In that case there is a further mechanism of appeal at Cabinet level.</P>
    <P>At all stages it begins with the public authority, which I defined in a change which I made today to specifically include local and regional authorities. Their role is there.  They then seek advice and if they run into a collision in relation to this there is an immediate mechanism for adjudication.  They may accept that, but if they do not it rolls on through the procedure.  It is not therefore a matter of starting at the top and moving down but rather one of encouraging consultation and advice at the most local level and having an appellate structure.  That is how section 10 will be implemented.</P>

This is going to be an extremely difficult Bill in practical terms.  We all aspire to much of what is contained in the Bill and I know that much will be achieved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns Government policy which discriminates against home ownership particularly through the reduction of mortgage tax relief and the extension of the residential property tax net; and calls on the Government to reverse the additional burdens imposed in this year's Budget at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>It is generally recognised that the tax introduced in this year's budget is one of the most inequitable ever.  There was a property tax which was index linked but based on realistic house prices.  As house prices rose a certain element of the tax was taken into account. However, through this measure the Government has brought in many householders who live in small houses and it has hit people who can least afford to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tax represents an attack on homeowners and the family, about which we have heard a lot in recent times.  This is supposed to be Year of the Family.  This tax is an attack on householders who do not have very high incomes and those who live in three bedroom semi-detached houses.  It is an <Col N="300" /> attack on home ownership.  Luxury goods, including expensive paintings, yachts and second houses have not been attacked, instead this tax is an attack on the family.  It represents an unjust and inequitable form of taxation.  The majority of those affected supposedly own their property, but they do not.  It is owned jointly with banks and building societies, which are the majority shareholder; they only have a minority share-holding in the family home.</P>
    <P>This tax has come from this partnership Government.  I know one side, the main partner, would like to believe it is something to do with the Labour Party, but the reality is that this tax was brought in by this Government.  It is a tax which hits the Dublin area and major urban areas, including the Minister's area.  It does not take all the factors into account.</P>
    <P>This tax has come from a party which said at the last election that it would put truth and trust back into politics.  I refer to an advertisement from the last general election.  It began with an important message from Deputy Spring.  It came from a party which said at the last election that many other politicians and parties were telling lies.  The advertisement said Fianna Fáil lies and distortions were dangerous and that it knowingly spread these lies about the Labour Party's policies to scare people away from change.  It also said Labour Party plans aimed for a reduction in income tax and it had no plans to introduce a new property or house tax.  For those hard of hearing I will repeat that, it said the Labour Party had no plans to introduce a property or house tax and it would not reduce mortgage interest relief.  This came from a party which exposed great virtues, a party of high morals and ethics in Government.  If and when the famous Ethics in Public Office Bill is introduced, I hope certain aspects will be made retrospective and the Labour Party's policies, betrayal of the electorate and its pledge to put trust back into politics could be brought up.</P>
    <P>This tax is wrong and it is recognised as such by various Members of both parties. <Col N="301" /> My colleague in Dún Laoghaire, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, recently sold his house. Obviously he did not agree with this famous property tax.  I am sure my friend and colleague from Tipperary, Senator O'Kennedy, where fewer people in the heartland of Roscrea, Thurles and Nenagh need to fill in residential property tax forms, does not recognises it.  He recognises that this tax is unjust and unfair, that it is hitting those who this so-called great Government said it would try to defend &mdash; the family.  When we discuss the break up in families in future months, what will this Government do?</P>
    <P>Although the Minister in the House is not the Minister for Finance, I ask him to ask the Government to abolish this tax.  If the Government does not, we in this party will abolish it at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the electorate have been badly let down in relation to this property tax.  They have been badly let down because people have put their hard earned income into a home for their family.  Houses caught by this tax are not necessarily very big houses and I suppose shortly people in even smaller houses, people in council houses, will be paying property tax.  If they are not paying property tax, the reality is that we will soon see the reintroduction of domestic rates.  That is probably what is behind this.  We have started down that road again.  The Government will claw back money from the taxpayer, a little at a time.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are very clear about our opposition to this measure.  We are not simply saying that some taxes do not have to be raised, we are asking the Government to go about it in an equitable manner.  We are asking the Government to refrain from attacking the basic fabric of society in this country.  All sorts of houses will be involved.  We are starting with three bedroomed houses, but apartments will be brought into the net.  Flats, townhouses, all kinds of homes will be included in this net.  This is not equitable. <Col N="302" /> Some of the semantics brought in do not go any way towards addressing the problem.  Questions were put down in the other House today and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, neatly side-stepped them.  He did not have any information.  He was not able to provide information about the various categories.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister here tonight to withdraw this tax.  It is unfair and unjust. He has broken his promises to the electorate in relation to property tax and mortgage interest relief.  I ask the Minister to pass my views on to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, because this is an issue that he will encounter on the doorsteps in the Dublin area in the next general election.  He encountered it in the European and urban elections, he will certainly hear about it in the next three weeks in Cork North-Central and in Cork South-Central. I ask the Minister to look at the breaches of promise despite all the talk of virtue and high moral ground during the last election and to abandon this tax. Admit to the people that it is wrong. The Minister has already gone part of the way on it.  Let us go the whole way and abolish this tax.  It is hitting the people who can least afford to pay it.  It is unjust, it is burdening people with an extra tax.  On top of this tax water charges now have to be paid.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to pass this message on to his colleague.  He is a reasonable man himself and he knows that this tax is not just.  It hits those who can least afford to pay it.  If there is an overall package in relation to taxation, let the Government take measures to improve the taxpayers' lot, but do not hit the poor householder who has invested his or her savings in a house when many people who are outside the tax net do not pay property tax.  These people may have a couple of yachts, expensive paintings or luxury goods.  Why not go after them?  Why hit the householder with a tax on a property that should be the family home?  Why should we force people who are looking after their elderly <Col N="303" /> relatives or sick parents to leave their homes?</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the contributions from Fianna Fáil Senators from Dublin.  I have no doubt that they will be rushing in here tonight to defend this tax.  I have no doubt that they heard about this tax on the doorsteps last June.  I look forward to hearing their defence of this tax and will enjoy hearing how to explain to the electorate that this tax is equitable.  My colleagues on this side of the House will be following on in relation to this matter but I ask the Minister to give a commitment here tonight to abolish residential property tax at the next opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is welcome to the House this evening.  I second this motion which condemns the reduction in mortgage tax relief and the extension of the residential property tax.</P>
      <P>The reduction of mortgage tax relief and the extension of the residential property tax is a two-pronged attack on family home ownership in Ireland. While much public odium is being placed on the residential property tax, nevertheless the changes in the mortgage interest relief are highly disadvantageous to families who have mortgages on their homes.  Rather than going into a considerable amount of detail and calculations on this matter, I will say that mortgage relief on homes by the year 1997-98 will only be allowed at the standard rate of 27 per cent.  This attack on home owners who have already taken out mortgages and who have existing commitments on their homes means that their tax relief has been reduced from 48 per cent in the year 1993-1994 and will be down to 27 per cent by the year 1997-1998.  The Government is effectively phasing out income tax relief on family homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point it is essential to make the Government fully aware of the views of homeowners across Ireland who are already paying penal rates of income tax, PRSI, VAT and road tax. Thousands of families &mdash; I believe the <Col N="304" /> Minister is aware of this &mdash; are in arrears with their mortgage repayments to building societies and banks, as is evidenced by the number of cases being brought by the financial institutions against home owners for repossession of their homes.  Unless the Taoiseach and the Government are out of touch or living in a dream world they must surely be aware of the fact that thousands of householders across the country are having difficulties meeting their existing mortgage payments and the charges on their homes.</P>
    <P>An efficient system of taxation has several different characteristics.  First, there must be equity.  There is absolutely no equity in the residential property tax, in that a tax should be fair and acceptable to the community at large. By no stretch of the imagination could this tax be considered to be fair.  The principle of providing equal treatment of equal people is broken in this tax. Moderate family homes in parts of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and in many of the large provincial homes across the country will not be taxed in the same way as a similar sized home in other towns.</P>
    <P>A further characteristic of a fair tax system is certainty.  The valuation of a home is necessarily a subjective task and it is difficult for the average home owner to place a precise market value on his family home.</P>
    <P>The average family home owner is obliged and will be anxious to accurately complete his residential property tax forms.  However, there are severe penalties for failure to return the necessary forms.  Even the non-arrival of a form in the post does not allow a person to escape the rigours of the penalties involved.  In the event of a person failing to send in a return, there is a a penalty of £1,000.</P>
    <P>In an article which appeared in <i>Business and Finance</i> on 29 September 1994, Mr. James Downey &mdash; who writes for the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash; mentions his own family case:</P>
    <P>Newspaper advertisements informed us that we must get one from a <Col N="305" /> library, post office or Garda station. In my own family's case, the library directed us to the post office, who directed us to the Garda station, who directed us to Hawkins House.  And that need not be the end of the saga, for the Revenue may dispute a house-holder's valuation.  It makes you think there was something in the methods of the old time barons, who simply drove off as many of your cattle as they would have thought would meet the bill.</P>
    <P>While I would not be in favour of the last remark, the quotation illustrates many of the difficulties people are encountering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>He can watch me on television now.  There are a large number of penalties outlined for failure to comply with this aspect of the tax.  Any person who obstructs or who fails to make a proper return can face penalties of up to £1,000.  A further penalty of £2,000 arises in the event of a person fraudulently or negligently failing to deliver proper returns, or making an incorrect statement.  Who is to say an incorrect statement is negligent, fraudulent or so on?  There are considerable difficulties with these forms which doubtless the Minister has seen, and completion of them is a highly complex matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to define market value; it is too arbitrary, too dictatorial and it places the individual in a situation where he can find himself incurring more severe penalties.  An example is a person who places a value of £100,000 on his family home and a house two doors down the road is sold for £140,000.  The Revenue Commissioners can then demand that the original home owner has to place a value of £140,000 on his property.  He would then have to pay the increased residential property <Col N="306" /> tax, plus a penalty for interest at a rate of 15 per cent per annum.  In fact, the Revenue Commissioners may even decide to go back a number of years for the collection of specific tax debts.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have been aware of this and of the following situation from her experience.  Two people can attend an auction for a house which can drive up its value or, alternatively, if there is no interest in a house it can be sold for a low price.  However, the highest value of the house is the one which sets the trend for the Revenue Commissioners and for those in the Valuation Office who keep an accurate account of property transactions.  This illustrates that there is a real problem in this area.</P>
    <P>In the Seventh Schedule to the Finance Act, 1994, the method of computing residential property tax is outlined. It is a highly complex system of assessment and it places an unreasonable onus of responsibility on the average home owner.  Will the Minister outline to the House the cost of the collection of the residential property tax?  Will she have a cost effective analysis undertaken by a competent body to ascertain the advantage, if any, to the State from the tax?</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the residential property tax under the following headings: the cost of overheads and office rental for staff, the cost of staff wages and those directly involved in the collection of the tax, the funding of the payment of staff and the cost of the Collector General's computer equipment and the time of the staff involved.</P>
    <P>This tax is an attack on those in society who have saved over the years to provide themselves with a home, on those who have purchased their homes and paid huge mortgages on their property for the benefit of themselves and their families.  A person can have a sizeable mortgage on a house, perhaps as high as 80 per cent, and be paying the full residential property tax.  Given this, there is no moral justification for the tax.  Combined with the reduction in mortgage interest relief, residential <Col N="307" /> property tax is an unprecedented and savage attack on the family home.  It is an attack on marriage and the family unit; it is an invasion of privacy into an ever increasing number of homes across the country.</P>
    <P>The Government speaks of introducing freedom of information legislation. However, the residential property tax smells to me of Big Brother tactics. Considering the foregoing, the motion before the House this evening should be adapted by all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my happiness and relief, and that of my colleagues &mdash; although perhaps not my colleagues from County Offaly &mdash; in the fact the Limerick selectors have been returned on the throne where they belong.  I hope that we, as the premier county, will have the opportunity next year of dethroning you.  I am happy to congratulate you, Sir, and to join with all the supporters in noting that Limerick have, again, settled those minor differences which happen in the best of families.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the progress in reform of the tax system which was continued in the 1994 Budget, particularly the major increases in the standard rate tax band and personal allowances</P>
      <P>&mdash;recognises the Government's continuing substantial support for home owners and welcomes the significant increased support for first time buyers announced in the Budget</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" />&mdash;recognises the contribution made by the changes announced in the Budget in relation to mortgage interest relief and the Residential Property Tax in redirecting the balance in the tax code more in favour of productive investment, helping to create and safeguard employment and giving a greater measure of equity in the tax system and</P>
    <P>&mdash;welcomes the adjustments to the Residential Property Tax announced by the Minister for Finance which preserve the essential features of the budget proposals while at the same time catering for the more deserving anomalies in the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to my mention of the best of families, the Government, like all Governments, is a partnership Government and, as in all partnerships, accommodations and compromises must be made.  I acknowledge that one of the accommodations and compromises made in the form of the residential property tax is not something about which this side of the Government partnership, or at least me personally, is entirely enthusiastic.  My views on this have been known from my days in Government and from my previous contributions in the House.  Nevertheless, if there is a price to be paid for partnership, in the interests of good Government I am prepared to make my accommodation also, although I would prefer if it were not in this direction.</P>
    <P>However, I am pleased that the general direction and thrust of taxation policy, and of the overall Government economic and fiscal policy is being maintained on a sound and consistent basis.  In this respect I underline the fact that we have been adhering to the progress in reform of the tax system in the 1994 budget, especially the major increases in the standard rate tax band and in the personal allowances, which cannot be achieved unless adjustments are made in other areas.</P>
    <P>I am especially pleased that the fiscal discipline which was introduced in 1987, <Col N="309" /> not with the full support of all of those who are now partners with us, in reducing public expenditure is being adhered to &mdash; at least I hope that this is the case because it is the bedrock on which a sound economic policy is built.  If such control of public expenditure is not achieved, the room for the private sector to expand, with low interest rates and low inflation, does not exist.  I hope this discipline will be adhered to; it has made this economy, after six or seven years of effective corrective action, an example of what disciplined action can achieve.</P>
    <P>With regard to taxation elements, there is a wide measure of agreement that there is a need to maintain the alteration to the balance of our taxation regime, to rely less on impositions on earned income, which is essential, and to promote those elements in our taxation system which are more beneficial to enterprise and employment.  For that reason we must continue to work towards broadening the tax base.  Limited and well focused incentives have a legitimate role to play but we must avoid poorly and excessively targeted subsidies.  Significant progress has been made over the years and is continuing to be made in this year's budget in streamlining the tax administration.</P>
    <P>We all want further major income tax relief.  However, the prospect of such a move in the medium term will depend critically on the prospective need for tax revenue overall.  One can only do that if one has a properly focused taxation system.  I make one concession to my Fine Gael colleagues in the House regarding the concern that the favourable treatment of property in our tax code does not put investment in this area at an undue advantage over the alternative possibilities for investment, which would support long term employment creation.  I am concerned about property taxes but one must not exemplify that concern to the extent that one would have favourable treatment of property in its own right at the expense of investment in employment creation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> I hope the progress on tax reform as it proceeds will continue to get that balance right.  It must be recognised that tax reform does not provide a panacea for economic problems.  It never did and it never will do so.  It is one of the elements of our economic and fiscal policy. The control of public expenditure and targeted public expenditure is at least as important as adjustments in the tax area.  The budget is an important instrument of policy but if we do not get control of public expenditure correct and target it correctly, the tax adjustments that can be made will be of minimal importance.  By and large, the enterprise sector tells us to create the correct climate, where it will not have to subsidise major public expenditure, and it will do the rest itself.  However, I recognise that while tax reform does not provide a panacea, tax incentives can to a large extent make adjustments, although they will not always live up to some of the wild claims that are made for them.  At best, they can be only a part of a wider response to the employment challenge.</P>
    <P>In that context and to focus on some of the elements of tax allowances in the budget, I particularly welcome the fact that specified interest rates, which were used to determine the benefit in kind charge for preferential loans made by employers to their employees, are being reduced.  The tax relief in respect of mortgage interest and health insurance premiums are to be given at a standard rate in future in all cases and this is important.  It will be phased in over a number of years and mortgage interest relief will be at a full standard rating in 1997-8.  First time house buyers are most important and they will be allowed interest relief at 100 per cent, subject to ceilings for the first five years instead of three years hitherto.  This will be of major benefit to first time buyers and to the house construction business.  In addition, they will not be subject to the <i>de minimis</i> threshold of £100 to £200 for the first five years of their claim.  These are all worthwhile indications of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The package in the budget gives major relief in income taxation to the general body of taxpayers. The fact that those reliefs will cost almost £200 million in 1994 is of considerable importance.  As the recent quarterly returns demonstrate, the Government's targets, as set out in the budget, on income and expenditure are being met.  This will mean the programme for tax reform as an essential part of the Government's economic policy will be maintained in the next budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The priority of any Government is employment.  This Government decided to have a Department of Enterprise and Employment. The Minister explained that the word &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; came before &ldquo;employment&rdquo; as the objective of the task was to create enterprise in order to create employment.  Rather than condemning the Government for extending residential property tax, as the motion suggests, I prefer to use the debate as an opportunity to discuss what we should try to do with our tax system as a whole in order to stimulate economic growth and therefore help employment.  In general our taxes are too high, mainly because they are too narrowly based.  We should be putting our energy into reforming the tax system by widening the base, thereby making it possible to have a widespread lowering of taxes in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be specific in three areas.  First, 85 per cent of all taxpayers should pay no more than one third of their taxable income in tax.  This should include all taxes.  The standard rate, including PRSI, etc, should be no more than 33p in the £ and the threshold for higher rate tax should be fixed so that only the <Col N="312" /> top 15 per cent pay more than that amount.  Second, the full rate of company tax should not be any more than 25 per cent.  The overwhelming number of businesses in Ireland pay the full rate, despite the publicity surrounding the 10 per cent rate.  Third, the rate of VAT should come down to 16 per cent, which is just over the minimum threshold permitted in Europe.</P>
    <P>Taken together, those reductions in tax rates could quickly transform the economy.  They would give people an incentive to work more and give companies more motivation to risk and invest.  They would stimulate the consumption of goods and services across the economic spectrum.  This is where my points connect with the motion. How does one achieve such widespread reductions in tax?  There are two ways. First, one reduces Government spending, but that is an argument for another day.  Second, one broadens the tax base and I wish to focus on this area.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the Commission on Taxation.  It had the right idea when it stated that our tax base was too narrow and that we are constantly narrowing it by creating further new exemptions on a regular basis.  The commission's recipe was to sweep away all those tax breaks and to apply taxes broadly at a much lower rate.  It said that part of that broadening involved the necessity to generate and generalise VAT across the range of buying.  It also stated that we should have a comprehensive property tax, in common with most countries in Europe.  We are taxing too few people and too few things.  By spreading the base wider, we can lower our rates to a level where people will consider them a good deal less penal than at present.  I was impressed by this year's budget, which took a small step in the direction of a generalised property tax.  It covered a small area and caused understandable pain to the people affected by it.  However, it was a step in the right direction.  If we are to criticise it, it should be because the extension of the tax did not go far enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> We should keep our eye on the ball when we discuss tax.  We should be pressing for a wide, swift and comprehensive reform.  This can only be achieved by sweeping away all the tax shelters which have proliferated over the years like a Third World shanty town and bringing into the tax net the large sections of the economy at present outside it.  Broadening the tax base will cause some pain but it can also stimulate the economy and create jobs.  Let us concentrate on the many not on the pain for the few.</P>
    <P>The link between the points I have made should be clear.  Nobody likes tax and it must be difficult for any Government to introduce a new tax.  If we are to broaden the tax base we will have to introduce taxes that hurt people. However, if we can do that at the same time as lowering the tax rates then we will end up carrying out the intentions of the Commission on Taxation &mdash; to encourage enterprise and by doing so to encourage employment.  Broadening the tax base aims at doing just this.  The residential property tax is a step in the right direction but it must be accompanied by the other measures such as those deemed necessary by the Commission on Taxation.  We are going in the right direction but we have to do more.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of each year the Government and the Minister for Finance have to introduce a budget. Many people believe that money is available like manna from heaven, that services can be provided and moneys paid without getting funds from somewhere else.  Although we get money from the EU &mdash; and will continue to get it for a number of years &mdash; for building the infrastructure of the country through training, for example, the day to day running of the country has to be <Col N="314" /> paid for.  Moneys must be provided from tax.</P>
      <P>At present we have income tax bands of 27 per cent and 48 per cent.  It was to maintain a fair system that the mortgage interest relief was reduced.  The reason for this was that the person paying a mortgage who was paying tax at 27 per cent gained 27 per cent on £100, whereas a person on the higher rate gained 48 per cent.  It benefited the better paid person more than the lower paid person.  The residential property tax was introduced in the early 1980s, there was no new tax this year, just an extension of the existing tax.  I find it hard to understand why people who are shouting for tax reform and a widening of the tax base are critical when a move such as this is made.</P>
      <P>The improvements in the tax relief compensated for any extra charges made.  After the introduction of the measures in this year's budget people were better off.  We must bear those points in mind when we consider this amendment.  If we were to dump any provision of the budget relating to tax collection we would have to cut out some of the improvements made. Consequently, I would ask those who move motions such as this to say what they will cut.  A 3 per cent increase was made in welfare payments, is it proposed to reduce that?  A further 3 per cent was given to the short term welfare payments.  These are completely necessary increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we want to reduce the waiting lists in hospitals or do we want to leave them as they are?  A sum of £3 million was allocated to reduce the waiting lists during 1994.  A sum of £7 million was given for improvements in education.  As the Minister knows well from her time as Minister for Education, many schools which were in pretty bad condition have been improved with this money.  Somebody proposed that the money which would have to be handed back under the terms of the motion should be taken from education.  The budget has to balanced and if money has to be obtained for a project it has to come from somewhere <Col N="315" /> and that &ldquo;somewhere&rdquo; is taxation.</P>
    <P>Additional provision of £3.8 billion is being made available for sports and recreational facilities and £1 million for marine improvement works in the Gaeltacht. The reason I mention these is to show what was done in the budget.  One can take any item in isolation from the budget and severely criticise it if it is a tax and praise it if it is a benefit.  This motion only involves criticism.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the social housing scheme £12 million was provided for additional local authority houses.  This is more than welcome and I would like to see more made available.  However, it would have to be paid for and more taxation would be involved.  We have to keep the balance.  Many people will be happily housed as a result of provisions of the budget of which some people are so critical.  A sum of £7 million has been allocated for remedial works in local authority housing and £4 million has been provided for the improvement of the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit and unsanitary conditions.  All of these measures are caring &mdash; caring for the elderly and caring for children and education &mdash; yet they have to be paid for.</P>
    <P>The introduction this year of the new community enterprises gave work to many unemployed people.  Some people have said that such work is not good enough, but, nevertheless, it is work. The dignity of working which people feel is a tremendous boost to their morale and takes them out of the &ldquo;dole syndrome&rdquo;. When a person applies for a full time job they like to be able to say that they worked on a social employment scheme.  It is of great benefit to them.  In providing money for these schemes we are helping them back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>There are vocational training opportunity schemes which provided around 2,500 places in 1994 for the long term unemployed; £10 million was available for general training activities in FÁS and £5 million for tourism.  All of these <Col N="316" /> measures have to be paid for.  Many people have talked of broadening the tax base, yet when the Government moves to do this it is criticised by them. I cannot see the logic in that.  Why do they not just say that they are against widening the tax base and be done with it?</P>
    <P>In the last budget the temporary 1 per cent income levy was abolished, as had been called for.  The 1.25 per cent health levy and the 1 per cent employment levy were also removed for those in receipt of incomes not greater than £9,000 per year or £173 per week.  Such measures have to be paid for.  There was also an increase in the budget of £350 in the personal income tax allowance.  I mentioned this earlier as compensating for the loss incurred in the residential property tax and the reduction of the mortgage interest relief.</P>
    <P>The standard rate tax band was increased to £16,400 for a married couple and £8,200 for a single person.  There was also an increase for people who had an income tax exemption for children of £100 per child to £450 for the first and second children and £650 for the third and subsequent children.  The change that interested me was in the marginal relief rate in tax.  It was dropped 8 per cent from 48 per cent to 40 per cent and that benefited many of our pensioners.</P>
    <P>If one is going to select items from the budget for discussion, the items I have mentioned are worthy of substantial praise.  However, I hear nothing about those items.  All I hear is criticism of the other provisions.  Tax must be balanced between those who can and those who cannot pay.  I remember a time when an employed person was paying tax and his employer, who was very well off, was paying no tax.  I also saw instances where the employee was unable to get a higher education grant but the employer was.  Everybody in the locality knew the financial circumstances of both. However, by virtue of the rules at the time that was the outcome of the situation. Everybody knew how difficult it was to settle this matter because somebody has to bite the bullet.  If we want <Col N="317" /> to widen the tax base we must do so without fear.</P>
    <P>The mortgage income tax relief will be reduced over a period of time. However, there is an extension of the 100 per cent relief for first time buyers for five years instead of the old period of three years.  If we wish to have a financial discussion we must discuss the full budget.  That is why I have discussed many of the provisions in the budget.  I could say more but time does not allow me to do so.  When an isolated provision in the budget is selected for criticism for publicity's sake it is my duty, as a member of one of the Government parties, to outline the good points in the budget. This debate might be better left until after the next budget.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Senator Calnan's dilemma in defending this motion through his amendment.  One of the advantages of a Government amendment to this type of motion is that one can put down an amendment and then not address the subject in hand at all. That is what Senator Calnan and Senator O'Kennedy have successfully done this evening.</P>
      <P>We put down a motion on residential property tax because we thought it might be of interest to the public and, indeed, to the press.  There is nothing wrong in seeking publicity for this motion.  It is a matter of public interest and has become a matter of acute difficulty to certain people in the last few weeks.  Senator Calnan will be aware that 1 October was the date by which the residential property tax had to be paid.  In the weeks prior to 1 October people received in their letterboxes not one document but two pamphlets.  The two pamphlets symbolised the complete dog's dinner which the Government has made of this tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody in this House knows that when the changes in the tax were announced in the budget there was a hue and cry.  In order to take the sting out of some of the hue and cry the Minister adjusted the tax to pacify his backbenchers at the expense of the Labour <Col N="318" /> Party, which had imposed the tax in the first place.  In doing so he introduced what I suspect is one of the most complicated taxes ever to be introduced in this country.  Proof of that is evident in the leaflets which were sent to those who got demands for residential property tax.  The Revenue Commissioners, who were set the extremely difficult task of raising only £12 million through this tax &mdash; we are talking about a very small amount of money but the tax affects a very small and very vocal number of people &mdash; decided that the tax was so complicated that just to send an ordinary demand to people as they usually did in the past was impossible.  Instead of sending a four page leaflet they sent a four page demand and an eight page help leaflet.  Nobody in their right mind, unless he or she is an actuary, could work out the residential property tax alone without help.  It is extremely difficult and complicated.</P>
    <P>The proof of that will be that every person who pays tax on this self-assessment basis this year will pay the wrong amount.  That is certain.  One is asked to pay tax on the value of one's house in April 1994.  How is one to know the value of one's house in April 1994?  One does not know.  One can guess but if one guesses incorrectly one will be penalised when the house is sold.  That is a draconian measure.  One can engage an auctioneer to value it but that will cost £300 or £400 which is another penalty.</P>
    <P>The explanatory document explains the meaning of market value in a way which makes me wonder whether the Revenue Commissioners were serious about the tax or whether they were trying to mock the Government.  The leaflet defines market value as &ldquo;broadly speaking the price the residential property would have been expected to obtain if sold on the open market on 5 April 1994&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Broadly speaking&rdquo; means absolutely nothing.  The poor unfortunate people who are victims of this tax must make a guess which will undoubtedly be wrong, pay a tax which is undoubtedly wrong and live in fear of a future clawback when they sell their <Col N="319" /> houses.  This will apply to many old people.</P>
    <P>On top of that, according to figures which were released recently, residential property has increased by 13 per cent so far this year.  Next year people will be paying at least 13 per cent more tax than they are paying this year.  It might be a great deal more because property might increase again before April next year.  It is undoubtedly true that we will encounter situations where people will have to sell their houses because of this punitive tax.  It is a totally unfair tax on people who have not got an adequate income to pay it.  It is unfair for two reasons.  First, it is a tax on income which people do not have &mdash; I will explain what I mean momentarily. Secondly, it is a tax on assets which they do not own, or it certainly can be.</P>
    <P>In many cases people who are not earning above the thresholds will have to pay this tax.  Those with whom they live will put them above the thresholds. The houseowner will be paying a tax on an income which belongs to somebody else.  The second problem is that it is a tax on assets which people do not own. I have never heard an adequate response to the criticism that this tax does not make allowances for mortgages. What happens if there is a heavy drop in the price of residential property in the next year or two and the tax continues at the same rate or increases at the same pace?  The mortgage on the residential property will remain the same, the people's incomes will probably remain the same, but they may well fall into the negative equity trap.  If they fall into such a trap and the valuation of their houses is over the threshold while their income remains the same they will have a mortgage which is above the value of their houses and they will have to pay residential property tax on that mortgage.  They will be paying tax on a loan.  That is a principle we cannot accept.  The Minister did not provide an adequate answer to that dilemma.  I accept that he came under much pressure at the time.  That is the most gross <Col N="320" /> inequity of this tax: that people will be paying a tax on debt.</P>
    <P>This tax obviously discriminates against people living in Dublin, especially prosperous areas of the city.  It is a tax against the middle classes and those who have managed to work their way up to own reasonably good houses.  It is also a tax with an unpleasant ideological base.  Because of the vocal public disquiet about this tax I hope the Minister will consider repealing it.</P>
    <P>No one in this House would be as worried about this tax if we thought the Government was making a concerted effort to broaden the tax base or was committed to reform taxation.  I do not believe that is true or that it has been thought out.  The Taoiseach, in a brave departure from party policy, spoke about rates at the IMI and we should applaud him for having the courage to mention that word in a political context. However, it seems he, his party and the Labour Party have backed away from that.</P>
    <P>If they are serious about broadening the tax base they should look at rates on domestic dwellings or at a means of transferring income tax on to domestic dwellings throughout the country &mdash; perhaps between £200 million and £300 million could be raised that way.  The tax should not only be levied on those above a certain threshold.  That is the only way to broaden the tax base if the Government is serious &mdash; it will not be done by raising a paltry £12 million in this haphazard way from a few people who cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>The solution is radically to examine rates on domestic dwellings and for the Taoiseach to pursue the courageous initiative he took in June.  He should be supported by his colleagues in the Labour Party who are so keen to broaden the tax base.</P>

      <P>Those who spoke since I came in were; the rest of the Opposition is getting smaller every day.  The main Opposition party was in a Government which introduced the tax.  To listen to the last speaker it would appear they never heard about it until the last budget, although he is a recent member of that organisation.  The public is not soft enough to listen to that nonsense when that party was the major Government party in 1983 when the property tax was introduced and collected the tax when in Government from that year forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in this Government introduced a budget this year which everyone now recognises as a proper framework of financial measures to enhance the economic standing of this country.  It laid the foundations for providing employment for the vast numbers who are still unemployed. This Government has recognised its responsibility and realised changes were needed.  The tax base had to be broadened and re-alignments were required if we were to get off the slippery slope, make tax equitable and reap the benefits on a national basis by providing employment to those without jobs.  This was the foundation of the budget, while keeping within the parameters of the Maastricht Treaty.  I have yet to hear of anyone who welcomes a tax, whether it is a local service charge or another form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a few minor changes to property tax but for a person who owns a house worth £100,000 and is earning over £25,000, the maximum tax payable is £225.  There are also many reliefs which apply.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to bring balance into the debate and show that certain measures are needed.  What was brought in was a minor increase to a tax which existed for ten years.  We must welcome the progress in reforming the tax system contained in the 1994 budget, particularly the increase in the standard rate tax bands and personal allowances. These were welcome initiatives and developments.  We also must recognise the Government's continuing and substantial support for home owners and the significant increased support for first time buyers announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>To broaden the focus, we should look at the massive increase in activity in the construction industry recently, which can be seen in any town in Ireland. There are a number of reasons for this. As well as the budget changes in tax, we should remember the urban renewal programmes, tenant purchase schemes allowing people to renovate their houses and the economic policies which have allowed interest rates to drop to an all time low.  This combination of factors has given this lift to the construction industry.</P>
      <P>It has been said in the past that if the construction industry is doing well, so is the country, because people are investing.  The figures announced by the Minister in the last fortnight prove beyond all doubt that the economic proposals of this Government are not just on target but have led to the second best economic performance in Europe.  Yet the main Opposition party forgets it initiated this tax in 1983.</P>

      <P>Ten years later a Government which is broadening the <Col N="323" /> tax net and trying to provide jobs for the unemployed is castigated by the main Opposition party, as if that party had never heard of the tax until the 1994 budget.  They might try to say that but the public will not accept it; that will be seen as the height of hypocrisy.  It is more important that the Minister and the Government continue on this road and that there be a further broadening of the tax base in 1995, 1996, and 1997 and a reduction in personal taxes.  This would create the opportunities for employment which are so necessary.  We cannot be inward looking as far as the economic performance of the country is concerned and what it will be in the future.  We must look at the 270,000 or so people who are unemployed.  The number of unemployed has fallen because of the policies of 1994 and I hope it will continue to decrease over the next three years.  This is what the public is waiting to see and from which it wants to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a simple point to make and I am glad the Minister for Finance is here to hear it.  It is along the lines of what I have made pleas on previously, that is, making some amelioration in the situation for people who are restoring historically important houses. I know this is the kind of area which can easily become a political football &mdash; I have heard it this evening, one party making accusations against another, really looking for voter appeal.  I do not want to engage in this but to make one clear simple point.  There is no encouragement whatsoever in the form of a tax or grant for people who do the duty of the State by refurbishing, maintaining and retaining the fabric of historic buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with two of the Minister's predecessors in this very important Ministry &mdash; Mr. Ray MacSharry and then the present Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds &mdash; trying to get some small change in the <Col N="324" /> tax structure for people restoring houses.  We limited this by making it applicable only to list one buildings within the designated areas.  There is a very small number because the Department of Finance is rightly conscious of its job of acting as watchdog of the public finances and it cannot permit a haemorrhage from the Exchequer.  I do not believe one single person has ever availed of the small degree of leverage or advantage in these tax provisions.  I have asked on several occasions for figures and I know of people who have asked for forms so that they could apply but they had great difficulty getting them and when they discussed it with their accountants, they found it was not worth their while.</P>
    <P>I know this Minister has a direct personal interest in the fabric of our city and other cities around the country and for that reason I would make a suggestion. Of course, it is necessary to have either this kind of property tax or rates. There will be an Opposition and a Government wrangling and each trying to jockey for voter position; it is all a charade and a farrago of nonsense and nobody with any intelligence takes it seriously.  I am not expecting this tax to be repealed.  We cannot do that.  There must be funds to administer local government.  My suggestion is that there should be an exemption from the residential property tax for people in designated areas who have restored list one buildings which the State itself regards as a significant and important part of our inheritance and our tourism drive. Such people get no grants; unlike most other countries in Europe there are no incentives here.  The very small degree of tax incentives which I managed to persuade previous Ministers for Finance to grant are absolutely useless.  Here is something small which could be done which would not penalise people.</P>
    <P>If I may make a parallel with the history of Ireland.  I think of Charles Gavan Duffy, Fintan Lalor, the Land <Col N="325" /> League and their three &ldquo;Fs&rdquo; and rack renting.  People who buy slum properties and put a great deal of passion, energy, resource, initiative, money and labour into restoring these buildings find they have increased the value of these buildings.  If they band together in an association, an entire area, willy-nilly, despite perhaps the interests of those who have restored buildings long term, will rise in value and become fashionable.  I bought a house 15 or so years ago for between £20,000 and £30,000.  I worked very hard and put huge amounts of money into it.  I and people in my area formed an organisation, we raised the standards of the area and brought other people into it. Are we to be penalised because we have, by our own efforts, unaided by the State, secured an increase in the value and fashionability of the area?  This seems to me to be unfair.  People should not be penalised for doing this kind of work.  Earlier we discussed the Heritage Council Bill and heritage houses, an area which is now recognised as very important and significant.  However, there is nothing, apart from disincentives, for people to restore houses.</P>
    <P>I am not a great dinner party person but in the last couple of weeks I was at a dinner party to welcome a new ambassador to Ireland.  All the guests were reasonably well off and conservative. Virtually all of them were in favour of this tax.  I was the only one who held out some qualification against it.  When I explained what this was &mdash; that is, that people who restored houses were being penalised &mdash; to a person they said that is the only exemption to which they would agree.  I believe there would be very little popular backlash against this and people would understand it.  It would not affect me because I am so impoverished that I have let out most of my house.  One is only taxed on the parts of one's house one occupies.  I have written to the Revenue Commissioners and told them that this tax does not apply to me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> I would like to think &mdash; I believe the Minister would as well &mdash; that people would be encouraged to buy these houses and restore them.  We seem to be incapable of providing grants of any kind.  There are no grants.  The tax changes do not work.  This is a small measure which would recognise the work being done and would perhaps encourage people.  I would like to use this opportunity to recommend this notion to the Minister.  I am aware that this House cannot make amendments to the budget but we can make what I understand are called moltaí, or recommendations, and I will certainly recommend this for the next Finance Bill.  I hope this opening shot might find a sympathetic response from the Minister when he comes to look at the next budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not comparing our Minister for Finance to Caesar; I am saying that taxes were imposed even in his time.  The Minister had to consider the unemployed, the over-taxed and services, such as health, education, public transport, lighting, sewerage systems, good roads and universities.  Money must be provided for all these services but there are screams from one side that taxes must be lowered.  I want to see the taxes of the average worker reduced, if he is lucky enough to have a job, and make it attractive for him to go to the expense, for example, of having a car to go to work, on which he also pays taxes. We cannot have it every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have sympathy for people living in big cities.  I come from rural <Col N="327" /> Ireland where we do not have such services. We do not have universities, therefore we must send our children to the cities where they must live in low grade accommodation at great expense. Some of these people, the cartels which rip off the students every year, are screaming about property tax.  These people have such vested interests, they would not pay a penny for anything.  I know the conditions these students must live in.  The property owners, who drive a Mercedes or a Rolls Royce, treat the tenants like fodder and my family had experience of this.  They own a lot of property in this city and in other cities, such as Cork, Waterford and Galway.  I have no sympathy for them because they should pay taxes.  The Minister is right to introduce a property tax on such people.</P>
    <P>Rural people have no public transport, which is also subsidised by the taxpayer. The cities have public lighting, sewerage schemes, good roads, universities and other amenities.  This increases the value of a person's house because they are near these services. We cannot have all these services in one area and tell the Government and the Minister for Finance to go elsewhere for money, yet ask them to reduce the weekly and monthly tax which is taken from our pay packets on a Friday evening.</P>
    <P>We do not want a situation similar to that in the early 1980s when the then Government introduced a property tax. The Minister for Finance and his colleagues had to rescue this country from bankruptcy because that Government went on a spending spree and we are still paying for it.  The Minister is trying to do the best he can to lighten the tax burden for the unemployed and the employed.  It is not an easy task and I do not envy him his job.  He is doing his best and I am sure he would not like to tax residents because there are many in his constituency.  However, he must balance <Col N="328" /> the books.  We cannot continue to borrow because the young people today will pay for that at a later stage.  Our EU partners are currently looking at our books.  We want funds for the development of roads, sewerage and water schemes, but if we do not keep our house in order they will not consider us favourably.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the responsible people in Fine Gael have tabled such an irresponsible motion.  They introduced a similar scheme.  Yet they are now whinging.  It is a double think because one cannot have one's loaf and eat it.  I would prefer if a man with a young family could pay less direct income tax.  If he is living in a big house in Foxrock, Cork or Limerick which is worth a lot of money, he is obliged to pay something on it.  Even an ordinary tenant in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or Tipperary, who is buying out his house from the local authority, must pay for it.  There is no gold mine behind Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann for the Minister for Finance or any Minister for Finance.  The day of reckoning is always here.  If the Minister is too liberal today, the next generation must pay and many services could be cut back, which happened in the mid 1980s when there were cut backs in the health services and in education.  I am glad we have changed such reckless policies and that the country's books are well balanced.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on what he has done over the years.  It is not an easy task.  He is doing the best he can in the national interest for the unemployed and those who are taxed.  No one wants to pay tax, but, unfortunately, we do not live in cloud cuckoo land.  If the houses in rural Ireland are not caught in this net, it is because we do not have the services which the people in the major cities enjoy.  However, we lose in another way because our children must go to the cities for an education.  The city people <Col N="329" /> have this on their doorsteps and it is also subsidised by the taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We are confronted once again by a calculating, sustained and unrelenting assault on middle class people in our country.  It has gone beyond that to the point where people on less than middle class incomes are targeted.  One wonders how that squares with the idea of enterprise and employment and having tax reform.</P>
      <P>The Government gave us the 1 per cent tax levy in 1993 and its folly was seen when it was abolished.  A 1 per cent tax levy seemed plausible until one converted it to what it was in the standard rate of tax, which was 2 per cent.  The trend we experienced when in Government with Fianna Fáil, where the tax rate declined, suddenly went in the reverse direction.  We had a tax amnesty for cheats so that the money they had salted away could be brought back and they could get away scot-free.  When Mr. Justice Hamilton prepared his report and submitted it he said that senior management in the Goodman Group were aware of what was going on.  A journalist went to court, but the people responsible for such activity seemed to be able to walk scot-free.</P>
      <P>Probate tax operates at the level of £10,000, but its folly was seen and the Minister had the good grace to exempt spouses in the last budget.  It was outrageous that people in that situation had to pay such a tax.  At least the Minister accepted the fact that spouses should be exempt.  He should now accept the fact that residential property tax is a bad tax. The reaction of the public was such that the Minister was compelled to make minor adjustments and he did so. However, the principle is still wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the last budget was presented to us as a tax reforming budget, it was no such thing.  It seems to be the case that if this mantra is trotted out and if it is repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> that something is tax reform, it becomes fact.  It was not a tax <Col N="330" /> reforming budget and it was not, as the Tánaiste represented it to be, a pro-jobs budget.  It had nothing to do with encouraging enterprise and employment in this country.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept some of the points made by Senator Calnan. However, how can he, as a member of the Labour Party, defend that position when the Labour Party went to the country on a platform that it had no plans to introduce a new property or house tax.  It made a solemn commitment to the electorate, but this was abandoned when the party went into Government.  The Tánaiste said the tax would not be introduced, but it was introduced.  What message is the Government giving to the people who work hard, save and put their money into their homes?</P>
    <P>Senator Byrne mentioned students who live in rat infested tenements in Dublin.  Of course that is wrong, but they are not being taxed; the person's home is being taxed.  Is it proper that someone who lives in a good house in a city or town must pay a rate of tax which someone living in the same type of house in the country does not have to pay?  I live in the country and I pay residential property tax because I value my property.  How does one value a farmhouse? I pay the tax because I am a citizen. What does the person who owns a yacht, or the person who has the money salted away or has an offshore account in the Isle of Man pay?  What liability is there on such assets?  In addition, many people save and invest their money and buy a nice house with a substantial mortgage.  What is the equity of a tax which is based on the value of the property and not on the value of the person's assets?  How can one square that?  If someone has borrowings of £55,000 against a house of £100,000, their net worth by definition is £45,000.  Irrespective of whether their mortgage is £20,000 or £50,000, the residents of the £100,000 house pays the tax.  Where is <Col N="331" /> the equity in that?  It was represented to us that this tax would generate £3 million and then what did we do?  We found £5 million for the GAA.  It is a worthy and great national organisation which does tremendous work, but after telling us about all of the things that we have to find money to fund, is it appropriate that £5 million be found for that purpose?</P>
    <P>I support Senator Norris in what he said.  We debated the Heritage Council Bill in this House this afternoon.  There was unanimity across party lines about the value of our built heritage and the need to protect it.  If somebody happens to live in a Georgian house in one of the nicer streets of old Georgian Dublin, I would support Senator Norris in suggesting that that person should receive an exemption if they put their money into keeping those properties.  The effect of not doing that would be to have every building in Merrion Square and every other Georgian street in Dublin owned either by a corporation or the people who want to house students, but not the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>When the Progressive Democrats come back to Government, as I am confident we shall, this tax will be abolished. It is wrong that people should be penalised by virtue of location.  We do not have tax reform.  We have heard about the need to fund public spending, but what has happened?  Public spending in this country has increased by 16 per cent over the past two years.  That is what we have to fund, at a time when inflation is 2.5 per cent.  Is that right?  Is that good economic management? While we have performed well under the Maastricht criteria, it has also been pointed out to us that our debt to GNP ratio, although going in the right direction, is wrong and is still more than it should be.</P>

      <P>We had platitudes about the Culliton report in 1993, but then it was all forgotten about when the budget came.  There was also the income levy and the increase in the standard rate of tax to 29 per cent compared to 27 per cent by virtue of that levy and what happened?  It was the trade unions who saw to it that the 1 per cent income levy was abandoned. In 1994 we raised the PRSI ceiling for employers to £25,000.  The effect of that was to add £450 to the employer's wage bill for a skilled employee.  If an employer in this country wants to employ somebody at the marginal rates of tax, they have to find £2.45 to give the employee £1.  Is that right?  Is that tax reform?  I submit that it is not.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, and your colleagues in this House for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  At the start of any debate I have to remind colleagues in both Houses and elsewhere that, good as we are in this country at the three card trick, doing magic and talking ourselves in and out of problems, nobody has found a way of reducing taxes without borrowing and increasing expenditure.  I totally agree with Senator Dardis about how terrible it is that public expenditure can creep up, but unfortunately practically every time Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas speak, put down a motion, ask a question or write a letter, they are looking for more money.  I never get any mail from any Members of any side of this House suggesting ways to reduce this expenditure.</P>

      <P>I get many suggestions from my eminent colleagues, especially <Col N="333" /> from those in the Opposition, on how I should do away with taxes, but they never give me any alternatives.  They also write another letter in the same post looking for more expenditure. Unfortunately, until we learn the basic lesson, which is not even an economic one, that if we want to reduce our level of taxation and borrowings, which we will have to do, we have to stop looking to increase expenditure and all the things that drive it forward.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to reply to this debate tonight.  It is important first for me to set down a few basic facts about what we are trying to achieve on the taxation front.  Resolving our critical unemployment situation must be our overriding economic and social objective.  This requires our efforts and policies to be firmly focused on maximising the number of sustainable jobs.  Ensuring that taxation policy is pro-employment is therefore essential.  This means that the process of tax reform, now under way for the last seven years, which is aimed at increasing the rewards and incentives for work and reducing the cost of employing workers, must be continued.</P>
      <P>It has been recognised by many national and international bodies who have commented on the area of tax reform that personal income tax in our country impacts most negatively on enterprise, incentive and employment. Despite the considerable progress already made, it remains an aspect of our tax system in need of positive reform.  In particular the burden of income tax can bear heavily on those with modest incomes.  In part this is because the proportion of all tax which must be levied on income is high, but it also reflects the structure of income tax. The point at which individuals begin to pay tax is relatively low and, more importantly, the level of income at which the higher rate of tax comes into play in comparatively modest.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> The Government is faced on a daily basis with urgings to reduce tax in this area or that.  However, few of those who seek tax reductions are willing to be specific as to which of the services from which they benefit they are willing to forego.  The plain fact is that tax reliefs cost money.  This money must come from somewhere, whether from expenditure curbs or alternative modes of taxation. With our level of national debt, borrowings on any substantial scale for any purpose is not a realistic option, either now, in the medium or long term. There is a clear onus on those who call for major tax cuts, be they in the area of income tax, PRSI or corporation tax, to cost such proposals and to specify where they think the money to fund these costs should come from.</P>
    <P>I would ask those who proposed tax reform not to play the tired and predictable game of &ldquo;Yes, but ...&rdquo;.  This involves ardent declarations of support for the broad concept of tax reform. They are the kind of people who come on the radio or the television urging tax reform, believing it is manna from heaven, the panacea to all of our problems and the road to utopia.  If we would only bring in tax reform, all of our problems would be solved.  That is followed by the heartfelt denunciation of the particular changes that ensue from putting an effective tax reform package into place.  The practical reality is that any revenue foregone in the process of tax reform must for the most part be recouped within the overall area of taxation. This means, in essence, increasing other taxes, imposing new forms of taxation or broadening the tax base generally. There is no getting away from the fact that there is no such thing as pain free tax reform.</P>
    <P>It bears repeating and underlining that significant progress has been made in recent years in the area of tax reform. Base broadening measures have been implemented, especially in corporate, capital and indirect taxation.  This has <Col N="335" /> enabled the standard rate of corporation tax to be cut by 10 percentage points, from 50 per cent to 40 per cent, and the standard rate of VAT to be reduced from 25 per cent to 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has also been made towards improving the income tax system, despite the constraints of the serious imbalance in the public finances. The standard rate of income tax has been cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the top rate from 58 per cent to 48 per cent, substantially reducing marginal tax rates for the majority of taxpayers and the number of rates was also reduced from three to two.  In addition, personal allowances have been increased and the standard rate tax band has been broadened.  The general income tax exemption limits, below which no income tax is payable, have been increased and a child addition was introduced into the exemption limits in the 1989 budget and considerably improved on since then.</P>
    <P>This year's budget continued the process of tax reform.  It had two particular focal points: first, it continued to address the most acute problems in the area of personal income tax and, second, to improve the fiscal environment for business, with special reference to the position of small and developing enterprises.  By any standards, the reliefs in this year's budget in mainstream income taxation were substantial. They reduced the overall take from income tax by almost £200 million in 1994 and by over £330 million in a full year compared to what it would be otherwise.</P>
    <P>The budget increased the personal allowances by £175 for a single person and £350 for a married couple, the largest single increase in personal allowances since 1984.  The standard rate band was extended substantially with the result that the thresholds for the higher tax rate in the case of most employees, before any allowance is <Col N="336" /> included for discretionary reliefs, have increased to around £22,200 if married and to over £11,600 if single.</P>
    <P>These measures reduce considerably the burden of taxation on low and middle income earners.  Moreover, they result, notwithholding other changes, in over 40,000 fewer taxpayers being on the top rate of tax.</P>
    <P>Finally, to help maintain and create employment, especially in labour intensive sectors, a differential employers PRSI contribution rate structure was introduced.  A reduced rate of 9 per cent is now levied on incomes up to £173 per week.  The obligation for employers to pay the cost of the health and employment and training levies on behalf of employees with medical cards has also been removed.</P>
    <P>The phasing in of standard rating of mortgage interest reliefs over a four year period demonstrates the Government's commitment to a well thought out and consistent programme.  Our commitment to redirecting the proceeds of standard rating towards broadening the standard rate band is clear evidence of our belief in long term and lasting solutions rather than quick fixes.  It would be easy to muddle on from year to year tinkering with the system and conceding relief after relief to the various interest groups.  It would, of course, do nothing to remove the disproportionate tax burden on employment. It would do nothing for the silent majority who earn average incomes and find themselves paying the higher rate of tax on every extra pound they earn. This Government is not going to let the ordinary taxpayer down.  We have grasped nettles in their interest and we will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>What these reforms are about is the construction of a tax system that seeks to reward work, by easing the burden on the lower paid and taking as many people as possible out of the higher rate. I am sure the House will agree with me when I say that a transparent, equitable <Col N="337" /> and work-centred tax system is worth fighting for.</P>
    <P>In the case of mortgage interest relief, the new provisions will ensure that the relief is of equal value to those on average and higher incomes and particular assistance is given to those who are getting into the housing market for the first time.  If looked at objectively this system is far more sensible than a regime which is of greater benefit to those on the highest incomes.</P>
    <P>It is important for taxpayers with mortgages to appreciate that the reduction in their allowances this year came about mainly because their mortgage outlay has fallen substantially compared with early last year.  This fall in interest rates is, of course, a reflection of general investor confidence in this Government's management of the economy. Taxpayers should look not just at their allowance for interest but also and more importantly at the important reduction in their mortgage payments over the past year and a half.  Overall, they will see that they are significantly better-off, because the net cost of their mortgages has declined, while their other tax allowances have risen significantly and the 1 per cent levy is no longer in the picture.</P>
    <P>While first-time buyers' allowances are affected by the adjustment for lower interest rates, they now enjoy for the first time 100 per cent relief for the first five years of their mortgage and, from 1994-95, will no longer have the <i>de minimis</i> of £100/£200 deducted from their allowable interest.  Even taxpayers who first claimed mortgage interest relief as far back as 1990/1991 benefit this year. This approach is a good example of this Government's attitude towards tax reliefs.  Such reliefs should be carefully targeted so as to achieve clearly defined social objectives; in this particular case, assisting young couples and others who are into mortgages for the first time.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this Government is fully committed to the principle <Col N="338" /> of owner occupation and to giving reasonable assistance to families to acquire their own housing.  The increase of the new house grant to £3,000 and the new mortgage interest relief concessions to first time buyers are tangible evidence of this commitment.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the tax reliefs on house purchase and mortgages are the equivalent of a major programme of Government expenditure. Mortgage interest relief will cost about £140 million in the current 1994-95 year and the stamp duty exemption on new houses costs in the region of £30 million per year.  The Department of the Environment in 1994 will pay out new house grants to the tune of about £20 million. This puts the combined annual cost of these pro-home ownership measures at over £190 million in 1994.</P>
    <P>Even when standard rating of mortgage interest relief is fully implemented, there will still be very substantial assistance through the tax system, that is from the general body of taxpayers, to those people who borrow to buy a house.</P>
    <P>The residential property tax as extended is both a modest measure of equity in the tax system and a contribution towards redirecting the balance in the tax code more in favour of productive investment, which helps in creating and safeguarding employment. The present tax structure has tended to encourage a disproportionate amount of investment in housing.  In particular, it has given rise to a tax-driven trading-up, with an undue bias towards the purchase of dearer houses as investments rather than homes.  These views have been echoed in all major reports in the last 15 years, including those from the Commission on Taxation, NESC, Culliton, the ESRI and the OECD.  The changes to the RPT introduced this year constitute a very modest element in the overall strategy for reducing the levels of income taxation and improving the equity of the tax system and for curtailing <Col N="339" /> the relative tax advantages of investment in dearer residential property as compared with industrial and commercial investments.</P>
    <P>The increased RPT charge will in the vast bulk of cases be far outweighed by income tax reliefs introduced.  For instance, a married couple with two children earning £30,000 gain £630 from the mainstream income tax and levies reliefs.  To put this in context, the RPT charge on an £100,000 house for this family will, following the adjustments introduced, be £90, or less than £2 per week.</P>
    <P>The fact that the increases in the residential property tax are modest should not be interpreted as being an indication that further increases are planned.  I confirm that there is no intention to reduce the thresholds further.  While many economic reports have recommended the introduction of a comprehensive property tax, the changes in the long-standing and limited residential property tax are once-off and should not be interpreted as a first step on that road.</P>
    <P>I do not think it makes any sense, at a time when Government is actively seeking to encourage a flow of resources into job-creating investment in business and commercial ventures, to give signals through the tax system &mdash; both in interest relief and in exempting from the RPT very many valuable residences &mdash; that the best repository for savings or borrowing is to acquire a dearer type of house.  This year's budget moved to redress the imbalance in tax treatment between investment in house property and areas which contribute directly to supporting employment, but in such a way as to maintain reasonable and equitable assistance towards owner-occupation and not imposing any property tax charge on people with average income or with houses not valued over £75,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> The Government is responsive to concerns over anomalies within the RPT scheme as it had existed.  We have adjusted the tax to deal with those anomalies. These adjustments preserve the essential features of the budget proposal, particularly in terms of promoting employment; at the same time they cater for the more deserving cases which have been highlighted.</P>
    <P>The adjustments are intended to eliminate hardship for elderly or incapacitated owner-occupiers of houses coming with the scope of the RPT.  They cater for the situation where a houseowner needs to bring in a carer on account of his or her incapacity or, if widowed, on account of having dependent children. They also ensure that no household will be brought into charge to the RPT simply on account of caring for an elderly or incapacitated person.  They further provide that no RPT charge will arise from alterations made to a property because one of the people living in the house is permanently incapacitated.  A provision was also introduced to give the Revenue Commissioners discretion to deal with possible hardship cases which are not covered by the various specific reliefs.</P>
    <P>A very important point, often overlooked, is that the child relief substantially reduces the actual charge for all families with dependent children.  All residential property tax bills are reduced by 10 per cent for each eligible child in a household.  Thus, where there are four children, the charge will be only three-fifths, or 60 per cent, of the full figure.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the income-related marginal relief serves to greatly reduce the actual residential property tax charge for people whose income is relatively close to the new income threshold of £25,000.  Under the revised scheme marginal relief has been extended to £35,000 income.  There is a one-tenth reduction of the RPT charge for every £1,000 below £35,000.  For example, <Col N="341" /> where the household earnings are £30,000 the RPT charge is reduced by 50 per cent.  This means that all households with an income between £25,000 and £35,000, including those who benefited from marginal relief in 1993, will get income-related relief in 1994.</P>
    <P>The Government looked at the argument that taxpayers should be allowed to set off an outstanding mortgage against the value of residential property. However, the existence of a mortgage is adequately recognised by the fact that RPT does not apply to the first £75,000 of value and interest on mortgages qualifies for income tax relief itself.  At the same time, we were conscious that the residential property tax charge in respect of the larger family home increased quite sharply due to the combined effect of the reduction in the value threshold and the increase in the rate to 2 per cent.  Accordingly, the rate applying on the value between £100,000 and £150,000 was reduced to 1.5 per cent, with the 2 per cent rate applying on the value in excess of £150,000.  This moderated by up to £250 the increase in the residential property tax charge on all properties valued in excess of £100,000.</P>
    <P>Finally, a phased payment system was introduced as an option for those who would prefer not to pay in a single lump sum.  The Government remains satisfied that the residential property tax as extended is a justifiable measure in redirecting the balance in the tax code more in favour of productive investment, which helps in creating and safeguarding employment, and also produces a greater measure of equity in the tax system.  From the employment viewpoint, the relative tax advantages of investment in more expensive housing can only be to the disadvantage of industrial and commercial investment which is essential for employment creation.  I make no bones about this: taxes have to be raised and if we can raise them in a way that does not hinder employment, so much the better. Senators will agree with this.  The forms <Col N="342" /> were due in two weeks ago.  There was a great national debate about my budget figures and instead of the changes bringing in £9 million they would be an extra £3 million to £4 million.  The so-called experts made much play of this and stated that the Government's figures were only one third of what would come in and that in money values it was only a small percentage.  I am sure that you, Sir, will be glad to hear as will many Members of the House, although others will be very upset, to hear that the only mistake I made was that my figures were a bit over-optimistic.  All the other so-called experts were, as usual, totally wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke in the House on 9 February 1994 in support of the motion &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to withdraw changes in the residential property tax as proposed in the recent budget by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;, I stated that the residential property tax was unfair, which I still believe.  It penalises people who live in one part of the country.  It takes no account of the relevant house values in different part of the country and in different cities.  It has been labelled an anti-Dublin tax, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>Since that debate the Minister has made some changes in the property tax. However, I believe they are minuscule. In the budget, the Minister announced that the income threshold for residential property tax was to be cut from £28,100 to £25,000 and that the house value threshold was to be cut from £91,000 to £75,000.  This is the most obnoxious part of the residential property tax.  Unfortunately, the income and value limits remain unchanged.  There are now many citizens living in urban areas paying income tax, residential property tax and ever increasing service charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to note the comments of the Taoiseach at the Irish Management Institute conference in Killarney in April, as reported in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 24 April.  In the course of a long answer to a delegate during a public session the Taoiseach stated &ldquo;I think <Col N="343" /> that what we need in the future is a combination of both, a merger of the two, so that people see what they are paying for and that they are paying for a service that there is in every part of the country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He went on to state that he felt there would be less resistance if the tax went to the local authorities because people would see where it was being spent.  He stated:</P>
    <P>I think from an equity point view and from a fairness point of view that people would be a bit more transparent about things if they got that kind of a tax based and indeed paid in to the local authorities rather than the central Exchequer because any moneys going into the central Exchequer from a local taxpayer's point of view is money lost...and that sort of approach will certainly be looked at.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not make any reference tonight to the enlightening words of the Taoiseach.  I support his view.  I believe that if people realised that the moneys being raised from the residential property tax were being spent on services in their local area, they would not object so strongly to it.  According to an article in <i>Business and Finance</i> on 28 April 1994, it appears that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, unfortunately has the opposite view.  It appears that he is against any measure which would get in the way of his plans for implementing service charges.</P>
    <P>Residential property tax penalises people when the value of their houses rises faster than their incomes.  This point was well made tonight by a number of Senators.  It penalises those who cannot afford the expense of an annual valuation for their property.  Is it fair to ask taxpayers to place valuations on their own homes?  Surely the value of a house can only be determined when someone states what he or she is prepared to pay for it.  The Government ignores this reality and prefers instead <Col N="344" /> to lumber people with a tax based on a notional value of their property.</P>
    <P>The new reduced threshold for the payment of tax on houses valued at £75,000 and household incomes of at least £25,000 means that we are on the slippery slope to a wide ranging revenue source.  When we look at house values today, especially in urban areas such as Dublin, a two or three bedroom terraced house will now fetch over £75,000. If one or two members of the family are working the income is likely to be over £25,000.  A person living in such a house, earning £30,000 a year, with two children at university, paying medical and other expenses &mdash; and, of course, we must remember that now there is no VHI relief and the Minister brought in the regulation which reduces the mortgage interest relief &mdash; will also be paying income tax, residential property tax and probably service charges.  The extra burden of the residential property tax is most unfair and for this reason I believe that it is an anti family tax.</P>
    <P>The Government has two options: to abolish the tax or to allow local authorities to benefit from the moneys raised.  If the Government is not prepared to take the second measure I will be calling on my party to abolish the tax at the earliest possible opportunity, which may be sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I wish to give the Minister a word of advice.  He said he was going to grasp nettles in the interest of the taxpayer. When he is grasping nettles he should make sure that he is not stung.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister has got the gist of the debate from this side of the House.  It is clear that this is a most inequitable and unjust tax.  It is very anti-family, anti-urban and, in particular, anti-Dublin.  Senator Calnan, Senator Kelleher and others will find out shortly when they are near the banks of the Lee how unpopular is this tax.  I urge the Minister to abolish it in the next budget.  If not, as Senator Dardis said and as our party have stated, we will abolish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> The reality is that in relation to many other taxes, thresholds are raised to take account of rising prices and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We did not tax every three bedroom house and council house as the Senator's party is doing.  This is part of the policy of the reintroduction of domestic rates which is being discussed by the Government parties.  I wish to quote again the important message from the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, during the last election campaign towards the end of November.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These points and many others are clearly set out in Labour's programme including that Labour has no plans to introduce a new property or house tax.  You have been misled and <Col N="346" /> betrayed for long enough by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that our party, and I am sure the Progressive Democrats, at the next election will be able to run an extended version of this advertisement: &ldquo;You have been misled and betrayed for long enough by both Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, the party which said it was putting trust back into politics&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is very noticeable what a large turn out we have had tonight from the Fianna Fáil Dublin Senators to support their Minister promoting this tax.  I have no doubt that if it is not abolished, the electorate, in Cork in a couple of weeks time and more particularly in the next general election which cannot be too far away, will deliver their verdict. I urge Members to support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming in for this debate.  I have been asked by women and doctors in my constituency to outline the present situation in regard to epidural facilities in the Midland Health Board area.  Pregnant women do not have the option of having an epidural at the time of their delivery.</P>
      <P>We have, as I am sure the Minister knows, two maternity units in the Midland Health Board area, one in Portlaoise and one in Mullingar.  The Minister for Health, in reply to one of my party colleagues in the other House, said last week that a limited epidural service is available in Portlaoise General Hospital and that he understood that the health board is investigating the possibility of providing a service in Mullingar.  The Minister also stated that epidural services are available in the majority of maternity units in the country.  Full or partial epidural services are available, according to the Minister, in 20 out of 23 units throughout the country.  If the services are as limited as they are in Portlaoise then I suggest that such service is equivalent to no service at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women <Col N="349" /> was that epidurals should be available on the basis of choice by the woman following consultation with her doctor and that all maternity hospitals and units should provide an adequate epidural service.  In the Midland Health Board a number of years ago the maternity services were rationalised, with two units, one in Portlaoise and one in Mullingar, developed to provide a full range of obstetric services.  I put it to the Minister that a full range of obstetric services should include the provision of an epidural service.  This is a safe procedure, it is available to women in other regions in the country and I believe that the women in the Midlands are discriminated against because they are at present deprived of this service.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the service can only be provided if the health board and the Minister are prepared to provide the resources to do this.  I understand that the difficulty at the moment is the shortage of anaesthetists.  Neither the faculty of anaesthetists nor the insurance companies that indemnify them recommend that anaesthetists provide such a service unless there is an anaesthetist solely dedicated to carry out this procedure.  It is not possible to provide a service if these anaesthetists are also providing a 24 hour emergency service for general surgery and more than 66 hours a week of surgery commitment.  There is a requirement that an anaesthetist would be available within three minutes for top ups, for adjusting dosages and in a case of an emergency.  To do this the maternity units would need a consultant anaesthetist as well as junior staff.</P>
    <P>Where an epidural service is available the demand has been shown to be there for it.  Where the service is provided in any unit 20 per cent of women avail of it within a year.  I noted in the Minister's reply last week that he said that a full or partial service is available in 20 of the 23 maternity units, but in many places, <Col N="350" /> such as Limerick and Kilkenny, the service is available for private patients only.  I am sure the Minister will agree that this is totally discriminatory and unacceptable.  There is a limited service in Tralee and in Cork city.  In Clonmel, epidurals are not available after midnight. Wexford seems to be the only hospital outside Dublin that is currently providing a full epidural service.  I was going to suggest to the Minister, if he was here in person, that if by any chance he did become pregnant, he could rest assured that a full service would be available to him in Wexford Hospital.  I appeal to the Minister to urgently consider the extension of this valuable service to hospitals in the Midland Health Board area.  It is a procedure that should be available to all women.</P>

      <P>There are two maternity units in the Midland Health Board area, in Longford/Westmeath General Hospital and in Portlaoise General Hospital.  In 1993 there were just over 1,000 births in each hospital.</P>
      <P>I wish to explain that epidural services are available in the majority of maternity units around the country and that advances have been made in this regard in recent years.  Of 23 hospitals where maternity services are provided, full or partial epidural services are now available in 20 hospitals.  The Minister for Health is conscious of the desirability of extending this service to all expectant mothers who wish to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of an epidural is subject to the availability of sufficient anaesthetic cover.  I understand that in the Midland Health Board area an epidural service is available only on an emergency basis in Portlaoise General Hospital.  I understand that at present an epidural service is not available at Longford/Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar.  The Midland Health Board <Col N="351" /> plans to enhance the service available in the region as resources permit. However, the provision of a full epidural service would be subject to the availability of additional resources, which would be necessary to fund an expansion of anaesthetic services.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has assured me that he will give sympathetic consideration to the Midland Health <Col N="352" /> Board's proposals in this regard in the context of the preparation of the board's 1995 revenue requirements and taking into account the many other competing demands for improvements throughout the health service and the health board's priorities for the development of its services.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 October 1994.</P>
