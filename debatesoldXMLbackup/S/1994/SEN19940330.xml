      <P>I have notice from Senator Honan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make adequate provision to deal with the medical problems of women who received the anti-D and who have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies and virus.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to lower the VAT rate for medical research equipment.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to immediately lower the suggested VAT limit on donated research equipment in view of the likely withdrawal of the Wellcome Trust in supporting medical research in this country.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to address the concerns of the <Col N="1758" /> Irish community in Britain at the proposed changes in the UK Social Welfare code, which if implemented, will adversely affect young Irish people wishing to seek employment in the UK.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Honan's and Ross's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  As Senators Ross's and Henry's matters are on the same topic I understand they will be sharing time.  Senator Mooney may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's business is Item 1. As today is the last day of the session I thank Members on all sides of the House for their co-operation during this session.  We had a very productive session. We completed a number of important Bills including the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, the Road Traffic Bill, the Social Welfare Bill, the Industrial Training (Apprenticeship Levy) Bill, the Terms of Employment (Information) Bill and the Stillbirths Registration Bill.  We also completed Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill.  We debated important matters such as the tourism industry and early retirement for teachers.  I am delighted to see news of a positive response to the latter debate in today's paper.  We also debated the budget, the residential property tax, the report of the National Education Convention, the Developing the West Together report and the extension of the free legal aid service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a constructive and productive session and I wish all Members a relaxing recess.  I look forward to another busy session after the Easter recess.  One of the Bills we will have in the next session is the Irish Horse Racing Industry Bill.  The Leader and I have been looking for the initiation in the Seanad of a substantial piece of legislation and I am <Col N="1759" /> delighted that this important Bill is coming to the Seanad.  We will also have to complete the Committee and remaining Stages of the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill and we will debate the Casual Trading Bill, the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, which deals with the urban elections.  I assure Senators that we will have a busy session after Easter so I would like Members to take things easy during Easter and come back refreshed and relaxed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Acting Leader in thanking the staff of the House for their help.  I thank the Leader of the House for the generally co-operative, helpful and positive approach which he adopted during the last session.  Quite an amount of work was done and it was carried out in a spirit of genuine goodwill and co-operation which I hope will continue.</P>
      <P>I was about to ask the Acting Leader of the House for a list of legislation for the next session but he pre-empted me. I support the attempt to have as much legislation as possible begin its life in this House.  In many ways this House is better suited than the other House to discussing technical and complex legislation in a disinterested and calm atmosphere, as was the case with the Companies Bill and other important legislation.  Anything the Leader can do to have legislation begin its life in this House will have our full support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make one request, however.  I ask that very early in the next session we would deal with two topics for which frequent requests were made during the past session.  The first is a further debate on Northern Ireland, which is more than timely.  The second is a request which was first made by Senator Quinn but which <Col N="1760" /> has the support of all groups.  We should as soon as possible debate the enlargement of the European Community and the implications of the enlargement for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what the Acting Leader has told us about the amount of legislation which came before the House, I echo what Senator Manning says, that it is easier in this House for some reason to debate these issues in a more non partisan manner than it seems to be in the other House.  For that reason the idea of tacking on the Seanad to the Oireachtas broadcasting brief is not a good idea.  The other House deserves television coverage of its own and so does this House.  It is not enough to simply add it on as a filler rather than give it the coverage it deserves.  The sort of debates we have here in relation to Northern Ireland have been a lot more reasoned than some of the debates in the other House.  The Press should also look again at the way this House is covered, not by the reporters present but by the amount of coverage that is actually given by the owners and editors of these newspapers. The House deserves better; it is trying to give of itself more than it has in the past and that should be acknowledged.</P>

      <P>I too thank the Leader of the House for his co-operation during the term up to now.  Every debate in this House seems to be carried out in a much calmer fashion than the other House.  I take issue with what Senator Manning said.  We in this House are never disinterested. The level of debate is far higher; we are probably more detached from it and as such we can debate it in a calmer manner.  We do not seem to be as politically aggressive as the other House. I also thank the staff of the House who have been very helpful to me during the last session.  I wish everybody a very happy Easter holiday.</P>

I agree with Senator Magner's comments in relation to the way in which the proceedings of the House are covered by the media and I thank Senator Honan for her comments.</P>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your assistance and courtesy to me as Whip and as Acting Leader and I also thank the staff for all the help I received from them during the session which is ending. I wish you, the staff and all the Members a very happy Easter.</P>

    <Title>Oireachtas Library Facilities: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Joint Services Committee Report on the Oireachtas Library facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for making time available today to discuss this report.  The report of the Joint Services Committee is an all party report and has the full endorsement and support of that committee.  It has the support of all the parties and the Independent group in the House.  The <Col N="1762" /> background to this report arises from a number of factors.  One of them is the changed nature of the job that all of us do as elected representatives, as Members of a House which has as its primary function the scrutiny of legislation and the scrutiny of the activities of the Executive.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years the nature of the job of a Deputy or Senator has changed enormously and has become much more complex.  We only have to look at the legislation coming here on a weekly basis to see that there is no such thing as a simple piece of legislation. Virtually every piece of legislation is technical and complex, requiring skilled reading, a great deal of background information and a great deal of comparative analysis if it is to be treated properly.</P>
      <P>We as legislators are also faced with an increasingly varied amount of legislation. People who do not know anything about this or the other House can often make glib remarks about politicians and rubber stamping legislation through Houses and so forth.  That is nonsense.  The range of issues upon which a modern parliamentarian is expected to have at least some information, in many cases a deep knowledge, is far more complex than would be faced by a managing director or executive in a company or a professor in a university.  Any serious politician today has to face a range of issues from international relations, European affairs, social welfare, finance, matrimonial law to important moral issues like divorce and abortion.  A modern legislator is expected to be fairly fully informed on all these issues.  We always hope people will take an informed position and a huge number of areas must be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area where our jobs have changed is the speed at which we are expected to work.  We live in an age of instant communications and politicians and Houses of Parliament no less than any other group are expected to make speedy responses.  The days of long months for reflection on an issue are gone.  Whether we like it or not we live in an age where speed of response is an essential part of the job of a Member of Parliament.  Unless Parliament can react <Col N="1763" /> speedily and in an informed way, then it is simply left behind and the issue is taken over by the chat shows and the media.</P>
    <P>Our job has also changed in regard to our need to anticipate.  We cannot just react to what is happening; we need to anticipate issues which are likely to appear in the future.  This is particularly true in areas such as the development of the European Union and environmental issues, where we need to know the effects of today's policies on the future environment. In questions of fiscal policy many people would say that the fiscal policies of successive Governments 20 years ago have led to many problems today because we overborrowed at that time.  Had we been fully aware of the consequences of those policies we might have behaved differently.</P>
    <P>There are many other ways in which our job has changed, and Members will have their own views, but the job of a modern parliamentarian is very different to what it was even 20 or 25 years ago. Unless we are able to fill out the areas I have talked about, to react to the complexity, the varied nature of legislation, unless we are able to give a speedy response and unless we are able to anticipate what major issues may happen, then we are not doing our job efficiently or fully and the people are not getting value for the money they vote to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another way the role of the parliamentarian has changed is in regard to the inequality of competition.  The research facilities available to the Houses of the Oireachtas or any modern political party could not be compared with those of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which are first class.  The banks all have their research departments, major industries have their research and development sections; usually they concentrate on product development but nonetheless research is a very important part of that development.  Members of Houses of the Oireachtas in dealing with issues of a trade union or a banking nature are in a situation of unequal competition simply <Col N="1764" /> because we cannot match the resources of these institutions.</P>
    <P>This is even more markedly the case when dealing with legislation brought in by Ministers.  Each Minister who comes to this House has a huge advantage in that he or she has the resources, the inherited wisdom, the experience and access to a Department of State available to him or her.  Senators, Government and Opposition, as well as backbench Deputies are in unequal competition with the Minister.  Knowledge is power and information and access to information gives the Minister a decided advantage. As a result legislation is frequently not scrutinised as carefully and as thoroughly as we would like it to be.  That is not the fault of Members; it is due to their unequal position.</P>
    <P>The committee believes that the Houses of the Oireachtas can only function to their full potential and in the public interest if they have access to proper information, research and back-up facilities.  In saying that the members of the committee did not decry the help given by voluntary groups.  All Members have back-up groups.  We get help from people who are either members of our parties or people who wish to serve the public good by making their expertise available to political parties.  However, such help should not be the core of any party's or parliamentarian's research.  It should be available to augment information and give a different perspective on an issue.  We should not be dependent on voluntary <i>ad hoc</i> support from outside. We should have a constant core of support available to all Members.  These considerations were the basis of the report.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline the main provisions of the report.  We first stated what was necessary &mdash; an efficient, comprehensive and thoroughly up-to-date research and information service.  We regard that as an essential element in a modern Parliament.  The core function of such a service is to provide Members with impartial information on subjects of importance to them as parliamentarians. We were struck by the absence of such a <Col N="1765" /> service in this House and contrasted that with the situation in other Parliaments. In every respect we are decades behind other Parliaments.  It is almost a miracle that so much work is done so efficiently in the Houses, given the nature of the service.</P>
    <P>This situation is certainly not due to the quality of the personnel in the Library, which is extremely high.  The committee in its work had the full support of the librarian and other personnel in the Library and information technology section.  They have as strong a commitment to having the service we envisage as any member of the committee. However, over the years there has been chronic understaffing and underfinancing of the Library.  There has also been an absence of forward planning and of a strategic view of what the Library should do and how its service should develop. In addition, there is a perception that the Library is a reactive provider of information. It reacts to requests from Members of the Houses rather than having an active information policy which anticipates the needs of Members.</P>
    <P>The committee recognised that the Library had been starved of resources. That fact is accepted and there is no need to labour it.  We looked at the deficiencies in the Library and outlined them in the report.  One of them is the slow pace of computerisation, which has barely begun.  Another is the lack of a computerised cataloguing and indexing system, which makes the search for reference material very difficult.  There are enormous deficiencies in the present Library system.</P>
    <P>The report instances another point which is worthy of detailed consideration &mdash; the condition of the material which is currently stored in the basement.  This material was transferred to Leinster House from the library of the then Chief Secretary in Dublin Castle at the time of the foundation of the State.  There was a small number of additions to the material during the 1920s.  The danger is that we do not know exactly what is in the material or how valuable it is.  We do not know what condition it is in.  There is no <Col N="1766" /> doubt that if the material is left in its present state it will deteriorate to the point where it is of no value.  It would be a shame and a terrible reflection on these Houses if valuable historical material which was given to the Oireachtas in 1922 was allowed to be destroyed through neglect. We want this situation tackled as a matter of urgency.  It will not cost much money.  We must find out what is there, how valuable it is and how it can be restored.</P>
    <P>The committee decided that it is important to have a statement of intent for the Library which will outline its objectives and the criteria by which we will judge it.  We offered five objectives for the Library.  A key objective is that information be provided equally to Members on a cross-party confidential basis.  One of the great strengths of the Library, despite its straitened circumstances, has been its fairness &mdash; all Members are equal.  We want the maintenance of that fairness established as a fundamental principle of the Library. There must be equal access to all Members on a confidential cross-party basis.  Four more objectives which the committee believes should be the characteristics of a library in a modern Parliament are outlined in the report.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the deficiencies in the present system and having looked at the prospective functions of a library in a modern Parliament, the committee made a series of recommendations.  They are far reaching and have financial and staffing considerations.  We recommend changing the name of the Library.  This is, in a sense, symbolic.  The name should reflect the services we hope the Library will provide.  It should be called the Oireachtas Library Research and Information Unit.  Research is a key element in the structure which this report seeks.</P>
    <P>We recommend the establishment of a permanent Oireachtas committee to oversee the implementation of the proposed changes.  It should be done within a fixed period of time.  The committee should remain in existence to monitor the Library on a continual basis.  In an age of great change in information technology, <Col N="1767" /> the changes we propose and which we hope will be implemented will not be the conclusion of the matter.  Technology changes so rapidly that there will be a need for a permanent committee to oversee the implementation of changes and to anticipate further changes.  The Library must be as good as any other library in the State.  It must be able to compare with the libraries of other Parliaments in the European Union.  We envisage that the committee will be a permanent subcommittee of the Joint Services Committee. Its establishment would indicate the importance we accord to the Library.</P>
    <P>The committee seeks the establishment of a separate research and information division within the Library structure.  This division should be staffed on a permanent basis by a small but highly professional team of economists, social researchers, lawyers and so forth. The unit should be driven by an active information policy.  I cannot stress enough the importance of this active information philosophy.  It should not be reactive but anticipatory and it should provide briefings, position papers and such information and analysis as may be appropriate for the needs of Members. This philosophy is the key to the proposals in this report.</P>
    <P>The report also provides a great deal of detail, which should not concern us here, but which was compiled in consultation with the librarian and the head of the information technology section, after our visit to House of Commons Library and our study of other parliamentary libraries.  There is also a detailed account of the type of information we would recommend the Library should have.  We have also made less important recommendations.  There should be a wider range of periodicals and newspapers on open access, computerisation of the Library should take place at the earliest possible opportunity and computer based reading and printing facilities should be provided for the Members' own use via the office computer network &mdash; the type of information <Col N="1768" /> which should be readily available to Members in their offices was indicated &mdash; and there should be a better video guide to the Library.</P>
    <P>There is not much point having an elaborate library if Members do not know how to use the facilities.  Most Members come to this House without any experience of using elaborate libraries.  Sometimes Members are either too shy or a little diffident about asking questions which may make them feel unlearned. We want a proper video guide to the Library so that Members will know what is there in a user-friendly way.  The House of Commons provides a useful video which explains how their Library works. Various Members of the House of Commons give their views on how they get information and what they find useful in the Commons Library on this video. Indeed, our own unit could produce something similar without any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>We also want a closer link-up with the National Library.  It should be accessed for information and reference material to a greater extent.  Discussions are currently under way with the staff in the National Library.  The Director of the National Library, Dr. Pat Donlan, has been extraordinarily positive and would certainly welcome any such link-up.</P>
    <P>The key issue in the report concerns staffing and financial resources.  When we compare our Library with similar parliamentary libraries elsewhere, there is simply no basis for comparison.  The British House of Commons Library services 651 Members and has a permanent staff of 205.  The Library in Leinster House which serves 226 Members has a staff of nine.  Those figures speak for themselves. After looking at other countries of a similar size &mdash; such as Austria, Finland, the Netherlands and Portugal &mdash; the committee recommended a minimum staffing level of 20 in the Oireachtas Library.  This would, of course, include staffing for the research and information unit.  After detailed consultation with our Library staff, we also indicated the type of staffing needs required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> The Library currently has a budget of £50,000.  One only has to look to the weekly list of Library accessions to see that it has virtually no money left to buy new publications after it has paid for newspapers and periodicals.  It is also dependent to a great extent on handouts of official documentation from the EU and so forth.  Clearly, the need both for staffing and for the purchase of information of material is paramount.  The £50,000 spent by the Library compares badly with £1.8 million for the purchase of materials by the Library in the British Houses of Parliament.  We reckon that our Library would need approximately £250,000 per year to enable it to purchase the type of material required to bring it to the minimum acceptable level.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem with accommodation. As well as this Chamber, the Library is one of the most beautiful rooms in Leinster House; it has a character of its own.  For those of us who are privileged to be Members of either House, the Library is a special place. Unfortunately, the design of its premises militates against the provision of an effective library service.  Books and publications occupy many separate rooms in the College of Art and Design, Leinster House and Kildare House.  This poses great difficulties on the Library staff because they are shuttling between these places and this is time consuming.  We do not have the solution to that problem and we do not want to interfere with that beautiful room.  All Members would want to keep it as a reading, browsing and reference library.  However, further accommodation is needed.  If a new committee is set up we recommend that it urgently look at the question of where the Library should be located.</P>
    <P>We strongly recommend that a senior member of the Library staff should be urgently given the task of preparing a report on the state of the material in the basement and what should be done with it.  There may be a case for moving it out of Leinster House.  If this material is never used by Members of either House &mdash; by definition it has not been used over the last 70 years &mdash; and if it is of value to <Col N="1770" /><i>bona fide</i> scholars and historians, there may be a case for transferring it either to the National Library or to some institution capable of indexing it or making it available so that it can be of benefit to scholarship.  These are the areas that have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner, to whom I must give my sincere thanks for his help and encouragement with this report, has a capacity for action which I have seen in few other chairmen of committees in this House.  I believe an action plan is being put in place to achieve some of the objectives of this report.  I thank him for his support and the other Members of the committee in helping to produce this report.</P>
    <P>This is not an academic discussion.  I know Senator Lee would agree with me when I say that when people use the word &ldquo;academic&rdquo; they tend to mean something is useless or of little value.</P>

      <P>Indeed it is.  I would like support for this report.  It is not merely an academic exercise.  The development of our Parliament over the next few decades will be influenced, for better or for worse, by what is done with the findings in this report.  They are not tablets of stone; there may be other views as to what should be done but unless the concept of a provision for a proper research and information unit for these Houses is taken seriously, we will lag behind and we will not be doing our job of scrutinising legislation and our contributions will not be nearly as comprehensively as full or as well informed as they should be.  It is <Col N="1771" /> genuinely in the public interest and of both Houses that the recommendations in this report are acted on as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I concur with all Senator Manning has said about the report.  We have worked closely on this issue.  I learned recently that the papers to which Senator Manning referred were transferred from Dublin Castle to Leinster House by horse and cart.  Without gilding the lily, we have not moved too far in terms of the technology available to us today.  It is now possible to send a message around the world in half a second, but it may take weeks to get documents from existing resources.</P>
      <P>I preface my remarks by acknowledging the outstanding contribution made by the Librarian, Ms. Maura Corcoran, and her staff.  As Senator Manning said, there are dedicated people in the Library.  Dr. Patrick Melvin is an enthusiast for the material we hold in trust on behalf of the people.  As someone who is not an academic, but a graduate of the university which you, a Chathaoirligh, mentioned, it is a joy to examine the material in the basements of Leinster House with Dr. Melvin.  His enthusiasm is infectious and I pay tribute to all the staff who have laboured in that vineyard without any support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member, irrespective of parties, should be interested in this issue.  Politicians on all sides must try to level the playing pitch between them, the temporary Government, who are the Ministers and Ministers of State, and the permanent Government, who are the civil servants who run the system.  Ordinary members of all parties must have rapid access to accurate and independent information.  If a lobbyist arranged a meeting with a number of representatives from the Dáil and Seanad on behalf of a company or group of companies, he would be the best prepared person in terms of research and backup.  We are meant to act in common with other organs of the State such as the Judiciary, to be the &ldquo;watchers on the wall&rdquo;; but one <Col N="1772" /> cannot watch if one does not have the ammunition to repel.  In many cases we are stymied by the lack of research and information services when trying to examine legislation put forward by the Government or proposals put forward by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The House of Commons has an excellent research department and I have seen some of the material which has been produced. It has produced copious amounts of well researched and documented independent material, including a report on nuclear testing and the UK.  One could take part in a debate on this topic armed with such information.  This information is prepared independent of the Executive. It is not the Government's view; it is an independent view compiled by the research department in the House of Commons for use by members of all parties. It has also issued a report on travellers which examines the issue and puts all the data in a readable form.  This enables members to participate in a debate on these and other topics.  We need this type of facility.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred briefly to staffing in the library in the House of Commons, but he should have spoken about the other countries in Europe which have similar numbers to ourselves, although some of these are bicameral Parliaments, while the rest are single ones.  Ireland has 226 Members in the Dáil and Seanad; Austria has 246 members and 25 library research staff; Finland has 200 members and 52 library research staff; Poland, which we often refer to in Third World terms, has 100 members in its Senate and 30 in its research and library department; Portugal has approximately the same number of representatives as we have, but it has 40 library research staff; the Senate in Spain has 37 research staff and the Congress of Deputies has 52; Sweden has 60 research staff.</P>
    <P>We are not at the races in terms of providing a service which Members need and which the public deserve.  The public send people here to promote and defend everything which affects their daily lives. It is not possible to do this in a modern <Col N="1773" /> world without information.  There is a serious lack of facilities for Members to obtain that information.  The transient nature of our jobs means every Government is to blame.  It is a long haul; therefore nobody wants to take the first step. Sometimes we criticise the Civil Service, but nothing would happen without it.  We must provide a modern, efficient and well staffed service in keeping with the resources of the State.  We are not asking for anything grandiose, but for a pro rata system to make information available to our people, as is available to members of all other Parliaments.  From the beginning other Parliaments took the view that one could not have a parliamentary democracy without the information being available to the members who used that democratic vehicle to run their countries.</P>
    <P>The problems we face are understaffing and gross underfunding.  The figure of £50,000 which Senator Manning mentioned is laughable because it buys only the newspapers and periodicals.  We have spent money on computers in Members' offices without putting the structures together to enable us to use this new technology.  We have put the cart before the horse.  The computer network should have been able to access modern efficient information services, but these do not exist.  We have computers, but we have nothing to look at except the menus. We must get our act together and I hope this Administration will act on this report.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned a phase 1 scenario which we will suggest to the relevant authorities.  It says we should begin this process of rejuvenation by giving the Library £100,000.  However, this is not an enormous sum of money when one is talking about a development of this size, but it would begin to redress the neglect of the information services in this House since the 1920s and the imbalance between the Executive and the elected Members.  If we receive the backing of the present Administration, the phase 1 proposition could be agreed and implemented immediately after the Easter recess.  Senator Manning and I intend to discuss this with the leaders <Col N="1774" /> of other parties in order to get support before putting pressure on the Department of Finance.  The Members should decide that these are our Houses and nobody can tell us what to do.  If the Members decided tomorrow by resolution that this is what they would do, it would happen without fuss; nothing would fall apart.  The moneys and the staff would be provided and we would begin the process of levelling the pitch.</P>
    <P>The changes in the Library in the last 70 years have been modest and today the service provided by the Library consists of a general range of parliamentary and Government publications with limited access to other reference works.  Senator Manning is right in saying that it is a reactionary service.  It initiates nothing because it cannot; it neither has the funds nor the resources.  Yet it tries to respond even in this reactionary mode.  How it responds to many of the requests it gets is nothing short of miraculous, given its staffing levels.</P>
    <P>One can ask them at the drop of a hat for information.  It must be remembered that the lead-in time for a query is not days or weeks, sometimes it can be hours. It happens fairly frequently that a Members attends at the Library, tells the Librarian that they are speaking in a few hour's time and want a brief on a complex subject.  Somehow or other the Library staff are able to provide it.  How, I do not know, but it is a tribute to their dedication that they can regularly perform those minor miracles.  However, we should not demand such dedication without giving them the tools to do their normal daily work.</P>
    <P>I fully support the idea that we should put somebody in charge of the historical material in the basement.  I agree with Senator Manning that perhaps the basement here is not the most appropriate place to have some of these historical works.  However, unless we check what is there we do not know, although some of the material is relevant to the Houses. We have spent millions of pounds on heritage <i>qua</i> heritage all over the country &mdash; some of the fanciest buildings one might ever see are heritage buildings &mdash;<Col N="1775" /> yet in the Houses of the Oireachtas we have ignored the heritage handed to us, given into our care in trust for the people.</P>
    <P>Of all the duties given to us, this is the one we have chosen to neglect, as Members of the Houses, whereas outside we are building palaces to cultural heritage. In the basement of this building there are over 8,000 folio volumes of 19th century parliamentary records which contain information beyond price on Irish political and social life.  Without being too fanciful, what is buried there is the soul of the nation in many ways.  We have been given this and have treated it badly, as I will show the House.  I am sure that the House will be as appalled as Senator Manning and I were when we went to look at it.  I invite every Member of this House to go to the Librarian and ask to be shown the 8,000 volumes and their condition and they will be equally appalled.</P>
    <P>In the bowels of these Houses we have a full collection of 19th century local and private statutes, many of which are still referred to today.  Some of those statutes would be relevant to the founding of the Cork Harbour Board and I would ask where they should be kept.  The Cork Harbour Board is housed in one of the most beautiful buildings in Cork, in magnificent cut stone, which has been there for hundreds of years.  Where else should the statutes which led to its foundation be housed than in the building which the statutes brought to life?  There is no great merit in having a treasure trove in the basement of this or of any other building that could form the central attraction of the heritage business in its own locality.</P>
    <P>There are other questions to be asked about the relevance of material and where it should end up.  I would prefer to give material back to the people rather than reserve it.  When I say &ldquo;back to the people&rdquo; I mean with great care and safety and all necessary precautions.  My mind-set is to give back to the people what is rightfully theirs while at the same time protecting an important part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> Also in the basement are the journals of the 18th century Irish Commons and Lords relating to the origins and course of the Irish parliamentary tradition.  It is appropriate that these books rest in the Library of the Oireachtas.  However, we have not looked after them.  That is to our collective shame and the shame of every Government and, after this debate, of every Member, because nobody will be able to take refuge in the citadel of ignorance and say that they never knew about it.  After this debate all Members will be aware of it.  It is not my responsibility, nor is it Senator Manning's responsibility; it is our collective responsibility to begin the process of ensuring that the heritage which we are charged with protecting does not dissolve into dust due to neglect.</P>
    <P>There is a rare and invaluable collection of pamphlets, some of which I have seen, and they are absolutely fascinating. One could spend months there with great joy.  I am no academic, but there is a sense of excitement in looking at some of the material going back to the 17th century and one feels part of it.  I can see Senator Lee is smiling because this is part of his life as a historian.  I have always had a great love for books and I would treat them far better than I have treated many other things &mdash; cars, for example.  The treasure trove in the basement is a great source of joy to people who are of an historical bent and who have the experience of Senator Lee of looking at documents from an historical perspective.  There is a collection in the basement of scarce newspapers which illustrate the development of Irish culture and nationalism.  I looked at some of them yesterday, some of the old Sinn Féin volumes going right back to the foundation of the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I was so outraged at what I saw that I asked this morning to borrow some of the books so that Members can see that it is not simply an abstract report but is about real things.  I have here one of 15 volumes of <i>Grattan's Parliament</i> and look at the state it is in.  This was given to us; it is part of our heritage and look at the state of it.  It does not take a great deal <Col N="1777" /> of money to fix it, but if we do not fix it soon there will be nothing to fix.  This neglect I am showing the House is not malicious, rather it is carelessness due to the pressure of other matters.  The Oireachtas Joint Services Committee itself is under pressure to do other things &mdash; change the restaurant, improve the self-service and put in a shop.  However, if we do any work of a long term benefit to the country, this will be it.  We must do this and there is no excuse for not doing it.</P>
    <P>I do not like to talk about historical documents in terms of monetary value but some people put great store on monetary value and for that reason I refer to another volume I have here.  It was printed in 1701 and is a list of claims entered at Chichester House in Dublin after the Jacobite rebellion.  According to the catalogue, this book is worth £3,500. Look at its condition.</P>

      <P>In any walk of life this would be considered silly; even from a monetary point of view this would be silly.  This is an integral and important part of Ireland's history and look how we have treated it.  There are no excuses. There was no malicious intent, it is due to carelessness.  We have to bring that carelessness to an end, hopefully starting today.</P>
      <P>I could speak for a long time on this issue.  The Oireachtas Joint Services Committee, which I am honoured to chair, is peopled by Members who have shown enormous dedication and interest in matters pertaining to this House, whether it is the attempt to provide modern services or improve facilities. The committee has been most enthusiastic and supportive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning was asked by the committee to look at the provision of library and research services and I knew Members were serious about this intent, as was Senator Manning.  Both he and I are determined that this matter will not disappear when this debate is concluded. We intend that the wrongs outlined here <Col N="1778" /> will be righted.  Members have been genuinely appalled by the examples shown to the House of the deterioration of this historic material under successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I hope to return to this House with Senator Manning in 1995 and show these same volumes, beautifully cleaned and bound.  We hope to show the House the progress made in that area and to announce that Members can access information from their offices.  I commend the report to the House.  We may have to put down a Private Members' motion calling on the Government to address this vital area of our heritage.  I hope that motion would come from this side of the House, as this is an Oireachtas responsibility on which can be reneged no longer.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Seanadóir Manning agus an Seanadóir Magner as ucht na sár oibre atá á déanamh acu ar an gcoiste seo.  It is rare that I feel I would like to repeat what has been said but I would have been proud to have been the first to say virtually everything that has been said this morning.  We have had two significant contributions towards broadening our minds and deepening our understanding about the problems confronting us in terms of the library and information services.  I hope to return to a number of those points in my contribution. My colleagues in UCC are unlike Senator Manning's colleagues in UCD in that they would never dream of thinking of me as a politician in any shape or form.  I hope my contribution will not sound over academic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled when I first came to the Oireachtas to find the Library in the condition it was but that was not because of the library service.  I join in the tributes paid to the Library staff by Senator Manning and Senator Magner.  I wonder at the courtesy and speed with which they can produce responses to requests at short notice.  Their dedication and commitment is beyond question.  It is a sad reflection on the rest of us that we have obliged them to work for so long with <Col N="1779" /> resources so inadequate for the quality of the service they provide.</P>
    <P>However I was appalled at the condition of the library and of research support available to Members.  It reflected badly not only on the efficiency with which Members of the Oireachtas could discharge their responsibilities but also on their self-image.  One hopes the Library will shortly improve as a result of this report.  Nonetheless, if Members were satisfied over the years with a quality of research support available, it spoke volumes about how marginal they felt themselves to be to the policy making process and how little influence they felt they could exert as legislators on the bulk of legislation, whatever about their influence within political parties.  It implied they saw themselves as fig leaves for legislation overwhelmingly devised in various Departments.  The legislation was often well devised but it could not be scrutinised effectively on the basis of the resources available to Members.  This indication of the role of the Oireachtas in the policy making process saddened me.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning's point about the relative decline in the quality of information available to Members over the last 20 to 30 years makes the position even more depressing.  He is right to say virtually all major interest groups have correctly taken steps to resource themselves for research and supply of information.  Oireachtas Members, Government Departments, politicians and civil servants, are now subjected to a barrage of documents.  These purport to be information documents and often are but they are naturally presented to serve the sectoral interests of employers, trade unionists or any other groups making their case.  This is quite proper from their standpoint.</P>
    <P>We do not have the capacity or the resources to evaluate those submissions even if we wanted to do so.  Not every Member of either House will see it as his or her main function to participate in that activity.  However there are Members who, through the fortune of their background <Col N="1780" /> or personal interests, would wish to make that contribution, however modest.  We do not have the resources to evaluate the quality of claim being made by these interest groups or the international organisations on whose reports we increasingly base assessments of our own performance.  I do not believe Departments have such resources either.</P>
    <P>We do not evaluate the data in EU or OECD reports to the level of scrutiny required to see if they mean what they are said to mean in the light of our circumstances. Civil servants cite these documents in their reports as if they are scientific and once they are cited the question is solved and we must follow that path because it is apparently the way it is done in other countries.  We are told this is the consensus among Ministers for a given area, meaning among their civil servants, and we must follow in their footsteps.  If we resist or reject those recommendations, we are said to be sinning against the light because those better resourced and equipped than us are reaching those conclusions.  Those of us who have a neo-colonial mentality may think the people who compile these reports are also more capable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in a number of instances we should imitate them.  I have argued for a comparative approach to our policy making from time to time but that does not mean simply copying what is done elsewhere.  One would first have to decide where one would wish to find one's ideas to copy.  It also requires learning about the ideas, evaluating them and asking if they help us perform better in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>Two examples indicate this point and the type of information that it should be possible for Members to acquire quickly and which research support would provide through a library and information service.  It involves the relationship, which is dear to me, between education and enterprise.  It is a topic of considerable public concern which influences policy making not just in the Department of Education but also in the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Finance. It has been one of the basic assumptions <Col N="1781" /> for the past couple of years in many ministerial speeches, in the observations of university presidents, or those pushing the interests of their institutions, in the observations of civil servants and in submissions, such as the IBEC submission to the Department of Education in response to the Green Paper.  In general, this was a good submission and I do not imply that this assertion was made solely on opportunistic grounds.</P>
    <P>However, it has been an assertion that we lack enterprise and the evidence for this is that the number of start ups of firms in other EU countries was much higher than here.  This was an example of the lack of a self start mentality in our culture which was allegedly fostered by the education system, and we should therefore dramatically reform the education system in order to produce students who would be self starters at the level of our competitors in other EU countries or more widely internationally.</P>
    <P>Just one piece of evidence was cited in favour of this move and this was the report which purported to show that the number of start ups here was approximately half that of Germany, Italy or France.  That found its way into a number of authoritative statements.  I tried to trace the origins of the data and the way in which it was collected.  I tried to assess its accuracy and reliability; how comparative was the data and did it permit the type of conclusion that was being freely drawn?  At an academic level, it does not matter what specialists, consultants, academics, experts and civil servants say but once it begins to find its way into forming public opinion and to be taken as a demonstrated fact on which policy can be based, it has huge implications for public expenditure and it has implications for fundamental decision making.</P>
    <P>I have been unable to precisely trace the way in which those figures were originally formulated.  However, I was able to detect sufficient <i>non sequiturs</i> within the figures and I suspected that there was something very wrong about the way they were being used.  I sought information from various places, such as the <Col N="1782" /> Oireachtas and other bodies, as to how exactly they interpreted and understood the figures.  It soon became clear that we could not put our fingers on their precise origin or track down how they came to be.  They were snatched at by potential and actual policy makers because they were figures and, once one has figures there is a tendency to assume that they are scientific and can be used as evidence.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on small business, which was published recently, states that a belief has taken root that the level of start ups here is well below that in other member states of the European Union, the United States and Japan. However, nobody has rooted the belief or is responsible for it.  Somehow it is parachuted in &mdash; if one may use that phrase nowadays &mdash; and we are the recipients of this largesse from the skies. A belief has taken root.  Everybody believes it but nobody knows its origin. Fortunately this report, which is good, having dug its way through data and making due allowance for its limitation, concludes that it would appear that the start up rate here is at or about the average level in other countries.  That is the best information we have at this stage and it took a task force to dig it out.  It is pure chance that the task force met when it did or we would still be acting on the assumption that we were lacking in enterprise, as allegedly proved by this piece of evidence.</P>
    <P>It should have been possible for any Member of the Oireachtas, who suspected at the outset that there was something potentially misleading about this information, to have the research resources available which would allow him or her to go and ask somebody to dig it out, follow it up, find out exactly where it came from and if it stands up. Then he or she would have been able to announce clearly and emphatically to those who may wish to use this type of information that they could not use the data to support their cause.  If that were the case, it would have been unnecessary for a task force to carry out as much digging to excavate the origins of this particular source of information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> The attitude that we are lacking in enterprise and must put in place a large number of policies in a wide range of areas to cope with that challenge and to change the way we do things is quite pervasive among many well informed people.  I have no objection to changing many of the ways we do things if this is necessary, but we should at least try to get the direction of our policies correct. In a number of cases, getting it right means getting the information correct and being able to dig out what it means from comparative data so that we do not have to swallow uncritically information supplied in some report which is never subjected to the degree of scrutiny to which it ought.</P>
    <P>One may say that civil servants should have scrutinised that information rather than allow their Minister to include a statement of that nature without adequate exploration of the background. However, civil servants frequently operate on the basis of inadequate information. Their job has changed greatly in the past 30 years, partly as a result of the type of activity to which Senator Manning referred.  Thirty years ago there was nothing like the range of pressure groups or documentation that now descends on civil servants.  Civil servants have become more like politicians in the way their time is spent.  Many spend far more time negotiating and mediating between varieties of interests outside.  Even if the education and training of senior civil servants 30 years ago had given them the type of competence which would allow them to analyse the information becoming available, in many cases they simply would not have the time to do so now.  I am saddened by what appears at times to be an excessively adversarial attitude of some civil servants, or a particular mentality within the Civil Service, to parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>As a favour I was given information in response to innocuous questions which held no potential embarrassment for Ministers or partisan political implications. This information should have been common knowledge and as a parliamentarian <Col N="1784" /> I assumed I had a right to it simply by requesting it.  Perhaps it is a generational thing but in some parts of the Civil Service there is an attitude that the less people know the better because if they know too much they can make life awkward for them or the Minister.  I will not mention names but a distinguished former public servant cites in his writings, which are public knowledge, an injunction from a former Secretary of the Department of Finance to the effect that you kept them from becoming a nuisance by not being over-zealous in informing them of details, information to which as mere Ministers they may have considered themselves to have a right.  In this instance it was not a mere parliamentarian but a Minister who was not to be burdened with an excess of knowledge about the subject on which he was to pronounce in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>However, there is more in common between the problems facing many civil servants and parliamentarians in getting at information and in appraising and analysing it as effectively as possible.  In some recent reports &mdash; of which the report of the task force on small businesses is, again, a good example &mdash; I am pleased to note that references to sources regarding particular statements is included.  This may appear academic, but it means that if there is a query about the use of evidence or if there is some doubt about an assertion, the original may be checked if it were available in the Oireachtas Library.  Of course, in many cases it will not be so available, because there would be better sources available to some civil servants than there would be to parliamentarians. At least, however, the source can be located to ascertain if the conclusion based on the source stands up.</P>
    <P>There should be more of a partnership attitude to this issue.  There is a partnership Government so it should be possible to have more partnership between parliamentarians and civil servants regarding sources of information.  I refer to sources of information which are not private and confidential but which are available and are in print.  Some of them <Col N="1785" /> will be international, but they are not in the Oireachtas Library; or, if they are in the Library, we are not aware of there existence and do not know their content because of the lack of research assistants. In this respect it would contribute to good governance if, without departing from the legitimate different roles which are undertaken, it were possible to be more co-operative and co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>The report mentions a sum of £50,000 per year available at present to provide the sources of information available to parliamentarians.  This is derisory if placed in perspective and compared with the money the Government spends on various commissions, task forces and so on, some of which produce good reports and others which do not.  For example, under the Culliton report, the amount paid to the 16 consultants who contributed to the report was £335,000 for work undertaken by them over a six month period.  Anybody who examined these reports will be aware that some of them were very good, but a number of them were not merely bad but awful.  At a conservative estimate, at least one third of that £335,000 did not merely add to public understanding but subtracted from it.  It was dreadful, and it represents two years budgeting for purchases in the Oireachtas Library.  It was a waste of public money, but it places in perspective the derisory funding provided to make basic sources of information available to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I support the call to raise the annual Library budget for purchases to £225,000 and Senator Magner's call for an immediate sum of £100,000 to be made available. However, these are small figures compared with what in a more ambitious state would be regarded as normal for these purposes.  I accept that there are limits on these matters and that a modest beginning must be made, but in the context of the amount of money which the State pays for information, and to consultants on a fairly regular basis for commentary on material, the amount sought by the sub-committee of the Joint Services Committee, even in the context of funding available for research and information, <Col N="1786" /> is modest.  It is not an outrageous demand.  It is an area where the normal negotiating ploy of asking for twice as much as is expected to be given should not be regarded as the position in this instance.  The sub-committee of the Joint Services Committee is requesting the minimum amount consonant with undertaking anything remotely effective in terms of improving the Library and information services.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of the historical material, I was moved &mdash; as, I am sure, were all Members who looked at the samples provided by Senator Magner in his address to the House &mdash; at the obvious neglect and damage done to our historical heritage by inadequacy of resources and by carelessness.  There must be immediate action taken on this material, given its state of decomposition.  In this respect I support the suggestion that consideration be given to the most appropriate locations for this material.  Senator Magner raised a number of valid points, and action of this kind should be taken in co-operation with the National Library.  In this respect I am pleased to note the co-operative response of the Director of the National Library, Pat Donlon, a response I would have expected.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that such a rich treassure trove is both so neglected physically and so unused by people who could base worthwhile work of national interest on it.  I therefore urge the sub-committee of the Joint Services Committee to pursue their proposals on this matter and to ascertain how this resource can be most effectively retrieved for the purposes for which it was originally intended.</P>
    <P>The National Library is grossly underfunded, despite the improvements that have occurred in recent years.  In terms of asking how State resources can contribute most effectively to the functioning of the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the wider public good, it is desirable to consider as confidently as possible the challenges posed by the long neglect of the National Library.  I make this point because the neglect of the Oireachtas Library was the neglect of only one of <Col N="1787" /> the major libraries or potential libraries in the State over a long period of time.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion that by upgrading the research and Library services available to the Oireachtas, there is a wish to deprive Members of the thrill of the political chase.  This will remain an integral part of political activity for as long as mankind survives, or perhaps for as long as original sin continues to have its long term consequences.  It is not suggested that every Member of the Oireachtas should spend their time pursuing quasi-academic research, but it is to the benefit of every Member, whatever their interests may be, that the quality of commentary in the Oireachtas and the quality of evaluation which Members can give to legislation is, and is seen to be, as effective as possible.  In large measure the Members of the Oireachtas have it in their own hands to raise public esteem for the work undertaken in the Oireachtas and if Members do not take this report seriously then they do not deserve to be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>Nothing is ever implemented or continued unless there is a monitoring mechanism. I therefore support the recommendation contained in the report that once the proposals of the report are accepted, as I have no doubt they will, adequate monitoring mechanisms are put in place and the Joint Services Committee and its sub-committee be given whatever resources are necessary to ensure they can discharge that responsibility effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>This report was prepared under the auspices of the Oireachtas Joint Services Committee of which I am a member and Senator Magner is chairperson. I have served on many committees and usually when a proposal is made, it is discussed, modified and qualified. However, when one mentions a matter to Senator Magner something happens immediately, because he is a man of action.  This is an excellent report which should be perused and discussed by Members of both Houses.  Senator Manning headed the subcommittee and <Col N="1788" /> the only flaw in the report is that it does not mention the members of the sub-committee. It is an important report, which contains many good points.</P>
      <P>A lot of what I want to say has already been said.  The report states that an efficient, comprehensive and thoroughly up to date research and information service is an essential element in any modern Parliament.  The core function of such a service is to provide Members with impartial information on subjects of importance to them as parliamentarians. The staff in the Library have been praised because they do their best.  I also praise them because in any dealings I have had with them I found them helpful, and when it is quiet they will discuss matters with Members.  However, the service is not adequate.</P>
      <P>As Senator Manning said, we are expected to know about a vast range of issues.  Most Members have been asked to speak on various subjects, ranging from the horrors of East Timor to the horrors of abortion or from CAP to <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> One may know something about a subject, but if not, one must research it quickly.  The purpose of the Library service is to enable Members to get such information quickly and efficiently.  This service has not been provided for the following reasons: chronic understaffing, chronic underfinancing, the absence of any strategic planning, and the fact that the Library is reactive rather than pro-active. We must tackle these problems if the service is to work.  I was amazed to discover that the Library did not have a computerised cataloguing and indexing system.  I could not operate in my job with such facilities.  I have immediate access to research facilities all over the world by making one telephone call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Magner mentioned the books in the basement which are rotting from want of care.  This is not malicious, but nevertheless it is happening.  I am interested in uniforms.  I visited the National Museum and I was given tour similar to that which Senator Magner was given in the basement of this building, <Col N="1789" /> but the uniforms and other artefacts were not on display.  As Senator Magner said, these are a part of the soul of the nation, but we do not have access to them.  They are being destroyed, not by the staff, but because the facilities in which they are housed are inadequate.  This is also the case with the books in the basement, which should be on display and available to Members.</P>
    <P>I refer to some of the recommendations made.  The name of the Library should not be changed.  It does not matter what it is called if it does its job.  I agree that a permanent Oireachtas committee should be established to oversee the implementation of these changes. If we do not have a permanent committee this will go from one committee to another and nothing good will happen.</P>
    <P>An expert in library systems should advise and assist with the automation process, and cataloguers are also required.  We cannot expect the permanent staff to implement these recommendations. The Library is understaffed and under-resourced; the staff are doing their best in poor circumstances.  A permanent overseeing committee, a research division and experts on automation and cataloguing are required.  The report also stated that access to a computer data base should be coming on line in Members' offices and that a video should be prepared to instruct Members in the use of this system and formal training should be available.  This should also be available to secretaries because they often do most of the work.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that one does not have access to many publications and periodicals which are in the Library.  The figures quoted by Senator Magner from other Parliaments suggest that the Library is understaffed and that a staff of a least 20 is necessary.  I am amazed that the Library receives only £50,000 each year.  In St. John of Gods Hospital where I work, the research department receive £30,000 each year.  That is only a small hospital, but the Houses of the Oireachtas receives only £50,000.  That is an example of how poor the funding is for the Library.  I am glad this report <Col N="1790" /> has been done because it has highlights something important.</P>
    <P>As regards accommodation, the Library is a beautiful room and it should be retained as a reading room.  I am not sure if it should be the permanent seat of the Library containing all the documentation, etc.  With the availability of computers, a lot of the information which we require could be provided elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This is a concise report and we must act on it.  Often matters are debated in the House and recommendations are made, but nothing happens.  The information required for contributions in the House is important.  We read <i>The Irish Times</i> to find out what is happening and reporters listen to us to hear what we are going to do.  When then we read <i>The Irish Times</i> to see what we have done.  It goes around in circles.  This report should be debated in the other House and I hope its recommendations will implemented.  I believe they will be, if Senator Magner has anything to do with it.</P>

      <P>I commend Senator Manning and the subcommittee on this excellent report.  When a Senator or Deputy requires information on a certain subject, the information which is available through the Library service is inadequate. One depends on experts, Departments or others to provide information on the considerable amount of legislation which passes through the House or for work on a committee.  If Members are to be properly informed before going to meetings, we must update the Library service.  That is why I welcome and commend this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Library services in other parliaments were mentioned, including the British parliament.  A staff of approximately 200 provide information to 651 parliamentarians. We have 226 parliamentarians and the number of staff providing information is minimal.  This shows how far behind we are.  By allowing this to continue, we are neglecting the people we represent.  Some £50,000 is spent on papers and periodicals each year.  Donegal County Council spends more than that; this year it will spend <Col N="1791" /> approximately £60,000 on new books and this will increase by £20,000 for each of the next two years.  This means that by 1996 £100,000 will have been spent on new books.  A paltry figure of £50,000 is provided for newspapers and periodicals. This is a disgrace and shows how we lag behind other Parliaments.  It is our own fault for allowing this to happen.  The report deals with the problem and I hope it will be tackled.  Earlier, a speaker said that knowledge is power.  Reading papers is the main activity which takes place in the Library.  One goes there in the morning to look in the papers for information one requires.  Granted many people may read through the death notices to see to whom in their constituencies they have to write.  The Library is not serving its intended purpose. I welcome the idea of a research and information unit, the title of which is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Every Senator and Deputy has a computer in his or her office and a secretary. There is no reason why a data bank should not be available to allow people obtain information they require.  If Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs wish to speak about Lebanon or Somalia, information should be available to them rather than them having to depend on others or to go to these countries to find out what the situation is there.  The fishing industry is a major concern of many people in relation to the enlargement of the EU. Norway has a large fishing industry, which will create problems for us when they join the EU.  We do not have statistics in relation to such issues unless we write to the EU or go to extremes to obtain them.  A data bank should be available to help Members in this situation. Requests for information from constituents and parliamentary questions are typed by Members' secretaries and submitted.  This costs a great deal of money.  If information was available on a data base we would not have to go to this extreme.  All we want is a printout, which we could send back and with which people would be happy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> I welcome the report and commend the people involved in compiling it.  Senator Magner referred to the material in the basement.  It is a disgrace that we should allow this type of material to go to waste. Many libraries throughout the country would be delighted to have it.  The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has about £13.25 million to spend this year in relation to heritage.  It is hoping to receive £27 million from the Structural Funds.  We should strongly look at having some of this money made available to help us deal with the problem of material in the basement.  It is a disgrace that it is allowed to waste away.  I commend the Members of the Oireachtas Joint Services Committee on their excellent report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the committee, I support the report and commend Senator Manning and his subcommittee.  I agree with Senator Lydon that it is perhaps an omission that the subcommittee's members were not included in the report.  I applaud the enthusiasm, commitment and energy of Senator Magner since his appointment as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Services Committee last year.  Without casting reflections on its previous Members, it always gave the impression of being concerned exclusively with Oireachtas bars and restaurants.  Senator Magner's tenure of office, assisted by the committee's Vice Chairman, Senator Manning, has improved the perception of the committee among Oireachtas Members and others because of its activities and the approach it has adopted to pertinent issues, none more so than this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to present an academic discourse on the inadequacies of our facilities.  Suffice it to say that I cannot criticise the facilities because there are none in the context of Senator Manning's report.  We have a glorified Library.  This is not a criticism of its staff.  All sides of the House would testify to the sincerity, enthusiasm and commitment of the staff, who work under the most appalling conditions and in an environment which is inimical to even the limited services we <Col N="1793" /> have.  It is shameful that successive Governments have ignored and neglected the research facilities which should be available to elected public representatives in a modern Parliament.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the delegation which visited the House of Commons before Christmas.  To say that it was an eye-opener would be an understatement.  I found it interesting that this State was parallel in terms of services with the services provided to members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords until the end of the Second World War. From 1945 onwards an attempt was made to develop the services in Westminster and bring them to the level we experienced during our short visit there.  I do not want to reiterate what has been said. Senators Manning and Magner covered in great detail the aspects of the report and have put them on the record of the House.  However, it is not enough to prepare a report, put it on a shelf and allow it to gather dust.  It is for this reason as much as any other that I speak here today.  We must maintain this lobby.  As Members of the committee and this House, we should bring our energy to bear on the Department of Finance to unlock the key which will start to bring our facilities into the 20th and 21st centuries.</P>
    <P>Why should we not have facilities similar to those available to the House of Commons and members of Parliaments in other democracies in the EU?  I may wish to contribute on an issue of current controversy in a part of the world of which I do not have personal knowledge or a great deal of expertise but in which I have a genuine interest &mdash; for example, East Timor, which is on the Order Paper and which I hope will be discussed soon. John Pilger's programme will be on RTE television tomorrow night.  To speak on East Timor I would have to spend considerable time and effort extracting from various media, national and international, information on East Timor.  I would have to contact State and international agencies, such as the United Nations, the European Union and the <Col N="1794" /> Government, to establish what my position would be.</P>
    <P>The amount of time this and the preparation of an adequate and succinct contribution to make in this House would take gives some idea of the burdens placed on us a legislators if we wish to contribute in a meaningful way to the workings and debates of the House.  Contrast our situation with that of Members of the House of Commons.  I give this example because we experienced it on our visit.  They can go into their library &mdash; Senator Manning has asked that our Library be called a research and information unit after any revamping of it &mdash; and can be given within minutes a position paper on East Timor or any other subject of burning public controversy and current topicality, in which all the components to which I referred earlier have been drawn together by qualified staff. This information is presented to Members in a non-partisan, objective and independent manner.  If a Member wished to find out the position of a specific Minister on East Timor and if that Minister was reluctant to go on public record, the Member could request a member of the research and information staff to confidentially contact that Minister's Department to request the Government's position on the issue and the answer can be conveyed to that research assistant in a confidential manner.  I can then quote in this House the Oireachtas Library as being the source of that information and nobody would question its veracity or credibility.  I would like to see that as a first step.  It is not a major problem; all it requires is money and the will to do it.</P>
    <P>The ideas contained in this document will not come to pass unless there is structural reform.  Within the precincts of this House we do not have sufficient space to develop much of what is contained in this report, although the minimum can be.  I heartily endorse the recommendations of the report that other buildings adjoining this House be utilised for that purpose. It cannot be repeated often enough that unless we keep this issue before this House, the Department of Finance and <Col N="1795" /> other relevant Government agencies on a regular basis, it will not happen.  If we do not become an irritant on the body politic, the many excellent elements in this report will not be realised.  I urge the House not just to debate this question and have it as a matter of record, but to return to it again and again.  If necessary, I would suggest to our own committee, which has representatives of all parties, that we act as a lobbying group to maintain pressure on Government.</P>
    <P>Overall, I heartily endorse the report and compliment those who put it together.  I look forward to the beginning of its implementation sooner rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking on this matter.  I would like to compliment the people who compiled this worthwhile report.  I do not wish to repeat what other speakers have dealt with so well in the debate.  The improvement of facilities in our Library is necessary.  There is a wealth of unused books lying idle there.  Many students who are free during the summer could work on cataloging these books, while experts could carry out repairs on damaged volumes.  It is a pity to have such books lying idle while so many people are in need of reading material.  Not only does the Library here need refurbishment, improvement and computerisation, but the Library service nationwide also requires a major review. We should not go off at a tangent concerning the Oireachtas Library and the National Library, but should seek a report and review of all libraries throughout the country.  Every library is suffering from financial constraints at the moment. Funding for primary school libraries in County Cork is inadequate, amounting to only 50p per pupil.  That is totally inadequate for running a service properly. There is no post-primary library facility available in the county.  In addition, funding levels are low and there is a curtailment of staff when any new developments take place because staff <Col N="1796" /> must be provided from the existing workforce.</P>
      <P>I have perhaps moved from the main thrust of the report, but the questions are linked because libraries throughout the country need to be developed, not just the Oireachtas Library.  I know it is another day's work but there is no harm in highlighting the issue because it impinges on what we are discussing.  I welcome the report and compliment its authors.  I hope it will provide a lead for the development of libraries throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I welcome this worthwhile report, which reflects the concerns of the Members of Seanad Éireann.  This debate has attracted wide interest as we can see from the various contributions for which I would like to compliment speakers, including Senators Manning and Magner.  They are two people to whom we can look with confidence to get something done about the issue.  I have been impressed by the Library and its staff since first coming to this House 12 years ago.  They are the most courteous and dedicated staff we could hope to have and we all owe them a debt of gratitude.  They work hard for long hours under difficult conditions to try to facilitate Members.  Our sitting hours are long compared to the private sector.  Very few businesses are open and running at midnight, but our library staff are there, willing and able to help us.</P>
      <P>The evidence of old books that Senator Magner displayed earlier leaves much to be desired.  We would not be worthy of the title Senators if we did not do something about the problem at this stage.  It is not possible to put a figure on the value of the Oireachtas Library.  To take this a stage further, I suggest an immediate visit to the party leaders, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, by the group concerned to see where funding can be availed of.  That should be done as a matter of priority.  They will find an open door on this question.  I am sure many people were not aware of the poor condition of many of these valuable historic documents until it was highlighted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> Various Oireachtas proceedings, as well as daily and weekly newspaper files, are now being documented on microfilm because of the limited amount of storage space in the Library for paper-based information.  Every year the volume of paper is getting bigger and bigger.  We used to sit for only a certain number of days, but over the past few years the number of sitting days has increased by nearly 100 per cent.  Consequently, much more information has to be stored and it is only right to make the most advanced technology available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Mooney, I was a Member of the subcommittee that visited the House of Commons.  One would be amazed by the amount of help and information that is available almost half an hour after it is requested.  There is a most comprehensive service available to Members.  No matter how obscure or new information is, it is available on request to Members.</P>
    <P>As Senator Mooney said, the amount of research which we must do in the Oireachtas in order to have factual information about new positions of Government, legislation coming before us, and so on, is time consuming.  It is difficult to have time for anything else on sitting days except doing research and preparing to make one's speech.  The success of any business depends on its back up services. It is the same with politics: the success of our contribution depends on the back-up service we receive from the Library.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to duplicate what other Members said.  However, as politicians, we should lobby our own parties and discuss this at our parliamentary meetings immediately.  The Library committee should highlight this to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Government because, at the end of the day, it is the Department of Finance which will allocate the funding.  The services in the House have improved and there has been a great deal of dynamic action by the various committees and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The services available to Members have greatly improved compared to when I first became a Member, 12 years ago. <Col N="1798" /> This issue needs to be addressed and I am delighted this report is being discussed today.</P>
    <P>As other Senators said, the lobby groups are professionally organised and have all the data and information at their fingertips.  When Members are addressing the House or are featured in the media they need the facilities to back-up what they are saying, to facilitate debate and to give an even picture of what is happening.  The lobby groups represent the interests of the side they are promoting but we, as politicians, must give a balanced view.</P>
    <P>I fully support this report and look forward with confidence to the success of those who are promoting it.  I wish them well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hundreds of women all over Ireland are now enduring the horrible reality and fear of last month's hepatitis C scare.  These are the unfortunate women who have tested positive to hepatitis C following the major testing programme launched by the Blood Transfusion Service Board on 21 February. They must now wait another three to four weeks to find out if they harbour the virus and could be hepatitis C carriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two months ago these women thought little or nothing of the anti D treatment <Col N="1799" /> which they received following their pregnancy. It was to them a life saving treatment which could prevent blood mismatching in any future pregnancy. Now, however, they are facing a totally different reality.  At best, being hepatitis C antibody positive means a lifetime of testing.  Damage may already have been caused to their liver and they could face an altered lifestyle.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which many of these women are facing is that they do not know what are the chances of them having the hepatitis C virus.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 11 March stated that up to 80 per cent of women who show up antibody positive for hepatitis C as a result of having received anti-D may actually have the virus, according to Dr. Mark Kane of the World Health Organisation. The Blood Transfusion Service Board said that the international statistics may be unreliable when we are dealing with a very specific group of women, as in this case when we are only dealing with women who received anti-D.  However, Dr. Joan Power of the Blood Transfusion Service Board confirmed that the vast majority of those who showed up antibody positive would have the hepatitis C virus and that she had been advising women of this fact.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to confirm if those figures are true.  I realise that there are difficulties because many of the results of the PCR tests have not yet come back to the Blood Transfusion Service Board so they probably do not have accurate figures.  However, what is very frightening is that one-fifth of the women who do test positive for the hepatitis C virus would expect to get cirrhosis of the liver and one-sixth of them could develop cancer.  Those figures are frightening and I can understand the fear of these women.</P>
    <P>Many of these women currently feel very well but that is no consolation to them.  Hepatitis C is asymptomatic and their current health cannot adequately be assessed without the PCR test or liver biopsies.  The Blood Transfusion Board, in the information it sent out to GPs, said <Col N="1800" /> that infection with the hepatitis C virus may lead to over-clinical hepatitis but more usually it is asymptomatic; more than 50 per cent of those infected are at risk of developing chronic hepatitis after a symptom free interval of 12 to 20 years.</P>
    <P>For the many women who in the coming weeks will test positive for the virus, the reality of last month's media hype is now sinking home for themselves and their families.  However, they feel they are being met with total silence about important issues, such as how their medical and future care needs will be met and who will fund the programme.  When the Minister spoke in this House on 23 February he said that all costs would be funded by the Department of Health. The Minister and the Government need to give clear statements on all aspects of this case.</P>
    <P>Details are needed on how many women have tested positive to hepatitis C every year and not just 1977 because it now appears that the problem may be much larger than we were led to believe. Initial Blood Transfusion Service Board letters to GPs concentrated on testing women who received the anti-D in 1977 and stated that women who received the anti-D in other years may be tested. However, there was an advertisement in last Monday's newspapers which seemed to indicate they now felt that the issue was much broader and the board was urging any women who are rhesus negative and were pregnant during the period 1970 to 1994 to come forward.</P>
    <P>Have the initial ELISA and REBA screening tests shown the existence of a far greater problem?  This may have serious health implications for the nation. Will the Minister for Health indicate clearly that free testing and, if necessary, free medical care will be available to partners and children of these women? Women who in the coming weeks will test positive for the virus face a frightening scenario.  Their quality of life and life expectation may be affected by a virus which they acquired in a no fault situation. Many will harbour the virus for years without developing serious illness, <Col N="1801" /> but others will develop cirrhosis and even cancer.</P>
    <P>There is no medical treatment available for the hepatitis C virus that offers real hope to these women.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board said that Alpha Interferon treatment is expected to have a response rate of 66 per cent. However, half this group may relapse and require maintenance therapy.  I accept that hepatitis C was only discovered in 1989 and as a result the general picture is very clouded.  State funding is urgently needed for research into treatment. Dr. Joan Power of the Blood Transfusion Service Board said that treatment rates could be much better as some evidence indicates that early treatment gives better results and that patient response depends on how damaged the liver is.  Obviously, if it was picked up early the results could be much better.</P>
    <P>The area is very clouded.  The blood transfusion board in its letters to doctors said that highly effective treatment for hepatitis C is still lacking and we have a long way to go before we are able to accurately identify those individuals whose hepatitis C infection will cause serious liver damage.  Our present rate of knowledge suggests that for many of these women their hepatitis C infection will not threaten their survival, but the provision of full information and counselling is of vital importance to allay unnecessary fears and help patients form realistic expectations about their infection and its management.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health must state clearly how his Department intends to handle the care of women who test positive for the hepatitis C antibody and virus.  Will biopsies be available to women who test antibody positive to determine the effect of hepatitis C on their livers?  Will Alpha Interferon treatment be available to all women who require it regardless of the cost?  Who will fund this?  Will funding for this major health programme be provided by the Department of Health, the Blood Transfusion Service Board or the individual health boards?  Will the Minister guarantee <Col N="1802" /> that free treatment will be available to the partners and children?</P>
    <P>It is only women who are affected by this current problem.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board has not issued any clear guidelines to these women on any risks associated with becoming pregnant. This is a major deficiency in the advice being offered because the board has stated that intrafamiliar, sexual and vertical spread from mother to baby appears low, but there is some risk and breast feeding may also be associated with vertical transmission.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Honan for giving me this time.  I strongly support what Senator Honan is saying.  She speaks with her third hat on here, not as an accountant or a Senator but as a general practitioner's wife.  I have been extremely alarmed by the confusion that seems to exist in some patients.  She is right to highlight this.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister ensures the Irish College of General Practitioners is as closely involved as possible in what is being done.  They are being approached by more patients than the units set up by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and they must be involved.  Proper procedures have been put in place but the knowledge does not seem to be filtering through to general practitioners who are being asked questions by patients which they cannot answer.  This is extremely serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This unfortunate episode brings to light the fact that only two-thirds of the cards of patients who were given anti-D in the last 20 years were returned to the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  There <Col N="1803" /> certainly has to be a tightening up on that because if all the cards had been returned tracing people would not have presented a problem.  We have had to have a massive publicity campaign because of that, so I hope the Blood Transfusion Service Board will look into that in the future.  I compliment Senator Honan on bringing up this topic.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the Minister for Health who would like to have been here but had to attend a memorial service for a member of his staff who died recently.  I thank Senator Honan for raising this matter on the Adjournment today.  Like her, we do not want to raise unnecessary fears but we want to give necessary information and allay fear.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to inform Senators about the programme being undertaken to provide treatment for the women who have tested positive under the screening programme undertaken by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that almost 44,000 women have been screened for hepatitis C antibodies and the number who have tested positive is 827, up to and including 25 March 1994.  I am aware of the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> to which Senator Honan referred which had a misleading headline suggesting that 80 per cent of those tested were positive.  That is not case.  The majority of those tested are in the clear.  A further confirmatory test will be carried out on the blood samples given by these women and some may yet prove to be negative.  I again urge all women who received anti-D immunoglobulin since 1970 up to 18 February 1994 to come forward for the screening test.  This should be done in the interest of taking as many precautions as possible.  We do not want anybody to fall through the net. We are not trying to scare people but trying to make sure that we catch everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health has made arrangements for treatment of women <Col N="1804" /> who test positive for hepatitis C antibodies to be provided at the following hospitals: St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, the Mater Hospital, Dublin, Beaumount Hospital, Dublin, St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Cork Regional Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway. The following arrangements will be put in place for these women.  Each patient will be seen at a consultant staffed clinic within two weeks of referral.  Clinics will be staffed by experienced staff who will ensure that a high quality service sensitive to the needs of patients is provided. A range of diagnostic tests designed to identify liver damage will be provided. Any further treatment prescribed by the clinician will be provided.  I cannot at this stage specify what that treatment is going to be as that will depend on the clinical judgment of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Any treatment that is necessary will be provided.  The treatment will initially involve out patient visits which may be followed by a short admission for clinical investigation and follow-up treatment if required.  As the Minister has already informed the Seanad, treatment will be provided for these women by the public hospital service free of charge. That is one of the points the Senator made; it will be free of charge.  The Minister is providing the necessary additional resources to the hospitals involved to enable them to provide the highest possible standard of care for this group of women.  A number of detailed important points were raised in the two contributions and I will bring them to the attention of the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I welcome what she has outlined here today because these women want information and having this information available to them is very helpful.  I ask her to specifically bring to the Minister's attention the issue of women who might become pregnant in the future and the need to explain any effects to them.  That is very important.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter because it may be of interest.  The University Senators have been extensively lobbied on this issue, which is:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to lower the VAT rate for medical research equipment.</P>
      <P>Senators may be aware that this became a live issue before the budget and many of us felt reassured by the budget.  We are no longer reassured and need further reassurance from the Minister on the attitude towards medical research in this country.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that there is a great deal of concern in the medical profession about the cavalier attitude to medical research taken by this Government and several Governments in the past.  The consistently <i>lais-sez-faire</i> attitude to medical research here shows no sign of being resolved. This becomes apparent in the attitude of the Wellcome Trust, which has threatened to withdraw from Ireland and take its research with it as a result of the Government's attitude to trust funded research in this country.</P>
      <P>If the Wellcome Trust were to pull out from Ireland it would send the wrong message to anybody who was interested in giving medical research grants to institutions in this country and it would also send the wrong message to other people abroad about Ireland's attitude to medical research.  There is no system here of addressing the issue by granting automatic State matching funds to grants which are given towards medical research, as is the case in many other countries.  I suggest the Government do something about this before it is too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> The immediate problem is the crippling VAT rate of 21 per cent on services, equipment, and supplies used in research.  As the Minister will be aware, if a grant of £100,000 were given for medical research, the recipients of the grant would then have to find between £10,000 and £20,000 themselves in addition to the grant, and as a result of this several of these grants have in the past been turned away.  Ireland has suffered in that those giving these grants have looked elsewhere as a home for their medical research.  Ireland is apparently at the bottom of the league in terms of medical research among developed countries.  We give a lower percentage of our GDP to medical research than any of the &ldquo;poor four&rdquo; in the European Union &mdash; Spain, Portugal, Greece and ourselves. We are the only OECD country to charge VAT on equipment purchased by charities.  The danger is that the Wellcome Trust and other organisations of this sort will switch all of their funding to the UK, where they will get better value.</P>
    <P>If in other countries in the European Union or elsewhere the VAT does not have to be raised, they will simply give the money to an institution there rather than give it here where there is an extra charge of up to 21 per cent.  There is a solution.  The Government should simply rescind or abolish all VAT on research grants.  It did not make provision for this in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Government should take measures immediately to take Ireland off the bottom of the league of the European Union in this area.  There is an intrinsic benefit for the country in having advanced technological sophisticated medical research.  It is probably difficult to quantify in terms of jobs, but if there is an anchor company like Wellcome happy with the treatment it is getting for its grants here, others are absolutely certain to follow.  I wonder what the IDA'S attitude is to the alarm which is spreading on this issue, because the wrong signals are going out to companies abroad about this.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider setting up a science council, funded from <Col N="1807" /> lottery funding, to look at this area and lobby continuously for medical research of this sort as a top priority.  We should certainly bring grants given by the Government up to the level of the Arts Council of £14 million or £15 million for medical research.  I wish to express the serious alarm which the medical profession fees about the Government's attitude, which was not remedied in the last budget.</P>

      <P>The Wellcome Trust gives twice as much money as the Health Research Board to medical research in this country.  The research workers are mainly high flyers, many of whom have come back from abroad to take part in research here.  If they are lost, whole research areas collapse.  I wish to tell Senators about the research that is going on and how much it means to the population in Ireland, because the diseases being looked at are prevalent in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In Trinity College, in the department of gastroenterology, research is being done into coeliac disease and into the immunology of the gastrointestinal tract. In the field of genetics, we are in the forefront in the area of retinitis pigmentosa, and so we should be as we have more families with retinitis pigmentosa in this country per head of population than anywhere in the world.  Again, in genetics we have inflammation being looked into in another department and also the genetics of cardiovascular disease. Ireland, Scotland and Finland are the areas with the highest rate of cardiovascular disease in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research is going on into the fundamental disease process of multiple sclerosis.  Work is being done on memory in the department of pharmacology.  In UCC we are working on cystic fibrosis. This is the most common genetic disease in this country, and who can say that that work is not worthwhile?  In UCC <Col N="1808" /> the genetics of hypothermia are being examined.  In Maynooth work is in progress on the whooping cough vaccine.  In the Royal College of Surgeons research is being done on schizophrenia, again our most common serious mental condition. In the Mater, along with UCD, work is being done on cardiology, which is another serious problem in this country.</P>
    <P>The loss of these researchers will be dreadful.  In UCD research is being done into gastrointestinal disease and the proliferation of yeasts, both serious problems in this country.  All these conditions are serious problems here, so it is not only important to the research workers. This matters to the health of the Irish public and I will be extraordinarily angry if the Minister cannot persuade the Minister for Finance to look at this again.  We will lose excellent research workers.  We will lose advancements in disease that is prevalent in Ireland.  I do not understand how this can be tolerated.  I will give the rest of my time to Senator Norris.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>If a research project succeeds in attracting funding of £100,000 it means they must then go out and find another £10,000 or £20,000 themselves. Far from encouraging research and development, the Government is crippling it.  This is in complete contrast to countries like Denmark.  In Ireland 89 per cent of funding goes to manufacturing and 11 per cent goes to research and development, whereas in Denmark 29 per cent goes on manufacturing industry and 71 per cent goes on research and development.  This is where the jobs are, where the new developments will occur. The statements of M. Jacques Delors make this quite clear when he says that three quarters of products and services which will be traded by the year 2000 have yet to come into existence.  That is where research and development will play its role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In medical terms, all the University Senators have had heartfelt pleas from researchers around the world relating to <Col N="1809" /> the fact that they wish to pursue research but are being inhibited by the lack of grants.  The Wellcome Trust is probably the largest charitable organisation, distributing something like £200 million per year.  One of the projects to which Senator Henry referred, the retinitis pigmentosa project, was made possible because a grant of £1.75 million was made available through the Wellcome Trust.  It would not have happened otherwise.  I have articles here from various magazines. I have letters from Irish scientists, some of whom are working here because the Wellcome Trust was in a position to grant them funding.  Others are abroad and wish to come back with projects.</P>
    <P>It is not just the fact that the Irish Government has the lowest rate of support in the entire European Union, but in addition to that it slaps this 21 per cent VAT on top of it.  This is the final nail in the coffin.  It reflects poorly on the words of the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, who said that the science base is the seed corn from which all new technological improvements grow.  If that is so, it is unacceptable that science in this country should be further shackled by this Government.  I join with my colleagues in calling on the Minister to remove this punitive tax which destroys imaginative and intellectual initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to outline the legal and factual position before discussing the ongoing negotiations with the Wellcome Trust.  It would be useful if I explained the general situation regarding the VAT treatment of medical scientific research equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with goods and services generally, the position is governed by European Union VAT law, which in turn governs Irish VAT law.  Under the European Union VAT rates directive, because medical research equipment is not on the limited list of goods and services to which member states may apply a reduced rate, it must be taxed at the standard rate. Contrary to what Senator Ross said, European countries charge the standard VAT rate.  Britain, for technical reasons, <Col N="1810" /> is the only exception.  The standard VAT rate in Ireland is 21 per cent.  Furthermore, as the relevant equipment was not at a reduced rate here prior to 1 January 1991, it is not open to us to avail of the EU &ldquo;parking rate&rdquo; facility which allows application of a reduced rate of not less than 12 per cent on a temporary basis.  It is also not open to us, or indeed any other member state, to introduce further zero rates.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, VAT is recoverable only by registered businesses.  A firm which undertakes medical scientific research in the course or furtherance of its business would usually fully recover the VAT on its purchases through the normal bi-monthly returns.  Thus, there is no difficulty in relation to VAT in a commercial context.  In contrast, universities and hospitals, as exempt bodies for VAT purposes under both EU and Irish VAT law, are not required to charge VAT on the services which they provide; but, by the same token, they are not able to recover the VAT element in any expenditure borne by them.  The fact that such bodies cannot normally recover VAT on their expenditures is taken into account in determining the level of funding provided to them by the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Union whereby institutions of the EU are entitled to recover any VAT charged to them on foot of purchases for their official use.  It should be noted that the relief is allowable only where the expenditure is borne directly by the European Union institutions; but it would, of course, apply to any equipment directly purchased in the course of a medical research project being carried out for institutions of the European Union.  In addition, under the terms of a special <Col N="1811" /> refund scheme in existence for some years, a refund may be given equivalent to the full amount of VAT borne on certain high cost medical equipment purchased through voluntary donations for use in hospitals, including research equipment used in their laboratories.</P>
      <P>Senators will appreciate that the State had made proper provision in relation to the VAT system to be applied to medical research equipment and had provided a significant special concession to enable the recovery of VAT on high cost medical equipment used in hospitals.  However, in the run up to this year's budget, the Minister for Finance became aware of the concerns being expressed in regard to VAT arising in relation to medical research equipment being financed by the Wellcome Trust in universities.  Where the Wellcome Trust funds research in the UK it is able to derive benefit under provisions in UK VAT law which allow zero rating of certain supplies to and by charities in certain circumstances.  Such zero rating predates the 1992 EU VAT rates directive and it is now not open to us to introduce similar provisions here. However, in recognition of the valuable activities financed by the Wellcome Trust here, the Minister announced in his Budget Statement on 26 January that he intended to extend the existing refund scheme to cover donated research equipment for use in the medical laboratories of universities and similar institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the budget the Minister for Finance wrote to the Wellcome Trust referring to his announcement and inviting its representatives to discuss the terms of the new scheme which will be implemented by refund order under the VAT Act.  Due to the wider budgetary implications which would arise from any precedent which might be set in this area, he advised the trust that he intends to retain the main governing criteria contained in the existing scheme, notably the requirement that the VAT exclusive cost of the equipment should be £20,000 or more and that the expenditure should be recommended by the Minister for Health <Col N="1812" /> or some other appropriate arbiter. Nevertheless, it is the Minister's understanding that his budgetary initiative will enable up to half of the VAT incurred on expenditure financed by the Trust in Ireland to be recovered &mdash; a very significant concession by any reckoning.</P>
    <P>The Trust was also invited to discuss their various other concerns with the Minister for Health as they fell primarily within his area of responsibility.  These discussions are ongoing.  In the circumstances it will be clear that in recognition of their importance to medical research work here, the Government is making every reasonable effort to address the concerns of the Wellcome Trust and I am confident that an overall satisfactory conclusion can be reached.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for approaching the Minister for Finance on my behalf a couple of weeks ago.  We compete on an international basis in this country.  Unfortunately, we compete mainly with Britain.  The fact that VAT on medical equipment is zero-rated there is a serious problem for us. We gain more than our fair share of medical research because we are so good &mdash; a fact about which I regularly boast &mdash; but the VAT rate in Britain is our problem. I realised that other European countries charge the standard VAT rate.</P>
