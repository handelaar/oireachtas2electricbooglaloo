      <P>I have notice from Senator Kelly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for the scheme for social housing in Dromcolliher, County Limerick, which is currently with his Department.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In light of the serious state of affairs which now exists in Clonmannon Retirement Village, Ashford, County Wicklow, due to the disconnection of the electricity supply, the need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to immediately appoint either a designated official, inspector or examiner to investigate the affairs of the Care Company currently operating the village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The enforced closure of the Ennis-Limerick railway line for the past four weeks due to flooding, the enormous inconvenience being caused to the public, and the damage to the development of Ennis railway station resulting from the line closure.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Kelly and Roche as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to express our deepest sympathy on the death of a former Member, Mr. Patrick O'Reilly from Virginia, County Cavan. He was a Member of Seanad Éireann from 1965-69 and of Dáil Éireann on seven occasions since 1951.  We extend the sympathy of the House to his wife, Maureen, and his daughters and sons. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>I join with the Leader in extending sympathy to the O'Reilly family on the death of Paddy O'Reilly who was a representative in both Houses for a number of years.  He represented Cavan extremely well and was highly regarded by the people of Cavan.  He was an extensive dairy farmer. On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I would like to extend our sincere sympathy to all the members of his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993.  I suggest 20 minutes per spokesperson and 15 minutes thereafter.  Item 1 will be taken until 6 p.m.  We will take Item 32 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  It is then intended to add an Item to the Order Paper &mdash; the Minister for Health will come to the House at 8.10 p.m. for statements on the issue of hepatitis C.  He will make a statement and a spokesperson from each party will make a five minute statement.  We will return to Item 1 at approximately 8.40 p.m. until 10 p.m.  The Adjournment will take place after the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of hepatitis is very serious and the time proposed by the Leader is totally inadequate.  This matter affects over 100,000 women and <Col N="620" /> the manner in which it has been dealt with to date has caused a great deal of concern among those who have received Rhesus negative transfusions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty minutes is totally inadequate.  I got this injection on three occasions and I consider the manner in which it has been handled appalling and insensitive.  There is a real need for clarification to allay the fears of many women and this cannot be done in 40 minutes; we require at least a two hour debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to grant time today or tomorrow to discuss Item 33 in my name and that of Senator Henry. It refers to the situation in East Timor, a matter in which many Members on all sides of the House have shown an interest.  The Leader will recall that the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, took a firm line with the Indonesians.  Genocide is continuing in East Timor as part of a criminal conspiracy between the British, the Americans and the Australians.  As long as nothing is done, people will continue to be killed.  Many of us will have witnessed with great sorrow the programme shown on ITV last night which depicted this situation.  It is the worst crime that has been committed since the Second World War and this House should make its voice felt on the issue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the subject raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn, I would also welcome an opportunity to discuss this serious matter concerning the health of Irish women.  However, I would approach it from a different point of view.  I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Health for the clear, forward, direct and honest way the matter was dealt with this morning.  It is precisely the way these issues should be addressed &mdash; immediately, quickly and efficiently.  I am glad to have the opportunity, from these benches, to put that on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="621" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Senator Dardis Senator Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Senator Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's recommendation that we consider the hepatitis C issue this evening and that the Minister for Health is coming to the Chamber.  However, the length of time allocated to individual speakers is totally inadequate given the gravity of this matter and the fact that many Members may want to contribute.  While the Leader's proposal is welcome, he does need to review the methodology for the debate.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Norris's call to consider providing time to debate Item 33.  Anyone who had any doubts about the abuse of human rights and the genocide taking place in East Timor would not have them after watching John Pilger's programme on ITV last night.  While the West intervened in the case of Kuwait, it has stood by in this similar case while people were murdered.  I too would welcome a debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to make time available to debate agriculture within the coming weeks.  This matter is regularly dealt with in this House.  Over the past few days a group of small farmers from the west have been protesting outside the gates of Leinster House in inclement weather.  They obviously feel deeply about the RSI matter.  There is an onus on the Government to make a definitive statement on this matter in the near future.  Pig producers are also experiencing problems and many farmers entitled to money owed to them by the Government have not yet been paid.  For those reasons, I suggest that time be made available to debate agriculture in the near future.</P>
      <P>I hope Item 7 &mdash;<i>the Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; can be discussed in the near future and I ask the Leader to make time available for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on the retail price of food.  Ireland has an opportunity to be recognised as a food producer who can compete successfully in Europe.  It will be a bad day for the agricultural sector and for those in food production if this market is not recognised.  I am prompted <Col N="622" /> to raise this matter because at present there is heated discussion taking place as to whether 40 per cent is enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the matter. I do not intend to make a speech, but I hope later to have the opportunity to contribute on this important issue.  If multiple stores are making a 40 per cent profit on a carton of milk, it is time this House and others accept that this is an unfair and unjust profit.  I am addressing my remarks to the Leader of the House.  It is a bad day when a head of a chain of multiple stores says he is embarrassed by the amount of profit he is forced to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a longer debate on the problems regarding the anti-D factor.  It is important to point out that this problem was discovered by Dr. Joan Power in the course of ordinary qualitative surveys and through vigilance and intelligence.  It is extremely important that the Minister be made aware of our concern that all areas in the health field have the necessary resources to ensure vigilance regarding the treatment patients are getting and that we have intelligent and good workers in all fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the increasing pressure on parents to raise their children in an ever changing environment and the recent advertisements on billboards, I ask the Leader to seriously consider providing time for a debate on parental responsibility and accountability and other elements of child rearing.  The recent advertising campaign is an assault <Col N="623" /> on what is left in this society to raise children properly.  This is an important issue and one that is causing much upset for parents and families and it should be immediately, brought to the public's attention.</P>
      <P>The motion on the Order Paper, sponsored by Senators Henry and Norris, which deals with East Timor is very important.  However, we also asked for a debate on former Yugoslavia but to date we have not had one.  It is an important issue which should be debated immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment to come here at an early date to discuss the discretionary block grants he announced last Friday.  Members will be aware that it was announced in the budget that a sum of £15 million would be set aside by the Minister for Finance from the proceeds of the tax amnesty to improve the condition of the roads.  It seems the Minister has diverted that money to some other purpose because Monaghan County Council received&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my concern about the length of time which has been devoted to discussion on the hepatitis-C virus scare.  Many people are alarmed and this House should take the opportunity to allay those fears, outline the position and allow everybody to express their views on the matter.  I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>That there be a full two hour debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>This would allow as many as possible to express their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the call for extended time for the discussion on hepatitis-C. I am pleased the Minister is coming to address this House but I hope it will be possible for him to answer questions. There is still a lot of confusion in regard to this issue.  Many women are concerned to know whether maternity hospitals have records going back as far as 1977.  GPs have been informed by Pelican House that they are to test women who were so treated from 1977 to 1991. I want the Leader to ask the Minister to clarify those matters this evening.  I understand from what the Minister said in the other House yesterday that the product being administered to women was changed last Friday, so there seems to have been a scare up to last Friday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that it has been possible to make time available to discuss the hepatitis C issue this evening.  I understand that as it is an urgent debate it may not be possible to have extended time this evening.  Perhaps we could have more time at a later date to discuss the various issues, including that raised by Senator Henry.  I take issue with what Senator Taylor-Quinn said about the Minister's response.  The Minister has done everything possible.  He has responded efficiently and very quickly, giving full public information which is what was needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of centres have been set up around the country for testing, and testing can be carried out by all GPs.  I do <Col N="626" /> not think there is anything the Minister could have done that he has not done at this stage.  If it is possible to have further time at a later date I would support that proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Neville's proposal for a two hour debate and I support Senator Dardis's call for a debate on agriculture.  The United Farmers Association are outside the gates today; I support them in their call for better farm incomes in the west.  I wish to raise another matter in relation to a debate on local authorities called for last week by Senator Manning.  I read a statement in last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i> made by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and I was appalled and shocked by what she said about local authorities and local authority personnel.  She said that the current practices of some local authorities are helping to escalate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to initiate a debate with the appropriate Minister about the problems confronted by many groups throughout the country where architects and purchasing officers are involved in the purchase of materials and goods for public services. It is virtually impossible for Irish firms to have their goods purchased by various bodies.  This is not the managers' fault; it is the fault of the architects who seem to have a penchant for buying imports. There is a need for an urgent debate on this matter because it is being raised in every forum in this country at present.  It might give us a chance to tell these people what import substitution and job creation is about because they do not seem to care.  I ask that the appropriate Minister could be asked to come here to develop this.</P>

      <P>I also support the request for a debate on East Timor, but I would like to have it extended because if we debate East Timor, the time allotted might not be adequate to discuss the problems associated with the denial of human and civil rights in what was formerly the USSR, Afghanistan, in former Yugoslavia and East Timor.  We should have an early debate on these subjects.</P>

Anyone who saw the television programme last night must be convinced that genocide is perpetrated by the Indonesians and by the complicity of the western nations, especially the Australians, in this matter.  Anyone who wants to read about this situation should go to the Library and get one of the books supplied by the Dutch Ambassador.  It is an important debate and, like Senator Lanigan, I ask the Leader to give it as much time as possible.  We cannot ignore genocide in any part of the world.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Norris's view that the Minister has handled this matter as well as possible and I congratulate the Leader of the House for making time available for a discussion.  I would be unhappy if this matter was pushed to a vote this evening because there is consensus on both sides.  The Private Members' motion ordered for today is early retirement for teachers.  This is a matter close to my heart.  However, in the interests of making more time available, I am prepared to defer this motion provided it does not mean the loss of Private Members' time at a later date.  In other words, I am prepared to accommodate the House if we take two Private Members' motions another week.  I do not want a message to go out from the House that we are not prepared to give time to the hepatitis issue.</P>

      <Col N="629" /> I also want to mention the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which has been raised on a number of occasions by both sides of the House.  Over the next three weeks approximately 0.5 million trade unionists will vote on this programme and it would be appropriate to initiate the debate in this House.  It should be debated next week because after that it will lose its value.  Time should also be made available for a debate on East Timor.</P>

There is an urgent need for this debate and following it the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or the Government side of this House should bring this issue to the attention of the Government.  We tend to debate issues and then forget about them, and that is not good enough.  We should seriously consider this matter and ask the Government to take a stand on it.</P>

This morning we tried to ensure that the Minister would come to the House today and he had to make various changes to enable him to be here at 8.10 p.m.  I will arrange, through our Whip, to see if more time can be made available for this debate.  I do not believe that this is an issue on which there should be political point scoring.  All of us are at one on this most serious matter.  It is for that very reason that we have added it to the Order of Business today on top of a heavy legislative programme.  I would not be keen on the idea of deferring Private Members' time for such an issue because specific issues could be dealt with in that way every week.  I am giving an undertaking to those who proposed the amendment to get in touch with the Whips before 6 o'clock tonight.  I know, however, the Minister has already broken one long standing appointment to be here this evening.  It may well be <Col N="630" /> that we can provide more time for the debate.  We will certainly try to achieve that between now and 5.30 p.m.  Everyone in the House will be made aware of what will be decided by a Whips' statement.</P>
      <P>We will take on board Item 33 dealing with East Timor as soon as possible. Item 7 concerning the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will possibly be dealt with next week but certainly within the next two weeks.  The request for a debate on retail prices has been noted. I mentioned last week that we will have a debate on local authority matters as soon as possible.  There is legislation coming to the House dealing with the elections in June which may give us an opportunity to discuss local authorities in general.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Members of the House will be able to agree that this is clearly a major Bill which forms a vital part of the comprehensive programme for criminal law reform which I have under way at present.  I am pleased that Second Stage is being taken in this House so quickly after its deliberations on another major <Col N="631" /> part of that programme &mdash; the Public Order Bill &mdash; and I am grateful for having been facilitated in this regard.  I believe there is widespread public support for the measures contained in the present Bill and that it proposes some of the most powerful weapons against major criminals ever to come before this House.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the Bill has three main objectives: first, it will enable the courts to order the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious offences; second, it will create a specific offence of money laundering and will require financial institutions to assist in the prevention and detection of money laundering; and third, it will enable this country to co-operate with other states in the criminal field and to become a party to a number of international conventions which deal with drug trafficking, money laundering and mutual assistance in criminal matters.</P>
      <P>I would like to set out some of the general background to this measure and then set out in some detail some of its more important provisions.  All the available evidence strongly suggests that large scale crime is becoming more sophisticated in its scope with increasing international dimensions.  It has also come to be recognised that where large amounts of criminal proceeds are involved, it is by no means sufficient that the perpetrators of crime should be dealt with simply by way of imprisonment and fines.  Other measures are called for.  In particular, I am referring to measures, such as confiscation of criminal assets.  This is required to target those who reap substantial rewards from crime at the expense of others and society as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere is there a greater need for these additional measures than in the area of drug trafficking.  We all know of the tremendous profits that can be made from drugs and that this obnoxious trade is being carried on by those evil parasites who prey on others &mdash; especially young people &mdash; for the sole purpose of financial gain.  I have no doubt that Members of this House will share the abhorrence and <Col N="632" /> concerns expressed in the other House about the activities of such people.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say it is hard to imagine a greater threat to the quality of life in this and in many other countries than that posed by the activities of those whose business is the supply of drugs.  The reality of what happens is all too simple and there is a pattern about it that is all too familiar to us in our role as public representatives. The drugs godfathers set about creating the market for their products among young &mdash; often very young &mdash; people. Very soon those whom they have successfully targeted are addicts.  Addicts then tend to live for nothing but their next fix.  The obsession with feeding their addiction is such that over time virtually all social values go.  Typically, members of the addict's immediate family will be the first to be deceived and defrauded.</P>
    <P>Shortly after that the addict is likely to start committing crime in the community beginning with petty theft and in many cases moving on to much more serious crimes.  At some point along the way the heroin drug abuser is likely to acquire the HIV virus and perhaps spread it further into the community.  Many addicts will likely end up serving increasingly longer sentences in prison as part of, in many cases, their greatly shortened lifespans. The addicts themselves are just the immediate victims.  There is also the agony suffered by their families and friends.  Then there is the misery suffered by the community generally because of the level and serious nature of crimes committed by many of those who become addicted.  Of course none of this is of the slightest concern to drug traffickers once they continue to reap substantial profits from their handiwork.</P>
    <P>This Bill, however, will provide us with the opportunity to strike at the very heart of drug trafficking and other serious crime.  By enabling criminals to be deprived of their ill gotten gains we will help remove, to a significant extent, the incentive which draws people into this type of crime.  In addition, we will ensure that money which might otherwise have <Col N="633" /> been used for criminal purposes is no longer available for such purposes.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, under the terms of the Bill, where a person is convicted on indictment of a non-drug trafficking offence the court will be able to make a confiscation order against the offender up to the amount of the benefit the court is satisfied was obtained as a result of the offence in question.  However, where a drug trafficking conviction is involved the amount of the confiscation order will not be limited to the benefit the trafficker has derived from a particular offence but will extend to all the profits that person has made from drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Money-laundering is another important feature of serious crime which is addressed in the Bill.  Laundering itself is not new as criminals have always sought to cover up the illegal origins of what is frequently called dirty money.  However, the growing trend towards the removal of restrictions on the movement of persons and capital between countries has made it much more difficult for law enforcement authorities to keep up with criminals who have become increasingly mobile and ingenious in their attempts to conceal and disguise their criminal proceeds.</P>
    <P>Our present law does not contain effective measures to deal with the modern reality in this area.  The Bill fills this gap by making money laundering a specific offence with very heavy penalties.  In addition, the Bill contains provisions which are designed to prevent and detect money laundering in line with the EC Directive 91/308/EEC on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.  For example, obligations are being imposed on banks and other financial institutions to carry out identity checks on customers and to report suspicious transactions to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The third significant feature of the Bill is that it will provide a legislative basis for this country to enter into arrangements with other countries whereby we will be able to obtain and to provide assistance in criminal matters.  This will significantly ease the task of foreign investigation and prosecution agencies in <Col N="634" /> cases where crucial evidence or witnesses may be in this country.  Equally, we will benefit by being able to make requests for similar assistance from countries party to the relevant international conventions.</P>
    <P>Mutual assistance arrangements between states are the subject of a number of international conventions and a measure of the comprehensiveness of the approach which we are taking is that the Bill will enable this country to become party to the most important of those conventions, namely, the Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, 1959; the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988; and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime, 1990.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful at this stage if I was to outline briefly the nature of these conventions.  The 1959 mutual assistance convention applies to a wide range of measures, such as the taking of evidence for foreign courts, the service of summonses and carrying out searches for evidence required in connection with foreign investigations or prosecutions. The UN Convention, which is generally referred to as the Vienna Convention, requires states to co-operate in the fight against drug trafficking, in particular in relation to the confiscation of the proceeds of trafficking.  The general thrust of the 1990 Council of Europe convention on money laundering and related matters is similar to the Vienna Convention but its scope is much broader in that it is not limited to the proceeds of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Turning now to specific provisions of the Bill, Senators will appreciate that in view of its size and technical nature it would not be practical for me to go through all the Bill in detail at this stage. Obviously, this is something we will do on Committee Stage.  What I propose, therefore, is to concentrate on the main provisions.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill deals with the Short Title, Commencement and Interpretation <Col N="635" /> providing extensive definitions in relation to terms used later in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II, which includes sections 4 to 14, is concerned with the confiscation of criminal proceeds and is at the heart of the Bill.  Section 4 confers powers on a court to make a confiscation order, on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions, against a person who has been convicted on indictment of a drug trafficking offence.  For this purpose a drug trafficking offence is widely defined and the definition is contained in section 3 in Part I of the Bill.  Where a court determines that the offender has benefited from trafficking it will make a confiscation order for the amount of the benefit he or she has received from all drug trafficking and not merely from the specific offence in respect of which he or she has been convicted.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that in determining whether a person has benefited from drug trafficking or the amount of that benefit the court will apply the civil standard of proof.  In this regard, I would like to emphasise that there is no question of reducing the burden of proof that the prosecution must discharge in order to obtain a conviction in relation to a particular offence.  That burden will remain on the prosecution in the usual way to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the offence with which he or she is charged.  However, to insist that the same burden be discharged in relation to confiscation proceedings would an intolerable task on the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It would inevitably mean that many convicted traffickers would be able to retain a large portion of their illegal gains.</P>
    <P>Section 5 makes provision for the assessment of a defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking in connection with the making of a confiscation order under section 4.  The main feature of the section is that the court will be required to assume that all property in the hands of the defendant at the time of conviction and all income or other assets received by him or her in the previous six years were part of the proceeds of drug trafficking. <Col N="636" /> It will be a matter for the defendant to show that particular assets or property were not derived from trafficking and I believe it is appropriate that this type of burden should be placed on the defendant given the nature of drug trafficking and that the type of information involved will be within his or her knowledge.</P>
    <P>The court will also be in a position not to apply the assumptions if it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if they were to be applied in a particular case.  I should emphasise that where a court is satisfied that proceeds of drug trafficking arose prior to six years before the conviction arose, these too can be confiscated; the difference would be that the same evidential assumptions would not apply.</P>
    <P>The situation where the defendant's assets are less than the amount the court assesses to be his or her proceeds of drug trafficking is covered in section 6.  If that proves to be the case the confiscation order will be made for the amount of the defendant's actual assets.</P>
    <P>The making of confiscation orders where a person is convicted on indictment of non drug trafficking offences is provided for in section 7.  The procedure will be similar to that in drug trafficking cases but the maximum amount of the confiscation order will be restricted to the value of the defendant's benefit from the specific offence involved and the type of assumptions which are provided for in section 5 will not apply.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 are concerned with the provision of information by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the defendant in confiscation proceedings. Section 10 includes a provision, inter alia, that before making a confiscation order a court can take account of a civil action that may be instituted against the defendant in respect of his or her crime and any other order that involves any payment to another person, for example, a compensation order made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 11, which has to be read with section 12, is to allow confiscation orders to be made against <Col N="637" /> persons who have died or absconded. These will apply where a person has been convicted of an offence on indictment but subsequently dies or absconds and also where a person against whom proceedings have been instituted absconds.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned with the enforcement of confiscation orders. Perhaps the most important point in this regard is that under section 15 such orders will be enforceable by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the same way as a civil debt to the State for the amount involved.  In this way the DPP will be able to rely on the whole range of civil remedies available in respect of civil debts in order to realise and collect money due under a confiscation order. In addition, specific provision is made to enable the court to appoint a receiver in respect of the defendant's property.</P>
    <P>The section also makes provision for the enforcement of a confiscation order by the committal to prison of a defendant who does not comply with such an order. The period of imprisonment to be served will be related to the amount to be paid or which is outstanding under the order and will be determined in accordance with a table at the end of the section. Where a defendant serves a term of imprisonment under section 15 this will not affect the power of the DPP to take other action to enforce the confiscation order, in other words, imprisonment will not be in substitution for compliance with a confiscation order.</P>
    <P>Part III also provides in sections 19 and 20 for the making of restraint orders by the High Court.  The purpose of these sections is to ensure that confiscation orders will not be frustrated by the transfer by criminals of their assets to other parties.  The effect of a restraint order will be to prevent any person dealing with the property covered by the order without the permission of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The operation of sections 19 and 20 is not restricted to the situation where a confiscation order has actually been made and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, they allow the DPP to obtain a restraint order against a person <Col N="638" /> who has not yet been charged with a criminal offence in respect of which a confiscation order might be made.  To avoid alerting criminals that their property may be restrained, provision has been made to enable a restraint order to be sought without notice to the defendant. It will be open to a defendant in restraint proceedings, or another person whose property has been affected, to seek the discharge or variation of a restraint order.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is concerned with money laundering.  Section 27 creates a new offence of money laundering.  It is wide in scope and will apply whether a person has laundered their own criminal proceeds or proceeds from crimes committed by others.  The maximum penalties for the offence will be imprisonment for up to 14 years and/or an unlimited fine.  This reflects the seriousness of the offence.  In addition, it should be noted that an offence will be committed where laundering is carried out in respect of criminal proceeds derived from crimes committed before section 27 comes into operation or from offences abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 28 obliges banks and other financial bodies whose services are likely to be used to conceal criminal proceeds to adopt measures to prevent and assist in the detection of money laundering.  In particular the section requires that customers be identified and records relating to identification and to transactions be retained in case they may be needed for money laundering investigations.  These requirements are provided for in the EU Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill is concerned with drug offences at sea.  The purpose of this Part is to give effect to certain provisions of the UN drugs convention.  Sections 29 and 30 extend the scope of our criminal law to deal with drug trafficking on Irish and other ships.  Sections 31 and 32 make provision for prosecution and enforcement matters arising out of sections 29 and 30.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> Part VI of the Bill makes provision for international co-operation with other countries in criminal matters.  I have already referred to various international conventions operating in this field and it is our intention to ratify those conventions as quickly as possible after the Bill has been enacted.  The overall effect will be to enable this country to play a full part at international level in the fight against drug trafficking and other serious crime.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it necessary at this stage to go into great detail on Part VI of the Bill.  However, in order to illustrate the broad nature of the provisions I believe it appropriate to list the forms of assistance covered &mdash; the enforcement of confiscation and forfeiture orders; the service of summonses and other judicial documents; the taking of evidence for criminal proceedings; the transfer of prisoners to give evidence or assist criminal investigations; and searches for material required for foreign investigations.</P>
    <P>Part VII is in effect the miscellaneous part of the Bill.  I will refer briefly to a number of its provisions.  Section 44 supplements the earlier money laundering provisions by requiring the disclosure by banks and other financial bodies of suspicious transactions to the Garda Síochána.  In addition, section 45 makes it an offence for a person to prejudice an investigation that may be under way following a disclosure made under section 44.</P>
    <P>Section 48 allows a court to make a forfeiture order in respect of property which was used or intended to be used in the commission of an offence.  Section 50 empowers a court, under specified conditions, to order a person to disclose to the Garda Síochána material which is required for the purpose of investigating serious crime or in connection with confiscation proceedings.  Additional provision is made in section 51 for the issue of search warrants to allow the Garda to obtain access to information where the disclosure procedure under section 50 has proved unsuccessful or where it would not be practicable or appropriate. <Col N="640" /> Sections 52, 53 and 54 provide for the payment of compensation in connection with the operation of the confiscation and related provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have set out an outline of the main provisions of the Bill and I am confident that it will be found acceptable in principle by all sides of the House.  I assure Senators that I will consider fully the points they make today and during later Stages.  In that context, it may be helpful for me to mention that I hope to be in a position on Committee Stage to bring forward a number of amendments arising mainly from the debate in the other House and representations which have been made to me by interested bodies on the detail of specific provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Given the provisions I have outlined, the importance of this Bill in terms of tackling the activities of major criminals and drug traffickers in particular will be self-evident.  I am determined, and I am sure I will have the support of every Member of this House, that this country should adopt the strongest possible measures to ensure that we do not allow a situation where criminals can live off their ill-gotten gains.  Equally, we must not allow this country to become a soft target for international crime.  This Bill sends out a clear message that we are prepared to take whatever measures necessary to make sure that does not happen.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Before I resume my seat, a Chathaoirligh, may I explain to Members that it will be necessary for me to leave the House in about ten minutes to make my concluding remarks, which I already started, to the Second Stage of the Extradition Bill in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice to the House and I also welcome the Bill.  I am pleased she has indicated that she will use this House to facilitate amendments she has identified. She has requested the Opposition to put forward amendments, and we will, of course, do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> For some years, Fine Gael has advocated in this House that legislation, similar to that before us, should be introduced.  In fact, the party's first motion in this Seanad, which was placed on the Order Paper on 25 February 1993, called for the courts to be given greater powers to confiscate assets derived from the proceeds of crime.  In this context, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>In 1990, I introduced an Adjournment Matter expressing my concern with the policing implications of open borders in Europe post-1992.  I expressly voiced concern regarding the implications for drug trafficking.  In the Official Report, 28 March 1990, Vol. 124, col. 1178, I stated:</P>
    <P>In the light of the massive scale of international criminal activity, drug trading, terrorist activities and so on, it is important that the police forces of Europe integrate into a cohesive unit which will have adequate resources to carry out detailed research into the problem, formulate laws and strategies to combat it.</P>
    <P>I quoted a 1986 committee of inquiry which stated:</P>
    <P>Urgent action is needed to improve co-ordination and efficiency of all law enforcement agencies involved with drug trafficking across the Community. The trafficker operates on a multinational basis which knows no boundaries and the war against organised drug organisations will be lost unless we co-ordinate our forces in a similar way.  Therefore, we urgently recommend that a European Community Drug Task Force be set up, to be modelled on the existing United States Task Force Programme, and adapted for Community use with all possible improvements.  The relevant department of Interpol should be expanded, reorganised on the basis of a number of principles and recommendations suggested in this report and given financial backing.</P>
    <P>During the debate in 1990, I pointed out that only between 5 per cent and 10 per <Col N="642" /> cent of drugs are recovered by international security forces each year and that open borders would facilitate even further the distribution of drugs throughout the EU member states.  Unfortunately, since 1992 there has been a dramatic increase in drag trafficking.  This Bill attempts to tackle that problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill will enable this country to co-operate with other states in the criminal field and to become a party to a number of international conventions which will deal with drug trafficking, money laundering and mutual assistance in criminal matters.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the House in 1990 I referred to money laundering and the international banking situation being an unwitting facilitator of depositing proceeds of criminal activity.  In the Official Report, 28 March 1990, Vol. 124, cols. 1179-11801 stated:</P>
    <P>International banking legislation and conventions of secrecy at present facilitate the safe disposal and concealment of the vast profits made from criminal activity.  While I accept that confidentiality of legitimate financial transactions must be maintained [by banks,]... progress [must be] made to devise means of detecting quantities of funds from criminal activities within the legitimate banking system.</P>
    <P>Until the enactment of this Bill, money laundering is not an offence in law.  This Bill is welcome for making money laundering a specific offence with heavy penalties. I also welcome the provisions in the Bill to prevent money laundering in line with the relevant EU Directive.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will fail unless we have the courage and determination to pursue drug barons to their source, to the countries which export illegal drugs.  Some countries export more illegal drugs in terms of their gross national product than the combined total of their legitimate products.</P>
    <P>There is a huge problem in Ireland with drugs which are sold openly on our streets.  These drugs are brought into the EU, warehoused in Rotterdam, distributed <Col N="643" /> throughout the EU, go directly to the UK and change routes without any macro plan to tackle the problem.  It is important that the EU, through the Trevi Group or the Council of Ministers, place the control of illegal drug trafficking at the top of their agendas.</P>
    <P>Money laundering from these illegal sources is corrupting all kinds of people. The money launderer is competing with the legitimate business community in a further distortion of society.  This problem must be tackled at EU level.  A drug control enforcement agency must be established in line with the DEA in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months, millions of pounds worth of drugs have been captured along the south-west coast of Ireland.  Assistance should be obtained from the EU to eliminate this drug trafficking. As a step in controlling drug trafficking along our coastline I ask the Minister to consider the introduction of helicopter units for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Airborne law enforcement is a practical cost effective weapon in the fight against crime and has proved to be a statistical success in other jurisdictions. Studies illustrate that the use of helicopters can help suppress crime.  The helicopter can see at least six times as much detail as any ground vehicle in the same time span.  It can search a 25 mile area in the same time that a ground vehicle can search a one mile area.  It can increase the level convictions by providing aerial photographs or videos of criminal activities.  This could extend, not only to drug trafficking, but other types of criminal activity.  The presence of a helicopter could distract suspects and make them feel surrounded psychologically.</P>
    <P>Helicopter units are a deterrent to crime.  In five minutes one dozen people might see a patrol car while one thousand people might see a helicopter.  Helicopters have been successful in dramatic operations, such as high speed pursuits, and in fighting mundane crimes.  Vandalism in Lakewood, California, was cut <Col N="644" /> by 75 per cent in the first year of helicopter control.</P>
    <P>In the Irish context, crime is increasing in two areas where the use of police helicopters could be successfully applied.  I already referred to one, the huge increase in the amount of drugs being smuggled into this country.  The second area is where bands of armed criminals steal high powered cars in urban areas to travel to rural areas to commit crimes.  They are miles away before the gardaí may effectively respond.  Patrolling Ireland's coastline is a task to which the helicopter is suited.  It could be successfully applied to the area of drug smuggling.  Within minutes of a crime being committed, a helicopter could be airborne and headed for that area.  Identifying a speeding car from a helicopter is not difficult at night. A helicopter could give chase while coordinating ground units to intercept the criminal.</P>
    <P>A fully equipped police helicopter could be purchased for approximately $1.2 million and maintenance could be contracted out to the airforce.  In Los Angeles the cost a two man patrol car searching an area of one square mile was $54, while the cost of surveillance by a two man helicopter of one square mile was $8.5.  There is an economic reason for introducing such an approach and the Minister should look at this.</P>
    <P>Money laundering from drug trafficking and other criminal offences is corrupting many people.  I call for an Irish DEA to work in conjunction with a European DEA which is required to tackle the drug problem internationally.  This should be done by giving incentives to or by imposing economic sanctions against countries which continue to export these drugs.  I ask the Minister if the Government is in favour of setting up a DEA? If so, what are its plans?</P>
    <P>How are the proceeds of crime used? In many cases, they are used to purchase commercial property.  We constantly hear rumours of property empires being built by ill-gotten gains.  These people are in a position to purchase the best advice available to cover their tracks.  Will resources be made available by the <Col N="645" /> Department of Justice to pursue these people?  Will expertise be available in the Department to pursue them?  There is no point introducing this legislation if there are not resources to implement its provisions.</P>
    <P>I would like to use this opportunity to refer to bail.  Those involved in large scale drug trafficking, moneylending or money laundering are adept at using bail laws. Would the Government consider using the opportunity provided by the European elections to alter the Constitution to facilitate a change in bail laws?  The Government must not refuse to do so on the basis that an amendment to the Constitution is required to stop people charged with crimes who compound the situation by committing further serious crimes because they know they will be punished in any event and, therefore, commit those crimes while on bail.  The Minister should use the opportunity provided by the European elections to amend the Constitution on the basis of cost because people will be voting anyway.  The courts should not have to free people who are likely to commit further serious crimes.</P>
    <P>Our bail laws are the most lax in Europe.  In 1991 &mdash; there are probably more up to date figures available &mdash; the number of crimes committed by those on bail totalled 2,690.  The problem is bail cannot be refused by the courts on the grounds that the accused is likely to commit further offences.  A constitutional amendment is necessary to restore discretion to the courts.  For many years, notorious organised criminals had little difficulty getting bail and abusing it. For serious offences, such as rape and bank robbery, there is little ground in Irish law for objecting to bail even if prosecutors know the accused is likely to commit these crimes again.</P>
    <P>The provision for consecutive sentencing in the 1984 Criminal Justice Act has been a deterrent to petty crime but it has had little or no impact on organised and serious crime.  Organised criminals who know they will go to jail for one serious offence have no compunction committing other serious crimes because <Col N="646" /> they know they will serve only a fixed period in an over-crowded prison.  The Government should use this opportunity to ask the people to change the Constitution so criminals who insist on committing crimes may be remanded in custody if it is likely they may commit further crimes while on bail.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Irish Independent</i> last year documented eight criminals who continued to commit crime while on bail. Consecutive sentencing is a deterrent if a petty criminal is caught but those who commit serious crimes know they will be given a substantial sentence, but will get time off.  The State must ensure those who commit serious crimes face a high risk of being detected and will not have the opportunity to commit further crimes while on bail.  Such people must serve full sentences with time off only for good behaviour.  During this time they must not be able to influence criminal activity outside the jail.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the introduction of more legislation in the criminal justice area, further pressure is being put on the prison system.  There is an urgent need to deal with this issue which is vital to public confidence.  In the custodial system, hardened criminals, drug traffickers, bank robbers and perpetrators of serious crime must serve full sentences. Resources must be given to the Garda and the custodial system to ensure that expertise, manpower and technology are available to implement the provisions in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and am delighted to speak on behalf of my party.  I congratulate the Minister for taking this issue seriously.  Every Member has recognised that this country should adopt the strongest measures to deprive drug barons of the fruits of exploitation.  The Bill is timely.  This week cannabis worth £10 million, destined for the Irish market, was seized by customs officers at Dublin port and Manchester.  This consignment arrived by ferry from Antwerp.  Last week-end a ton of cannabis was found in the south inner city of Dublin.  We must congratulate our <Col N="647" /> customs officials and the Garda.  There is no doubt but that we have a huge drugs problem and now is the time to bring in draconian measures to deal with it.  These events clearly indicate how vulnerable Ireland is to drug barons and how exposed our coastline is.  They highlight the need for new legislative measures and powers of enforcement to ensure we are equipped to combat the menace of drugs in the most effective manner possible.</P>
      <P>People who believe drugs are not available on the streets of our cities and towns are kidding themselves.  I refer not to the so-called soft drugs but to hard drugs which now affect every walk of life and are readily available.  Drug dealers tout their wares on the streets of our inner cities.  A great deal of crime is drug related because addicts steal and commit assaults to feed their habit.  We only have to look at the drug ravaged hearts of American inner cities to know the threat drugs pose to Irish society.  This legislation is a clear manifestation of the Government's determination to ensure that such a situation never arises here.</P>
      <P>I know from my work on the north side of the city the trauma and pain drugs cause.  I counsel people who take drugs. My work has made me all too aware of the effects of drugs not only on takers but on families.  It may a cliché but it cannot be said often enough that drugs destroy lives; they eat at the fabric of our community.  Most disturbing of all is the sheer power of the international drugs trade and it demands an equally powerful response at international, national and community level.  We all know young people now smoke hash and that they can get it very easily at street corners and in public places.  The Garda are aware of this.  However, we do not seem to be able to get to the source of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Profit is the root motivation of the international drug trade.  In confiscating the assets of such criminals, the Minister is striking drug barons where it hurts them most.  While a prison sentence is a major deterrent, the confiscation of assets will prevent them from resuming, or subsequently benefiting from, their <Col N="648" /> crimes.  Confiscation is an invaluable weapon in the war against drugs and I look forward to its swift and ruthless application.  We must pursue the drug barons and confer on the courts the power to confiscate their assets and impose other strict penalties.  In the past we saw drug barons use the profits from their crime to keep them and their families in the lap of luxury.  They receive social welfare payments and live in local authority houses but they have bank accounts and go on lovely holidays.  All this is financed by the exploitation of our young.  They lead comfortable lives far removed from the misery of their victims. This display of opulence was often gained through brutality and criminality.</P>
    <P>I am aware from experience of many young people who are vulnerable and unemployed, who see their opportunity to make money quickly and are roped in. I want to help them out of their drug ghetto.  I commend the Minister for the sections dealing with confiscation of assets and penalties.  These measures are draconian but necessary.  The Minister is doing a super job in tackling crime in every walk of life and introducing penalties.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to read in a newspaper a reference to the petitions procedure and the Minister's power to reduce fines.  There was criticism of this and suggestions that this power should be changed and taken away from the Minister.  The Minister should have this power.  After being fined in court for a minor offence, a constituent approached me and said they did not have the resources to pay the fine.  In such a case it is my duty to ask the Minister to reduce the fine or to extend the period by which it must be paid.  I reject suggestions that this power should be changed and believe the Minister should be able to look at each case involving fines and use his or her discretion.  The issue may be confidential and it may not be possible to speak about it in court but the Minister may be able to adopt a more sympathetic approach.  I have strong objections to suggestions in the media that this power should be taken from the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The Bill deals with money laundering. This is a process whereby the international drug trade processes its ill gotten gains.  It is right that financial institutions are prevented from assisting, and forced to help detect, money laundering.  They have a serious responsibility in this area and must play their part to the fullest extent.  I welcome the obligation on banks and other financial institutions to identify customers and retain the records of any proceeds of which they are suspicious. Money laundering is a very complex operation as can be seen from reading literature on it.  However, it would take too long to go into all the details now.  We all have a responsibility to detect people we believe have obtained money through ill gotten means.  This part of the Bill is good and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The drug dealer is not a shabby dresser; he often wears expensive clothes and has a mobile phone.  He looks like any other prosperous businessman.</P>

      <P>We must not only root out and punish the foot soldiers on the streets of our inner cities but we must deal with the problem.  The drug business casts its net across international boundaries. I am very conscious of the need for international co-operation and a coordinated plan to fight the drug barons. There is no point tackling the problem on the ground if we do not deal with the source.</P>
      <P>The crunch is that the opening up of frontiers and the free movement of goods and services in the wake of the Maastricht treaty makes this co-operation between European countries more difficult. Having said that, the Council of Ministers and all the justice Ministers of the EU should be able to get together to determine how best to stop this problem at source.  Drugs are getting through the frontiers into England and our open coastline is difficult to defend, as we saw along the Cork coastline last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> I congratulate the Garda and the custom officials on their efforts to monitor this area but perhaps the Naval Service could also be involved.  We should not leave it all to the Garda.  They are to be complimented on their role in the confiscation of drugs but should we leave it all up to them?  We as parents, teachers, junior liaison officers, social workers and medical practitioners all have a role to play.  We can only win it if we all work together.  People on the street know what is happening.  At my work last week a parent told me her son told her he can get drugs any night of the week.  When young people are going to discos they can pool their money and buy drugs.  I wonder if parents are aware of what is happening.</P>
    <P>We can all help to get rid of this problem. We can reach out to the people who need our help but we must do it together. The Minister spoke about international co-operation but I wonder if we could do more in terms of national co-operation. I do not see any mention of this in the Bill but maybe it is there and will be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Garda and customs officials are doing a super job.  However, we have an open coastline and each of us must co-operate to stop the drug barons.  I am using this Chamber to reach out to the man on the street.  The drug barons are listening to me over the airwaves.  If we do not stop them Dublin will be like one of the South American cities where it is heart-rending to see young people being exploited.  Our high levels of unemployment make our young people targets. When they are caught they receive short prison sentences and the drug barons are waiting for them when they are released.  It is easy money and once they get hooked, that is the beginning of the end.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  It is much needed legislation which I hope is but the first in a series of such measures from this reforming Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be using all my time because I do not have a great deal more to add.  I live on the north side of <Col N="651" /> Dublin and am aware of the increase in crime throughout the inner city, both north and south.  In recent days a serious drug problem in the Meath Street area was highlighted.  I have been told that up to 40 people are openly dispensing drugs.</P>
      <P>However, one needs to be sensitised to the situation to be able to detect it.  I am told it goes on all the time in my area but I have yet to be aware that I am witnessing such activity.  Although having recently been told how it happens, I have become suspicious of groups of youths congregating in certain areas, little packages being passed and so on.  However, I am also aware that in one of the local public houses recently a young man was found passed out with a syringe in his arm, which had not happened for a number of years.</P>
      <P>It is, as we all agree, a very serious problem which affects the health and wellbeing of a vulnerable section of the population.  If one analyses the figures, it is clear that although there are drug addicts in all sectors of society, by far the most vulnerable group is those at the margins of society as a result of deprivation, unemployment, poor housing, low income levels, and so on.  Faced with very difficult prospects in life, drugs at least represent some kind of pleasurable escape from confronting realities.  It is clear that cynical people manipulate this situation to their own financial advantage.</P>
      <P>This is the year of the family of which much play is made, some of it extremely offensive.  It is being used to attack certain liberal advances and to attempt to roll them back.  However, at heart we all feel that children are one of the great assets of the nation and that they are vulnerable and require protection. Unscrupulous persons regard young people as an easy mark.  They can be introduced free of charge to the drug habit so that when they consequently become addicted they will act as cat's paws for the godfathers of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, what is happening is a kind of Fagin style operation in which people no longer have to expose themselves to <Col N="652" /> risk.  They have an army of automatons, reduced to that state by the drug habit, who will batter old women for the sake of a few bob, grab handbags, break into houses and commit every crime up to and including murder because they are driven by the need to supply this habit.  It is a physical addiction caused by people who use these drones or pawns at one remove to commit crimes of burglary, theft and violence.  They are manipulating them by remote control.</P>
    <P>It is a serious problem which I have no doubt lies, at least in part, behind the significant increase in crimes of violence. When I was a young man &mdash; which is not as long ago as some people might suppose from looking at me &mdash; there was no violence to speak of in this country.  I remember when an elderly woman and her sister who ran a small sweet shop off St.  Stephen's Green were threatened with an iron bar.  It made front page headlines in the evening newspapers.  It would not be mentioned or receive the least notice now.  Reports of murders are often buried in a paragraph.  That has a lot to do with the drug problem.</P>
    <P>Our response to violence has been desensitised by the activities of the Provisional IRA.  It is my firm conviction that our so-called republican heroes were not too far away from the drug problem at various stages of its development.  I recall, in particular, one slaying at Cumberland Street post office where various elements of disaffected ex-republicans machine gunned each other in pursuit of the profits of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is correct in addressing the problem on a financial basis by seeking to distrain the proceeds of crime.  This is the sophisticated approach that is most likely to work, shades of the way in which Al Capone was brought down in the United States of America.  When every other direct frontal attack on his empire failed, the FBI had the brainwave of attacking Al Capone through the tax laws.  They eventually got him through financial vulnerability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> Perhaps the Minister is correct in introducing this Bill as a short term measure, but &mdash; and this is the principal burden of what I want to say &mdash; it is nothing other than a short term measure because it will not ultimately be successful.  In the same way that the attack on Al Capone's alcohol based empire was not only unsuccessful but there had to be a repeal of the prohibition laws, my conviction is that the basis of the entire problem, as the Minister has rightly deduced, is financial, but one will only deal with this if it is on a global basis, which means removing the financial incentive entirely.  In order to do this, we must make drugs available. I have no doubt &mdash; and I know it is controversial to say this &mdash; that the drug problem will continue until the ultimate mechanism which makes it profitable for those people to sell drugs on a global basis is undermined and removed.  The basis for the Medellin and other cartels is purely financial.  As long as the demand is there there will be the supply; as long as there is an enormous financial mark up in terms of making drugs available on the street, we will have these multinational organisations dedicated to introducing drugs throughout the world.  I do not see any way to stop this other than making drugs available on prescription, removing the criminal penalty and stop driving it underground.  That is clearly the message from the prohibition experience.</P>
    <P>There was a recent debate on AIDS in this House, and this is a related subject.  I remember being surprised and interested listening to Dr. John O'Connell, who subsequently became Minister for Health.  He made this contribution before he became Minister for Health, although by then he had held a number of political positions.  If the Minister cares to check the record of the Seanad during that debate on AIDS &mdash; it was the first debate to take place on that issue in either House of the Oireachtas &mdash; Dr. O'Connell said that from his experience as a politician and as a medical doctor, the only way to clearly fight the drugs and AIDS problems was to contemplate not only free <Col N="654" /> needle exchanges but also the legalisation of drugs, including hard drugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that this view is increasingly gaining currency among international police sources, the last place one would expect to find it.  I recognise that what I say may be misconstrued and it may be suggested that I am approaching this from a liberal point of view and that I wish half the countryside to be as high as kites but this is far from the situation.  It is a most unpleasant prospect to witness people on drugs.  In my view, it may be better than continuing a situation where people are driven by the high price, the fluctuating accessibility and purity of these drugs, to addiction. Heroin is often cut with different substances, some of them toxic.  Deaths may arise either from the agents introduced into the drugs or because the heroin is too pure when it is injected.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about imprisonment. This is not an answer.  The proof of that was clear last week when a Greek heroin addict was placed in Mountjoy Prison.  He had been detoxified but seven months into the programme, he managed, inside a secure prison, to acquire for himself a hypodermic needle and a supply of heroin that was so pure it killed him instantly.  Imprisonment and the criminalisation of drug taking is not the answer.  The distraining of profits from those who make money from this offensive and horrible manipulation of other human beings is part of the answer, but until we bite the bullet and address the problem, which is to destroy the capacity to make profit out of drugs, we will only be tinkering at the edges.</P>
    <P>Various people have spoken about the situation with regard to the coastline in County Cork.  We do not have the manpower or the resources &mdash; and I doubt that we ever will &mdash; to turn ourselves into a complete fortress island.  There is no doubt in my mind that drugs will continue to be imported.  I doubt if there is a satisfactory answer to this problem in terms of a military or naval option.  The coastline is too jagged and lengthy and our resources in terms of personnel and gunboats are far too limited.  We are fooling <Col N="655" /> ourselves if we think this kind of sophisticated international operation can be stopped in this way.  It is not possible.</P>
    <P>While I commend this legislation as a partial measure, and it is the kind of appropriate measure we can do as a country on our own, we can only stem the increase in drug taking and the spin-off effects of crime by, with our partners in Europe and the rest of the world, addressing the problem honestly and realistically and by destroying the financial base of this trade.</P>
    <P>In this legislation there is the question of the confiscation orders.  I assume that this has been tested for constitutionality because, regrettably, property often seems to be given stronger guarantees under our Constitution than personal rights.  I am aware that the common good is another of the constitutional tests, but I have noticed in the past that Governments have been reluctant to balance this against the rights of property.  I presume this has been tested for constitutionality. I also notice that it says that it will be a matter for the defendant to show that his assets or property were not derived from trafficking.  I would again like to sound a slight note of caution.  Although I detest the godfathers of crime in this area &mdash; I regard them as a disease, a cancer on the body of this country &mdash; this seems to reverse a long established principle, which is the assumption of innocence and the requirement of a court to demonstrate guilt.  I again have some hesitation about this and the way in which it will be operated by the courts.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that it will be possible to take out confiscation orders against persons who have absconded or have died.  I am also glad that the Minister is taking measures to prevent the frustration of confiscation orders by the transfer of property to relatives or other individuals.  This is highly appropriate.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the section on money laundering and hope this is effective. I am sure money is being laundered in Ireland.  I am sure the Minister will remember, as I do, the difficulties the previous Government encountered when <Col N="656" /> it attempted to seize money being laundered by the IRA.  I do not know whether this money derived from drugs, it may have been proceeds of bank robberies, but I remember being astonished to find how difficult it was for the Government to seize this money.  Anything that addresses that problem would certainly be welcome.</P>
    <P>The problem does not just arise from foreign interests or individuals and groups who derive their income from drugs laundering money in this country. I am aware of people in the inner cities who are laundering money abroad.  It is not just drug money.  There is at least one case in which £25,000 worth of hot money a week is exiting this city as the untaxed proceeds of a Rachman operation.  The Minister will recall what Mr. Rachman was up to in London in the 1960s where he exploited tenement dwellers and extracted exorbitant rents from them upon which no tax revenue accrued to the State.  There is a serious problem with money laundering not only in the drugs field but in a number of other areas.</P>
    <P>I said I was not going to use all my time so I had better make good that promise.  I commend the Bill.  It is a good piece of work.  I hope it has been tested for constitutionality but I am sure it will do some good.  I have every sympathy for the plight of persons who take drugs, but I have none for the pushers and the godfathers.  This Bill is only the first step. As one nation in Europe, we can act on our own but until the world grows up and learns to face the fact that unless we deregulate the drugs industry and remove the ultimate basis of profit, there will always be enormous cartels and we will never stop the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, do not intend to use my time allocation because this is a Bill with which we all agree in essence.  I will not repeat what has been said by previous speakers with whom I agree. I am delighted that this Bill has been introduced.  I hope it will address criminal matters which were not previously dealt with in legislation and in that sense it is long overdue.  Nobody could object to <Col N="657" /> what the Bill seeks to achieve.  Aside from the specific wording of certain sections, this Bill is badly needed and long overdue.</P>
      <P>This morning as I was driving down to Dublin, I was listening to &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; which, I might add, is not a habit of mine.  The governor of Mountjoy Prison was discussing crime and prison life.  The discussion followed on from previous programmes which dealt with crime and the victims of crime.  The prison governor was explaining how the prison system works and how prisoners are treated.  The general discussion was informative and interesting.</P>
      <P>In the course of discussion the governor referred several times to the destructive nature of drugs and mentioned that in a recent survey of Mountjoy Prison it was found that on any one day over 60 per cent of the prisoners were either drug addicts, had psychiatric problems or had attempted suicide at some stage.  That statistic frightened me. It highlights the need to tackle the causes of crime and not just treat the symptoms by putting people in prison.</P>
      <P>While imprisonment keeps the problem at bay, our system fails to rehabilitate the individual prisoner and address the causes of crime.  Statistics show that these people come from disadvantaged areas and backgrounds.  I am not making excuses for them but if there is a direct link between the background against which they are struggling and crime, we will witness an increasing crime rate until we address the problems caused by disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of drug addicts in prison needs to be highlighted.  It is obvious that drug addicts needing money for a fix will automatically resort to crime and the number of them in prison reflects that fact.  Where are the drug pushers, traffickers and barons who are making their fortune from the appalling problems which result in crime?  They laugh at our judicial system and our gardaí as they head to the bank with their money.  The victim may land in prison but the drug barons do not.  This Bill is essential to <Col N="658" /> assist our gardaí and the court system to confront these unscrupulous people.</P>
    <P>If one examines any part of our society, especially those sections which are disadvantaged and poverty stricken, one will realise how easy it is to operate a drug supply system.  The pushers are planted and encourage innocent young teenagers to try drugs by giving free samples and actively encouraging them to become addicts.  Peer pressure is a major problem for young people.  Once hooked the addict is helpless and drugs take over his or her life.  Life's only purpose then is to get the next fix at all costs.</P>
    <P>We should not blame the addicts because they suffer most.  They are inflicting more damage on themselves than on anybody else.  Drug addiction makes robots of them and their aim is to get money to buy drugs to feed their addiction.  The suffering caused to many families as a result of drug abuse is unmeasured.  We do not fully appreciate the agony those people go through or that experienced by the victims of the crime which results directly from drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that increases in crime are a direct result of the drug problem. These people need money and will stop at nothing; they are oblivious to everything else.  The need for speed has directly resulted in an increase in crime.  Until we address the drug problem we will unfortunately suffer crimes, muggings, burglaries and so on.  It is the root cause of a lot of damage.  I hate to see the profits these people make from the agonies they have inflicted on what are now addicts and helpless people.</P>
    <P>The people who benefit from the crime &mdash; the drug barons as they are now called &mdash; are known to the gardaí but they manage to avoid the rigours of the law in their usual crafty fashion.  This is why I welcome the provisions of this Bill.  I believe wholeheartedly in showing mercy.  I have talked on previous occasions about the rights of the individual and how our prison system fails to deal adequately with the disadvantages suffered by prisoners.  However, I have no mercy for those who profit from drugs. <Col N="659" /> They are a menace to society and no stone should be left unturned in rooting them out, isolating them and punishing them.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims to deprive these people of the profits gained from drug trafficking. It could not go far enough.  The godfathers of crime need to be stripped of all such gains.  This Bill also addresses international drug trafficking.  As Senator Norris said, it is an international problem and we are only a small part of the overall jigsaw.  Our ports and coastline have been abused in recent years and drug barons have exploited our coastline in order to inflict more damage on people who are already suffering from this appalling situation. We cannot do enough to tackle the people who are importing drugs.</P>
    <P>This abuse of our shores has gone on for too long and in this Bill attempts to deal in a very practical way with incorporating and facilitating international co-operation in the investigation of crimes and the investigation and following up of international drug barons.  It will also facilitate the giving of evidence and help the Garda in other practical ways which are badly needed.  We cannot go far enough in facilitating the international tackling of drug racketeering and trafficking. I am pleased that this Bill takes that on board in a practical way.</P>
    <P>We definitely need co-operation.  We need to realise at an international level the problem we face as a direct result of drugs in modern society.  Until we share that information and co-operate in every way possible, we will have problems because these people are shrewd operators. They do not need to be told how to get drugs into this country.  I have noticed that the debate so far has focused directly on drugs and I do not blame Senators for doing so because it is a root problem in society.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive Bill.  Money laundering has become an increasing problem.  This is a direct result of technological advances and needs to be tackled because it allows criminals to benefit from crime.  If there were no gain, why would criminals be involved?  Profit <Col N="660" /> from crime must be a primary concern of this Government.  I am pleased this Bill tackles money laundering, racketeering, etc., and helps our courts and the gardaí to deal with them.  They do not have to go through the present procedure of trying to provide evidence against the people they know to be involved in racketeering but they cannot prove it.  In providing specific offences in these cases the Bill facilitates the bringing of these people before our courts to answer for all they have done.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the confiscation of profits from drugs and other offences and enables these profits to be collected under the civil law system.  It provides for restraint orders and the proof required for conviction.  It seems to be an overall programme that will help to tackle the root of crime.  This Government is doing all it can to deal with the motivator of crime, and the motivator is profit, there can be no doubt about that.  We have to deprive these godfathers of their profits. We must strip them of their assets.  Drugs can be bought in every village in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The addicts need help but that is a problem for another day, a problem which needs to be addressed.  However, it will not be addressed by the Minister for Justice as it is not within her brief, but she can and will deal with the godfathers who benefit from crime of this sort here today.  No stone should be left unturned in doing that.  A question was raised regarding the confiscation of property and whether it is constitutional.  It did not occur to me on reading the Bill, but if there is a problem regarding the property rights of drug barons, I would hate to see them invoking the provisions and protection of our Constitution to benefit from crime.  To let them get away with that would be an abuse of our Constitution. What about the rights of the victims of crime?  What happens to the drug addicts?  They are all victims.  Who is going to protect them?  In this case property rights should not be paramount. The provisions in this Bill are required if they are to strip the drug barons of their gains.  That is my opinion and I have stated it here today for the record.  In this <Col N="661" /> case we cannot go far enough.  Profit is the motive for crime and until we take away the profit we can never hope to reduce the problem created by drugs and other offences.  I wholeheartedly welcome this Bill.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I warmly welcome this Bill which my party supports.  It is radical legislation but we all accept that it is badly needed.  The Law Reform Commission carried out a review of the law in this area in 1987 and examined the possibility of confiscating the proceeds of crime.  For as long as there has been crime and criminal activity there has been concern to ensure that we confront the situation that crime does pay and that criminals are laughing all the way to the bank.  It is for this reason that I welcome this legislation.  The Minister and her Department must be congratulated for the excellent work they have done in comprehensively covering all these issues in this area.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission was asked to examine the matter because of the need to comply with international obligations in relation to drug trafficking and money laundering.  There is very good cause for all of us to be concerned about the increasing proliferation of drugs, particularly hard drugs among young people.  There is a general belief that the drug problem is confined to the big cities but no town has escaped it.  As most Senators have said, the real problem is the drug barons, the people who are making money.  The addicts, the victims of the drug problem, are the people who end up in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Gallagher spoke about hearing the governor of Mountjoy on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; this morning.  I, too, was listening to him.  He talked about the proceeds of crime and criminals benefiting from their activities.  He said he did not believe that anybody in Mountjoy Prison was wealthy, so the barons of crime and the people who are benefiting from these activities do not seem to be the ones getting caught.  That is a big difficulty.  I have never visited the male <Col N="662" /> prison in Mountjoy but as a member of the Commission on the Status of Women I visited the women's prison.  Almost 75 per cent of the women in prison were heroin addicts.  The great sadness is that they were introduced to drugs when they were very young, they were preyed upon by the drug barons and their lives from there on were completely destroyed.  The governor of the prison talked about whole families he knew, families of young people who had been in Mountjoy, who were drug addicts and who had since died of the HIV virus.  He talked about grandparents being left to rear the children of these people.</P>
    <P>Any legislation we can bring forward to prevent these drug barons &mdash; I cannot even think of a word bad enough to call them - from benefiting from the proceeds of their crime should be enacted, but my main concern is to catch these people. That seems to be the difficulty.  If they are not in prison they are roaming the streets and committing heinous crimes against young people.  These people are sophisticated and intelligent and the need for international co-operation is paramount. This legislation must be welcomed because it enables us to take part in international conventions and comply with international regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the State powers to seize the proceeds of crime by allowing the Director of Public Prosecutions to freeze assets before a criminal trial takes place or an accused person is charged.  This is welcome because if one cannot do this before a criminal trial takes place, or before someone finds out they will be charged, the accused will be able to dispose of their assets, to transfer them out of the jurisdiction or to transfer them into someone else's name.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that money laundering is being seriously tackled in this legislation.  The Bill provides for 14 years' imprisonment and/or confiscation for such an offence.  This penalty will be welcomed by most people because it relates to crimes other than drug trafficking &mdash; for example, white collar crime which, to date, has not been adequately dealt with.  The obligations placed on <Col N="663" /> financial institutions will be warmly welcomed and will change the attitude of many banks and building societies.</P>
    <P>The Minister was willing to introduce amendments to the Bill as it passed through the other House.  One part of this Bill which worries me relates to the seizure of the proceeds of crime.  The Minister has indicated that part of the proceeds will be used in the implementation of this legislation.  I believe they should be used to establish a fund to ease the pain and suffering of crime victims. Drug barons make their money from drug addicts and those who go to prison. Many of these people are attending drug rehabilitation centres, many of which are under-funded.  There are long waiting lists for those who need treatment at these centres.  The money should be used to help these victims; it should not go back into the Exchequer for general distribution. A voluntary committee for the support of victims of crime has been established and it receives support from the Minister, but it is under-funded.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister says about this.</P>
    <P>It could be said that this radical legislation is draconian, but it is warmly welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>For many months a number of Senators raised the issue of the importation of drugs.  We called for many debates and today we are speaking on a Bill which meets our requirements. We hoped the drugs problem would go away, but it will never be defeated because of the large amount of money generated from the importation and distribution of drugs.  However, we should try to curtail this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legalisation of drugs was mentioned. I am against the legalisation of narcotics which people use in the streets. It is a sad day for any country which prides itself on caring for all sectors of society, including drug addicts, if we accept defeat and legalise drugs.  If we do so, we are sending a clear message that we should legalise any form of criminal activity the resolution of which has <Col N="664" /> defeated us.  More people would use drugs if they were freely available.  It would be better to make drugs illegal if this would stop one person from using them.</P>
    <P>I welcome this comprehensive Bill. Drug trafficking is a profitable game because there is a demand for drugs and we should tackle this problem.  As a responsible member of the international community we should look at countries where drugs are freely grown and exported.  Trade embargoes on such countries would be an effective way of informing them of the havoc they are wreaking on society.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious crimes.  Last year drugs worth over £7 million were seized in the west Cork area.  This is an indication of the lack of resources provided for those who are trying to fight crime.  Mr. Barry Galvin, a State solicitor, once said that west Cork was a haven for drug importation, and I am sure other areas are the same.  If that is the case, I fear what we do not know. The Bill is important, but resources are needed to implement the harsh rigours of the law on those who are blatantly flouting it at present.</P>
    <P>While the European Community is losing the battle against drugs, this problem could be overcome if resources were made available to the international police.  Ships are moving freely and if an international drugs body was established and there was proper liaison between all member states, it would help to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It was stated that the confiscation of property could be unconstitutional.  We should try to seize property and assets if they have been gained through illegal drug trafficking. Money laundering is also tackled in this Bill.  I welcome this because for too long people have gained by moving money illegally through states.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of this Bill is to stop, curtail or make unprofitable the illegal importation of drugs.  I am against removing the prohibition on drugs.  It would <Col N="665" /> serve no purpose and would send a clear signal to criminals in this country and abroad that if we are defeated we give in immediately.  We should never give that message to anyone involved in any form of crime.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and look forward to the other Stages.  This Bill will be successful if resources are provided. The proceeds from confiscation should be used to enforce this legislation.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will help to solve our problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  I agree with the Minister that it forms a vital part of the comprehensive programme of criminal law reform which she and her Department are undertaking. In conjunction with the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993, this Bill indicates the direction this Government intends to take in order to put our system of law and order back on the rails.</P>
      <P>Politicians are often accused of not listening to the public or responding to their concerns and suggestions as to how we could strengthen our laws, particularly in this area.  Our system of justice is held up to ridicule.  One sees known criminals parading on television and thumbing their noses at the justice system.  They are collecting social welfare although they have large amounts of money in bank accounts.  In one instance, a recipient of social welfare, a well known criminal in the Dublin area, had a local authority house in addition to a large and expensive private house in the suburbs. If we are not seen to right this kind of situation the public will rightly lose confidence in politicians and in our system of law and order.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that this Bill is draconian, though I am not sure exactly what those who made the claim mean. As far as I can see, this is sensible legislation. It sets out to deprive criminals of their ill-gotten gains.  I do not view that as draconian; I view it as sensible.  It is a welcome disincentive to those making profits on the backs of unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> It has already been said that we should not raise the total problem of drug abuse with this Minister.  However, as the problem overlaps into her Department I want to put on record my concern about the huge increase in drug abuse.  Senators have said that no small town remains untouched by the drug problem, though Dublin city and county, and other larger urban areas, share the bulk of the problem. A study carried out in 1962 reported that of the total admissions to hospitals in Dublin city and county, only 18 were for drug abuse.  Would that we were back in those halcyon days.  By 1971 there had been a three-fold increase in the number of drug abusers known to the Garda. A further study showed that the figure increased from 350 known abusers in 1969 to 940 in 1970.  This shows that we did not tackle the problem early enough or hoped it would go away.  Far from going away, however, drug abuse is ever on the increase and needs to be tackled by a specific and comprehensive programme.</P>
    <P>This legislation concentrates on what are referred to as the godfathers, more commonly known as drug dealers.  I have no fear about what the legislation is going to do, but in the general context of reducing dependency on illegal drugs, I do not know if this legislation will be worth anything because a 1991 report entitled The Government's Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse, stated that: &ldquo;The majority of persons charged in each city were drug offenders and not drug dealers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill is just one instrument and, while it is a vital one, will not make the kind of inroads we need to reduce dependency on illegal drugs and the related increase in crime.  The Minister knows that in urban areas a huge volume of crime is drug related and has to do with the cost of feeding drug dependency. I welcome the fact that this Bill will hit the drug dealers where it will hurt.  Unlike drug offenders, dealers have the expertise to escape the full rigours of the law and have shown themselves very capable of evading the legal process.  Taking money from their pockets is a more effective way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> I have been calling for a debate on drug abuse and I am going to abuse my position in this House by asking the Minister, with the Ministers for Health and Education to put vital pieces of legislation in place.  The 1991 report suggested the introduction of legislation to confiscate the proceeds of drug trafficking. That has now become a reality in this Bill but a number of other recommendations were made in the report, many in the education area.</P>
    <P>A three-pronged approach to drugs is required.  The first we are dealing with today is the confiscation of assets.  The second deals with education.  From my involvement in school boards of management I now that what was referred to as the pastoral care system in schools is now being broadened to include educational awareness of drug abuse.  Unless we follow up on the other suggestions in the report we will not make the necessary inroads into the problem.  Perhaps the Minister could take on board a third recommendation in the report, the need for informal education.  It stated:</P>
    <P>The Department of Education will continue to make full use of the funding available from the National Lottery under its youth and sports programme to ensure that adequate, attractive leisure activities exist for young people through the provision of sports and recreational facilities, supporting the activities of voluntary organisations and the establishment of special projects for the disadvantaged by the EC and voluntary organisations.  The various initiatives undertaken by Cospóir, with a view to increasing the general level of participation in sports and active leisure activities, will be supported and further developed.</P>
    <P>I live in a suburb of County Dublin which has a large young population. There is a very serious drug problem there, as in many inner city and suburban areas.  It is no mere coincidence that the increase in drug abuse among young people is linked, as the report suggests, to bad living conditions and unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> However, where that is not the socioeconomic profile of the user abuser, it is because kids are bored and hang around street corners since there are no leisure facilities in the area.  In the suburb I represent and in which I live, there are limited &mdash; perhaps non-existent &mdash; recreational facilities for teenagers.  That, allied to an unemployment rate of between 60 and 80 per cent in certain housing estates, means the area is a breeding ground for the continuation of the existing drug problem.  In conjunction with what the Department is doing, I ask the Minister to tackle the preventative side because it is only through reducing drug supply and demand that we will combat the problem.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the great work that Customs and Excise officials and the Garda Síochána are doing to reduce the supply of drugs coming on stream.  We must provide the Garda Síochána with whatever resources they need to ensure they can win the fight against drug abuse on the streets.  There must be an educational and rehabilitation programme to reduce demand; I do not know if such a programme is in place at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the proceeds from the confiscation of money. This was discussed in the Dáil when the Minister said that the proceeds could not be used for a specific purpose.  There would be no greater irony than if the proceeds of assets confiscated from drug dealers could be used for rehabilitation and drug treatment programmes.  That would send the correct message to the people we represent and to those who exploit unfortunate addicts.</P>
    <P>The Public Order Bill, which I welcomed although I did not get the opportunity to speak on it, and this Bill are the law reforms which our constituents have been seeking.  They want to live in peace and free from persecution by unruly mobs.  They want to know that their representatives are capable of legislating in such a way that our system of law and order is not held up to ridicule.  These two Bills are sensible, timely and welcome. On the other hand, speakers for <Col N="669" /> the liberal agenda suggest that they may be unconstitutional and probably invade civil liberties.  Such an attitude encourages the possibility that the first person who is arrested or whose assets are confiscated under this Bill will challenge the legislation on constitutional grounds.  I hope that will not be the case.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister has received the assurance of the Attorney General that the legislation is implementable.  I understand why Senator Norris raised the possibility of legalising drugs.  However, if we take a three pronged approach &mdash; legislation to confiscate the assets of drug dealers, an educational programme to reduce the number of young people who get involved with drugs and total support for our Customs and Excise personnel and the Garda Síochána in their fight to reduce the supply &mdash; we will not need to legalise drugs.  I welcome this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this legislation. I was a member of the national drugs co-ordinating committee in 1982. At that time I sought legislation which would permit the State to confiscate the ill-gotten gains of those who had benefited from drug trafficking and drug abuse &mdash; which would be more correctly termed &ldquo;life abuse&rdquo; because these people are killers in the true sense of the word. I am also glad there is renewed interest in the drug abuse problem in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the legislation will work.  For ten years I have listened to six Ministers for Justice speak of the impossibility of making legislation like this compatible with the Constitution.  Section 4 states that the standard proof required &ldquo;shall be that applicable in civil proceedings&rdquo;. When I discussed this issue with Ministers for Justice I was told it might be found to be offensive to the private property provisions in the Constitution. Like Senator McGennis, I hope that will not be the case, although people should be encouraged to test the constitutionality <Col N="670" /> of legislation.  Perhaps the Minister will explain how that hurdle will be overcome.</P>
    <P>There are a number of critical aspects to the drug abuse problem &mdash; supply, demand, detection and punishment. There is one certainty: the drugs problem will never be resolved by focusing on supply.  We have seen that on numerous occasions throughout the world.  In the golden triangle in Asia people involved in drugs trafficking were shot, killed and maimed.  In Columbia flame throwers and American bomber aeroplanes were used against drug traffickers but it did not stop them.  When things got bad a clever scientist in Amsterdam developed designer drugs.  In the last five years new designer drugs have been developed every six months.</P>
    <P>Any preventative programme which focuses on the danger of drugs and the fact that they might be life threatening will never be effective.  Drugs are no more life threatening than joyriding or climbing Ben Nevis in a snowstorm. Danger will not stop people taking drugs. The critical point is to focus on the moment when a young person is offered drugs.  We should focus on giving that person the confidence to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  There is a huge debate on how that might be done.  We are utterly and irresponsibly remiss in this area.</P>
    <P>It must be six or seven years since the EU recommendation that every school in Europe should have on its teaching staff a person with skill and support in drugs education.  Drugs education is one of those areas which people allocate to the schools.  The vast majority of teachers &mdash; 99.9 per cent &mdash; like 99 per cent of politicians would not know the difference between white talcum powder and heroin.  The teaching profession cannot be expected to take that task on board without any background, in-service education or preparation.  That must be recognised.</P>
    <P>The other question is, where do we begin?  I received a telephone call from a school principal in the city about three months ago; he was principal of a school in an area which I will not identify &mdash; it <Col N="671" /> has enough trouble.  He told me he was worried about drug abuse in his primary school.  The drug being used in the school was heroin.  He had evidence of that. People have a tendency to litigate and the difficulty for teachers, like gardaí, in dealing with such situations begins at that point.  Many people believe that once a problem is identified it is resolved.  From the teacher's point of view, the problem begins when it is identified.  He or she does not have the authority to accuse a child of abusing drugs.  If the principal involves the gardaí there is an element of breach of confidence inside the school and a risk to life and limb outside the school.</P>
    <P>In this instance, we advised the principal to raise the matter with the parents of the pupil involved.  That gave rise to a huge row during which the teacher was accused of making all sorts of allegations against the children in the family. Eventually we had to involve the gardaí confidentially.  The gardaí told us, off the record, that the family were pushers in the area and there was nothing they could do.  That child was aged between 12 and 13 years and was attending primary school.</P>
    <P>In a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme the interviewer spoke to drug addicts about their early experiences with drugs. Two of them made it clear that their first experience with heroin occurred when they were still at primary school.  I do not raise these issues to be sensational.  I have two reasons for doing so.  I wish to make it clear that drugs are a problem at primary level in certain areas and it is a problem that will never be addressed by telling children about the dangers of drugs. Young children would not be able to keep up with the changing names for heroin; every three or four months it is called a different name in different areas in the argot of the streets.  We must focus in on the child's capacity to say no to drugs, and that must begin at an early age.  It also implies a clear responsibility on parents, indeed on all of us, because it begins with the gateway drugs of tobacco and alcohol.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> In the early 1980s I worked with drug addicts and I never met a heroin addict who did not smoke tobacco; I never met a heroin addict whose first involvement in the misuse of addictive substances was not with tobacco.  In recent years I have met two addicts who were not smokers and I found that extraordinary.  We need to address the issue at that point.  I do not agree with the general view that gateway drugs immediately lead to others and there is plenty of evidence to show this is not the case.  I raise the point because children and young people should be in a position to make choices at different stages.  Any parent who believes their child can get through primary and post-primary school without being offered a number of opportunities to indulge in alcohol is living in cloud cuckoo land &mdash; although I meet them every day.  We need to address the problem at that level.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill which excites me most is that which finally nails down the international element of co-operation in the detection of drugs.  It has become necessary following the developments of the Maastricht Treaty and we must be careful about it.  The value of this legislation will be to people who live in the socio-economically deprived areas and who, despite the outside world thinking that everybody in the area is a criminal or a junkie, have to barricade their houses day and night and are afraid for their lives because of these terrorists who deal in drugs in their area.  Those people will feel there is now a new deterrent.</P>
    <P>The criminals who got away with it for a long time and were finally apprehended would have their ill-gotten gains to live on.  In the early 1980s criminals took great care not to be caught.  There was one famous case of a person who was finally convicted and the word around town about him was that &ldquo;Larry did not carry&rdquo; because he knew that if he carried the stuff could be found on him.  I will not identify anybody.  That was one case which went to court and was reported in court.  There was another case on the northside of Dublin where it was reckoned that the person who was convicted <Col N="673" /> was a millionaire and would live a comfortable life having served a jail sentence.  That has happened time and again over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there will be a constitutional challenge to elements in this Bill because it is the first defence that will be used by the first lawyer who deals with the provisions relating to confiscation following the declaration that a person has benefited from crime and having to prove the amount of benefit and seize the assets.  This will create problems down the line but it has to be tested.  I support the Government's decision to put forward this legislation and even if it is found to be unconstitutional this decision will stand to the Government's credit. We have been looking at this issue, talking about it and threatening to do something about it for at least ten or 12 years.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Department and the draftspersons involved in this legislation. I hope it works.  I have some doubts about it &mdash; as do others &mdash; but it is an honest effort to move forward.  There are people in communities in Dublin in particular who will feel that if these people are not caught until next year, at least when they are caught we can gain from their fancy houses and their money.  Many lives have been lost through drugs.  This Bill is an important move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has been introduced not before time.  We must put those who control the supply of drugs in a position where they can be brought to court and the assets they have accumulated through drug trafficking or through other serious crimes can be seized.  Many Irish citizens have been killed as a result of those other serious crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All too often it appears that when these people are brought before the courts they have no apparent means or livelihood yet they live in fine houses and have a standard of living few people enjoy. There has been a proliferation of crimes of violence and there is a need to have a full check on where the perpetrators live, the standard of living they enjoy and how <Col N="674" /> they come by the large amount of arms that seems to be available.</P>
    <P>When the test case goes to court it will be interesting to see how effective the legislation will be.  Lawyers will test this legislation in court and because these people have accumulated wealth illegally they will be able to buy the best lawyers. They will have better financial means to test this legislation than ordinary criminals or any other member of society who might wish to challenge it.  Legislation has been challenged in the past and, in some cases successfully, but the cost of these challenges has, in the main, been supported by money from organisations. It is only through these organisations. The criminals who have benefited from the illegal accumulation of wealth will challenge this legislation.  I hope the legislation is solid and if challenges are made that they can be fought all the way.</P>
    <P>There is an international implication whereby the people who make the most money in Ireland will be in contact with those who make the most money abroad and they will get together to fight any such legislation.  This has happened in the US, Germany and everywhere legislation has been introduced to eliminate the curse of drug trafficking and international crime.  Those who profit most from this have fought through the courts using constitutions. In certain cases Governments have been bought off by these international criminals.</P>
    <P>In Ireland there has undoubtedly been a huge increase in drug availability as can be seen in any city or town and many rural areas.  The number of people involved has grown substantially.  It has been suggested that much drug trafficking and pushing happens in deprived areas of Cork, Limerick and Dublin but the situation is the same in smaller towns and villages and country areas.</P>
    <P>Those involved come not only from deprived areas.  Some prominent people in Dublin have been heavy drug users.  It is well known that drugs can be made available in certain clubs and entertainment venues in Dublin and elsewhere. The Garda Drug Squad and the Department of Justice have tried to eliminate <Col N="675" /> these problems but they were not successful because there is an unlimited supply of drugs on the international market.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that legalising drugs might have an effect on drug barons and minimise the money they can accumulate.  I do not agree, because drugs are available from rich and poor countries.  The proposal is that certain so-called minor, non-addictive drugs be legalised.  That would involve many more people in the drug culture and they would progress from one drug to another.</P>
    <P>One problem encountered when travelling is the sight of so many young people who cannot be rehabilitated.  Outside every railway station in Europe there are &ldquo;spaced out&rdquo; addicts who can never recover.  I do not know how the international community can address that problem; we can only use our limited resources as best we can.</P>
    <P>This Bill will at least signal that this country will not allow drug traffickers to exploit unfortunate individuals.  Those who take drugs are the people most punished by society.  It is they who are caught, gaoled, and put into homes and who die of AIDS or other diseases arising from the misuse of drugs.  Those who supply drugs will often say they do not take drugs, they do not drink or smoke and are not involved; but they are the killers.  We should punish them severely, not the poor, basically innocent young people who have been dragged into this major problem.</P>
    <P>The other side of the problem is seen in the poorer areas of the world, in the poppy fields of the &ldquo;golden triangle&rdquo;. There is no point burning the fields to eliminate the problem, as some have suggested. The people who produce poppies make a poor living in dreadful circumstances. Unless they are provided with income substitution &mdash; agriculture or tourism, for instance &mdash; they will continue to grow and harvest poppies.</P>
    <P>We cannot put nets around our shores to limit the amount of drugs which can be brought in by sea.  It is virtually impossible to control the numbers <Col N="676" /> coming through airports or to restrict what may come in by container or car. We must compliment the Customs officers, the Department of Justice personnel and the gardaí for the major drug finds, especially in the last three years. Every drug haul affects the drug barons. They have paid cash for the drugs so they are most affected when the drugs are confiscated.</P>
    <P>We must examine the possibility of more rehabilitation centres for those who have become involved in drug abuse. However, that does not come within the provisions of this Bill.  It provides for our involvement in as many international conventions on the subject as possible and for the confiscation of proceeds from drug trafficking and other major crimes.</P>
    <P>Money laundering must also be carefully examined.  Someone may approach an Irish business person with a view to investing in that business.  Large sums of money are available for legal investment but it is often better to check the source of the money beforehand to ensure that this is not laundered.  There have been cases in Ireland in the past where laundered money was used to set up industry. We should not grab whatever money is available without examining its source.</P>
    <P>Switzerland is said to be the safest place for laundered money because bank accounts are kept secret.  The Swiss can be moralistic on other issues but their country has been the biggest centre for laundered money in the world, followed by Las Vegas, Atlantic City and the financial institutions on Wall Street.</P>
    <P>The Bill is being introduced as a result of the Vienna convention on drug trafficking at sea.  It is major legislation deserving the support of everyone in the State.  We should ensure the barons who kill hundreds of young people every year are put behind bars, where they belong. No one involved with them should ever be able to avail of the huge profits made by them.</P>

      <P>I add my voice to those welcoming the Bill; it is long overdue.  I come from an area which has its problems with drugs.  The emphasis in the Bill <Col N="677" /> makes it clear how seriously the Department has thought about solving the problem.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to deal with drugs trade barons who have large amounts of illegal money from laundering.  I welcome the stringent provisions in the Bill.  We should waste no time informing the public of what these regulations involve. The barons appear to benefit from &ldquo;light&rdquo; laws to make massive amounts of money by exploiting young people.  It is important to remember that 52 per cent of this country's population is under 25 years of age.</P>
      <P>For the first time, this Bill includes a provision for the confiscation of property. There have been many other less serious situations &mdash; for example money owing to the State &mdash; where property could be confiscated but at long last we are attacking the drug barons.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of Irish people are conservative and many can be discreet about their views but they want proper laws on the Statute Book.  The impression was given for too long that we were not on top of enforcement laws, particularly in relation to drugs and those involved in drug money laundering.  Nothing should be spared to deal with these people and the Bill is tough in this area.  At long last we are getting on top of the situation and saying, as a nation, that we are prepared to get tough.  I have spoken to many people who, directly or indirectly, know of people who distribute soft drugs in my area.  I have often asked about the situation and been told there is no legislation to deal with it.  Although it is generally known who these people are, nothing can be done about them.  That must change.  I hope the provisions in the Bill will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is that many pieces of legislation that go through both Houses are not fully implemented.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that all the ill-gotten gains of the drug baron will be put to useful purposes.  Any money confiscated should be utilised to tackle this problem and nobody would object to that because, from a social point of view, it would provide protection for young <Col N="678" /> people and the less well off in society.  It is a sad reflection on society that many people living below the poverty line appear to depend on drugs.</P>
    <P>There is a serious situation as regards people who are constantly on bail.  This Bill tightens up this area and creates the position where people may or may not be given bail.  This is to be welcomed.  It is good for the public to hear that people may not be granted bail.  In a small society, such as Ireland, where everybody knows everybody else, we can create an atmosphere that would make these people unwelcome.  At present, that is not the case.  If it is properly implemented and if finance is made available, I hope this Bill will change that.</P>
    <P>I know of many sad problems which have been created by drugs.  People below the poverty line are not the only offenders; people with higher living standards are also included.  We have a duty and a responsibility to inform everybody, particularly those in higher education, of the severe penalties provided in this Bill. People involved in drugs should not get the opportunity to use their resources to employ the best barristers to defend them.  I would welcome amendments which would make the provisions in the Bill more stringent in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will create a better Ireland.  It should be a better country. There is no reason that cannot be the case.  We have the resources, particularly customs personnel who are no longer required because of the Maastricht Treaty.  These people are willing, well informed and well trained.  I have seen their commitment over the last 12-18 months, particularly in the west Cork region.  They have put their lives at risk to ensure that no illegal drugs are transhipped through Ireland.  A few days ago, drugs, which were to be transhipped to Ireland, were found in a container on its way to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The amount of drugs coming into the country, especially along the south west coast where a quantity was found for transhipment to other countries, is a sad reflection on our society.  It is regrettable that drug barons are using Ireland as a <Col N="679" /> distribution area and I hope this Bill will ensure that this is not an ongoing development.</P>
    <P>The present drug trafficking does not make it easy for those living in affected areas, nor for those charged with the control of crime on the island of Ireland. For this reason I welcome the stringent laws set out in this Bill to deal with drug traffickers.</P>
    <P>It is most important that information be provided to the public on the implications set out in the Bill for those intending to break the law.  For too long knowledge of measures such as these has been restricted.  We should not be afraid at any time to publicly display in our libraries, local authority assemblies, courthouses and community areas the regulations contained in Bills such as this. Other Departments have become more open regarding their provisions and regulations. For example, the Department of Social Welfare now provides information on its activities and its welfare provisions and I have remarked upon this when addressing social welfare issues in the House.  The Minister and the Department are to be congratulated on this. Similarly, the Road Traffic Acts have led to widespread publicity on the implications of drink driving, publicity which rightly entails the expenditure of large sums of money.</P>
    <P>There is no reason the Department of Justice should not be more open.  The public should be advised on the meaning of drug trafficking laws and regulations. Similarly, for those using or pushing drugs, information should be made available as to the implications of these activities. For this reason the Minister should be ensuring publicity for the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Department of Justice on its circulation. Once the Bill is enacted, I hope that all of its provisions will be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Minister is earning his money today because I had the pleasure of listening to him in another <Col N="680" /> forum earlier as he expounded on a number of other Bills within his brief in his usual excellent way.  I am sure that this House will benefit from his response on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I agree with all the comments made on this Bill, and it is significant that it has been welcomed by all sides of the House. The Bill has been introduced in the context of our obligations as a member state of the EU.  As a peripheral state within the EU and with a large seaboard on the ocean between America and Europe, the opportunities for drug trafficking in Ireland will increase.  Within the context of the significant finds by various drug agencies operating worldwide in recent years and the general increase in drug trafficking, this Bill is timely.  Upon enactment, it should go some way towards alleviating the legal difficulties that our drug enforcement agencies have had in this country for several years.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the Bill is not a panacea for the international drug problems.  These problems will not be solved overnight following the enactment of this legislation.  However, it will send a message to the international drug cartels that Ireland is no longer, if it ever has been, a soft target in terms of landing drugs for onward trafficking to continental Europe.</P>
      <P>From the debate in the other House I am pleased that it has become evident that the Government is committed not only to introducing this Bill but to giving it effective resources to ensure that the various sections of the Bill will be enforced in so far as the resources of this country will allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome and pay tribute to the drug enforcement agencies in this country and in Europe, who have had some spectacular successes, it should be remembered that the detection of drug trafficking is generally the consequence more of chance and coincidence than real detective work.  This is not a criticism of the agencies concerned; but when one reads of the manner in which some of the more significant finds have initially been detected by the police forces of various countries, it gives an indication to the <Col N="681" /> ordinary layman such as myself of the difficulties facing our law enforcement agencies in detecting drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Such trafficking has become highly sophisticated.  In the last couple of weeks a programme on Ulster Television gave a reconstruction of one of the largest discoveries of drugs in the UK and Ireland, which had a street value of over £110 million.  The cocaine was landed in an obscure Scottish port where it was recovered by the authorities.  It would have caused immeasurable damage to our young people if it had been released onto the market.  The authorities also arrested the couriers involved.  Sadly, the godfather involved, who is a Scotsman, got away and continues to live somewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>The manner in which this case came to the attention of the customs officers in Scotland was as a result of a chance conversation which took place on one of the islands off the Spanish coast.  A local expatriate Englishman was discussing with a holidaymaker friend whom he had met the purchase of a boat sail by a Scotsman for a substantial sum of money. It happened that the holidaymaker he was talking to was a police officer who, on returning home, checked his data base and discovered that the name mentioned was of a well known drug traffic dealer.</P>
    <P>I recount this incident to inform the House that drug trafficking is a highly sophisticated business and that as many laws as possible should be passed as an obstacle to the continuance of this heinous crime.</P>
    <P>Regarding the measure dealing with the confiscation of assets, may I ask the Minister if he is satisfied that there will be sufficient resources to ensure that the assets are confiscated?  This refers to the following of the famous money trail.  I ask this because Members of the House will be aware of the extreme difficulty that Government inspectors had, with the full resources of the State behind them, in identifying the real owners of the Johnston Mooney and O'Brien site at Ballsbridge.  To this day the establishment of the owners of the site at any one time, through its sale and resale, is <Col N="682" /> not in the public domain.  In view of this, it will not be easy to locate and confiscate assets and perhaps the Minister would comment on this.</P>
    <P>Regarding the status of customs officers, I am aware, as is the House and the Minister, that there has been a continuing feud, perhaps not in the public domain but certainly behind the scenes, involving customs officers, who form the recently constituted national drugs squad.  These were customs officers who were surplus to requirements following the enactment of the Single European Act on 1 January 1993 and who were designated as having a particular function in the detection and follow up of drug traffickers.  However, their terms of reference or job description are in conflict with the agency designated to carry out that function, the Garda Síochána.  As a result of proposals contained in this Bill, customs officers have lobbied the Department for equal status to the Garda Síochána in regard to the power of arrest and follow up powers.  I understand the Department has resisted this.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter because it is of concern to customs officers.  Ireland is alone because it does not have a drug enforcement agency dedicated to the detection and the arrest of drug traffickers.  I appreciate that we do not have to follow Europe and that a system has evolved in this country.  I bring this matter to the Minister's attention and I would like clarification.  Customs officers would like to be on a par with the Garda Síochána. To a certain extent I sympathise with them, because they are involved in the area of drug detection and are in contact with European drug enforcement agencies, which are, I understand, customs rather than police forces.</P>
    <P>Members may be familiar with the recent television programme, &ldquo;The Chief&rdquo;, which is about a chief constable in a fictional area in south-east England. A number of recent programmes were devoted to drug addicts and drug trafficking. A particular episode highlighted the question of the status of customs officers vis-a-vis the police.  This story centred on a drug detection squad <Col N="683" /> attached to the UK customs and it was led by a determined lady operating a covert operation to flush out and arrest an industrialist suspected of drug trafficking between Britain and Holland.  In order to acquire evidence they mounted a surveillance operation at his factory.  With the assistance of the night porter, to whom they showed their identification and who believed their bona fides, they preceded to burgle the factory.  They found the evidence, but as they were leaving the alarm went off and the police were called.  A young policeman who saw the van coming towards him, stood in the middle of the road and was run over.  The local police treated the case as hit and run and burglary.  When it became evident an independent covert operation had been mounted by Customs and Excise, the police decided to prosecute customs officers on the basis that their patch had been interfered with and that there had been no liaison between customs officers and police.  That highlighted a difficulty which the Department of Justice might face if it transferred powers from the Garda to customs officers.</P>
    <P>I raise this issue because it has been brought to my attention.  I must declare an interest in this because my brother-in-law is a member of the Customs and Excise.  Although he is not involved in the drug area, he and his colleagues were partly responsible for a major drug bust in Rosslare one or two years ago.  Furthermore, my late brother-in-law was an employee of the French customs service. I have an interest in this area and I would like to hear the Minister reply.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill to the House, although it is astonishing that it has taken so long.  The public must look at the way drug dealers have been able to enjoy <Col N="684" /> money collected from young people in recent years.  I am not the only person who has bought a house and who has had to explain to the Revenue Commissioners where every pound came from.  How is it possible for drug dealers to spend and launder money so easily?  It is incomprehensible to me and, I suggest, to the public.</P>
      <P>Many important points were made by other speakers.  Senator Honan spoke about how the proceeds of drug should be spent.  Perhaps the Minister would direct moneys confiscated to areas affected by drugs.  The treatment of drug addiction is important, but it costs a great deal of money.  We have been involved in setting up satellite clinics around Dublin. These clinics have put drug addicts on methadone programmes, provided counselling and have managed to get those addicted to drugs off them.  The clinics are expensive to run because they need a large personnel and counselling service to help those addicted.  If possible money should be given to the Department of Health in order to improve these clinics so that those from whose misery this money has been made may kick the habit.</P>
      <P>There is a need for penal reform, and those involved in prisons insist on it. When the Department of Health has used the money it needs, money acquired from drug pushers could be used to help prisoners. It is interesting that there are so few grey heads in prisons today.  Most prisoners are young and come from poor backgrounds.  Drug pushers have taken everything from those with least.  Some people have said that if the drug problem was as bad in Foxrock as it is in the inner city, it would be dealt with.  Those in some inner city areas have little to hope for and see nothing wrong with becoming involved in drug addiction; momentary pleasure is all they see in their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prevention is important, and Senator O'Toole spoke about a lack of facilities for young people.  After we have spent money on the health service and on the rehabilitation of prisoners, we must spend some on prevention so as to tackle this problem.  We must improve facilities <Col N="685" /> for young people in the areas I spoke about.  Like Senator O'Toole, I will not name these areas, because once one names them it increases the stigmatisation of those living in them and makes life more unbearable for them.</P>
    <P>One rarely comes across a drug addict who has not been involved in alcohol abuse or smoking at a young age.  The sale of alcohol to under age people must be looked at by the Department.  This is a very serious problem and has been looked at by youth clubs and community groups all over the country.  It has been found that it is far too easy for young people to buy alcohol.  Often it is from alcohol, which is a drug, that people go on to become drug abusers.  This seems to be ignored when prevention is discussed. I urge the Minister to urge the Garda, who must act like social workers rather than guardians of the peace in many situations, to secure convictions, where possible, of those selling alcohol to underage children.  The Bill is to be commended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister.  The Bill deals with very serious offences.  We need to adapt our prison system to cope with the type of serious crime we have described today and which we are encountering more and more in everyday life.  Our prison system is, by its very definition, a finite resource.  There is only so much it can take and do.  We can build more prisons and have done so. The time has come to face the fact that in the foreseeable future, whatever about the long term, there will not be enough prison spaces to accommodate all the people the justice system is automatically sending to prison for the full period of their sentences.  People who commit serious crimes, often involving violence, are not serving sentences appropriate to the seriousness of their crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a way of coping with this challenge which does not involve building more prisons.  Better use should be made of the resources we have nowadays.  Use should be made of &mdash; and it is possible to adjust to this &mdash; the modern technology which is becoming available around the <Col N="686" /> world.  Our detention system is based on prison concepts which existed prior to the 20th century.  We are close to the 21st century but have not changed our attitude since the 19th century.  We lock people up to keep them out of trouble, often in degrading conditions with little prospect of rehabilitation.  We do this more or less regardless of the seriousness of the crime.  However, there is the possibility that modern technology may be able to give us the same results by means which are radically different to the ones we have used for centuries.  The future dungeon may be a digital one.  Electronic tagging may be used.  I am not an expert on this.  Tagging and similar techniques are being used around the world.  They make it possible to control a person's movements and behaviour as effectively as locking them up.  This system is used extensively in the United States.  It involves attaching a tagging system to a person's body to control the area in which he or she may stay.</P>
    <P>There are disadvantages to putting criminals in jail.  First, we often put them into an educational establishment for future criminals.  This is the degrading situation in which they can be placed. Secondly, we remove them from the very occupation which would perhaps have enabled them to rehabilitate themselves later.  Thirdly, we give them bed and breakfast, which the State pays for at a very expensive rate.  Using modern technology, there is a tagging system which could control the movements of somebody in an area, whether that area is a parish, a postal area or a Garda control district.  This could be an appropriate form of detention for those convicted of less serious crimes.  It would save the State the enormous expense of detaining them and, equally importantly, it would give the detainee a better chance of building a normal life again.  It would also free up space in the prison system for the small band of hardened, serious, professional criminals who are the main beneficiaries of the present constraints on resources. For the relatively small number of criminals who commit crimes over and over again and while on bail, violent crimes <Col N="687" /> and the kind of crimes covered by this Bill, the answer will always be to lock them up.  They should serve the full sentences the courts hand down to them, subject to remission for good behaviour. Serious criminals should not be released before time due to lack of space for them in our prison system.</P>
    <P>When we pass laws such as the one we are debating and when we talk about putting more resources into the criminal justice system, we should not just think in terms of more police and prisons.  We should also think of how we can use resources more smartly and use technology to extend the reach of those who work the system.  I am not convinced we have been doing this.  I am fairly convinced we have not changed our mindset from the one which says this is what we have done in the past and will continue to do in future.  Tomorrow's criminal justice system should be a marriage between highly professional people and very sophisticated technology.  I suggested tagging.  This is one system, but there are many variations of it which we could use.  We should realise that passing laws like this to cover new kinds of crime is only one part of the adaptation we have to do.</P>
    <P>Those who are more expert in prison systems will say there are three reasons for sentences.  Senator Henry referred to them.  Punishment is one.  Somebody who commits a crime needs to be punished. Rehabilitation is another.  A third reason is the protection of society from violent criminals.  The system of locking people up, which we have used for many years, manages to achieve two of these needs. It protects society and punishes people. It does not rehabilitate in the manner in which it is possible to do so.  We should adapt the system all the way along the line.</P>

    <Title>Teachers' Early Retirement Scheme: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>recognising the particular problems, demands, pressures and inherent stress on teachers;</P>
      <P>aware of the high incidence of disability and stress related illness among teachers;</P>
      <P>and noting that teaching is a profession which very often has a shorter than normal career span;</P>
      <P>calls on the Minister for Education to introduce, this year, an option of early retirement for teachers who have reached the age of 50 years.</P>
      <P>I consider the amendment to this motion to be a total and cowardly retreat under fire, a refusal by the Minister to deal with an issue.  I cannot disagree with the words of the amendment as they are from the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme.  However, I do not know see its relevance.  The amendment states &ldquo;that matters within the scope of the scheme will be dealt with exclusively through the machinery of the scheme&rdquo;.  I do not know anybody here who wants it to be dealt with any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> It also states &ldquo;that, in respect of any claim before the Conciliation Council, no party to the scheme shall, in furtherance of its case, move any outside body to make representations on its behalf;&rdquo;.  I do not know that any party to the scheme is moving this body to do anything on its behalf.  I am the general secretary of the INTO which is a party to the scheme. This is not coming from the INTO.  The other names to this motion &mdash; Senator Lee, Senator Norris, Senator Henry and Senator Quinn &mdash; are not members of any of the parties to the scheme and two of them are teachers at third level whose salary is not determined by the conciliation and arbitration scheme for first and second level teachers.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister is unable to be here.  My reason for putting down this motion is very clear.  The Minister has raised this issue time and again.  She gave a further commitment on early retirement in the Dáil and in December at the Select Committee on Social Affairs referred to the fact that the claim was at conciliation.  The Minister has on three or four occasions since April given a commitment on this issue.</P>
    <P>Teaching is a job with different kinds of stress and demands.  There is no question of teaching being unique as a stressful occupation; there are many stressful occupations.  However, teachers experience a different kind of stress where they know in the morning that five or six times over the course of the morning he or she will be brought to the brink of tolerance in terms of the limit of normal endurance and do not know from what corner of the room that challenge to their authority will come.</P>
    <P>Irish primary schools are the most overcrowded in Europe.  Post-primary schools and third level colleges have their own problems but at times primary teaching can often deteriorate into crowd control. This is an additional demand on teachers.  In recent times teachers have had to increasingly cope with the problems of home and community as they find their way into the classroom.  In overcrowded classrooms teachers must try to <Col N="690" /> identify and respond to the learning, growing and emotional problems of pupils on top of everything else during the course of the day.</P>
    <P>Teaching is a harrowing, demanding and wearing job, as are many other occupations. However, these occupations have ways of allowing people out of the job at particular times.  That outlet does not exist in the teaching profession and we and the officials in the Department often have to find ways around the system to allow teachers ways out through disability, etc., when there should be a clear and understood process of early retirement.</P>
    <P>Many teachers can continue for 40 years with constant energy output.  I want to make clear that this is not an ageist motion.  There are many people in their sixties or late fifties who are suited to the job and have the metabolism to continue. Therefore, I would be opposed to pressuring people to retire.  However, this motion is to give them the option.  The wear and tear of the job proves intolerable for many teachers who no longer have the vitality to cope with the professional demands of the job.</P>
    <P>Teachers deserve and demand the opportunity to retire from their teaching responsibilities with dignity and reasonable financial security.  That is not too much to ask for people who give of their all daily, and the Minister has recognised this.  Last Easter, the Minister indicated her support for the concept of early retirement.  She announced it at all three teacher congresses where it was well received.  The teachers were pleased to hear this commitment and the Minister received the applause and acclamation of delegates representing 50,000 teachers at first and second level; this was re-echoed in the third level institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister received the applause and acclamation and was very happy to indulge in it, to which she was entitled.  I was one of those who complimented her and we looked forward to a system being put in operation for 1 September.  That did not happen.  No proposal has been brought forward by the Minister so far. It would be disingenuous for her not to <Col N="691" /> address this problem urgently.  She must be as good as her word.  She was the person who raised the matter and now has a duty to fulfil her promises.  She has a responsibility to respond to the expectations which she gave teachers at the different congresses last year.</P>
    <P>In reference to the amendment, it is now clear that nothing came from the Minister.  The teachers' unions were required to submit a claim for an early retirement scheme in the hope of processing the matter.  That claim has been lying there for months and it has not been possible to get a response from the Minister.  I hoped she would come here tonight and fulfil her promises, and give reality to the expectations of teachers and allow this matter to go forward.</P>
    <P>This matter cannot be dealt with or negotiated in this forum.  In that sense, the amendment is tautologous and does not address the issue.  We want a commitment from the Minister that she will introduce what she said in a number of other fora she was going to do.  We need consummation of that promise.  We want to hear what she is going to do about it. This issue will not go away; it is a live issue among teachers at all levels.  They want to know what is going to happen. If the Minister visits the three teacher congresses at Easter this year, this will be the issue on which we will want a response.  I regret that she is not here to put forward her point of view.  I am not trying to demean the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward.  This issue began with the Minister.  When the Minister of State puts forward his viewpoint, I hope it will be a clear and unambiguous commitment on behalf of the Minister.  However, if the Minister was going to give this commitment, she would be here herself. Instead, she sent someone else to take the flak&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We are referring to people who take responsibility for classes at an early stage of their careers.  They are now in their fifties and sixties, but are still expected to have the same level of energy to deal with classes of 30-40 or <Col N="693" /> more.  Teachers are supposed to act like wise and prudent parents.  There would be serious questions asked if a parent in their mid to late fifties was to start taking responsibility for a family of 40.  A similar demand is being made on primary teachers every day of the week.  There should be a recognition of that kind of wear and tear; it is not any other job. Politicians prepare themselves to make a speech, trade unionists prepare themselves for a series of negotiations and actors psyche themselves to go on stage. No matter how they feel teachers have to put on a positive performance every day. They do not know from where the pressure will come.</P>
      <P>In light of the Minister's promises, I ask for a reasonable response in terms of an escape clause for teachers that would give them the option to leave the teaching profession with dignity and security. They should not have to prove they are disabled, for example, to get this entitlement. I hope the Minister of State gives a clear and unambiguous commitment to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion because it is a matter of common observation that the quality of life in teaching has declined over the last few decades. The challenges currently confronting teachers, especially the type that Senator O'Toole said leads to stress, have increased beyond all recognition compared with the time many of these teachers entered the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confirm Senator O'Toole's statements about the implications of the amendment.  The words &ldquo;no party to the scheme shall, in furtherance of its case, move any outside body to make representations on its behalf&rdquo;, baffle me as much as they baffle Senator O'Toole.  I reject the notion that this amendment imputes that those of us supporting this proposal are somehow parties to some type of outside quasi-conspiracy.  I, for one, was unaware of the terms of the conciliation council.  Even if I had been aware of them, I would not have taken the slightest notice of them for reasons I will give in a moment.  They seem to <Col N="694" /> virtually privatise an issue which is a matter of grave public concern.  I am speaking here solely on my own behalf and because I happen to believe in the merits of the case, not on behalf of any institution or organisation, and I am sure that is the case with the other Independent Senators too.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of common observation, perhaps worst of all in the cities but it is becoming increasingly so in rural areas, that teachers are obliged to confront sustained stressful situations in a manner inconceivable 30 years ago.  That will certainly have led to burn-out in a number of cases.  It is also commonly observed that a percentage of people in all occupations find that they have chosen the wrong career; they would not choose it if they were starting over, but there is no way out.  In many of those cases, whether in the public or private services, one can hide from the consequences, in other words, there is no direct spillover effect on other people.  However, a teacher who is in the wrong occupation continues, day after day, to teach.  If only 5 per cent of teachers made the wrong choice &mdash; a conservative estimate for any occupation &mdash; the consequences and the spinoffs on approximately 5 per cent of pupils at national or secondary level would be enormous.  That is a matter of concern for pupils and parents.</P>
    <P>The consequences of stress, disillusion and frustration are more directly felt by innocent parties in teaching than is the case in most other occupations.  If one works in an office, there are ways of being &ldquo;carried&rdquo; or of daydreaming one's way out of the situation but a teacher cannot do that because it would be quickly perceived by the pupils.  It is most unfortunate that they should occasionally have as role models adults who may be frustrated, bored, short of temper or genial disposition because of the circumstances they find themselves in.</P>
    <P>The implications of early retirement in teaching deserves to be seriously considered from the point of view of teachers, pupils and parents because they have knock-on effects.  These people cannot be good and effective teachers, <Col N="695" /> however much they try to commit and rededicate themselves as the years go by. From an intellectual, a character building, an emotional and other points of view, I find it difficult to understand how it can be in the public interest to oblige those in their fifties or sixties who feel they made the wrong decision to continue in that occupation.</P>
    <P>Those teachers, who are now in their fifties, chose teaching nearly 30 years ago when there were few alternatives and that would have increased the proportion of those who chose a career for which they were not suited.  We still oblige people to choose careers at an extraordinarily young age by international standards, when they were often intellectually and emotionally immature and are not able to make a mature judgment on the career path they wished to follow.  Shoving people in their early twenties into life career paths is fraught with a potential for disillusion and a sense of failure as one goes along.</P>
    <P>A sense of failure and a sense of frustration are demoralising feelings for those who experience them.  Regardless of the career we are pursuing and despite congenial appearances, we all have at some stage been afflicted with a sense of frustration and inadequacy.  Some of us may overcome that or, at least, give the impression of overcoming it more effectively than others.</P>
    <P>I share Senator O'Toole's feelings for teachers who do not like their job, who are switched off, who realise that they are not giving of their best and that they are not the people they used to be.  It is difficult to imagine the sense of frustration they must feel going in day after day as well as the sense that their pupils derive from their incapacity to convey the excitement of learning, which is something every child should have an opportunity to acquire in the course of their school years.  I strongly support the principle underlying this motion and I am glad to second Senator O'Toole's.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;recognising that the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers stipulate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that matters within the scope of the scheme will be dealt with exclusively through the machinery of the scheme;</P>
      <P>that, in respect of any claim before the Conciliation Council, no party to the scheme shall, in furtherance of its case, move any outside body to make representations on its behalf;</P>
      <P>notes that the teacher unions have submitted a joint claim to the Council seeking early retirement for teachers and that the matter is under discussion at the Council.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the amendment confirms that the three teacher unions have submitted a joint claim for early retirement.  I also welcome the fact that the amendment confirms that the claim is currently under discussion at the conciliation council.  In due course the claim will be determined through the conciliation and arbitration process.  The option of early retirement should be there for those teachers who have reached a stage where they are no longer able to cope with the stress and strain of teaching.  I earnestly hope that the outcome of the claim to which the amendment refers will result in that option becoming available to teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a general recognition that teaching is a demanding and stressful occupation.  There is also a recognition that the vast majority of teachers work extremely hard.  The perception of teaching as an occupation which involves only short hours and long holidays is no longer widespread.  Teachers at every level carry a heavy workload.  Preparation and correction can be time consuming.  Many teachers give time voluntarily to extra-curricular <Col N="697" /> activities such as games. Teaching is an occupation which demands much energy and commitment. Every school situation has its own problems and difficulties, which vary from school to school.  In any one school the problems and the difficulties can fluctuate and change from day to day.</P>
    <P>The sources of stress for teachers are many and varied.  Class size in Ireland is still very high.  Many school buildings are seriously substandard.  Many primary schools lack essential basic facilities such as a staff room or a telephone.  The majority of primary schools have no access to the services of a remedial teacher.  Some schools have seriously physically handicapped pupils in ordinary classroom situations with little or no support services.  Many pupils lack motivation and discipline is a growing problem.</P>
    <P>It is a recognised fact that domestic problems are on the increase, and domestic problems inevitably translate into classroom problems.  It would appear that there are now more broken homes and more difficult domestic situations in this country than at any time in the past.  All the indications are that child abuse is on the increase.  Crime and drug and substance abuse are widespread in many urban areas.  Poverty and unemployment create their own problems and difficulties. Teachers have to cope with the growing number of emotionally disturbed and disruptive pupils.  Bullying is another problem which appears to be on the increase.  It is small wonder therefore that some teachers burn out before they reach an age at which they can retire without suffering considerable financial loss.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases these teachers have no option but to struggle on.  Their work deteriorates, which has a consequential detrimental effect on their pupils.  The teacher realises that his or her performance is not up to scratch and this exacerbates the stress.  The realisation that he or she cannot retire without suffering considerable financial loss puts an additional strain on the teacher.  It would be much better for all concerned if such teachers could retire with dignity <Col N="698" /> even though they might have only reached the age of 50.  This is not possible now but it would be possible if an acceptable early retirement arrangement were put in place.</P>
    <P>I believe we are talking about a small minority of teachers and that such a scheme would have so many beneficial effects that it would more than justify the cost involved.  I also believe that the cost involved would not be great.  The cost implications of such a scheme should not be computed on the basis that all or almost all teachers would avail of the option of early retirement.  I am convinced this would not be the case.  A majority of teachers would continue to normal retirement age, but the option should be there for those teachers whose capacity to do a reasonable job has been adversely affected by the stresses inherent in teaching.  The availability of such an option would also have a beneficial impact on the morale of teachers generally.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there have been several welcome developments in recent times which will help to alleviate some of the problems to which I have referred. The pupil teacher ratio has been reduced and hopefully will continue to be reduced.  Many school buildings have been improved.  There are indications of a much increased provision for in-service education and training.  More remedial teachers are being appointed.  However, in spite of all these improvements, teaching will always be a demanding and stressful occupation.  There will always be teachers who will suffer premature burnout and that is why the option of early retirement is so important.</P>
    <P>The availability of early retirement would help enhance the attractiveness of teaching as a career.  We have to face the fact that teaching as a career is no longer as sought after as once was the case. Teachers are not seen as being well paid. Promotion and career opportunities are limited.  The status of the teacher in society has declined.  There was a time when teaching attracted the brightest and the best of our secondary school leavers, but this unfortunately is no longer the <Col N="699" /> case.  The number of male entrants to the teaching profession has been declining for a number of years.  These are all matters which need to be redressed.  Any development which would make teaching more attractive would be helpful in this regard and the introduction of the option of early retirement would certainly have this effect.  I look forward to a satisfactory outcome from the discussions which are taking place at the conciliation council.</P>

It diminishes the intent of the original motion.  It also casts a serious doubt over what the Minister intended when she travelled the country at Easter, taking wonderful applause for making that announcement at the teachers' conferences.  The announcement was warmly welcomed and teachers had looked forward to it for a long time.  It is therefore difficult to understand why this amendment has been proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I am disappointed with the way the whole thing has been handled this evening and I am entitled to register that disappointment.  Those of us who are in touch with the teaching profession know that they were all under the impression last Easter after their conferences that the Minister had decided to introduce early retirement for teachers in the near future.  That was the intent, that is what she said at the time, but it seems that the Department is now backtracking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been proposed to cast some doubt on what is happening. The Minister has the power to make these decisions herself.  To talk about conciliation and arbitration in these terms does not make any sense whatsoever.  I am supporting the motion fully and calling on the Minister here this evening to deliver the goods now.  She accepted the applause gracefully during the conferences and she got a wonderful press. That announcement was one of the central reasons for the wonderful press she received last Easter.  Teachers were very pleased, because many teachers would like to have the option to retire at the age of 50 or thereabouts.  They are continually telling us that.  I was at a teachers' meeting last night in Monaghan town and that was one of the things they mentioned. They would like to have the option to retire.  Family circumstances might mean they would have to stay a bit <Col N="701" /> longer, but if the option was there it would improve the mental health of teachers, because many of them in both the primary and the post primary sectors are under extreme stress.</P>
    <P>The stresses and strains which accumulate over the years are enormous and any of us who have been in teaching &mdash; many of us in this House have been teachers &mdash; will agree with that.  Society has changed and greater emphasis is now put on education. Parents have greater aspirations for their children, which is good, but it adds up to incredible pressure on the teacher.  In both Houses you hear regularly that educational attainment is regarded as the saviour of the nation. That message is going out in every Government programme produced these days: if we manage our educational affairs properly and educate our children to the highest possible level we will have social and economic progress; and if we do not, then we will not.  This means that from the first day our children go to school parents keep a close eye on them and see that they are getting the very best attention so that they will get the best results in their leaving certificate.  That is the target now from the age of four, because it opens or closes the gate for a child when they reach that level.  Incredible pressure is associated with the leaving certificate and the points system.  This has transferred right down to infants' class in national schools.  It is good that people recognise that.  They recognise that a quality education implies a good teaching environment and a teacher who is comfortable and relaxed and who has good mental health.</P>
    <P>Because of the stresses and strains in today's society, many teachers when they reach the middle years have grave difficulty in maintaining any sort of energetic and even handed approach towards the business of educating children.  The Jamie Bulger case is a perfect illustration of how society has changed.  It is an extreme example to take, but Jamie Bulger was murdered by two ten year olds.  Children aged eight, nine, ten or 11 years regularly appear in court in this country.  These children are in somebody's <Col N="702" /> classroom.  It causes teachers emotional distress to be faced with big classes.  Ireland has the biggest class sizes in the developed EU countries.  Facing those problems, it is very difficult to handle a big class.</P>
    <P>The fact that teachers go to work every morning is quite incredible, given the conditions they work in.  I was in Urbleshanny school on Monday.  The school was built in 1932.  The classrooms are small and the lighting is bad.  They have just the four walls and no facilities.  The new curriculum is not taught in Urbleshanny national school because it is impossible to teach it.  That is the situation all over County Monaghan and all over the country.</P>
    <P>The teacher in Ireland is expected to be a manager of two football teams or more.  I have walked into classrooms where there were 38 students, and yet we talk about the pupil-teacher ratio coming down.  The pupil-teacher ratio in Ireland is the highest pupil-teacher ratio in the developed part of Europe.  In the rest of Europe pupil-teacher ratios are 11 to one, 15 to one or 16 to one.  In Ireland we talk about a ratio of 28 to one, but in fact it translates into 38 children in a class.  The same problems exist at post primary level.  There is a school in my constituency built for 150 students, with toilets for 150 students.  There are 360 pupils there now; they are virtually teaching in the toilets.  The stresses and strains are incredible under normal conditions, but when bad working conditions are added the problems are greater.</P>
    <P>I support this motion.  I hope the House will accept it and that the Minister will give us a positive response.</P>

      <P>I want to apologise for the absence of the Minister. This motion was submitted on Thursday last.  The Minister is unavoidably absent because she had prior commitments.  She is not deliberately missing from the House.  Referring to the applause at the teachers' conferences, which has been mentioned several times, I hope and am confident that the same applause will be <Col N="703" /> available to the Minister this year when they hear her very constructive comments at the round of conferences in the near future.</P>
      <P>The three teacher unions have submitted a joint claim to the Conciliation Council for Teachers seeking that teachers be entitled to retire from teaching service on a pension from 50 years of age on the basis of accrued pension with ten years' enhancement.  The claim is being considered in accordance with the provisions of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for teachers.  The parties to the schemes are the Ministers for Education and Finance, the managerial authorities of primary and post-primary schools and the three teachers' unions.</P>
      <P>The terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers stipulate that matters within the scope of the scheme will be dealt with exclusively through the machinery of the scheme, that in respect of a claim before the conciliation council, no party to the scheme shall in furtherance of its case move any outside body to make representations on its behalf and that the proceedings of the council are confidential and that no statements concerning them may be issued except with the authority of the council.</P>
      <P>I know that Members will accept that in these circumstances it would be against the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers to comment on the possible outcome of negotiations on a claim currently before the council.  I can, for the information of the House, outline the present position in relation to the retirement of teachers.  Under the existing retirement provisions the pension arrangements for national school teachers are governed by the national school teachers superannuation schemes, 1934 to 1972.  All permanent teachers must join the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pension arrangements for teachers in secondary, community and comprehensive schools are governed by the secondary teachers superannuation schemes, 1929 to 1972.  This is a voluntary scheme.  About three-quarters of the secondary <Col N="704" /> teachers are members of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The pension arrangements of vocational school teachers are governed by the local government superannuation scheme, which is administered by the Department of the Environment.  Membership is compulsory.  The superannuation of vocational teachers cannot be discussed within the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers.  Any proposal for an amendment of the teachers' schemes would have to involve discussions with the Department of the Environment.  All three schemes are contributory, that is, there is a 5 per cent deduction from salaries in the case of all teachers who are members of the schemes.  They are non-funded schemes, in other words, employees' and employers' contributions are not paid into a separate fund to which superannuation benefits could be charged. Instead, remuneration is paid net of the employee's contribution and the full cost of benefits is met from recurrent expenditure in the same way as the remuneration of serving teachers.</P>
    <P>All three superannuation schemes are part of the wider provision for public service superannuation and changes must be considered in that context.  Improved early retirement arrangements for teachers, apart from being costly, would be likely to have repercussive effects for other public servants which could result in large increases in public service expenditure. Consequently, the Department of Finance has a crucial role in considering changes.</P>
    <P>The standard pension is calculated at one eightieth of retiring pensionable salary for each year of reckonable service subject to a maximum of 40 years; the standard lump sum is calculated at three eightieths of retiring pensionable salary for each year of reckonable service up to a maximum of 40 years.</P>
    <P>Under the current superannuation provisions for national, secondary, community and comprehensive school teachers, teachers may receive the following awards on retiring.  A teacher who has reached the age of compulsory retirement, <Col N="705" /> which is the end of the school year following his or her 65th birthday, may receive a lump sum based on actual pensionable service and retiring salary.  A pension and lump sum are paid to a teacher who satisfies the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance that while in the teaching service he or she has become incapable from infirmity of mind or body of discharging the duties of a teacher and that such infirmity is likely to be permanent.  Notional years may be added to actual pensionable service in calculating pension and lump sum. The maximum is ten years but this applies only to a teacher with ten years' service. For teachers with more than 20 years service the maximum is six and two-third years.  However, years cannot be added to give teachers more service than they would have had if they continued in service until they could retire voluntarily. Thus a national teacher aged 55 with 35 years' service could not get any added years.</P>
    <P>A teacher who has reached 60 years of age and has at least five years of pensionable service may receive a pension and lump sum.  In times gone by the pensionable salary of teachers retiring voluntarily was averaged over three years in a way that was less favourable than for those at compulsory retirement age.  This disincentive has been ended.</P>
    <P>In the national teachers' scheme there is a further provision allowing for retirement at 55 years of age where the teacher has at least 35 years' pensionable service. Averaging of scale salary occurs where a teacher has not held the same salary point over the last three years of pensionable service.  The averaging method used nowadays is more favourable than that which operated some years ago.  &ldquo;Ineffective&rdquo; teachers may retire with a pension based on actual service from the age of 50 at the Minister's discretion.  In recent years there has not been recourse to these arrangements.</P>
    <P>A teacher with at least five years' pensionable service who leaves without immediate entitlement to a pension may get a pension and lump sum from the age of 60 based on actual service and the <Col N="706" /> uprated equivalent of retiring pensionable salary.</P>
    <P>A teacher may resign and transfer accrued superannuation entitlements to another employment, within certain limits.  Facilities exist to enable teachers to carry accrued pension rights to and from approved organisations or services. These include the Civil Service, Garda Síochána, Defence Forces, universities, local authorities, health boards and most State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>A teacher who retires on grounds of ill health with less than five years' pensionable service may be awarded a disablement gratuity.  This is a once-off payment calculated by reference to service and retiring pensionable salary.  No pension is payable.  Short service gratuity is now confined to teachers who retire or resign with less than five years' pensionable service.  They receive a short service gratuity which is a refund of the contributions paid to the pension scheme, less a deduction for tax.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to refer to the general issues of disability and stress which have been raised by Members of the House and which relate to arguments advanced by those seeking more favourable early retirement arrangements for teachers.  The crucial wording on eligibility for disability pension is &ldquo;when a teacher becomes incapable from infirmity of mind or body from discharging the duties of a teacher&rdquo;. Thus a teacher may qualify for a disability pension while capable of taking on alternative employment.  Disability pensions are subject to periodic review, but only up to the age of 50.</P>
    <P>The wording of the provision for disability pension and the trends in implementing it in recent years might suggest that stress and burn-out, to the extent that they can be objectively established, should be dealt with as disabilities and qualify for disability pension.  While the existence of stress and burn-out has been acknowledged in general terms, establishing it in a specific case with the degree of confidence needed to approve a public service pension would not be easy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> A feature of conditions for disability pension is the provision allowing a pension and lump sum to be reduced if it is considered that the teacher contributed to the disability.  It would be important, therefore, to distinguish the teacher who reaches a certain condition for reasons outside his or her control, such as illness, disease or clinical stress, from the teacher who is ineffective because of laziness, alcoholism, private interests or lack of interest.  It would be unfair and unwise to reward the latter type of teacher with early retirement with enhanced benefits which are denied to the efficient and hard working teacher.  This would be a good example of a perverse incentive.</P>
    <P>Establishing inefficiency generally is an educational issue to be dealt with through a process involving the school principal, the board of management, the inspectorate and the Minister.  On the other hand, establishing stress as a justification for special treatment would seem to be a medical issue which should be left to the medical profession.  Such an approach if adopted would suggest that a clear distinction should be made between medical and non-medical reasons.</P>
    <P>Any demanding job will have its quota of stress and teaching is no exception. Some stress factors in teaching would be shared by other occupations, such as accountability for performance or the obligation to be available for duty at prescribed times whether this is convenient.  Stress can also be related to features peculiar to the particular case, such as the physical conditions in the workplace and the temperaments of others with whom one works.</P>
    <P>Early retirement is not the only response to the teacher in difficulty and it should not be the first response. Indeed, in a survey carried out recently on behalf of the Council of Teachers Unions on stress in teaching, teachers themselves identified 16 strategies to overcome stress but did not include early retirement among them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Alyward Mr. Alyward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alyward</NameTxt>
      <P>The first response should be to support the teacher through in-service training, peer group support, better facilities in schools, improved codes of conduct for students, selective counselling for teachers, a welfare service for teachers, more secretarial services, etc.  Senator O'Toole also mentioned these matters.  There have been substantial improvements in a number of these areas over the past few years and further improvements are in prospect.</P>
      <P>Teaching has its own particular stress factors.  First among these must be the demand that a teacher must be on the alert with his or her class every moment of class time.  A teacher in front of a class has little time to relax.  Related to this is the particular types of demands which students make on a teacher, the noise levels, the disturbance levels, the application of rules which must often be there to enable the day-to-day operation of a class or school to take place, etc.</P>
      <P>Often it may seem to teachers that their situation has worsened in recent times.  Perhaps the biggest change has been in matters of discipline.  This is not a matter of the abolition of corporal punishment, but of the fact that children today are less submissive and thus less amenable than they were in the past. Allied to this has been the greater interest and thus the greater demands made by parents.  In the past the teacher may have been one of the few educated people in his or her area.  Today teachers must contend with the fact that some parents are more highly educated than many teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have also been curricular changes which have imposed demands on teachers in terms of updating their knowledge and skills.  Classes are large by European standards.  If this is so, there are areas in which stress has been lessened in recent times.  In a recent survey commissioned by the three teachers unions, to which I have already referred, reducing the pupil/teacher ratio was identified by teachers as the principal action to combat sources of stress in teachers. Beginning in 1960 there has been an improvement in class sizes in primary <Col N="709" /> schools and today's classes are considerably smaller than those of 20 or 30 years ago.  The target for the pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools under the Programme for a Partnership Government is 22: 1 which will represent a reduction of 19 per cent over a period of seven years.</P>
    <P>Specialisms have been developed within the teaching force, such as remedial teachers, guidance teachers, home, school and community liaison teachers, teachers for children with handicaps and visiting teachers for children with certain impairments.  These are supports for the class teachers.</P>
    <P>Not all curricular change leads to further stress.  The 1971 curriculum in primary schools has provided teachers with freedom and flexibility and the challenges it presents should be much more a matter of excitement than stress.  At post-primary level the new junior certificate syllabuses have been devised with the full involvement of the teachers.  The increase in the number of levels in all subjects enables teachers to allow for differences in abilities as opposed to trying to cater for all ability levels within the same course.</P>
    <P>The conditions in which teachers work have also improved greatly over the years.  Many more teachers now work in bright, spacious, modern classrooms than they did years ago.  Schools often have additional facilities that did not exist before.  The length of the primary school year in Ireland, which was 200 days some decades ago, is now at 184 days minimum, shorter than in most other European countries.  The effective length of the post-primary school year &mdash; 168 &mdash; is considerably shorter again.  A relevant factor in regard to occupational stress must be the amount of time one has to spend on the job.  By comparison with other occupations it must be conceded that the teachers' working year and working day are relatively short.  Teachers in Ireland work a shorter year and consequently have longer vacations than their counterparts in most other European Union countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> A particular difference between schools today and those some years ago and one with special relevance to the matter of stress is the change in relationships. Few elements in a work situation can contribute so much to stress as tension in this sphere.  Yet the old authoritarian relationship between manager and teacher or between inspector and teacher is now almost entirely a thing of the past.  Teachers are no longer subject to the same type of consorious scrutiny in their work by inspectors as they may often have been formerly.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in trying to measure stress at different times and in different individuals is to know when like is being measured with like.  In former times, there was a relatively greater degree of harshness about the features of life and when people may have been more submissive, many things may have been endured as part of the nature of things which people nowadays would be unwilling to suffer or would consider themselves stressed if they did have to put up with them.  This may be relevant to assertions that teachers are having to have recourse to retirement earlier than heretofore.  People may consider they have a choice not to have to accept things which many, in times past, would have put up with, patiently or otherwise.  So increased recourse to earlier retirement does not necessarily imply that greater stress is being experienced.</P>
    <P>As stress is, in effect, an occupational hazard, the salary paid for a job should take account of the stress level.  So it is in respect of teaching.  In the case of the last special pay increase awarded to teachers at arbitration, the teachers unions put forward arguments related to increasing levels of stress in the profession. The arbitrator in making his award stated that he had taken into consideration all factors put before him.  This leaves the question of how people cope with stress.  If there is stress in teaching today &mdash; and teaching would not be a challenging profession if there was no stress &mdash; perhaps teachers need to be helped to cope with it.  We all, including <Col N="711" /> politicians, meet stress and the important thing is to know how to manage it.</P>
    <P>I made a brief reference earlier to a welfare service for teachers as one of the means of providing support for teachers experiencing difficulties.  I am happy to say that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> provides that the current discussions on the question of a welfare service for teachers will be concluded at the earliest possible date and proposals will be brought forward for the establishment of a welfare service.  There is abundant material available about coping with stress in relation to work.  An approach to the issue among teachers might be to try to tap into this material and perhaps to engage people with skills in stress management as part of the planned major development in in-service training for teachers.  Again it is worth noting that in the survey of teachers I mentioned earlier, teachers accorded a high priority to in-service training as an action to combat sources of stress.</P>
    <P>Stress, to some extent, has become a buzz word, as if the existence of stress was due entirely to technological and other changes in society.  As I have already indicated, it is not as if stress did not exist in the past.  What is clearly different is the constant publicity, media and otherwise, sought and given to stress.  Public agitation can be a double-edged sword. Attention, so won, invariably concentrates on the negative aspects of an occupation, whether it be that of a nurse, a garda or a teacher.  Constant focusing on the negative runs the risk of reducing the status of teaching as an occupation, lowering the esteem and morale of those in the profession and diminishing the attractiveness of the profession to those contemplating teaching as a career.</P>
    <P>The issue of early retirement is a matter in the first instance for discussion and resolution by the parties who share responsibility for the operation and administration of the school system. These parties have agreed that the Conciliation Council for Teachers is the appropriate forum for dealing with matters such as this in a rational and considered <Col N="712" /> manner.  I believe that all of us should agree that the competence and jurisdiction of the council has to be preserved and respected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I know he is a very decent person. However, on his performance this evening, when he was obviously ventriloquised by advisers, I would give him approximately six for reading, but whoever created this script would get three for composition.  It is a hopeless piece of rubbish in my opinion with some ludicrous <i>double entendres.</i>  No teacher <Col N="713" /> would get away with a phrase about how much time is spent on the job without a sniggering group of pupils in a class.  I would like to point to a paragraph which I find quite astonishing:</P>
    <P>It would be important, therefore, to distinguish the teacher who reaches a certain condition for reasons outside his or her control, such as illness, disease or clinical stress, from the teacher who is ineffective because of laziness, alcoholism, private interests or simple lack of interest.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a whole series of <i>non sequiturs</i> there.  Does the Minister believe that alcoholism is not a disease? Does the Minister not believe that a caring employer ought to intervene in a situation of alcoholism?  Is alcoholism not frequently a response to the kind of stress one meets in the teaching profession?  I do not wish to blackguard my colleagues and I do not even want to specify my own department, but if I look around me in university circles &mdash; and I am not even confining myself to my own university &mdash; not only in Ireland but in America and Europe as well, I see friends and colleagues who suffer from alcoholism, who have drug problems, marital problems, nervous breakdowns and some have committed suicide.  That is a fairly clear response to stress.  I would say that stress is a very real issue for all members of the teaching profession, including third level.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, alcoholism is a disease and is not something that is chosen.  The Minister establishes an artificial distinction between reasons that are &ldquo;outside his or her control&rdquo; and others such as &ldquo;laziness, alcoholism, private interests&rdquo; etc.  Alcoholism is not within the control of the individual unless a caring employer intervenes as they should.  There may well be circumstances in which somebody suffering from the disease of alcoholism &mdash; even if the Minister does not appear to recognise the disease &mdash; should be permitted to withdraw.  May I ask the Minister &mdash; or may I ask the puppeteers through the Minister &mdash; whether it is believed in the Department of Education that an alcoholic teacher is a good teacher <Col N="714" /> or should they not be permitted to get out of the system?  It seems to be implied there that you simply keep alcoholic teachers almost in a kind of vindictive situation.</P>
    <P>I have to declare a certain interest in this because I am a teacher at third level. I am glad to see that the motion, as framed, covers all levels of teaching &mdash; primary, secondary and third level.  I love teaching.  I thoroughly enjoy it partly because I am an egomaniac and partly because I regard teaching as a performance art.  I started teaching when I was 22 or 23 years old.  I came into the profession after being an under-graduate and I was given a heavy workload.  I was thrilled because I thought it was a vote of confidence in me, although it did not help with research.  If I were to continue teaching until the age of 65, I would have taught for about 43 years.  It is my stated ambition to get out at the age of 55 by which stage I will have contributed about 33 years.  Jesus Christ accomplished his life's work and miracles in 33 years; I wonder what the university system and the Minister expect to extract from me by attempting to compel me to continue for ten additional miraculous years.</P>

      <P>The Senator is right; I was not.  I enjoy teaching and always have. However, if one has taught for a considerable time it becomes increasingly difficult to adapt to the rapid process of change.  The universities, for example, are going through a process of modularisation. The obituary of a distinguished professor of classics who was a connection of mine, although not a blood relation, queried, among other things, whether such a brilliant research mind and superb teacher would have been able to survive in a world of modularisation, semesterisation and so forth. <Col N="715" /> It is sometimes difficult to adapt to a system &mdash; and what I consider its increasing inflexibility for the teacher &mdash; which is intended to produce greater flexibility for the students.</P>
      <P>There should be an early retirement option.  People who wish to retire at the age of 50 should be permitted to do so. What is the point in keeping them if they do not wish to continue?  How will they be good teachers?  How will they transmit to the students the love of and interest in their subject which they felt at one time if they must continually reiterate the same material every year and set examination questions on that material?  Taking repeat examinations and special examinations into account, one may find oneself setting examination questions on the same material four or five times a year. In the extreme case of five times in the year, one can multiply that by 40 and arrive at 200 questions to be extracted from, for example, the works of D.H. Lawrence or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Teaching should be a vocation.  If it ceases to be a vocation the teacher, in the interest of not only himself or herself but also the students, should be given the option of retirement.  There is a nasty, parsimonious, accounting mentality which, if one retires before the age of 60 or 65, creates what is called an &ldquo;abatement&rdquo; of the pension so that one is docked part of the pension for every month.  This is a mean minded approach to what should be a joyful profession and vocation.

He is not concerned about raising this money.  His only concern is propagandising for his membership and attacking somebody who is not here.  The Senator knows why the Minister could not be here.

      <P>Large classes, disturbed pupils and the greater expectations of <Col N="721" /> parents with a wider curriculum to cover than in the past teachers have a great sense of frustration at not having any form of advancement or a recognition of achievement, but all these sources of stress so not necessarily need the remedy of early retirement and the Minister alluded to this.</P>
      <P>With regard to large classes, the Government is going a long way to reducing the pupil teacher ratio.  Nobody can deny that with a reduced number of children in the class a teacher's ability to communicate with each child and to give each child a little extra attention is greatly enhanced.  The Government is committed to further reduce of pupils in classes the element of stress will, in time, be reduced.  With disturbed pupils who come largely from disturbed homes and backgrounds there is a wider range of services available to schools in the form of remedial teachers and visiting experts and there are facilities where children can go to be assessed.  Problem children can thus have their problems identified and isolated and, in many cases, remedied.</P>
      <P>Parents did not have the same expectations 40 or 50 years ago as parents of today.  Some parents who did not have a great education wanted that lack remedied for their children.  Greater liaison between parents and teachers in putting some of the onus on the parents.  I recommend that the Minister takes note of the report of the National Education Convention which recommends a more flexible role for senior teachers.  This would do a great deal to relieve stress on senior teachers.  There could be a greater flexibility when there is a genuine need for a teacher to retire early so that the Department facilitates this need.</P>

      <P>I am happy to speak after the solid, middle of the road performance of Senator Kelly.  It would be more difficult to follow the eloquence, rhetoric and verbiage of Senator Norris <Col N="722" /> and the loquacious performance of Senator Magner who deviated from the motion.</P>
      <P>I support this motion.  I am another teacher who has witnessed a changing pattern in education over the years and the failure of successive Governments to meaningfully reduce class sizes, and the big changes in the curriculum, especially in recent times.  Teachers have, to say the least, a traumatic time and teaching is fast becoming a young person's occupation. Stress is the key word in the motion and it is the norm for teachers.  Demands come from all sides from the establishment of support groups for teachers under stress.  In the stereotyped reply from the Minister there is reference to some such structure.</P>
      <P>It is also accepted that stress is highest among older teachers and recently released figures from Woodchester Plan show clearly that most of the classes in the loss of salary protection schemes are from teachers in stress related areas.  The cost is exorbitant and is unproductive. Teachers over 50 years are on the maximum salary.  They could easily be replaced by young teachers at the bottom of the scale at a lower overall cost to the Department and the State.</P>
      <P>Teaching is the least mobile of professions, caused by the so-called &ldquo;grandfather scale.&rdquo;  It takes 25 years to reach the maximum on the teachers' salary scale; no other professional group has such a structure.  If teachers were allowed to retire at 50 years of age it would open the door for thousands of unemployed young and not so young teachers to get into the classroom.  One of the most difficult jobs to get at present is a full-time teaching post.  I speak from experience as chairperson of the appointments board of a vocational education committee.  It is sad to witness at first hand the scramble for jobs by highly qualified young teachers, endowed with exceptional talents as they traverse the country to attend at interview after interview for teaching jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CVs are turned out by the score, holders of B.As, B.Comms, H.Dips and other qualifications vie for part-time <Col N="723" /> jobs.  I was given an example by a young teacher at an interview board who informed us they had applied for 30 positions and the Galway vocational education committee interview board was the first to call this teacher to an interview &mdash; and it was only for a part-time position for ten or 11 hours per week.  That gives an indication of the great difficulty facing young teachers at present.  Thousands of teachers are <i>in situ</i> in part-time teaching posts with no security of tenure.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for the Minister to set up proper structures for eligible part-time teachers and enshrined within it must be a proper superannuation pension scheme.  At present job sharing people retain their pension rights and a precedent has been established here.  It is now incumbent on the Minister to instruct the Department to set in train and adequate pension scheme for EPTs, that is eligible part-time teachers.</P>
    <P>The Department's failure to put in place a properly structured in-service system has accelerated stress related problems in a rapidly changing educational environment.  Much of the taxpayers' money is going in higher education grants to train new young educationalists more familiar with current changes but few of them ever get the chance to use their talents in a permanent post.  Volumes have been written and spoken about this topic but has there ever been a proper evaluation of the cost to the State, the benefit to the education system and the effects of unemployment on newly qualified graduates and trainee teachers?</P>
    <P>We have an ageing teaching profession all of whom have contributed nobly to the State and its youth.  One example is a school I know well, which currently has 47 full-time teachers, 32 of whom will retire within a ten year span under the present system.  Another school has 18 teachers of whom 11 will retire in a seven year span.  Meanwhile young gifted teachers have little or no chance of promotion in the present rigid system.</P>
    <P>Recent studies show a high percentage of teachers would retire if a proper <Col N="724" /> scheme was put in place.  There are obvious signs of low morale at the upper end of the teaching scale.  The National Education Convention highlighted many of these problems.  Repetitive motions to annual conventions relate to early retirement structures.  Over the years many Ministers for Education have promised to look at these matters but little has happened.  Action is now necessary.</P>
    <P>How many teachers get a maximum benefit from pensions at the age of 65? What is the average length of pension benefit to a retired teacher?  These are rhetorical questions.  Most teachers who are lucky to see 65 are burnt-out and are unable to enjoy a deserved break.  Is it fair to ask older teachers to implement totally new programmes?  Is it fair to the thousands of highly qualified young teachers to work below their full potential in part-time teaching jobs?  Some teachers are employed on building sites and in shops and, sadly but undoubtedly, some are on the dole.</P>
    <P>Any teacher who has given 25 or at most 30 years to teaching should be allowed to retire on full pension.  At present a teacher is expected to teach up to 45 years to qualify for full retirement benefit.  This is grossly unfair to the older teachers and equally unfair to the thousands of unemployed young teachers. The cliché says life begins at 50; I say teacher retirement should begin at 50, or at the latest at 55.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have waited a long time to speak and all the points seem to have been made.  However I will keep strictly to the topic, which is whether teachers should retire because of stress. We have ranged widely from that topic and I am now stressed from listening to all the points made.  Speakers should not have deviated so much from the motion, especially at this time in the evening. Perhaps the points could be made at another time on another topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers experience stress and there is need for early retirement.  I spoke this morning to colleagues at work about this motion and asked their opinion.  All of them agreed there should be an early <Col N="725" /> retirement option for teachers under stress but it should not be made compulsory. I dread the word &ldquo;stress&rdquo; because it is a buzz word used to describe every mood and illness that may affect us.  I am concerned that we are not taking our profession seriously.</P>
    <P>One reason for stress in teaching is that the format for discipline has changed.  My experience is that students now have a right to challenge the teacher on any subject, even if they are not qualified to do so.  Teachers cannot touch students; if they do they will be challenged by parents. In my school there was an argument in a classroom and a teacher touched a student.  Immediately the parents intervened and called in a solicitor.  The stress of that incident led the young teacher to decide to leave the profession.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level the parents' aspirations for their children cause stress. No one mentioned the points system, which is the biggest source of stress today.  At parent-teacher meetings we are confronted by parents saying how many points their child must get to enter a given course.  That puts dreadful pressure on teachers who feel inadequate if their students do not get enough points; the points system decides if they are good teachers.  The teacher may have a different philosophy and feel he or she is educating for life rather than serving the points system.</P>
    <P>I would not be entirely in favour of the early retirement option.  However, to deviate slightly, teachers have no options for mobility.  Often a teacher is in one staff room from the time he enters the profession until retirement.  That is not healthy.  Perhaps the option of mobility has not been considered by the conciliation council but it should.  Career breaks have not been mentioned either, and that is an equally good option. Teachers may not want to take early retirement.  It would be good if it was available; all the other options should be examined first but there are none at present.</P>
    <P>At present career breaks may depend on subjects, on individual teachers and whether there is a replacement teacher. <Col N="726" /> That option should be open and easily available.  It was said this evening that many young teachers are waiting to enter the system.  If we had mobility and career breaks those young teachers could be used.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not provide an answer to the question whether there should be early retirement but he may be unable to do so because we are in the middle of negotiations.  That is the path we should follow.  Teachers have made submissions to my union, the Teachers' Union of Ireland.  I want that union to negotiate for me; I do not want to carry on negotiations for them.  We want the Minister to know that.  There is support for using the machinery and asking the Minister to put it into action.  The teachers' conferences will take place in two months time and they will develop the matter further.</P>
    <P>All the options should be considered. The question is whether there should be early retirement because of stress.  We should examine if there should be ways for teachers to overcome the stress.  We should not confine the question to that narrow issue.  I ask the Minister to make those points at the Easter conferences.  I want my union to discuss those issues.</P>
    <P>One Senator mentioned illnesses and said alcoholism might not be an illness. It is a huge stress factor; we have all heard the phrase: &ldquo;it would drive you to drink&rdquo;.  Alcoholism should be seen as an illness rather than resulting from stress in the school.  I agree with the motion but I believe the matter should go through the conciliation council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I wondered at the outset of Senator Ormonde's contribution if it would be necessary for me to speak at all because she appeared to be saying the right thing.  She made good points but, as she said herself, she deviated from the <Col N="727" /> subject.  The main point is whether people who vote against this motion are so doing in the interests of party politics rather than teachers and their pupils. That is the bottom line.  Would a motion of this nature be put before the Seanad unless it was the considered opinion of teachers, and those in the profession generally, that it is reasonable to agree to the introduction of an early retirement scheme, and it is the considered opinion? In view of that fact, the Minister should not tell the House that he had any part in drawing up that document.  Senator Norris quoted from that document but I would not have the audacity to come into the House and talk about ineffectiveness due to laziness or alcoholism.  It is an insult to the teachers to make such references because the Minister of State did not analyse the causes of stress in schools.</P>
      <P>I was a member of a vocational committee for five years and I am aware of the stress and strain some teachers have to endure.  I am also aware of the situation in primary schools.  The Minister of State and his Department need to analyse the situation and realise that there has been a complete change in attitude. To a great extent there is no respect for authority and teachers must contend with that.  Is it right to say that teachers must continue after 24 or 30 years service in a difficult job which has become more difficult as time passed?</P>
      <P>Regarding the pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools, the fact that there has been such a diabolical ratio has largely contributed to the stress and strain on many teachers.  Teachers have other problems, such as the capitation system of payment to primary schools which should be urgently addressed.  As regards the amount of work that has to be done in the area of adult literacy, that is an indictment of the Department's policy in this area of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said there is an abundance of material available about coping with stress in relation to work and an approach to the issue among teachers might be to try to tap into this material and perhaps to engage people's skills.  I <Col N="728" /> did not think that the Minister of State would address the House with that type of lingo.  If we recognise that due to stress and strain there are teachers who cannot cope with the situation and want early retirement at 50, that is reasonable.  Does the Minister think that people who are associated with and who represent teachers would put down a motion of this type without good grounds and without the support of teachers?  The point was made that stress has become a buzz word. That is an insult because the Minister of State knows there is a major problem and that the solution is at least to provide the option of retiring at 50.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde made a good point; there should be an opportunity to opt out for a year or two but that is not available. I discussed this matter with teachers before this motion and they said that would be a help.  The Minister of State has not addressed this problem but he said there is machinery for conciliation. He used most of his speech to tell the House what is already available by way of superannuation or retirement through disability.  However, a person would almost need to be in a wheelchair to qualify.  The fact is that there is a major problem which must be addressed and it is reasonable to propose the option of early retirement for teachers.  That is why I support this motion and I ask other Members with common sense to do likewise.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, certain Members seem to think that I, or the Minister, could make a definitive statement here tonight.  That is not possible because of the constraints which are placed on the Minister, as on the other partners, in the conciliation and arbitration system.  That is a fact and we cannot breach it.  It is unfair for Senators to give that message.  We have no intention of breaking our part of the bargain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this motion.  I listened to the Minister's reply on a point of order.  We are aware of serious problems in primary schools due to teachers who have different types of problems. There is consultation and a mechanism to deal with these problems but for the majority of circumstances the system does not exist which would allow teachers to take early retirement and the children suffer as a result.</P>
      <P>As Senators, we cannot get details when asking questions but I would like the Minister of State to tell the House how many letters on files are piling up in his Department about teachers who have problems in primary schools and where parents, out of frustration, have moved their children to schools up to six miles away.  Such situations are causing the break up of parish communities and leading to people having no confidence in the boards of management in the schools concerned.  On the first and only time the Minister attended the conferences last year, she said she was in favour of introducing early retirement.  Why has there been such a long delay in introducing this system which is urgently required in such a stressful area?  I cannot understand it. Gardaí can retire after 30 years' service when they come to 50 years of age or a little older.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why these negotiations and the arbitration cannot be concluded, considering the serious problems existing in primary schools throughout the country, with the children as sufferers.  Last night I met with the parents of children who have been moved from the local school because of problems.  Admittedly, the problem cannot be addressed as there is no mechanism to deal with it.  How long must negotiations continue, as children continue to suffer from existing problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all can have health problems arising from all walks of life and we must feel sorry for those with such problems.  In this respect there are demands placed on the education of children, including the demand for them to do well.  Where children have only the one opportunity in <Col N="730" /> life to receive this education, we are told that there is a mechanism, through conciliation, to deal with problems where they arise.  However, the reality is that the problems cannot be addressed because the mechanism does not allow for this.  The teachers accept that the problems can be addressed if there is a means and a will to do so within the Department, but there is no such will. Nobody with a child, who, as I have said, has only one chance to be educated, should be subjected to a situation where because of a problem their child may suffer.</P>
    <P>There is a general awareness of the large number of people who are willing, able and eligible, if the opportunity arose, to start teaching.  However, that opportunity is not being granted to them. The amendment from the Government parties, following the Minister's statement to the unions in April 1993, leads me to wonder what the Minister will say this year.  Will the Minister advise that the issue is still under negotiation?  It is time to call the shots and make the decisions on behalf of the future generation in this country and of the teachers who desire a facility for those in the profession who wish to leave the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion as it highlights an important issue that requires debate, debate in a broader sense and not limited to the teaching profession.  The situation regarding teachers is merely a symptom of the change that the world is going through. That change arises because, for the first time in history, people born into one world die in another, a world that is completely different and has become different in the course of their own lifetime. This is not overstating the case, as many would argue that this radical change is now taking place so fast that it happens several times during a single lifetime.  It presents an enormous scale of challenge that we have not experienced before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important consequence of this fast moving change is that the old way of dividing up a person's lifetime is now dead and gone.  The old idea was that <Col N="731" /> people were educated for a specific career in the early part of their life.  All the preparation and training that a person went through was expected to last an entire lifetime, and this was usually so at times when the world did not change much.  The situation is different today. At the most extreme, there are those who argue that one cannot expect the one career to last a lifetime and that people should plan to make at least one change and perhaps even several career changes. I am not speaking of changing jobs, rather the possibility of changing careers.</P>
    <P>However, even within a single career such as teaching, the job itself is changing all the time.  This means that the preparation for teaching which young people receive in their teenage years and early twenties becomes outdated long before the end of their careers.  In this respect it was interesting to hear Senator Norris speak of joining the teaching profession at the age of 23 and being expected to continue teaching for many years afterwards. In consequence of this there must be continuous adaptation and training all the way down the line.  Unfortunately, the notion of training during a teacher's career has been neglected.  It is an area where resources have not been spent.  In this respect I agree with Senator Ormonde when she spoke of the need for adaptation and that it must now have a high priority.</P>
    <P>To put it at its most extreme, we cannot expect teachers to operate on the basis that what they learnt 30 years ago will apply in the future.  Senator Lee spoke of everything changing out of recognition. The subject matter, the technology of teaching, the expectations from the educational system and the competition for the student's ear, as vividly described by many Senators tonight who are teachers, have all changed.</P>
    <P>As everybody in Ireland today has a need to adapt continuously in whatever job they hold, we must especially realise that this need presses strongly on teachers.  We must provide the means whereby they can adapt during their teaching lifetime.  There will be some for <Col N="732" /> whom the changes are too great, some who, as Senator Lee referred to, burn out before the normal retiring age.  For those the notion of early retirement may be a good idea.</P>
    <P>However, it is important that we do not make the big leap into concluding that early retirement should become the norm, or creating a situation where it is allowed to become the norm This was not suggested when Senator O'Toole spoke of the possibility that not even 5 per cent would accept the early retirement option.  However, it could easily become the norm if the wrong system was put in place.  One only has to consider what happens in Brussels where a large number of those working in the EU Commission are invalided out 15 years or so ahead of time.  That is a system which, although founded on good intentions, has become an expensive recipe for abuse.</P>
    <P>Another reason we should take care to stress that adaptation is the norm and that early retirement should be the exception, the last resort, arises from the growing tendency to believe that people over 50 years of age have come to the end of their working life.  The view is that they are truly finished and should retire because there is not a useful purpose to be served by their continued career participation and that they do not have as much to offer as younger people.  This view is wrong, not only because I am in that age group myself, as are many Senators in the House, but because what we should be saying is that people still have a worthwhile contribution to make if they adapt properly to today's conditions.  This is why some months ago I proposed, and had accepted, that age should be regarded as a cause for unfair dismissal. It was a proposal to stop people being made redundant on the grounds of age alone.</P>
    <P>Our approach to this issue should have two elements.  As the norm we should help people to adapt to this total wave of change.  As the exception, for those who are genuinely unable to adapt, we should insert the safety net of early retirement as proposed by this motion.  If we approach the problem in this way, we should have some chance of achieving <Col N="733" /> the objectives within the resources available to us.  Therefore we must consider the possibility of early retirement as the exception but adaptation as the norm.</P>

      <P>I thank all Members for their contributions to the debate.  I would not differ with those who addressed the question of early retirement.  I would differ with those who addressed the question early retirement.  I regret, however, that the Minister was not prepared to give a commitment this evening.  That is not a problem in regard to conciliation and arbitration.  The Minister could have repeated the commitment she gave last year.  It is the Minister's job to tell her negotiators what she wants done so they may negotiate through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  This happens all the time; it happened last week in Government Buildings when the social partners reached agreement on pay, etc. This then goes to the conciliation council where it is dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State's speech was unacceptable.  One page was devoted to the motion, five or six pages explained the current system on retirement, six pages dealt with stress and two-thirds of a page referred to this issue.  He stated that all three schemes are contributory but are non-funded.  That is not my problem. In the last three weeks I issued a statement saying it was a disgrace that the Government is in breach of its own legislation on superannuation.  Given that £4 billion is spent on public service pay and wages and 6 per cent of this is taken in superannuation contributions each year, approximately £300 million should go into a superannuation fund which would eventually find its feet and be in a position to reduce the cost and burden of pensions.  That is required in industry and where it is not required, the State must move in.  As we saw in the budget, the Minister for Finance made a huge contribution to the pension funds of semi-State bodies.  It is not my fault that it is non-funded.  Members of my organisation pay a contribution which is taken from their salaries each month.  It <Col N="734" /> is irresponsible that pensions must be paid from current expenditure.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the speech I found extraordinary was that of the 16 strategies teachers thought of to deal with stress on the job, early retirement was not considered. How would one cope with stress on the job after early retirement?  It is like saying one will not crash one's car if one does not drive or the best way to deal with competitiveness in industry is to close down one's shop.  Of course it is not a strategy for dealing with stress, it is something which comes after one has failed to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I listened to Members, including Senator Quinn, speak about the need for in-service training, an adaptable, flexibile approach to the job, job sharing and career breaks, etc.  I spent five arguing with the Department to introduce career breaks.  I pointed out that it would save it money and create flexibility, but the Department rejected it.  However, it followed the former Department of the Public Service when it took that decision. I spent the past five years arguing with the Department to introduce a job sharing scheme.  Finally, it is to this Minister's credit that she agreed to allow one case I put forward.  We now have two miserly job sharing schemes in primary education. This would not cost the State, but it shows a lack of adapability on the part of those who take decisions.  I have spoken about in-service education for the past ten or 12 years and, in fairness, this Minister has grasped the nettle and in-service education will take place this year.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we must fight for things which are good and do not cost money.  Last year the Minister stood before 1,000 people and spoke about the need for early retirement.  She now speaks about the repercussive effect it would have on the public service.  It seems the Minister did not think about it at the time or that she is now having second thoughts.  That is unacceptable. There is no commitment to move forward.</P>
    <P>Early retirement &mdash; I made sure this was included in the motion &mdash; must be an <Col N="735" /> option rather than the norm.  Last week I read an essay by Disraeli about advances made through the discoveries and initiatives of those past what is now considered retirement age.  People have studied languages at this time and some great autobiographers and philosophers have written during this productive period in a person's life.  I am attracted to that area of life and, like others, I studied <i>de senectute</i> at post primary school.</P>
    <P>The Minister has opted out of a commitment she gave.  However, this issue will not go away.  I noted those on the Government benches said this will be dealt through conciliation and arbitration. I looked for an answer to this at conciliation and arbitration, but it was not forthcoming.  If we do not get an answer we must ask if this issue is being buried.  It is unacceptable if that is the case.  It infuses anarchy in the system if the Minister makes a point and says this is the way forward, but nothing happens. Last April the Minister said she wanted to introduce early retirement, but she has not done this.</P>
    <P>I got a letter from a teacher who attended the congress last year.  We video the congress and large screens show what is going on.  He wrote that if the Minister attends this year's congress, he would be pleased if we would play the video of last year's speech as she enters the hall so she would be clear about the commitment she gave and the response she got.  I would not do that because it is not in anyone's interest to embarrass Ministers, although it is embarrassing for those concerned.</P>
    <P>A commitment has been given which we cannot walk away from.  At some stage someone will have to pay the price. This commitment would not cost a significant amount of money because people are paying into their pension funds at all times and a variety of approaches could be taken.  It is well known that someone retiring will be replaced and that the difference between the top and bottom of a teacher's scale is almost double.  A teacher coming in will earn approximately £14,000 while a retiring teacher <Col N="736" /> earns approximately £27,000 or £28,000. A saving could be made in this regard. The pension of the teacher retiring and the salary of the person coming in will be equal in the first year.  However, as a teacher goes up the scale the gap narrows. The average a teacher spends in retirement is less than seven years.  That is unfortunate and we should be aware of it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be flexible.  I have letters from people who cannot continue in the job.  I am used to people putting words in our mouths as to who should decide for teachers.  Like other sections of the community, I believe teachers should be answerable and they should argue their case.  There are no winners in a situation where teachers are not able to do their job.</P>
    <P>There is a risk in focusing on the negative aspects of teaching, and does not give me pleasure.  I have been talking to local communities and small groups of people in far flung corners of Ireland who have said there are problems in their schools and have asked me to do something.  I do not have the opportunity or the means to deal with problems when people in local communities have only two options, either sack teachers who have children in third level education and responsibilities and status in the community or allow them to continue doing what they can no longer do to the best of their abilities.  If these are the only options, somebody is being irresponsible.  I, as a representative of teachers, and Members who spoke tonight, both teachers and non-teachers, said we should be fair and open about this.  We would then not have to highlight these problems and would be able to present the profession in a better way.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a small number of teachers.  I inform Senator Quinn that we are referring to far fewer than 5 per cent.  This problem could be dealt with on the basis of a few hundred retirements each year.  This is a tiny number.  It would be a relief to people to know they have the option of retirement if things get too tough.  People who reach the age of voluntary retirement may feel good about <Col N="737" /> waiting until they are 60 or 61 before retiring but it may be psychologically difficult for them if they thought they had to stay working for another six years.</P>
    <P>We all understand there is a problem. <Col N="738" /> I regret the Government side put forward this extraordinary amendment.  I ask them not to press it and to accept the motion.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to the Senators on this issue.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board informed me on Thursday, 17 February, that evidence had emerged that there was a possible link between the product anti-D immunoglobulin and hepatitis C.  The board made arrangements to change the product and this took place on Friday, 18 February, 1994.  The board has introduced a new virally inactivated product which has been supplied to hospitals around the country.  I have already publicly outlined the importance of anti-D immunoglobulin in the treatment of rhesus haemolytic disease of the newborn and the importance of the administration of the anti-D immunoglobulin to mothers who may have babies with this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hepatitis C virus was first described in 1989.  The question of introducing a screening test for hepatitis C for donations nationally had been considered in 1989 and in 1990.  During this period the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the Department of Health <Col N="739" /> examined the possibility of introducing such a test.  However, a review of international practices and discussions with medical experts abroad revealed that there was insufficient scientific information about the test to approve its routine introduction.  The position was carefully monitored and when the test was considered sufficiently reliable for the purposes of screening donations, it was introduced to Ireland.  This occurred in 1991 at the same time as this screening was introduced in the United Kingdom. I would like to emphasise that cost is not a factor in the timing of the introduction of such tests.  In fact, £1 million for hepatitis C testing by the Blood Transfusion Service Board has been approved to date.</P>
    <P>In January 1994, as part of the ongoing monitoring of quality assurance procedures by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, it emerged that a disproportionate a number of rhesus negative female donors had antibodies for hepatitis C.  On further investigation it was found that nine of the ten female rhesus negative donors had received anti-D in 1977.  This was linked with an earlier report of six cases of jaundice which had been investigated in 1977 when no cause for the jaundice had been found.  It would seem now that the anti-D manufactured in 1977 is potentially the cause of this problem.</P>
    <P>I must commend the BTSB for carrying out this thorough type of research, which is essential in the monitoring and quality control of blood products which it processes.</P>
    <P>When this matter was brought to my attention my immediate concerns were first, to protect all future recipients of anti-D immunoglobulin and, second, the identification of any risk, however small, for any mothers who received the anti-D immunoglobulin product in the past.  I agree that the action taken on Monday last by the Blood Transfusion Service Board was correct as the safety of blood products must be the first priority at all times.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has announced its intention to follow up <Col N="740" /> all of the mothers who may have been at risk of contracting hepatitis C from the anti-D immunoglobulin product.  A special public awareness campaign has been launched to inform the public as to the possible risks.  This campaign will continue until every woman who wants to be tested has received a test.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements have been made to provide information to general practitioners, who in many cases will be, and indeed have been, the first point of contact for the women concerned.  While a small number of general practitioners did not receive their information packs on Tuesday, 22 February, the Blood Transfusion Service Board has assured me that every effort is being made by the board to ensure that all general practitioners are fully informed on this matter.  Seanad Éireann will appreciate that facilitating the testing of as many women as quickly as possible is of the utmost importance. The question of negotiating the fees will be dealt with in consultation with the IMO, commencing tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Free phone lines have been put in place by the Blood Transfusion Service Board to provide information to people who might be anxious, and special arrangements for the testing of women at risk have been made at several locations throughout the country.  The locations will continue to stay open and a new list will be announced in addition to the 12 centres announced by me yesterday.</P>
    <P>Blood testing at the Blood Transfusion Service Board centres and at general practitioners' surgeries will be administered free of charge.  I am determined that every woman at risk will, as far as practicable, be identified.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board is making specific arrangements to trace the cohort of mothers who were given the anti-D product in 1977 and are focusing at this time on those mothers.  Because of changes of address, it may not be possible to trace everybody and therefore the public awareness campaign has been launched. Decisions on the individual follow-up necessary will be made as a result of the ongoing testing process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> I would like to emphasise that all women who were administered with anti-D immunoglobulin, or who believe they may have been, are being requested to avail of the nationwide free blood testing services provided by the Blood Transfusion Service Board during the coming weeks.  Anti-D was introduced in 1970 and the object of the campaign is to advise all women who had anti-D immunoglobulin from 1970 to the present to come forward for testing.  I would like to stress, however, that where the test is negative for hepatitis C, there is no need to undergo a second test.  It is accepted that all medical interventions, including the use of blood and blood products, carry some risks which require the balancing of the benefits and risks of particular treatments.</P>
    <P>The prevalence of hepatitis C in Ireland among blood donors is low and compares favourably with other European countries.  This implies that hepatitis C is not widespread in the population.  Should any of the people given anti-D immunoglobulin need special medical treatment for hepatitis C as a result of receiving this product, I can confirm to the Seanad that whatever treatment prescribed by the clinicians will be provided by the public hospital services free of charge.</P>

      <P>I stand here as one of a thousand Irish women who need to be screened.  I have received three anti-D injections within the past ten years.</P>
      <P>The manner of the public announcement left much to be desired.  It flung many women into panic, confusion, fear, suspicion and in general need of reassurance. Many disliked the tone and the patronising effect on the way in which the news was imparted.  Frankly, it lacked understanding and definitely lacked any element of sensitivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> Many questions need to be answered and clarification is necessary.  What is hepatitis C?  I heard the announcement on the 11 o'clock news when I had left a meeting in Newmarket-on-Fergus.  My first question was what is hepatitis C?  I know what hepatitis A is and I know that hepatitis B can sometimes be fatal, so I assumed that hepatitis C was a degree more serious than hepatitis B.  That is the first question that needs to be answered.</P>
    <P>Could children conceived after a mother received the anti-D injection be at risk of hepatitis C?  I ask this question because in my first pregnancy I was pregnant with twins and miscarried one after three months.  At that time I received an anti-D injection, so the remaining six months of the pregnancy of the second twin were after I received the anti-D injection.  What is the position of that child?</P>
    <P>What is the position of people who received blood from rhesus negative donors?  As the Minister is aware, rhesus negative donors are universal donors, which means their blood can be used in an emergency.  This blood is much sought after by the transfusion board and is used in cases of emergency.  What is the position of people who received blood from the rhesus negative group, that is, women who received the anti-D injections?  Are these people now at risk?</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board is at the centre of the controversy and serious questions have to be asked.  One has to find out immediately what the source of blood and blood products are in this country.  How reliable are they? What type of testing is done?  Where exactly do they come from?  It is now widely accepted that there was knowledge of the risk in 1989, a reliable test was developed and screening was put in place in Britain in 1991.  Why was full screening not put into place in Ireland in 1991?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it now being stated that only women who received the anti-D injection prior to <Col N="743" /> 1991 need to be screened?  Given that the product was changed last Friday, does the Minister consider that women who received anti-D injections between 1991 and 1994 should be screened?  If not, why not?  Do we take it that a new product was introduced in 1991 which protected women from 1991?  Do we conclude that full testing and screening should have been introduced in 1991 rather than 1994?</P>
      <P>It is vital that a proper national screening programme be put in place.  Thought needs to be given to the structures and it is essential that no one slips through the net.  A counselling service is also required and every effort must be made to ensure that no further pressure or anxiety is caused to the women involved.  Many questions have to be answered and there is still much confusion among the public. Women are worried about the situation and rather than proceeding as was done last Monday evening, it would have been more appropriate if the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the Department of Health had first advised all general practitioners, hospitals and health boards of the impending situation and, having prepared and advised them, then go public.  In this instance the cart was put before the horse and the proper structures were not put into place until the public announcement was first made. This is most unfair to the 100,000 women concerned.</P>
      <P>The manner in which some people have commented on the issue since it was announced leaves much to be desired.  I refer in particular to the consultant, Mr. Terry Walsh.</P>

      <P>Over the past 24 to 48 hours comments have been made by certain personnel on the airwaves that leave much to be desired.  This is extremely unfortunate.  There is a real possibility that over 1,000 women are infected by hepatitis C.  That is a grave matter which <Col N="744" /> should be dealt with seriously and not in a casual fashion.  The question of compensation was raised in the course of one of these programmes and it was dismissed in an offhand fashion, which is completely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister has much work to do.  Many areas in his Department require attention and the Department of Health demands time and resources.  In this instance there is an urgent need to allay many of the fears, anxieties and worries that exist across this country.  These worries are not just for the women themselves. Many are also concerned for their children, and there are people who have received transfusions in emergency situations over the past number of years who are equally concerned about the dangers of contracting hepatitis C.  Clarification is needed urgently and I request the Minister to supply that as soon as possible.</P>

It is sad that any aspersions should be cast on the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  It has done a marvellous job for many years and saved millions of lives.  There was not test available when this happened.  The media has treated this very fairly.  An article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> carries the headline: &ldquo;No case for scapegoats.&rdquo;  It continues:</P>
      <P>The testing process is now underway and the results will come through quickly.  Then the investigation should start.  This investigation must not be allowed to degenerate into a search for scapegoats.  When the problem first arose in 1977, no one knew about hepatitis C either here or in the rest of the world.  There could not, therefore, be any test to detect it.</P>

      <P>In fairness, the Blood Transfusion Service Board has done a <Col N="745" /> wonderful job.  Despite the fact that this problem has arisen, as this article says, thousands of children have had a good life and been brought into this world free of any disease, impediment or disability. We must look at the good things the board has done.  Medical science will always be a challenge.  The Minister and the Blood Transfusion Service Board should be congratulated.  They acted fast and have put every mechanism in place. I pay tribute to the 1,700 general practitioners around the country who have decided they are going to do their utmost to ensure the tests are done as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It may not be as serious a problem as some people try to make out.  It is sad that anybody should start blaming others and attacking people by saying this is a serious problem when we do not know whether it is or not.  Why do some want to generate anxiety and worry among people by this kind of debate?  It is wrong and is neither caring nor respectful.  It does not take account of the situation in which these people find themselves.</P>

      <P>We should not be scaring people unnecessarily.  The Government, the Minister and everybody concerned are doing their utmost to ensure we get to the root of this problem and that everybody who was given this injection is tested and screened.  I have no doubt that in a month or two we will realise that this is not as big a problem as people are trying to make it out to be.  I do not think it will be a big problem, because if it has not shown up in 20 years it is unlikely to blow up into an epidemic now.</P>
      <P>We should not start looking for scapegoats. Claims were mentioned here earlier. Litigation is the order of the day in today's world and everybody makes claims.  The opinion of an eminent solicitor is reported in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> and I wish to read it into the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women seeking compensation for receiving infected anti-D blood products were advised yesterday to pursue litigation with caution, writes Gordon Patterson.  As the Dublin solicitor specialising in medical negligence cases commented, &ldquo;Do not consult your lawyer just yet&rdquo;.  He said from the city centre practice yesterday: &ldquo;At this very early stage, I would advise all women to co-operate fully with the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  If it turns out they have hepatitis C, it could have come from the blood product in question or it could have come from some other source.  To get compensation the person must prove the defendant was negligent as opposed to being careless or merely lacking in knowledge.  For example, they did not know there was a problem in 1977 and they did not have adequate knowledge.  That would be what is known as state of the art at <Col N="747" /> the time defence, that is, they did not know the product was contaminated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of an eminent solicitor who specialises in this type of business, so the case for litigation seems to be very weak.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the quick action taken by the Minister and his Department. I am also delighted with the public information in all the daily papers today. I can assure the House that the Minister's wishes will be carried out and nobody will be left untested.  I do not believe that this will be as big a problem as some people are saying it is.  I pay tribute to the media for the very balanced way in which they are approaching this very emotional subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While I realise that this is a very personal, sensitive and emotive issue for all women who fear they have been infected by hepatitis C, it is unwise to castigate the Blood Transfusion Service Board, which I know, having had dealings with blood transfusion services in many nations, is one of the finest in the world.  It is most important to point out, and I am very glad the Minister did so in his introductory speech, that this problem only came to light because of the vigilance and intelligence of those working in the blood transfusion service, Dr. Power and her co-workers, who pointed at the fact &mdash; it is quite hard picking these things up when an enormous amount of testing is being done &mdash; that there was a cluster of rhesus negative women in Cork, that there was a problem, and who were able to correlate it back to the giving of anti-D immunisation at the same time in 1977.  When one is examining a large number of charts and tests this takes a lot of doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must congratulate the blood transfusion services on their quality assurance procedure.  We must not concentrate too much on this specific case, because the message I have for the Minister tonight is that our commitment to the monitoring of health care is one of the most important <Col N="748" /> functions of all of us who work in the health care area and specifically of the Department of Health.  Not only have they to make sure that we who work in this area monitor health care but they must also make sure we have the funds available to do so.  I congratulate the Minister on what he has done to date.  He could not be described as having alarmed women.  There is an enormous difference between alarming and alerting women, and the women had to be alerted.</P>
    <P>The Minister was wise to go public with this because if he had sent notification out to general practitioners, within no length of time the general public would know there was something going on and what was going on, and the Minister would have been accused of a cover up. What the Department of Health and the College of General Practitioners did was the right way to go about things.  An enormous amount of testing must be done.  It is important that these 100,000 women be tested.  It will be about that number, 10 or 15 per cent of the women of child bearing age over a 20 year period. It is not essential to go today.  Someone said to me that she was going next month. If she has had it for the last 14 years, she said, she would go next month.  It is very important to make people aware that it is not absolutely essential to get there immediately.</P>
    <P>The media campaign has been very good.  However, I ask the Minister in about six months' time or perhaps longer &mdash; a long time lag will be necessary &mdash; to ask the maternity hospitals to go through their records and tick off all the people who responded to the media campaign. Of course, they can start now.  Those records should be correlated with those of the maternity hospitals which were given anti-D, fanning out from the 1977 era.  That appears to be what the Minister wants to do.  It will be worth while doing that, because a certain number of these women will have emigrated or changed addresses.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister would specifically emphasise the importance of this campaign for people who had miscarriages and stillbirths.  These people <Col N="749" /> may not pay as much attention to the media campaign, because all of us will associate the immunisation with the result of a live born child, and its association with a previous miscarriage or stillbirth may be pushed into the background.</P>
    <P>I am glad the treatment for those who are found to be positive will be free.  It is important to point out that this will be a very small number.  It is suggested that people might have got it from ordinary rhesus negative blood transfusions, but I have been reliably informed that this is a very remote possibility.  It must be remembered that the anti-D immunoglobulin is heavily concentrated and the problem lies where a concentrated dose is given.  We do not know everything about hepatitis C now, nor did we in 1991 when the screening was introduced, but I am confident that those who have it will be properly dealt with.  We should emphasise that while some people will be affected, the incidence of cirrhosis from hepatitis C is very small.  This is not being said enough, and I would be glad if the Department of Health would make this known.</P>
    <P>I praise the Department of Health, because what the Minister and his Department have done this time is in marked contrast to the troubles we had in the past with various women's health issues.  I wonder whether any Members here remember what happened with the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine device which caused severe problems in this country and with which the Department of Health gave little or no help to women who were trying to pursue justifiably legitimate claims against the manufacturers. There was also the lack of attention given at the time to women who had had Diethylstilboesterol.  Very little help was given to them, even though it was a much more serious problem: their children were the victims of cancer in some cases and the women involved had a higher incidence of breast cancer.  The Minister has done the right thing in this case and I congratulate him on his change of attitude and on that of the Department. The diethylstilboesterol campaign <Col N="750" /> was appalling.  Were it not for the persistence of a woman, Mrs. Daphne Passmore, who had been a victim of the drug, and the setting up of a clinic in the National Maternity Hospital, I do not know if anything would have been done about these cases.  So, while the Minister has given more money to the Health Research Board, let this be a lesson to us.  Quality control is very important.</P>
    <P>The general public have an idea that medical research is to do with laboratories and stunning breakthroughs in determining the cause of some disease. It is not.  It is just this sort of thing, slogging through charts and tests and having the wit to realise what is happening. I ask the Minister and his Department to emphasise this and to let the general public know that this is a most important area of medical research.  It will not be supported by the general public; it has to be supported by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for taking this debate here tonight.  I congratulate him and his Department, and particularly Dr. Joan Power, for the work they have done in this area and the prompt actions they have taken.  It is a pity that Senator Taylor-Quinn has left the Chamber because I would have said that her outburst was far from helpful.  This is an area that should be looked at calmly.  Instead of raising fears about this situation, it should be factually considered.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis C is a new strain of hepatitis which was discovered in 1989.  People involved in medical research understand that one does not know all the facts as soon as a strain is identified.  One must find out where it came from and how it may be cured.  This takes years of research and, as the Minister pointed out, international research did not provide sufficient answers about the identification of hepatitis C until 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anti-D immunoglobulin injection was of great benefit to many women because it resulted in approximately 100 babies being born alive each year.  This would not have happened 30, 40 or 50 years ago <Col N="751" /> when babies would either have died in early infancy or, if they had survived, they would have been anaemic and would have suffered from the blue baby syndrome. Many parents were happy this injection was given to mothers after the birth of a child because it ensured that future children were safe from a reaction to the mother's Rhesus factor.  We must be thankful for this.  As the Minister said, there may be negative effects from an injection.  A small percentage of people may be infected, but this should not take away from the fact that the anti-D immunoglobulin injection has been of great benefit to parents.</P>
    <P>In January this year a link was discovered between a group of women donors who were Rhesus negative and had hepatitis C antibodies.  As Senator Henry pointed out, the link was forged as a result of people carefully watching what they were doing.  Links may be forged between coincidences, but it took time to examine the charts and establish a definite link between these two factors. Last Thursday the Minister was informed that this link existed.  Since then, he, his Department and those in the Blood Transfusion Service Board have worked day and night to put procedures in place before the public could be informed. Additional blood products were imported from Canada as a precaution. However, this was not intended to create fear, but to ensure that people were safe.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided clear information about this matter and we have heard nothing tonight which was not in the newspapers or on the airwaves on Tuesday morning.  The Minister and Dr. Power have not kept information from the public.  Many women did not understand the situation and perhaps a small percentage became unduly anxious. However, that is a small price to pay for an awareness campaign.  It is more important to be informed than to sweep the issue under the carpet.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the prompt action he has taken to organise special arrangements, such as telephone lines and 12 information centres.  I took <Col N="752" /> a friend to my local centre last night, which is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.  Such a service had to be organised because it did not happen overnight.  Women should thank the Minister for caring enough to do that.  He could have sent letters to GPs instead, but this would have achieved little.  The GP would either have left the letter in his file or, if he was consistent, he might have informed his patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I hope he will be able to answer my questions.  People may get too annoyed about certain situations.  I understand it takes a long time to find answers to problems.  Hepatitis C became an issue in 1989 and it has taken two years for Dr. Power and others to identify the problems.  Were any indications given that there was a problem with this vaccine and was it still being used last week?</P>
      <P>I am worried about the third last paragraph of the Minister's speech which states: &ldquo;It is accepted that all medical interventions, including the use of blood and blood products, carry some risks which require the balancing of the benefits and risks of particular treatments.&rdquo; This is a glib comment and we should not accept such a situation.  It is difficult to get everything right and to ensure that what is a problem today will not be one in ten or 15 years' time, but people need better assurances than this.  Perhaps this is not possible because of the introduction of new products into the system. We welcome new products which help people with different illnesses.  However, I am worried people will not trust them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I was listening to an interview on the radio about this issue.  Compensation was mentioned, although I do not support the compensation syndrome. The impression I got from the answer was that it was like betting on a horse in that one takes a chance.  People took the injection because that was what they wanted at the time; they took a chance.  It was prescribed by a doctor and if it did not work they lost out.  We should not be able to wash our hands of all <Col N="753" /> responsibility when something like this happens.  We do not want that type of society.  We care about people's health; we care about people in all walks of life. I would not like to see this developed further because, whether we like it or not, 80 per cent of people will read all the newspaper articles and 20 per cent will not.  There will always be a fear among a small percentage of the people and it is our job to ensure that that is not confirmed by glib replies to questions at interviews.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>If people are to take anything from tonight's debate they would be well advised to take the very learned and informative discourse by Senator Henry.  That is the sort of information people want.</P>
      <P>This has been one of the best days for the Irish public service for many years.  I agree with Senator Henry that the Blood Transfusion Service Board has behaved magnificently.  The Department of Health's response has been nothing short of magnificent.  It belies the idea that the Irish public service is slow to respond in a crisis, that it cannot do what the private sector can.  It proved not alone that it can do it but that it can do it quicker and more efficiently.  I listened to Senator Taylor-Quinn; I have to be mindful, as a male, that I did not have this injection and she did.  I respect the concerns she has voiced but I think she is wrong when she mentioned a &ldquo;casual&rdquo; approach. Nothing could be further from the truth. This was the opposite to a casual approach.  The approach to this issue was what I expected this Minister to take.  It was the same public information approach he took in the Kilkenny rape case, involving full disclosure and putting systems in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all fields of human endeavour, nothing evolves as quickly as medical science; it changes almost daily.  When something happens that nobody can foresee, the political head of a Department has a number of responsibilities.  One is to ascertain the scale of the problem immediately and assemble the relevant information.  Second, the defective product <Col N="754" /> must be removed and replaced with a product which is not harmful.  All those things were done.  The third step is to fully inform the public, which is what the Minister did.  The reason there is no sense of panic can be laid at the door of the Minister for his performance and that of his Department &mdash; and let us be fair, the performance of the Opposition in the Dáil and in this House.  Nobody tried to make political capital out of this situation. This is not a political issue.  The way it was handled by the Department and the Blood Transfusion Service Board is a matter of great pride to us all.  The Department and the Minister have performed in an impeccable manner. Women have every reason to be happy not just that the Minister &mdash; who may change from time to time &mdash; is in charge of the Department of Health but that it is staffed by officials of enormous competence.</P>
    <P>I am glad this issue has been treated in a serious way by all concerned.  Tribute was paid earlier to the media.  If this was England I shudder to think what <i>The Sun, The Star</i> and all of these Fleet Street journals would make of an issue like this. They would say, let us sell papers.  This is a good story.  That does not happen in this country because we have higher standards and, thank God, we are a little more civilised when dealing with serious issues.</P>
    <P>I know other Members want to contribute and I will not delay the House any longer.  I conclude by paying tribute to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, his officials and the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister and thank him for coming into the House to speak on this matter.  As a mother who received the anti-D treatment after the birth of each of my three children, I think it is essential that the matter be dealt with in a responsible, calm and transparent manner by the Minister and the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My immediate reaction on hearing the news on the radio on Monday evening was one of shock.  The urgent and dramatic <Col N="755" /> circumstances in which the press conference was called were bound to cause concern among some women.  Like all women, in the beginning I was looking for information.  What exactly was hepatitis C?  What were my chances of contracting it?  What effects would it have on my health?  My concern, and the concern of many women who contacted me, was whether it would affect children born to them after they had received it.</P>
    <P>The person to whom most people go for information on their health is their GP.  I disagree with Senator Henry and others when they said that the press conference should have been held before GPs were contacted since many women immediately rang their GPs who were not in any position to reassure them because they did not have the information.  I realise the Minister's dilemma.  It was a difficult decision but I think he went the wrong way about it.  I accept his sincerity and his efforts to try to do the best thing. However, when one is affected, these things can mean something different.  It is easier to be more detached when you are not at risk.  That was the difficulty with many women; they panicked because they could have been affected. In that way they differed from officials in the Department and the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised complete openness in dealing with this situation and I welcome this.  The outstanding question that needs to be answered is: why were mothers like myself not alerted of the possible dangers before now?  The virus was discovered in 1989 and the Blood Transfusion Service Board apparently became aware of it in 1991.  I would like the Minister to clarify this.  I would also like to know if a more effective screening service was available earlier and if a more effective testing mechanism was available abroad.  If so, why did we not have it?  I understand that a mechanism was available in Canada and the United States from 1993, although I do not know that for certain.  I would like the Minister to confirm it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> I was surprised to hear in his statement to the Dáil yesterday that over the weekend a virally inactive product was imported from Canada.  Does that mean that up to last Friday women who received the anti-D vaccine were still at risk?  GPs were confused about this.  In the letter they received yesterday they were told to test all women who had received the anti-D injection in 1977. When they phoned Pelican House they were told to test women who had been injected during the period 1977-91.  I would like the Minister to state whether GPs should now test women who received the anti-D up to last Friday.  It is essential that this be made clear.</P>
    <P>The GPs would like a system to be established.  At the moment they are being told that containers for blood samples are not being sent out automatically by Pelican House; perhaps they could be sent to the health boards for distribution. It is very difficult for GPs to get through to Pelican House by phone at the moment.  One GP &mdash; with whom I am sure the Minister is familiar &mdash; told me this evening that he would be willing to organise this himself.</P>
    <P>The present alert also raises the matter of hospital records.  Some hospitals do not have records going back to 1977; that is the difficulty.  Today I was contacted by a woman who had a baby in 1977. When she contacted the hospital they could not tell her whether she had received anti-D.  My advice was for her to have the test anyway.  The records system for women patients, particularly in maternity hospitals, needs to be looked at.  Since what happens in childbirth can affect one's subsequent children this is very important.  The area of women's health has not been treated with the urgency and importance it should.  I hope that is now changing.</P>
    <P>I am glad this testing can be done by GPs because while there are not health centres all over the country, women in rural areas have ready access to their GPs.  It is important to maintain a sense of balance.  I agree that the discovery of anti-D has saved the lives of thousands of children.  Before its introduction more <Col N="757" /> than 100 babies died each year from blood mismatching; now the figure is less than five per year.  We must keep this issue in perspective.  It is vital that women who are receiving anti-D vaccine this week are reassured that the product is safe.  I appreciate the fact that I was given the anti-D vaccine.  Women like my mother, who were Rhesus negative, did not have the benefit of the vaccine.  As a result children, including my brothers and sisters, had to be given several blood transfusions. There is always a balance of risk and benefit.  I am glad to have the benefits. However, the Minister should reassure women about some of the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I share the view that he is a Minister who has established his credibility from the first day of his appointment on this and other issues which he discussed in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no personal experience in this matter so perhaps it is wrong of me to disagree with some of the women who have such experience.  I do not think the manner of the Minister's announcement was insensitive or lacking in understanding as was suggested by Senator Taylor-Quinn.  There was openness and honesty as soon as the matter came to light.  The media behaved in a responsible manner also.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board acted immediately and informed people.  As Senator Honan said, there was some confusion about whether general practitioners had been informed.  If the Minister had waited until every GP had been informed we would have come to this Chamber to demand an immediate public awareness campaign. We would have cited the ten to 14 day delay in postal deliveries in some parts of the country as a factor in not making people aware of the risk.  It is unfair to say the Minister should have taken a different course of action.  The announcement was made in the most efficient and effective manner possible.  General practitioners may believe they were excluded <Col N="758" /> but the public awareness campaign was the necessary course of action.</P>
    <P>Senators have said that the importance of the anti-D treatment must be taken into consideration.  Senator Honan said that if there was a choice of availing of the anti-D treatment or not, few women would refuse to take the risk.  Reference was made to the fact that medical treatments are not totally safe.  The medical profession, including my GP, will agree that there is no medical treatment that does not carry some risk, no matter how slight.  That applies to any treatment, even aspirin.  Having given our children aspirin and taken it ourselves for years we discovered that there is a risk.  Any treatment carries risk no matter how small.  If the Minister is criticised for referring to that fact we can return to the days of the spin doctors and the PR agents who gave us the flavoured story.  I do not want that brand of politics.  I prefer to be given the facts.</P>
    <P>I do not think this matter is causing panic.  The facts should be repeated; Senator Taylor-Quinn suggested we did not act as quickly as we should have.  The screening test was introduced in 1991 &mdash; not 1993 &mdash; at the same time as the UK when it was discovered that the test was reliable.  I would not criticise the Blood Transfusion Service Board in that regard. As Senator Henry said, it was due to the board's quality control mechanism that the problem was discovered.  The worst thing we could do is criticise the good work of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  If the board had brushed this under the carpet for another ten years there would be a different debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Honan that an information campaign on hepatitis C is necessary.  I have not got a clue what it is and it could be a cause of worry.  That should be the next part of the campaign if a second phase is being considered.  People should be told about the virus, the likely percentage of <Col N="759" /> people who might be affected and the effects.</P>
    <P>It is true that there is great concern among women, men and families about this matter.  The concern does not arise because we were not informed but because we do not know what the results will be.  The women to whom I have spoken are concerned but they are calm. I believe that is due to the way this matter has been treated.  Nobody welcomes the problem that has been discovered. However, if we face it openly and honestly people outside the Oireachtas will respect us and have confidence in us as legislators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is welcome. It is a pity this matter is the reason for his visit.  I hope we will see him here on many occasions in the future when there will not be a semi-crisis.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Taylor-Quinn who asked a number of questions.  This evening was the appropriate time to ask those questions, if they had not previously been answered.  Those who criticise the Senator for doing so are having a political go at her and I do not like that. If questions must be asked they should be asked when the Minister is here.  There is no reason the Minister cannot intervene to make a further statement later and we can bend the rules if necessary so that he can do so.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's comments. If there were ten Ministers in charge of this matter there would be ten different programmes to deal with it. Individuals are different; we are not clones.  The Minister undertook a certain course of action.  I might have waited for another 24 hours or, depending on the circumstances, I might have done something different.  The Minister should be open to mild criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has not had a shattering affect on the nation.  People who get half of the message &mdash; who only tune into the headlines on the radio &mdash; are the people we <Col N="760" /> worry about.  If this was a crisis, getting the message across without giving all the information would have created difficulty. Many people only take in half of the message; they read the newspaper and take in only half the information. Later, over a cup of tea perhaps, the person may give another that information whereupon that person may begin to wonder and worry if he or she will die immediately.  That has happened.</P>
    <P>Some GPs received information which was not correct.  Brushing that under the carpet will not do any good.  We might learn from it for the future.  I am speaking for people throughout the country but mainly for those in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  I am anxious that the Minister be clinical in his approach to ensure that everybody receives the information and that the information is complete. Many people here did not know about hepatitis C.  If they have it they do not know if it will be bad, very bad or terrible.  There are big gaps in the information people have acquired and those gaps must be filled.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my constituents, neighbours and friends I urge the Minister to be as clinical as possible for as long as possible to ensure that everybody gets all the information and that people do not think they have the illness when they do not.  Already, there are 100,000 possible cases; each probably thinks she has it. Ultimately a small percentage may have it but until that groups is investigated nobody will know.</P>
    <P>Let us ask the questions tonight and get the answers.  We must ensure that people are given complete information on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;Special arrangements have been made to provide information to general practitioners who, in many cases, will be the first point of contact for the women concerned&rdquo;. It is important that the Minister would justify not having fully consulted with the medical profession at both GP <Col N="761" /> and hospital levels to ensure that the maximum and most effective screening could be carried out with a minimum of anxiety.  They were unaware that this was to explode in the media.</P>
      <P>The Minister decided to raise the issue through the media and by doing so highlighted the need for screening but he also increased the level of anxiety among women.  GPs and many hospitals were not in a position to give any information and help at that point.  I accept that what the Minister said was clearly and easily understood but there should have been consultation with the GPs and the hospitals before he went public.</P>
      <P>The other point I put to the Minister is the time lag involved between the discovery of the necessity for hepatitis C screening and its implementation.  It is crucially important that the population's trust in our excellent Blood Transfusion Service Board, which is the envy of Europe, is maintained and that every measure is taken to ensure this occurs. My main point is that there should have been more consultation.  I accept the sincerity of the Minister and the Department in this matter but a lot of anxiety was created that could have been avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to reply and I thank Senators for thoughtful and considered contributions.  They were particularly valuable from the women Senators, who would be concerned for their own health, and as a male Minister it is important for me to listen carefully to the points made and the anxieties they expressed.  Many positive things were said about me for which I am grateful, but more importantly about the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the officials of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud and impressed at the amount of work undertaken since I was alerted last Thursday evening.  I got the first written report on Friday and the staff of my Department and of the Blood <Col N="762" /> Transfusion Service Board have been working around the clock since then, right through the weekend.  My commitment was to have public information available.</P>
    <P>The point of criticism from some Senators was that we should have waited until all GPs were notified.  That was something which had to be considered but, on balance, it would have been impossible.  There are 1,600 GMS GPs. How should they be contacted?  By telephone? Should we have written to them all?  The Dublin GPs would have got the information a day before the country GPs.  It would have been impossible for anxieties not to build up.  Some of the GPs' wives would possibly need the test. Within a day of the notification, there would have been widespread concern, confusion and total panic.  The couple of hours gap between the public campaign beginning on Monday evening and the post arriving on Tuesday morning was an acceptable level of confusion in handling an extraordinarily difficult and complex situation.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend the Blood Transfusion Service Board put in place a nationwide screening process on an unprecedented scale.  Four shifts of people are working around the clock from yesterday to carry out 6,000 tests every day from yesterday.  They will have results within a week from each test.  That work is ongoing around the clock.  We hope to be able to screen all the women who present themselves within a matter of weeks.  As I said this is an unprecedented scale of operation.  We brought in the GMS Payments Board to assist over the weekend so that labels would be printed for every doctor and the postal information would go out to them.</P>
    <P>The tests are carried out in the Blood Transfusion Service Board in Cork or Dublin.  The GP is asked to take a blood sample which is part of his routine work for 101 other conditions.  There is nothing complex in taking the blood sample and sending it off, and we will be negotiating <Col N="763" /> with the IMO tomorrow about the fee structure.</P>
    <P>The more important issue was to get a mechanism in place to inform everybody. That is my style; it will be my approach to any issue that arrives on my desk &mdash; people have a right to know about information that pertains to their health and I have no right to keep it from them.  That might be crude or even insensitive but, after the initial shock, that is the approach most people want from the Minister for Health.  They want the truth immediately and I am most anxious that all information will be made available as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>A few specific questions were raised that I will try to answer as best I can.  As I said in the Dáil, I am no expert; in the last four days I have had an intensive course in the effects of anti-D immunoglobulin, hepatitis C and its six strains and the methods of transmission and I am still not an expert.  I put together the expertise of the country as best I could over the weekend, including the specialists from the hospitals, to give the best advice to people to people and to make it available.  That will continue.  It is a little over 48 hours since the campaign started and I dare say that few women are unaware of it now.  Yesterday 60,000 individuals tried to get through on the freephone lines and many thousands of them were counselled and advised. Obviously there will be difficulties.  Not every GP got the pack in time but I hope they have it now, and in the fullness of time all lines of communication will be perfect.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate points I have already made.  Hepatitis C was identified in 1989. I am no expert, but it is an extraordinarily elusive virus.  It was discovered not by being identified itself, but its shadow was discovered by electron microscope.  I think the people who worked on that project got a Nobel prize for their work. For years it was known as non-A non-B hepatitis until it was finally identified. <Col N="764" /> It took a long time for an acceptable international test to be worked out.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board was to the forefront in dealing with a proper test and participated in many international fora until an acceptable international test was agreed.  It was introduced in Ireland at the same time as in the United Kingdom in 1991.</P>
    <P>The question was asked when we had reason to be concerned that there was a fear of contamination with hepatitis C from anti-D.  I was made aware last Thursday; the Blood Transfusion Service Board came to the conclusion in January from its own internal research.  Praise is due to Dr. Power for the detective work and the research that brought her to that conclusion and so quickly brought us to the point where we are concerned enough to take the action we have.  It is a great credit to the quality assurance mechanisms that are in place and the reputation of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>People asked what is hepatitis C.  The virus was first described in 1989.  It is considered that this virus has evolved in the human race over many hundreds of years.  Work by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service Board has classified six types of the virus.  Types one, two and three are most commonly seen in western Europeans.  Infection with hepatitis C may cause jaundice immediately.  However, more usually the recipient is totally unaware of infection. In a small number of cases the virus may persist and cause chronic inflammation of the liver many years of decades later. The prevalence of hepatitis C is low in Ireland and compares favourable with other European countries.</P>
    <P>Although we were testing anti-D since 1991, I was anxious to be absolutely certain. I used what some would call a belt and braces approach and brought in virally inactive anti-D last Friday.  I have asked that all women who received anti-D from its introduction here in 1970 up to last Friday should present themselves <Col N="765" /> for a test to be sure there were no difficulties and to set their minds at rest. That is what we hope to do.  In my view it is better that women be told everything rather than being left in the dark.  That was the decision made and I fervently believe it was right, although there is an argument on the other side.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry talked of quality control and complimented the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I thank her for that.  I fully accept what she said about quality assurance measures generally and the value and importance of health research.  That is why I was happy to give a significant increase to the Health Research Board for 1994.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked about the correlation with maternity hospitals.  That will be done.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board has the names of two-thirds of the woman who received anti-D since 1970.  It has established a data bank into which all the testing names are being inputted.  At the end of the process, in a week or two, the board will correlate all those who present themselves for testing with the known names and try to identify those who are missing.  The hospitals will help in that tracking system.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly asked about the gap between 1989 and 1991; I have explained that.  The virus was identified in 1989 and the first international test was developed in 1991.  The test was introduced here at the same time as in the UK.</P>
    <P>There were comments about the paragraph in my speech about risk.  There will be associated risks but my job is to ensure risk is minimised.  In fairness to the Blood Transfusion Service Board, it has worked remarkably over the years to ensure all the blood products it presents and the whole blood and plasma it produces are as safe as it can make them, which is as safe as any country in the world.  We should all maintain confidence in one of our most important institutions, responsible for preserving the lives of millions of people since the mid-1960s when it was established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> I join with Senator Magner in complimenting the media.  They have been most responsible when one considers what might have happened in other jurisdictions. They have been balanced and helped the board communicate the message in a clear way.  The questions asked have also been fair because they reflect the questions surfacing elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan asked why mothers were not alerted to the risk of anti-D. The answer is that we were not aware of the risk until last month when Dr. Power's research concluded there was reason to suspect a link between hepatitis C and the 1977 product and I was not aware of it until last Thursday.  I think that justifies testing everyone to ensure all fears are allayed.  Every woman who has had anti-D should be tested.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the wider issue of women's health.  I am making a speech on that issue tomorrow morning in the Coombe Hospital &mdash; if I may promote that.  It is an extremely important issue and I will deal with it by publishing a women's health strategy document this year as part of the national health strategy. In accordance with the request from the Council for the Status of Women I hope to bring a women's health plan to Government for approval before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis talked about bare facts, and I agree with her.  I am in favour of giving bare facts.  That is my job.  I do not agree with Senator Cotter that I should have held off for 24 hours.  That cannot be justified because of the fear and confusion which would have instantly arisen.  The Senator said people were getting a half message.  If I had fed the information selectively to professionals or some other group, there would have been a half message because it would have spread a shadow across the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock spoke about the same issue.  He demanded that I justify disclosure.  I do not think I need to justify telling the women of Ireland what the <Col N="767" /> case is.  I have a responsibility to do that and no coterie within the population&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Full information had to be given.  The question is a legitimate one.  I have been asked by doctors whether I should have informed them first.  I thought it was much more important to tell everyone in the nation at the same time.  That is my style and I can be criticised for that.  Openness and having all the information available was what the people wanted, particularly the women. They do not want the information filtered through any source.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock also mentioned the time lag before the introduction of screening.  I repeat that there was no time lag.  We introduced screening as soon as an internationally acceptable test was available.  It was introduced in 1991 at the same time as in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful for the interest and the support of so many Senators.  There is a problem which needs to be addressed and women who have been tested will be anxious until the results come back.  We will work as diligently as possible to support <Col N="768" /> the Blood Transfusion Service Board through its difficulties and we will help it give accurate information to patients.  I hope to be able to keep this House updated as I receive the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will know, this is the third time in a two month period that I have raised in the Seanad the issue of Clonmannon retirement village. I am extremely grateful to the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to do so and I am more than grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, for the care and consideration she has shown on this matter in the last two months and for being here again tonight.</P>
      <P>As I said in the Seanad on 17 December, the well being, health and welfare of the residents of Clonmannon depend entirely on Hilltop Catering Company Limited, the care firm responsible for the management of that village; the youngest person is 70 years of age and the oldest is 96.  The <i>bona fides</i> and operational capacity of that company was the only guarantee those people had that their well being would be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion I spoke of my grave concern about the <i>bona fides</i> of the operating company given the evidence that come to my attention in previous weeks.  With the deepest regret, I am convinced that this company has neither the capacity nor the standing to be allowed to continue operating in this area.  This company is not fit to run a kennel let alone a retirement home dealing with people between 70 and 96 years <Col N="769" /> of age.  Over the past weeks, the already disastrous situation at Clonmannon retirement village has been made infinitely worse by the activities of the owner and manager of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will abide by your ruling, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, but we know who the person is.  On 31 December 1993, Hilltop Catering Company Limited decided, ostensibly due to the ongoing dispute with a number of residents of Clonmannon village, that it would close the nursing home facility there.  At short notice the families of those residing in the nursing home were told they had to find alternative accommodation for their loved ones.  Over the Christmas period, this major relocation operation had to be carried out with the assistance of the Eastern Health Board &mdash; and I acknowledge the help and care of the board's officials.  On 1 January 1994, the nursing home reopened within hours of closing as a retirement home.  The significance of this move is that the legal measures surrounding a retirement home as far more flexible, as the House knows, than those applying to nursing homes.  When the nursing home was closed by Hilltop Catering Company Limited, all the nursing staff were fired.  Many of the staff are fine people &mdash; they are well known to me and to other public representatives in County Wicklow &mdash; and gave years of <Col N="770" /> devoted service to the residents of Clonmannon and had established a personal relationship with them.  On 31 December the scenes at Clonmannon House were heartrending to say the least.  Since then, things have deteriorated and in the last 48 hours they have gone from bad to disastrous.</P>
      <P>On Friday last, the company notified residents in the village that at 2 p.m. on Tuesday of this week, electricity to the main house and to the sewerage plant, which services the entire village, would be disconnected.  My inquiries have established that the ESB cut off the electricity because it had not been paid since July last.  That date is very significant because at that time all the residents of Clonmannon village were paying their full service charges.  Regarding the level of these service charges, a family now living in the most extraordinary conditions in Clonmannon, paid almost £20,000 to Hilltop Catering Company Limited for the very dubious services that were provided by that company in the previous 12 months.  This was a company which was cash rich and if it had been properly managed, we could have looked on it with some confidence to give support to the people of Clonmannon.  At 2 p.m. on Tuesday of this week, electricity supply to Clonmannon was cut off.  The sewerage, which services the entire village, was put out of commission.  The retirement home was closed down and was in the dark.  The remaining three residents, when I visited the place, were sitting there with piteous remnants of their lives around them, waiting to be relocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 12 noon on Tuesday &mdash; I will not mention the name although it has been mentioned in the press &mdash; an elderly lady of 86 years of age was told by the manager of this company, whom I am prevented from naming, that she had one and a half hours to take her husband, who is 85 years of age, and relocate him wherever she saw fit.  That gentleman is a diabetic and suffered a stroke in the last five <Col N="771" /> weeks.  He is infirm, totally blind and incapable of dealing for himself.  His biggest fear on Tuesday was that he and his wife would be separated after a long married life.  They had both moved to Clonmannon, she as a resident of a bungalow and he to the retirement/ nursing home.  They were paying £20,000 a year for the privilege and they had paid in excess of £40,000 for a lease there.  In the final years of their lives they are getting misery and are being treated in a degrading manner.  When the electricity was cut off, the bulk of the bungalows in the village ceased to have any communication system with the outside world.</P>
    <P>In the particular case I mentioned, that gentleman and his wife had no way of communicating with anybody.  There was no telephone, no emergency bell and the area in which they were living was in absolute darkness.  There was a group of journalists in that estate last Tuesday night and to say that they were furious that this could happen would be an understatement.  All of us there felt sickened by what was happening.</P>
    <P>The management of Clonmannon nursing home were left last Tuesday with three elderly people, the eldest of whom was 96 years of age and the youngest 86 years of age.  The eldest, a 96 year old gentleman, was moved into a house which had been deserted for some time and which had no heating.  Also moved into that house was a 94 year old lady, no relation of his, and the two of them were closeted together.  When I visited last night, I thought the situation was unbelievable.  They were in the care of untrained people.  Guards from the estate were paying visits to the place, looking after those people, but they are untrained.  If there had been an accident or an emergency, there was no way to summon an ambulance.</P>
    <P>I left Clonmannon at almost midnight last night.  The scenes I witnessed there were piteous and appalling in any civilised <Col N="772" /> society.  In one household I visited, there were two constituents of mine who had a combined age of 170 years and they simply did not know what faced them. These people had paid £1,000 per month service charge in one case and in the other, £500 per month service charge, and they were fed sandwiches and tea last night.  When I left their house at 11.20 p.m. they were still waiting for a person to come to assist an elderly person, who could not be handled, into bed.</P>
    <P>Hilltop Catering Company Limited is supposed to be a care firm.  It deals with frail, elderly and vulnerable human beings.  In my view, it deals with them in the most despicable fashion.  It milks people dry and now it is providing them with derisory services.  There is a sound basis now for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to put an inspector, an examiner or a designated official into this company.  My arguments in favour of this course of action are not based entirely on emotion.  They are based on the facts as they have been presented.</P>
    <P>Since we last discussed this matter, the issue of Clonmannon and its financial affairs were the subject of a High Court hearing.  In an affidavit sworn at that hearing, of which I have a copy, it was said that the care company was in funds, was operating on a profitable basis and would have a surplus of £26,000 for 1993. Yet, on Tuesday of this week, the manager of that company could tell the press there was no money to pay any of the outstanding bills.  When I challenged him personally in front of witnesses with the extraordinary discrepancy between the sworn affidavit and the facts as they now presented themselves, my protestations were dismissed.  It was suggested to me that one has to say certain things in affidavits in court.  If that is that company's way of dealing with the courts of this land, it is further evidence that it should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>We are in a difficult area and having discussed this with Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, I understand fully <Col N="773" /> that we are in new territory in company law.  Equally, I understand and accept absolutely her personal commitment to doing something in this area within the law.  I understand her hands are tied. However, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment could now send a strong message to cowboy operators who wish to exploit the old and the vulnerable. It is time we called a halt to these disgraceful operations.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Roche for raising this matter again.  This issue was discussed in the House on 17 December last.  Since then, there have been legal developments in that there have been court hearings on particular matters relating to it.  The scenes, as depicted by Senator Roche and in what we have read, are uncivilised and inhumane &mdash; and these are mild words in the circumstances. We are dealing with people of a particular age who are very vulnerable to changes in their living arrangements, who are being turfed out of their accommodation and are being subjected to unbelievable behaviour.  These people paid well for what they thought was going to be a decent living environment for them in their declining years.  To impose on them the type of indignity, harassment and ejectment to which they have been subjected is intolerable.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and the Eastern Health Board have been emphatic in dealing with the matter, in so far as they can make adequate arrangements for the care of these people at short notice.  I am satisfied that the immediate health needs of these people have been attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this is not the topic raised by Senator Roche tonight, although he has paid tribute to the health board and was pleased to note that when the emergency presented itself, the health board coped as best it could.  Indeed, this situation should never have arisen especially for people of that age, nor <Col N="774" /> should people be subjected to what I have described as inhumane treatment.</P>
    <P>Following the debate in this House in December 1993, the matter took a legal turn.  The Government made its preliminary investigation through the Department of Employment and Enterprise. Given the fresh evidence which Senator Roche has produced this evening together with the legal advice he obtained as to the scope of the investigations which could by undertaken by the Department, I would be pleased to take that legal advice and present it to the Department's legal advisers.</P>
    <P>We pay lip service to how we treat our old and how they are entitled to a place in the sun.  These people have paid dearly for their place in the sun.  Their hope that Clonmannon would be a gentle place of retirement has become a hurley-burley world of late night excursions, fear of what the next hour and the next morning will bring and a constant, pervasive worry as to the next development in the saga. However we cope with an uncertain situation in the whole of our health, we should not and must not tolerate the situation where people of that age have to live with the uncertainty, fear and tremulous anticipation of what the next hour will bring.</P>
    <P>Based on what has happened since December 1993, the advice which my Department has received and the fresh information Senator Roche has brought to the House this evening, in the morning we will seek to start afresh on what might be done under the Companies Act.  We are living in 1994, it is cold February weather and these are elderly people.  For heaven's sake, use common sense and employ a modicum of proper behaviour, one human being to a group of people who have fallen prey to the misapprehensions and misconceptions of the situation.  For goodness sake, give these people back their dignity; they have paid for it.  This is a common sense plea, it is not expressed from any perch within a Department.  It is made from somebody <Col N="775" /> listening to the story, reading about it and knowing that what is happening is wrong.</P>
    <P>Returning to the issue posed by Senator Roche, the Department will renew its investigations in the area you have highlighted this evening and I hope this saga will be concluded.</P>
