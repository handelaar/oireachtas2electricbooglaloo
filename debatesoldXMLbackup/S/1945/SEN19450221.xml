      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 3, line 20, to delete the figures &ldquo;1948&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;1950&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second sub-section of this section provides that the Minister shall not make an Order under this section after the 31st March, 1948.  That gives the <Col N="1278" /> Minister three years in which to make an Order, assuming that this Bill becomes law, not later than 31st March, 1945.  I rather think that is restricting him too much.  He will have to make a survey or an examination of various kinds before making an Order to declare his intention to establish a sanatorium, and I understand that it is not merely one sanatorium that is being considered, but three sanatoria. In that case it seems to me that he should not restrict himself to a period of three years.  I am suggesting, as an alternative, that the period in which he may make an Order be five years instead of three.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any great objection to the Senator's amendment in principle, but I should just like to point out that the purpose of the Bill is to enable us to approach the problem of the provision of institutional accommodation for tuberculosis patients in a rather unusual manner and in the hope that we may be able to proceed more expeditiously than if we operated through the normal channels.  Were it not for the emergency position, I would not be asking the House now for the special powers that are enshrined in this Bill; and if the emergency had passed, and if we had solved the acute problem of bed shortage for the treatment of tuberculosis patients, we would, of course, revert to the ordinary method of providing institutional accommodation, namely, through the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, policy has already been fairly well determined.  As I outlined in some detail to the House, we have a clear mind as to the institutional accommodation that is urgently required.  With the passage of time, we may find that considerably more bed accommodation than it is possible to provide within the next four or five years may ultimately be necessary, but we all hope that when we reach that time, we can operate through the ordinary machinery.  Personally, I think I would, on balance, prefer, if I have not this job done at the <Col N="1279" /> end of three years, to come back to the Oireachtas and say I have not done it.  Then I could ask the House to extend the operation of the Bill.  It is not a contentious matter in the Bill at all and I would feel just as content if the limitation were left as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain that I do not want to see delay&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary understands that thoroughly&mdash;but if there is a difficulty, and if he finds himself unable to make this Order within a period of three years, there should be no rushing at the end of that period and no likelihood of irregularity.  This is a Bill about which we would tell the Parliamentary Secretary that if five years would do this job better than three years, we should have the five years. There would be no necessity for any device to get over a difficulty imposed by ourselves.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has drawn attention to another matter and I think the Bill follows the right procedure.  It is far better that the State should act as the central authority in dealing with this problem of erecting sanatoria than that they should be the subject of squabbles between a particular Department of State and the local authorities. I approve entirely of the method followed in this Bill and, therefore, I am anxious to see that there will be ample time for the Parliamentary Secretary to have his proposals carried out.  If the Parliamentary Secretary says now that he does not want more than three years, then I do not wish to impose a longer period on him, but I would urge on him that it is better to take that period now than to have to come back again to ask for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that sub-section (2) be deleted altogether. Senator Duffy has moved an amendment to the proposal that no Order shall be made under the section after the 31st March, 1948.  His amendment is that 1950 should be substituted for 1948.  I do not see that <Col N="1280" /> there is any great necessity for putting any limit to the time unless there is some special reason for it. The ordinary course would be to give the Minister power to make an Order at any time he shall think fit during the currency of the Act.  I am only making a suggestion, Sir.  The Minister may have some special reason for limiting his own powers under this section.  Of course, the section itself merely empowers him to make an Order declaring his intention of establishing a sanatorium in any particular area.  The Order does not, of course, require him to carry out the establishment of the sanatorium before the date mentioned in sub-section (2), so that I think the section would be quite suitable for the requirements of the Minister if the limitation to sub-section (2) were deleted altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much more to say about it.  Senator Ryan, who spoke last, has put his finger on the really important point in the section, and that is that the Minister has only to declare his intention.  He has not to provide, establish and equip the sanatoria within a time limit.  He has to determine his policy.  He has to decide upon the geographical areas in which the sanatoria are to be established, and declare his intention to establish them, but I think he ought to have his mind made up in three years as to the number of sanatoria required.  Senators ought not to overlook the fact that this procedure is entirely abnormal.  Ordinarily, the local authorities would provide these institutions, and would get grants out of the Sweepstake Funds for the purpose.  It is in the hope that, on account of the urgency of the problem, we may be able to proceed more rapidly to provide a couple of thousand beds that I am asking for the powers here.  Too much time could be spent on the provision of these institutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a crow to pluck with the Parliamentary Secretary and I think I can do it under this section. As the House knows, my county adjoins his.  I do not know whether the House understands how close is the affiliation.  Under this section, the Minister has power to establish sanatoria.  I come to the point at once. Recently, a communication has come from the Parliamentary Secretary's Department to the committee of management of the mental hospital in Monaghan dealing with a new building erected there by the joint Cavan-Monaghan committee.  This communication suggests that this building, which is at present in the hands of the joint committee, should be handed over to Monaghan County Council for use as a sanatorium.  I should like some enlightenment from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to his policy in this matter, which affects not only his own county but the neighbouring county of Cavan.  The committee decided, on the letter from the Department, to lease this building for five years to Monaghan County Council and that decision is causing considerable perturbation to the ratepayers of Cavan. Perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us what exactly the position is.  Is it his intention that this building should be utilised as a sanatorium for County Monaghan?  Under this section, he has, I think, power to make an Order to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so but, if I have that power, it is not intended to use it in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of confusion at present as regards the position and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some enlightenment.  I do not suggest that the Monaghan people want to &ldquo;put something across&rdquo; their neighbours in Cavan, though I know that they are well able to do that in certain directions when they try.  The communication to which I have referred indicates that certain structural and other alterations to this building will be necessary.  If that be so, are we to take it that the building will be restored to its original condition at the end of the period?  If Monaghan wants this building, let Monaghan have it and let them take Cavan's liability on their shoulders in respect of it and relieve the ratepayers of Cavan.  That is the feeling of the people I have heard speak about it.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would clarify the position and let us know whether he is expecting more from us than he is entitled to receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect to have to deal with this matter but I shall tell the Senator what I can recollect of it without having an opportunity of looking it up.  It is not intended that the powers given in this Bill should be availed of in this case.  I do not think that they are applicable to the position in Monaghan at all but, if they are applicable, it is not intended that they should be availed of.  The position in the Monaghan institution, as represented to me by the inspector of mental hospitals and the medical advisers in the public health section, is that the new hospital, which was built with the intention of providing special accommodation for mental cases, is not urgently required for that purpose.  It was explained that there has been a substantial reduction in the number of patients in the Cavan-Monaghan Mental Hospital as compared with four, six or ten years ago and that, as a result of that reduction, the overcrowding which was a matter of some urgency a few years ago is no longer a problem.  While I say that, I am not prepared at this stage to state that good use could not be made of the hospital for the treatment of certain <Col N="1283" /> classes of mental patients.  The point I want to make is that the problem of overcrowding, which was acute some years ago, no longer exists and that, in fact, certain sections of the parent institution are at the present time vacant.  It was represented to me that bed accommodation for the treatment of tuberculosis patients was urgent&mdash;I think that we are almost all agreed upon that&mdash;and that, until such time as we could provide ample institutional accommodation for those patients, we should avail of any institution not so urgently required for any other purpose.  Having considered the matter very carefully from all angles and having taken into consultation the inspector of mental hospitals, who is immediately concerned with the welfare of mental patients, it seemed to me to be sound policy to acquire, by lease or otherwise, this institution, which will accommodate upwards of 80 patients and apply it to the treatment of tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that Senator Baxter attempted to mislead the House when he used the phrase &ldquo;handed over,&rdquo; but that phrase does not accurately describe the position.  If, and when, this building is handed over, that will be done on a business basis for a due consideration.  That is a matter for negotiation between the local authorities concerned, but it would be wrong to assume that those who are part-owners of the institution&mdash;the people of County Cavan&mdash;will not be adequately compensated for the temporary use County Monaghan may make of it.  As to whether the institution will be available for patients from outside County Monaghan, if beds are available there and if beds are required in any neighbouring county&mdash;even Senator McGee's county&mdash;we shall not allow those beds to continue vacant. That is the position as far as I can deal with it at the moment.  I look upon the arrangement as a temporary one.  If the local authorities had not agreed in the matter, it was not intended to use undue pressure upon them, but they have been very sensible and very helpful, and I believe that there will be friendly agreement <Col N="1284" /> regarding the payment of appropriate compensation to the party affected by the transaction.</P>
    <P>Section agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 24, before the word &ldquo;sanatorium&rdquo; to delete the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;any specified&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment for the purpose of making clear what the money is needed for.  Under the section the Minister may direct the Hospitals Trust Board to make payments out of their funds for the purpose of defraying the expense of the establishment of a sanatorium; and under Section 6 he may make an Order requiring the local authority to repay to the Hospitals Trust Board a proportion of the sum so advanced.  It will be observed that sub-section (2) of Section 7 says that in his direction to the local authority the Minister may direct the repayment of a specified proportion of the sum advanced.  It seems to me that in the first instance under the section the Minister may instruct the board to advance £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 just as he thinks fit, or as is required, without indicating in his Order the particular institution in respect of which the money is advanced. That is going to create difficulty for the particular local authority to which the direction is issued, under Section 7, because in that case the local authority or the combined authorities will be instructed to pay back a specified proportion for the total sum advanced, provided that it does not exceed one-third of the total.  I think that the only way that the local authorities can be assured that they are only paying back moneys advanced in respect of the institution taken over by them, is to have clearly indicated in the instruction issued to the Hospitals Trust Board the particular institution in respect of which it is being advanced.  Apart from that the amendment raises no particular difficulty.  It clarifies the position and I <Col N="1285" /> should imagine that, in principle, the Parliamentary Secretary will have no objection to adding the words: &ldquo;Any specified&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Duffy's amendment has drawn my attention to the proposal to delete the word &ldquo;a&rdquo;. I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary is going to establish three sanatoria and I imagine he is going to issue three separate directions to the Hospitals Trust Board.  When he has made one, I wonder is his power spent under that section.  I am not at all sure, under the section as it is framed, that once he has made one direction to the Hospitals Board to give an advance the board has any power to give another one.  I think that the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;any&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The draftsmen think that the draft as in the Bill is better than the suggestion in the amendment. Whatever the statutory obligations appear to be to different lawyers who have examined it, separate accounts will have to be kept in regard to each institution.  For the purposes of defraying the expenses of establishing a sanatorium under this Act Section 4 gives the Minister power to make an Order declaring his intention of establishing a sanatorium and he has power to establish more than one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

That has happened over and over again.  We are not quarrelling with the Parliamentary Secretary's intentions, but I am urging that he should go to the draftsmen and take up this point, as to whether, in fact, what we say concerning the construction is good or bad.

We have found that where there is a doubt amongst many minds it is often <Col N="1287" /> better that it should be given further consideration.  I cannot see the reason for the word &ldquo;specified&rdquo; but to me it seems that the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; would be advisable.  The word &ldquo;any&rdquo; is not exclusive, but the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; it seems could be.  I cannot see why the Parliamentary Secretary has any objection to the word &ldquo;any&rdquo;.</P>

If the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied, then the responsibility lies on him.  I ask him, as I intend to withdraw the amendment, to call the attention of the draftsman to the points made here.  There are two main points. One is whether in fact under Section 5 the Minister may make more than one demand on the Hospitals Trust Fund. The second is, what is the position of local authorities to whom a direction is given under sub-section (2) of Section 7?  These local authorities will have to protect their own interests and may, in fact, refuse to act on an Order made under Section 7.  In that case there will be power to proceed against them for recovery.  That means going into the courts and having these two sections interpreted by judges.  All I am anxious about at this stage is that <Col N="1288" /> the Parliamentary Secretary should satisfy his own mind that there will be no difficulty of that kind with local authorities.</P>

      <P>On this question of the diversion of Hospitals Trust Funds, the Parliamentary Secretary was very helpful the last day in dealing with the point I raised as to the effect on the voluntary hospitals.  I have since discussed the matter, however, with a very eminent member of a hospital staff and the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, as far as I could convey it, did not appear to be satisfactory to him.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that the hospitals could take steps to get the corporation to pay for poor patients who come to the voluntary hospitals, that, in fact, they should adopt, by analogy, the method that prevails in the country districts.  So far so good, but let us put the matter in a specific form.  A patient presents himself to the out-patients' department of a hospital.  He is certified by the doctor as being a fit case for hospital and he has to be taken into a bed straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these circumstances, it is suggested that the voluntary hospital should go to the corporation and say: &ldquo;Look here, we have A.B. from the city as a poor patient and we want you to pay for him.&rdquo;  Now the demand cannot go in that way.  The patient must pass through the official channels on his way to the hospital, that is to say, the patient must first be seen by the dispensary doctor.  The dispensary doctor must say: &ldquo;This is a case for hospital treatment.&rdquo;  Then the matter must go to the appropriate official in the corporation and in due course the hospital is informed that So-and-so is to be taken in as a poor patient.  That means that the dispensary district system must be put in order.  Until there is an adequate dispensary system which will act as a conduit for the sick poor the matter will not work as easily as the Parliamentary Secretary thinks.  It is not enough for the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1289" /> to say: &ldquo;You have the good will of the Minister.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary must go to the corporation and see that the dispensary system is adopted to deal with all these patients. The dispensary doctor must, in the first instance, examine these patients before they are passed for treatment by the corporation.  I do not want to pursue this argument unduly but I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to reply to the point I have made.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, seeing that I have no amendment down to Section 5, I would not be allowed to dilate on the section as Senator Sir John Keane has done.  But as he has been permitted to speak at some length, I should like to recall to the mind of the Seanad what happened at the last meeting here.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke, rather lightly, in my opinion, of the fact that Dublin Corporation, by imposing 1/- on the rates, could raise £100,000, and that a like rate would raise a further £20,000 from the County Dublin.  If that suggestion were put into operation, Dublin City and County would be mulcted for a matter of £120,000 for services which they were getting, up to now, almost free, services to supply which the Sweep Funds were originally created. We must throw our minds back to the time when the appeal of the Sweeps was international and the funds were devoted solely to the voluntary hospitals.  On that account a very large sum had been accumulated.  Through the Act of 1933 the Minister got power, more power and authority than ever he was entitled to, to deal with these funds.  Apparently, if he has his way, he is going to exploit that power to the very utmost, so much so that he is going to create a tremendous amount of hardship and suffering on the people in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take one section of the community alone, the Dublin Corporation tenants. Their rents are regulated by their rates.  Put up their rates by 1/- and up go their rents also.  These people are not in a position to meet any increase in their rents.  They find it difficult enough to live as things are. Again, take the case of industries.  An increase of 1/- in the £ means in one <Col N="1290" /> case, with which I am familiar, where the administrative expenses are up to the limit and cannot bear any further strain, another £100 a year.  Mark you, all this for some notion the Minister has of spending the funds in a certain way and making the citizens of Dublin City and County pay another £120,000 for services, very excellent services, which they are getting from the voluntary hospitals at present almost free. The international sweepstakes were organised to augment and maintain the funds of these hospitals.  Naturally there is a deficiency all round but nothing very abnormal.  If things were looked after in the right way, these deficiencies could be properly met.  I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary has in his mind against the citizens of Dublin City or County but why should he, at this period when people are put to the pin of their collar to try to live, disturb fairly settled conditions?  We have rent restrictions, but these will not remain if the rates are going to be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>I submit that in Dublin, where the rates are at present fairly substantial, the addition of 1/- is going to make a very big difference all round. It will upset many things that are fairly settled as matters stand now.  It is not going to give a better medical service to the people of Dublin City and County but it is certainly going to put a very big financial burden on them.  I want to put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that the citizens of Dublin are getting very excellent services from the voluntary hospitals at present.</P>

      <P>I do not know that there is very much more to be said on that.  I do submit, Sir, that the encroachment on the Hospitals Trust Fund in this case is serious enough, but, if the Parliamentary Secretary persists in his declared intention of asking the citizens of Dublin City and County to contribute for every patient in the hospitals, it is going to put a very heavy burden on the people in the city and county.  Earlier on, there was a reference to the fact that the Minister could not make an Order after 1948, and somebody wanted that extended to 1950.  I would suggest that, if the Parliamentary Secretary persists in his present attitude towards the voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin, some other Government will be dealing with the administration of the sanatoria in 1950, because the citizens of Dublin are not going quietly to look on at the imposition of this enormous amount of money, when there is really no need for it.  Appeals have been made to the world in order to accumulate those funds, and now they are <Col N="1292" /> going to be spent at the whim of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not think that is good enough, and I do not think it should go unchallenged.  Certainly, it will be duly noted through the length and breadth of the land. Further, I will say in conclusion that, if this attitude is persisted in, the appeal of the sweepstakes will lose its effect and value.  In the last analysis, I do not think it is very suitable or becoming that the Government should make such inroads on the funds of a voluntary organisation in the country.</P>

The wording here indicates to me that only the land and the equipment would be handed over; there is no mention of <Col N="1293" /> the sanatorium building itself.  I referred to the definitions in sub-section (2), but did not receive much enlightenment.  I should like to be assured that the draftsman is satisfied with the wording of this sub-section.

      <P>On the section, I should like to raise a point which is not clear to me, although perhaps it might be if I were more familiar with the general laws relating to those matters.  This section provides for the transfer of the sanatorium to a county authority or to a group of authorities.  In the section, so far as I can see, no provision is made for the establishment of a board or committee or organisation to control the institution when it is transferred to a group of local authorities.  Let us assume for a moment that the sanatorium erected in the west is to be vested in two or three county councils. It seems to me that there must be provision somewhere for the establishment of a board of control, or a joint committee <Col N="1294" /> of management, or some similar body.  It is not provided in the section. Perhaps there is provision elsewhere which has escaped my notice.</P>

      <P>To add immediately after sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) Where in pursuance of any vesting order, a sanatorium is established on land vested in the Minister, the Minister shall pay to every person who suffers or who is likely to suffer any damage by reason of such establishment, compensation in respect of such damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates what I am trying to get at in this amendment, although I admit that it is rather difficult to phrase the amendment in exact wording.  I should say, in the first place, that I want it to be absolutely clear that it must be left to the unfettered discretion of his medical advisers, in any way they want, to take any particular piece of land.  I do not want <Col N="1297" /> that particular discretion to be fettered in any way, since I realise that the particular piece of land concerned, or the site concerned, must be taken over in certain circumstances, but I do say &mdash;and I have said it on another occasion in connection with another matter &mdash;that when the interests of a private individual are being interfered with, the State should make up to that individual for whatever loss he may incur.  What I have in mind, for instance, is that when the State takes up a site next to, say, a private school, in order to put up a sanatorium there, the result may be that that school may be completely blotted out.  Parents might feel, whether reasonably or not, that they could not send their children to a school in the vicinity of which such a sanatorium had been erected.  Now, since no land belonging to the school had been taken over, there is no provision for compensation in the Bill, and I want to be quite clear that, in some shape or form, it should be laid down that such a right should not be continued for ever, or that at any determined time a sanatorium site could be taken over without regard to the rights of the people concerned.  That is the reason why I put in the words &ldquo;likely to suffer&rdquo;.  The phraseology of the amendment may not be right, but it is the principle with which I am concerned, and I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider the fact that the establishment of a sanatorium in a particular district may very injuriously affect the livelihood of some individuals in that district, and that, if that livelihood is to be affected, the State should bear the loss of the individual concerned.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Senator Sweetman in his amendment in regard to this matter.  I should like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a lot of what one might call muddled thinking in this country as regards certain institutions and localities which would be dealing with tuberculosis patients.  Accordingly, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should give careful consideration to Senator Sweetman's amendment.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary ought to view this <Col N="1298" /> matter on the lines of the broad principle that Senator Sweetman has already explained.</P>
      <P>These things cannot, by any means, be reduced to a rule of thumb, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should realise that there are certain localities where there are already sanatoria or hydros, and that if he suddenly decides to institute an anti-tuberculosis institution in another district, there is definitely going to be a rather reactionary feeling, commercially, towards that locality.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary understands, and can explain much better than I can, exactly the kind of feeling I am trying to express, and I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary, in his wisdom, will find some means of explaining to this House, during the Committee Stage, exactly how he intends to deal with this aspect of the problem.  Then, possibly, on the Report Stage, we will be able to get together and deal with that aspect of the problem more coherently.</P>

      <P>I think the principle of this amendment is very objectionable.  If the State establishes a sanatorium in a particular district, we could not allow every difficult person with house property in the vicinity to claim that its value had depreciated. It would be an impossible principle for us to bring into an enactment and besides I think the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to explain that there should be no depreciation.  It would be a pity that any member of this House should create the impression that because a sanatorium is established in a district, it is going to be deleterious in any way to the health of the people in the vicinity, or that it could in any way depreciate their property.  It would be a wrong principle to introduce in legislation, because we would still be contributing to this silly dread of anything connected with tuberculosis.  We have pretty well come to the conclusion that tuberculosis is not such a desperate disease when so many people get cured of it, and we cannot insert a proviso, that, because the sanatorium is established, the district is to step down in the social scale, so far as property <Col N="1299" /> value is concerned.  It would be a bad principle to insert in our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that Senator Sweetman will not press this amendment.  It is an entirely new principle. We have over a long number of years established sanatoria in different areas, and the question of consequential damages to the neighbouring community has never been raised before. I think it would be a mistake to raise it now, and I feel that the line of thought pursued by Senator O'Donovan is sound.  I rather take the view that the establishment of sanatoria of the dimensions we have in mind will, in fact, be assets to the particular districts.  There will be water, sewerage, and electricity available where these amenities have not been available before.</P>
      <P>Let us picture a sanatorium of 1,000 beds, with upwards of 400 of a staff. It seems to me that the adjoining land will become valuable, because shops will grow up, and perhaps places of entertainment will be provided.  And, indeed, the question would cross one's mind: Should the people in the immediate neighbourhood not be asked to contribute something because of the amenities we are bringing to their very doors?  That is the other side of it. The very suggestion that we should deliberately, by Act of the Oireachtas, encourage the type of prejudice we are trying to break down could not be entertained.  I do not think it is exactly what Senator Sweetman has in mind, but it would have that effect.  It would convey the idea that if there was a sanatorium in the neighbourhood, the local people should be compensated, because they suffered consequential damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is damage to property that Senator Sweetman has in mind, but, if you admit the principle of consequential damages, you are on dangerous ground.  I think that if such an amendment were incorporated in the Bill, that the Minister shall pay compensation to every person who is likely to be inconvenienced, it must lead to endless litigation, and at what distance from the sanatorium will it be determined <Col N="1300" /> that consequential damages are no longer suffered?  The courts might determine it, and the lawyers might have a gay time, but I am sure it is not for that purpose that Senator Sweetman has put down the amendment, although it would have that inevitable result.</P>

      <P>So far as existing sanatoria are concerned, I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary would agree that it could be used as an objection to an acquisition of land by a county authority that it was going to injuriously affect surrounding property, and it is because I do not want any chance of that to occur that I put down the amendment.  I do not like the wording of my amendment any more than the Minister, but I do not like the omission of some sort of provision in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that until such time as the social prejudice which we all feel should be broken down has disappeared, that provision is desirable.  If you had a school in one field and a sanatorium in the next, it would not, in fact, be possible, in existing circumstances, for the school to carry on.  The sewerage, drainage and light would be very nice in the building nearby, but if there are not going to be any pupils, it would not be any great addition.  I can see great difficulties in the way and the only thing I can possibly suggest is that if there are two sites suggested to the Minister, both satisfactory medically, he will take the one that is going to injure private individuals the least. That is as far as I can go.</P>

      <P>Though it might be tempting for the sake of scoring in a debate, I could not give Senator O'Dea a firm assurance on the heading, <Col N="1301" /> that tuberculosis cannot be spread by the sputum becoming dry and pulverised and the germs being conveyed by air.  While I say that it is a scientific possibility that has to be borne in mind, it is not in the ordinary sense an air-borne disease.  The heaviest source of infection is by what is called droplet infection, that is, by contamination by close proximity, sneezing and coughing, rather than by the wafting through the air of dust clouds laden with tubercle bacilli.  I would not try to mislead the House in any way&mdash;tubercle bacilli can be borne by means of dust.</P>

      <P>I think the point cannot be decided on scientific knowledge. You have to deal with known prejudices, and the point in Senator Sweetman's amendment is the question he raises about a school.  I have knowledge of an Irish college at the present moment, in an extraordinarily healthy position, and I think it is true to say that if the Parliamentary Secretary, in his wisdom, were to be advised that a site exactly beside it was a good site for a sanatorium, that mothers would refuse to send their children to the college.

The point is a practical one, but I assume, in the working out of schemes, that the Department of Local Government would keep it in mind.  Certainly, if it did do it, and it seems to have power to do it under this particular section, the people concerned would be left without the opportunity of making a legal objection. If they could do that under this provision, and if they did it, it would, certainly, inflict great damage on existing institutions and the damage would result not from the scientific facts but from the prejudice of the people, which prejudice, I entirely agree with the Parliamentary Secretary, we should eradicate, if possible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (4).</P>
      <P>The Minister is taking a double-barrel gun in this sub-section and I think he ought to take only a single-barrel gun.  If he offers Mr. A £1,000 for a site and if Mr. A says: &ldquo;That is not enough,&rdquo; then the matter goes to arbitration under the Lands Clauses Acts.  If the arbitrator holds that £1,000 was enough, Mr. A will have the pleasure of paying all the costs incurred by the Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary is not content with the very big stick afforded by the substantial costs of the arbitration.</P>
      <P>The arbitration may take a very long period.  Corporation arbitrations take about 12 months&mdash;I am almost afraid to mention the corporation lest Senator Healy take me up&mdash;and the person concerned is to be denied interest on his money if his appeal to the arbitrator fails.  With the exception of one Act, brought in by the Minister's Department&mdash;the Unemployment Relief Act&mdash; the ordinary system in acquisition legislation is to pay interest.  When a man does not accept an offer, he must pay the piper if he fails before the arbitrator, but why he should be asked to contribute in two ways I cannot understand.</P>

      <P>The sub-section, as drafted, is intended to induce the owner of property to accept reasonable compensation, when offered.  If he does not accept a reasonable offer, goes to arbitration and is awarded a lesser sum, he will not get interest on the award in the intervening period.  The intention was to induce him to accept a reasonable offer and, in that way, expedite the settlement of outstanding claims.  Senator Sweetman might <Col N="1303" /> properly argue that such an inducement should not be held out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, this works out to the claimant's advantage.  The arbitrator, having carefully considered the claim, having carefully assessed its merits and having arrived at a figure close to the amount which was offered, says he will give him a little bit more in order to ensure that he will be paid his interest.  Senator Sweetman might not like to admit here that that is what happens but he would admit it outside.  The claimant, probably, gets a slightly higher award than was offered before he went to arbitration so as to qualify him for the interest on the money.  I may say, though it is not of any value in so far as we are enacting a code of law, that we have only three areas in mind and that it is probable we shall not go outside these areas.  I do not expect any difficulty of this kind regarding the three sites we have in mind.  I do not press that argument, because a statute should be drawn as carefully as it is possible to draw it, but I would point out that the principle embodied in this sub-section has already been accepted by the Oireachtas without question not only in the Employment Relief Works Act, 1940, but in the Water Supplies Act, 1942.  Senator Sweetman will find in Section 16 (2) of the Water Supplies Act the counterpart of the provision here.  The Senator is entitled to say that, if we made mistakes in 1940 and 1942, there is no reason why we should continue to make them.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was discussing this Bill on the last occasion before the Adjournment I had mentioned, as the Minister himself had mentioned, that the Bill really only dealt with two things, that in the first place it related to the administrative machine by which these existing companies would carry on and, in the second place, it extended from £240,000 to £400,000 the amount that would be advanced out of public funds to the new company that was going to take over the project he had in mind. I suggested then that I thought it was desirable that the Minister should inform the House of the reasons and the qualifications upon which he had appointed the several directors of the company.  I do not mean that I want to know the personnel.  So far as the names of the personnel are concerned I am not interested, but I am purely interested in their qualifications, the qualifications we will say of Mr. A and Mr. B. I happen to know who they are.  I know one of them and, so far as the one I know is concerned, I am perfectly satisfied that he has the qualifications for the position so long as it did not cross his own private commercial enterprise.  But I think the House should get, so to speak, a picture of the manner in which the Minister has moved in making appointments of this nature and in considering the remuneration which these directors obtain by way of fees for carrying out their duties.  The Minister <Col N="1307" /> made the point that the Civil Service has not the technical knowledge that industrial and commercial concerns perhaps require, and the red tape of the Civil Service does not allow sufficient enterprise.  I am inclined to agree with him that that has been approved in respect of one industrial operation that was carried out under Civil Service management.  At the same time I think that we ought to be very clear in our minds when employing this method of dummy companies.</P>
      <P>These dummy companies do in fact mean that by their formation of regulations they had a complete avoidance of the fundamental regulations of the Civil Service, which we like sometimes to sneer at as red tape, but which were designed for integrity, economy and Parliamentary control.  We must be certain that in giving us those regulations we are getting something that is very considerable.  This is not a new question at all.  It is a question that was discussed in the first place by the Banking Commission, and was discussed at very great length by the Vocational Commission, which reported to the Government on the 4th November, 1943.  Even at the risk of boring Senators with knowledge that they have already acquired through the reading of the Report of the Vocational Commission, I do think it is worth while to refresh their memories on one or two paragraphs.  If we refer to paragraphs 4, 7 and 8, on page 298, we see this sentence: &ldquo;The Banking Commission pointed out that some of them&rdquo;&mdash;(they, of course, are references to these companies)&mdash;&ldquo;that some of them were established without legislative authority, that they, often received public funds to a large extent, and that there is an evasion of Parliamentary responsibility as regards both policy and accounting to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, so far as this company is concerned, the position, I understand, is that the Comptroller and Auditor-General does audit accounts which are laid on the Table of the House, but I will deal with a certain deficiency in these accounts as presented.  Be that as it may, the Comptroller and <Col N="1308" /> Auditor-General, although accounting in the way he does, is purely dealing with it not as an investigator but as a checker, if I might use that word.  One of the worst things I felt in regard to the accounts of these particular companies was that there was only a consolidated profit and loss account and a consolidated balance sheet.  I find that the Vocational Commission in their report used very strong words of criticism in respect to the refusal of the company concerned to give similar information.  In respect to the Dairy Disposals Board, the Slievardagh Company and the former Minerals Development Company, a report was made to the Department, and the report was there available on the Table of the House, but there was no effort made to produce a trading account.</P>
    <P>That trading account or that report would segregate into various departments the many different enterprises that were being carried on by the particular company concerned.  All these things were considered as I say fairly and fully by the Vocational Commission.  The Minister in the other House tried to brush aside as being of no importance the report of that commission, but it does appear to me that it is of very little assistance to set up commissions from time to time to report to the Oireachtas if we are not going to pay some attention at any rate to their representations, even if their representations are made on matters to which we did not quite anticipate they would advert when they were being set up.</P>
    <P>On page 430, paragraph 683, perhaps the most significant paragraph appears.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This method of administration is clearly fraught with great danger to the prestige and integrity of democratic government.  It offers a wide field for the exercise of political patronage of a very costly and undesirable type, for not merely may large salaries be given to persons as a reward for political services but large sums of money for capital and working expenses may be placed at their disposal without adequate safeguards.  It could provide an unscrupulous Government with a means <Col N="1309" /> of making a large number of persons dependent on it for salaries and wages and of obtaining electioneering support by promoting enterprises or industries in certain localities without due regard to economic factors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are very strong words of criticism particularly taken in conjunction with the fact that a couple of pages further on they state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There would appear to be little justification for appointing persons without special technical or business ability.  The practice of making appointments on the ground of rank or political affiliation is most questionable and is open to many of the abuses concerned with interlocking directorships and the utilisation of political personages for company promotion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was to satisfy myself that was not in fact what has been happening in regard to these particular companies that I suggested on the last occasion to the Minister that he should explain to us the qualification upon which the directors in this case had been appointed.  That may be all very well from the point of view of theory but we have got to get down to brass tacks and try to see if this theory has had any practical effect in recent years. That report was made in 1943.  We all know that the practice of the State engaging in commercial enterprise since then has largely increased.  There is, quite frankly, a danger that such an increase would mean that the very evils to which the Vocational Commission referred would be extended.  There were in the last few weeks proceedings in a case before a certain court, which have now terminated, proceedings which were of peculiar interest to the members of this House.  In those proceedings one of the witnesses for the State has alleged, on oath &mdash;and we must, of course, accept that statement without question&mdash; that he was making a sum of £12,000 net profits from a contract that he had obtained from one of those companies&mdash;I do not mean one of the companies mentioned in this Bill but one of those State-controlled dummy companies.  I have no means whatever of verifying whether the <Col N="1310" /> statement was correct but the statement was made on oath by that individual, that he had made, over a period not exceeding two years, a sum of £12,000 profit out of one contract, that that was only one contract, that he had several, and that he made that profit by sub-contracting the contract given to him by this dummy company. The mere fact that that could be stated in open court suggests that we have got to get down to the basic principle of these companies, that we have got to ensure that we shall substitute for the red tape that does mean integrity in the Civil Service, some method of control that is not there at present, some method of control that will ensure that nothing of the kind I have described can happen in future because we are dealing with public funds.  The particular person concerned on that occasion was receiving public funds when he said that he was making £12,000 in two years, that is, £6,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that I am making no charge against the Minister or against any director of any company that that was in any way fraudulent but there should be some method, something equivalent to the Committee of Public Accounts in the Dáil, whereby such a system of accounting could be examined and at least the public would know that the money that was being spent was being watched and checked by somebody on their behalf.  I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that the very essence of an audit of these companies by the Comptroller and Auditor-General as apart from an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of public funds distributed through the Civil Service, is that the Comptroller and Auditor-General will merely vouch that the amount has been spent and that he will not of necessity inquire into whether it was good business or bad business to spend it.  I do not think it would be reasonable to ask him to do so.  In respect of these matters I think we shall have to have something on the lines suggested by the Vocational Commission itself, that there should be a body of experts set up which would be invested with some such power as that of the Committee of <Col N="1311" /> Public Accounts in the Dáil, and which would be in a position to judge and to report whether in fact the public funds in this case were being used to the best possible advantage.  So far as this particular Bill is concerned, I fully appreciate that we are in the middle of an emergency, and one of the things done under this Bill is to produce anthracite &mdash;340 tons a week, I think, was the estimate given by the Minister.  I think it would be very inadvisable to do anything at present which would hinder our getting that 340 tons, or prevent it from coming in to assist the supply situation, but, on the general principle, if we are not going to have distrust of the whole system of State entry into commercial enterprise on those lines, sooner or later some such system of control will have to be established.  Therefore, I think it is advisable that we should ask the Minister to give to the House an indication of what his views are as to the future of such companies, and as to the future method of ensuring that they will be patterned to some degree at any rate along the lines that were suggested by the very diversified experience of the members of the commission to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that the introduction of this Bill seems to me to confirm the arguments which are frequently used by some of us on these benches, when various measures are going through the House, to the effect that they require much more close examination than they have been receiving.  We have had such an example earlier this evening in relation to another Bill.  Both Senator Sweetman and myself urged strongly that the Bill did not, in one particular, mean what the Minister in charge said it did mean.  The Minister was adamant; his advice was the best possible, and consequently we had to accept his view.  Here we have an example to confirm the little reliance which can be placed on assurances of that kind.  In 1941 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;not the present Minister&mdash;insisted that the way to get development work done was to proceed with two Bills, one a general <Col N="1312" /> minerals Bill and one a coal Bill.  He insisted that the procedure had to be along certain lines.  He got his way. There was a good deal of criticism of the manner in which the thing was approached, criticism of the suggestion that you must have two companies working side by side, doing much the same thing, because the Minerals Act of 1941 authorises the company to do everything except mine for coal. Special machinery, a special Act, was provided in regard to mining for coal. Subsequently, it transpired that the same persons constituted the directorate of both companies.  I think they probably have the same staff.  In his Second Reading speech in this House, the Minister told us that there was duplication and waste, and this Bill is now submitted for the purpose of undoing what his predecessor said was the only sensible thing that could be done three years ago.</P>
      <P>In making that criticism, however, I do not desire to associate myself with the kind of criticism which was made by the last speaker.  I think if there is one thing more obvious than another it is that the concerns established by the State to do research, to carry freight, to operate industries of various kinds, have saved the people of this country from destitution during the last four years.  Let us bear in mind when we criticise those companies that the State never goes into a concern except where the private capitalists feel they cannot make enough profit.  If there were going to be 25 per cent. dividend on coal mining, some of our friends would be in on the hop.  They would not wait for a State company. They would get in on the ground floor for the 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of shipping, flour milling, or transport of any kind. Wherever there is a profit, the gentlemen with the money to invest are in on the ground floor.  But when, in order to save the community, the State enters upon some enterprise of this kind, and fails to make a profit, the wise guys who are always after profit come in and criticise.  I think the public must not be deceived by that kind of humbug.  As far as I am concerned, my criticism of this Bill is a criticism purely and simply of the manner in <Col N="1313" /> which those subjects are approached, and the unwillingness of Ministers, occasionally, to listen to common sense, but I entirely approve of the steps which are being taken by the Minister to save this community by taking risks, where it is necessary to take risks, to establish a company which is essential in the public interest.  As a matter of fact, whenever one sees the Minister or the State entering upon an enterprise of this kind, it may be taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that there is going to be a loss, because, if there were to be a profit, the Minister would not get the chance of coming in.  There would be a race to get in before him.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to say that I am not in favour of placing unreasonable restrictions or unreasonable imposts on those concerns.  It is easy to come in here and make a case for having their accounts examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  But the Comptroller and Auditor-General is appointed by Parliament.  He is appointed to report to Parliament on the expenditure by State Departments on the money voted to them by Parliament.  It is hardly his function, and I doubt if he has qualifications to examine and audit the accounts of a commercial firm.  Those are commercial concerns; they are not State Departments.  Parliament votes a certain amount of money to the Minister for the purpose of establishing one of those concerns, and holds him responsible for the manner in which the money is expended, but in no other direction.  If we are wise, I do not think we ought to tell the Minister here that we are going to place upon him&mdash;not perhaps now, but in a year or two&mdash;these restrictions, restrictions which will have the effect of destroying the competence and the efficiency of those concerns, because what you are doing is proposing to get inside to find out, for the advantage not of the public at large but for the advantage of the investing public, the secret by which they can make money, when the concern is going well.  I do not think we ought to support that, and, as far as I am concerned, I am going to make it clear that, while the matter is not in issue now, if it were in issue, I would be violently opposed to it.</P>

      <P>I suppose that I am one of the &ldquo;wise guys&rdquo; referred to by the last speaker&mdash;one of the &ldquo;wise guys&rdquo; who is looking for an opportunity for a good investment, and will not come forward unless I see a certain 25 per cent. profit on my money.  Now, I share very strongly the apprehensions voiced by Senator Sweetman, and I do not share those apprehensions without some knowledge of the atmospheric or psychological background of this business.  I readily admit that in special circumstances, such as this war has brought about, a certain amount of legislation of this kind was justified, but what I am anxious about is to know whether these companies which were set up in times of scarcity, and in order to handle certain commodities, are going to continue in the same way after the war, because I feel that, if so, when the commodities concerned are again in plentiful supply, or in reasonably plentiful supply, the consumer is going to suffer, and to suffer very grievously as a result of this kind of legislation. One reads about these things in the paper, and certain approaches are made to one in connection with them.  Therefore, it occurs to me that the whole matter must be viewed in a different way.  For instance, people come and tell you about certain things that are happening, and if you ask them: &ldquo;Can I use that information?&rdquo; they answer: &ldquo;No, because if you give that information, it will be used as a black mark against me, and the next time that I look for a concession, or for some reasonable way of going about my business, I will not get the same chance as if I had been a &lsquo;good boy,&rsquo; and had kept my mouth shut.&rdquo; The Minister may say that this does not happen, but I suggest to him as a man of the world, and I am sure he realises that if a man comes along with a complaint of that kind, that man's business will suffer, or that, at least, he is afraid that his business will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy talks about the State only coming in to take charge of a business when the business shows no profit, but take the case of any business <Col N="1315" /> man who is offered a monopoly of shipping at certain rates, combined with marine insurance.  I think the Minister knows what I am talking about here, and that is, the question of the interlocking of the operations of two companies, one in collaboration with the other.  Now, that is what is going on.  I can quote the Minister one example, and this was not told to me by any person who, I feel, cannot get into any trouble.  The company in question gave a quotation of £15 per head for taking cattle to France.  Now, that is the danger in connection with matters of that kind. I know that you cannot reverse the wheels straight away, but I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that he is anxious about this whole business and that he does not propose to continue this kind of thing after the emergency has passed.  I do not say that, in every case, he should be asked to liquidate all these companies, but I do say that he should view with concern the operation of these companies, when the emergency has passed, and try to get back to the normal operation of such companies, because otherwise it is as clear as daylight that the Government, having sunk its capital in these enterprises&mdash;the capital of the State&mdash;has only got to raise protective barriers in order to get a monopoly on its own trade, the cost of which, inevitably, will be passed on to the consumer.  In the nature of things, moreover, any company of that kind cannot be as efficient as a company working for shareholders and which must go &ldquo;broke&rdquo; unless it is worked efficiently. If there is not the fear of going &ldquo;broke&rdquo;, you will never have the full measure of efficiency.</P>
    <P>I might refer to another company that was set up in Cork&mdash;incidentally, to deal with a commodity ill suited to home production.  That company got into trouble fairly early, and the Government came to its rescue, and I suppose the time will come when we shall be shocked to find at what price that company will be able to sell its product, in the face of the world competition when the emergency has passed.  I want the Minister to assure <Col N="1316" /> us that the taxpayers, through their elected representatives, will have some control over such companies as I am referring to and that, as I say, reports can be got from the auditors of such companies somewhat in the nature of the reports given to the Committee of Public Accounts of the Oireachtas through the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the matter of the expenditure of public funds.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Public Accounts Committee, the Comptroller and Auditor-General points out in what way the money devoted to the various Government Departments has been spent, in what way the money has been managed, or mismanaged, as the case might be, and I think that the same should apply in regard to the accounts of these particular companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know that Senator Sweetman was going to raise this matter on this Bill.  There are only a few remarks that I should like to make.  In the first place, so far as this particular Bill is concerned, I do not believe that it is practical politics to have an extension of coal-mining or mineral development in this country by means of private enterprise, at this stage, at any rate, in the history of the country.  It is a matter which I have heard debated, in my opinion, rather wildly on both sides.  Some people say that we should have millions of pounds sunk in this country in mining, while others say that we have no minerals at all.  One thing is clear, and that is that nobody&mdash; even Senator Duffy&mdash;would be prepared to sink money in either coal-mining or mineral development in this country unless there was some prospect of profit. Again, we are up against the problem of how to deal with this matter.  It can be said, quite logically, that there is no use in attempting any development of our mineral resources unless the prospects are sufficiently good to induce people to invest their money in such projects.  I think that that is not a bad principle in general, but it cannot be applied when it comes to a question of national necessity; and the provision of coal, unquestionably, was a matter of national necessity, and if some such <Col N="1317" /> company had not been established, a great number of us, to put it mildly, would have been very uncomfortable, and a great many of our industries would have been very seriously affected Again, in this connection, we are up against the problem of management. In the case of a public company, with a certain number of shareholders, certain safeguards are provided by the fact that you have those shareholders to look after their own interests.</P>
      <P>Of course, we all realise that you may have annual meetings for two, three, four or even five years, at which only a few shareholders turn up, and there is very little criticism of the affairs of the company concerned; but as soon as the shareholders of such a company become suspicious that the company is not being well managed, that the directors or the management are being paid too much, or as soon as a rumour gets around that the agents of the company are making too much out of it, you will very soon find that the shareholders will attend and ask for an explanation and that, if the directors of the company do not give a satisfactory explanation, the shareholders will take action.  That, certainly, provides a check on the activities of the company, except in the case, which is unusual in this country, where the directors of a public company control the whole business of the company.  It seems to me that the practical thing to consider is how to control the type of State owned company we have at the moment, and I think that a certain number of them will be inevitable for many years to come.  I think the Minister has already said that he would much prefer&mdash;I gathered this from his speeches&mdash;to see privately-owned concerns developing in this country.  So far as the principle is concerned, there might be very little difference, but the fact remains that we have got some such companies operating at the moment which are controlled by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But as regards this other type of company, I think we should consider whether any machinery can be found which will adequately take the place of shareholders' meetings.  I know nothing whatever about the case <Col N="1318" /> cited by Senator Sweetman, but if an agent of one of these companies is making what seems clearly to be an excessive amount out of the contracts given by it, and if that happened in the ordinary public company and came before a court in evidence, I can guarantee that there would be a full attendance of shareholders at the next annual meeting wanting to know something about it.  It is not clear what takes the place of these shareholders' meetings.  Can the Minister do it, or is it his function?</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Comptroller and Auditor-General really provides a solution, although it may be convenient that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General should act as Auditors.  Auditors have a definite function in the finding of irregularities, but it is not the function of an auditor, generally speaking, to take any responsibility for the efficient management of the business.  His duty is to see that the accounts are kept properly, that everything is straightforward and that there are no irregularities, but, obviously, the accountancy profession would be quite incapable, as a profession, to provide criticism of the various industries that have existed in this country.</P>
    <P>The practical problem seems to be one of finding a way out by which the shareholders' meeting will be substituted in an effective way.  I am not fully familiar with the procedure, and I do not think you have anything on the same lines in other countries, but I have been reading with very considerable interest some of the plans adopted by the Swedish Parliament. I do not want to be misunderstood as saying that they have anything to deal with like this case, but, in Sweden, a great deal of administrative matters are handled by means of Parliamentary Committees.  At these committees civil servants can attend to explain and answer questions.  It might be that a Committee of the Dáil, or, possibly, a Joint Committee of both Houses, could be appointed which would, as I say, take the place of the shareholders' meeting in the case of companies where the State holds the majority of the shares.  If that could <Col N="1319" /> be done on the lines of efficiency apart from questions of Party politics, and I cannot see how Party politics would arise, it would give a way out.  I do feel that some solution is needed and the Government will find itself that it will be highly desirable to have some safeguard of the kind.</P>
    <P>I imagine that although they may not be technically responsible, the civil servants of the Department do keep an eye on these companies and, perhaps, that may be sufficient and may have been the best way of dealing with it, because there has been a considerable amount of departmental control of all companies.  But, if we get back, as I sincerely hope we will in a comparatively short time, to trading becoming almost entirely free again, when there is the minimum control of companies generally, there will be a need for something more like the rules which apply to companies which are controlled by their own shareholders, for safeguards in regard to companies of this kind.  I suggest that it is a problem which must be faced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to speak in defence of the type of organisation which is represented by these mineral companies, because I appreciate it has defects arising out of its nature, which are, in my opinion, unavoidable.  I indicated the nature of these defects when I was speaking here in defence of the proposals of the Transport Act.  The Transport Act proposed the establishment of a new type of organisation&mdash;new as far as this country is concerned&mdash;for the control of transport services, and in justifying that type of organisation, as distinct from other forms which were suggested by Deputies and Senators, I gave reasons which necessarily involved some reflection upon the suitability of the type of organisation contemplated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not follow because this type of organisation has got certain obvious defects that it is possible to improve on it very substantially.  I do not think it is.  If the State wants to have certain commercial activities undertaken which because of their nature do <Col N="1320" /> not interest private enterprise, it can do it itself through a Government Department, or it can subsidise private enterprise to do it, or adopt an intermediate course represented by the formation on its own initiative of companies established under the Companies Acts, in which it will hold the equity. Of the three courses, I think the latter is the best.  I doubt very much if it is practicable to have commercial activities of this kind properly directed by a Government Department.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear whether the Vocational Commission considered that a suitable arrangement.  I find it hard to speak on the Report of the Vocational Commission because the nature of their report is such that it is not always easy to know precisely what point they were trying to establish. If they contemplated the type of Parliamentary control over expenditure by these companies as is exercised over expenditure by a Government Department, I think their idea is completely impracticable.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are Government Departments doing what might be described as commercial work, Departments which have to come to the Dáil with estimates of receipts and expenditure for the year under the various headings on which estimates are based, salaries, wages, travelling expenses, postages, telephone and similar charges.  The practice of such Departments is to get a Vote of public moneys to cover all their outgoings and to bring in as Appropriations-in-Aid the revenue which they expect to get from the sale of the goods or services they produce.</P>
    <P>It may be undesirable to change that practice where it has been established, but if we are embarking on new commercial activities, we should try to get something more akin to the normal type of commercial organisation, which will have the freedom of day to day activity which the normally privately owned commercial organisation has.  I think if we were to attempt to do work of this character, particularly mineral development work, by subsidising private enterprise, we would come in for far more criticism <Col N="1321" /> than is likely to apply to this type of organisation.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane asked me if we were contemplating the extension of Governmental organisations engaged in commercial enterprise after the war.  I think it has been made clear that the Government prefer to see industrial development through private enterprise.  But I think that there is a case to be made for the establishment of a greater measure of Government control over commercial companies which are in a monopoly position, whether that position is secured through legislation or is the outcome of circumstances not due to Government action.  It has been argued that where a monopoly position exists, public ownership should exist, but I think that the application of that principle in all cases would lead us into difficulty.  I go no further than saying, that where there is anything akin to monopoly, there must be a greater measure of public control than would ordinarily be deemed prudent where competitive conditions operate.  These companies were established to do a type of commercial work in which, at the time, private enterprise was not interested.  It would not be true to say that private enterprise is not interested in mineral development, because particularly in the case of coal mining, private companies have been profitably operating for a number of years without Government assistance or protection against competition from abroad. <Col N="1322" /> The difficulty which arose at Slievardagh was due to a peculiar set of circumstances relating to the ownership of the deposits and the exceptional circumstances of the time.  These conditions appeared to suggest that, if action was to be taken for the development of the deposits, it would have to be taken by the State.</P>
      <P>I may say that, subsequent to the stage at which the Slievardagh mine came into production, proposals and suggestions were made to the company concerned and, through the company, to the Government, that private enterprise would be prepared to buy out the mine.  These proposals and suggestions were considered but I came to the conclusion that the sale of that mine to a private company at present would be bad business.  I should not like to suggest that the idea would not be entertained later but, at the present time, when a great deal of money has been spent on development work and when the circumstances of the mine are such that we could not hope to get back from a private buyer the full amount expended, it would be bad business to sell.  I think that we should, certainly, wait until it is possible to establish the commercial potentialities of the mine by the installation of up-to-date machinery, working under normal conditions.  If the amount expended by the State upon the exploration and development of the deposit could be recovered and the mine offered as a fair, commercial proposition, then, in response to a firm offer, we might consider sale, under conditions, to a private company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider an offer from a rival company which might buy the mine to close it down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I deliberately inserted the two words &ldquo;under conditions&rdquo; in my statement and I had in mind the necessity for imposing, as a covenant in any such agreement, an obligation to keep the mine working.  When the State gives a lease of mining rights to a private company, there is always in the lease a condition as to working. In the case of the Avoca deposit, circumstances <Col N="1323" /> are entirely different.  We have got expert reports upon that deposit which appear to indicate that the quantity of ore available for working is very substantial.  But they also indicate that the proper commercial development of that ore would involve its working on a very large scale&mdash;far greater than is being done at present and far greater than has been contemplated for the future.  The difficulty about working on the scale at which, in the opinion of experts, successful commercial development would be possible, is that we have not in this country at present a market for the products. This is a composite ore, which, when broken down, would yield pyrites, copper, zinc, lead and certain other minerals.  We are now working the mine for pyrites only because that is the only product we can use&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At Avoca.  It would seem inevitable, therefore, that the working of these deposits upon the scale which the experts recommend would involve either the exportation of the ores or the establishment of industries for the processing of the ores. That, in turn, would involve a very substantial expenditure which could not be embarked upon without a very full examination of the commercial risks involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it not easy to speak about the report of the Vocational Commission in respect of its observations upon matters of this kind.  I have read the report of that commission on more than one occasion and I have been unable to come to any conclusion as to whether the querulous, nagging, propagandist tone of its observations is to be attributed to unfortunate drafting or to a desire to distort the picture.  The commission spent a great deal of energy upon its researches, and a very long time in preparing its report, and I think it is unfortunate that the report, when published, should be such a slovenly document.  I think that that is a fair description of it, because it contains an extraordinary number of mis-statements of fact which <Col N="1324" /> could easily have been rectified by a telephone inquiry to the Department or organisation concerned.  In some respects, its recommendations are self-contradictory.  I re-read the observations of the commission on these Government commercial organisations because I knew the matter was to be raised here to-day.  Again, I am not quite clear whether or not the impression left on my mind was the impression the commission intended readers of the report to get.  I felt that they wanted to be nasty about these organisations, and, yet, re-reading their observations, I am not sure that they did.  It may be that I got a wrong impression because of an unfortunate method of wording.  The observations of the commission on these organisations, their references to the possibility of patronage, the possibility of the abuse of Government powers and the misuse of public moneys were completely unjustified.  There was no attempt on the part of the commission to show that these dangers existed or to produce any evidence that Government organisations of this kind had been so conducted in the past as to justify fears of that kind.  It is true that, where the Government has power to make appointments, some element of patronage must enter.  I do not think that that is necessarily objectionable.  On the contrary, it is a means by which the Government can bring into the public service or make available for the development of particular industries persons of ability who might not get that opportunity through private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be said that any of the Government companies operating have been at any time directed for a purpose other than the maximum commercial results that could be secured. It is, of course, perfectly true, as Senator Duffy said, that most of these companies were established to undertake commercial enterprises that private persons were not interested in because of their speculative nature.  In respect of these two companies, there is even more to be said because the boards of these companies came to me after they had been established and said that if purely commercial considerations were to apply they should <Col N="1325" /> close down and remain closed down until the war was over, when proper equipment could be procured.  There was no doubt as to the wisdom of that advice if purely commercial considerations were to apply, but I had to decide that other considerations had to be taken into account, and the most important of these was the need in present circumstances for the minerals which these companies were working. So much importance did I attach to it that I instructed both companies to proceed with the maximum output regardless of cost, to produce coal and phosphate rock regardless of cost, and to endeavour to secure only that the maximum quantities would be made available during the emergency.  They had been involved in a loss as a result, due to the fact that the method of working is uneconomic, and also to the fact that we fixed the prices at which they were to sell without regard to cost of production.  We fixed the prices solely with regard to the prices at which we wished the products which these companies were producing to be sold.  In fixing the price of phosphate and pyrites, which are the raw material of agricultural fertilisers, we arrived arbitrarily, first of all, at the price at which agricultural fertilisers should be available, and then we proceeded to adjust the prices of the constituent products so as to enable the manufacturers to produce at that price.  In order to do that, the mineral company has been required to produce at a loss. Both pyrites and phosphate are produced by an extraordinarily costly process, which involves actual hand-picking so as to get the type of material which the furnaces in use can deal with.  Nevertheless, it is available at the price which is lower than the price we pay for the Spanish pyrites we import.</P>
    <P>In the case of the coal mine, again the situation was the same.  The coal was sold at the price which we fixed, and the price had relation to the price of coal as produced from other mines, and had no regard to the circumstances of the company.  This decision to maintain the output of these minerals, irrespective of other considerations, was of special note in regard to these companies, because unlike ordinary companies <Col N="1326" /> they are working a wasting asset.  A company producing woollen cloth or boots can continue to produce so long as the raw materials are available, and the very fact that it is producing does not lessen its productive capacity for the future.  That is not true of a coal mine.  Every ton produced there is one ton less which it can produce later on.  Therefore, the decision to keep on working irrespective of commercial considerations involves not merely immediate loss in the present but some deterioration of the commercial possibilities of the company at a later stage.  That applies in respect to the phosphates, but it hardly applies in the case of pyrites because in relation to the total quantity available the amount we are taking now has no significance.</P>

      <P>The quality is all right for certain purposes.  I should like to differentiate between the purposes for which anthracite is used.  Sometimes it is used mainly as a fuel for the raising of steam or generation of heat, sometimes it is used in the process of manufacture, and no other coal can be used.  The coal must have certain physical characteristics.  We have never had any difficulty in disposing of all the anthracite produced. Before the war we had a commission which was set up to investigate the possibilities of increasing the output of anthracite in order to meet the growing demand.  As Senators are aware, the demand is increasing very rapidly, not merely in this country but everywhere. Consequently, the possibility of developing our anthracite deposits is important, and we can contemplate substantial development after the war.  It is notable that during the war very large numbers of private firms have <Col N="1327" /> interested themselves in the working of coal deposits.  This company which investigated portion of the North Leinster field in the Carlow area has since surrendered its lease to a private company which is about to work the deposits, and which is repaying the company a substantial proportion of the money previously expended in exploration.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy said that the introduction of the Bill meant that we had taken a wrong step in 1941, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce got permission to establish two companies.  I do not think that is entirely correct.  If we had worked on the basis of one company we would have made much less progress than we did with two companies.  A very great deal of development work had to be undertaken rapidly and the work proceeded simultaneously in Slievardagh, Avoca and at the phosphate deposits in County Clare because we had these separate organisations.  A stage was reached when the coal mine at Slievardagh came into production and it became obvious that there were certain aspects which would limit the output of coal.  At that stage I decided that the coal output was never likely to be able to carry alone the superstructure of a managing director, <Col N="1328" /> board of directors and a mine manager.  Nor did I think it necessary once development stage was over.  I decided a combination was desirable, and to abolish a separate organisation for the working of Slievardagh mine.  I do not think it would have been possible earlier.  I think Senator Duffy was wrong in saying that the same persons were directors of both companies at an early stage.  That is not so.  It is only since last year that the same persons were appointed to the boards of each company and the same staff utilised.</P>

      <P>In 1944.  The companies were originally separate organisations under two separate managing directors who were officers seconded from the Electricity Supply Board and with separate staffs and technical advisers.  Now there is only one organisation under one board of directors and one managing director, with separate managers, however, for each of the mining activities in which they are interested.  I do not know whether Senator Sweetman requires me to give the names of the directors of the company.</P>

      <P>Their main qualifications were that they were considered the persons best suited to run this enterprise.  I could not say more than that.  There is amongst them a professor of engineering.  I do not want to say that he is the best professor of engineering in the country.  He was appointed because of certain personal qualities as well as on account of his professional qualifications.  There is also a coal merchant who happens to be a very representative coal merchant. Again I should not like to say that he is the best coal merchant we could secure, but I think his personal qualities and his representative character justify his appointment.  In the selection of those individuals, the matter was eased for me by reason of the fact that I had twice the number to choose <Col N="1329" /> from the members of the former boards of both companies.  When they were amalgamated a number of former directors had to cease to be directors and I limited the selection to those who were directors of one or other of the companies at the time.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane wanted to know whether these companies would be continued in existence after the war.  I want to make it quite clear that we are not establishing this company as an emergency company and it is intended that these enterprises will be continued after the war. It is hoped that after the war we may recover some of the money lost on them.  Certainly, so far as Slievardagh is concerned there should be no difficulty in maintaining an increased output and selling it remuneratively if the necessary machinery can be obtained. I would be less confident about Clare phosphate.  Apart from the fact that the phosphate rock there is particularly costly to win because it has to be done by mining, the known area of the deposit is limited and I raise as a general question the desirability of exhausting that deposit in times of peace when supplies can be obtained from abroad, rather than leaving some portion of it as an emergency reserve against a similar situation which might arise in future, when imports could not be procured.  I have mentioned that the Avoca deposit, which is the only one worked at the moment, is the subject of an expert examination, and the experts' report seems to indicate that it has very definite commercial possibilities, provided it is worked on a scale far larger than we had previously contemplated.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister answer this question?  A report has been laid on the Table of the House in regard to this company.  That report deals with nine separate trading ventures.  Does he obtain from the company concerned a trading account in respect of each venture so that he and the Department can judge each venture on its own?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say, arising out of Senator Douglas's remarks, <Col N="1331" /> that there is probably no shareholder in a private company who is so insistent on obtaining information, or who is so critical of the administration of the directors of each company, as the Department of Industry and Commerce is, in relation to these companies or that other Government Departments are in relation to companies for which they are responsible.  I think that in so far as constant inquiry as to progress or pressure of criticism can produce efficiency in an organisation, it is more likely to be operative in the case of these companies than in the case of an ordinary privately-owned concern. It is true that the Government, having embarked on an enterprise of this kind, does not like to withdraw from it, but it would be wrong, however, to say that it never withdraws from it.  In fact there have been such withdrawals in the past.  I officiated at the winding up of one State enterprise in the last two weeks.</P>

      <P>I shall send the Deputy a note.  Others may be wound up in future.  Neither do I think it would be incorrect to say that the Government has never shown any hesitation in replacing directors or managers whose competence or whose work was shown by experience to be open to question. I should like to say, in replying to an observation of Senator Sir John Keane, that Irish Shipping, Limited, engages in marine insurance and war risk insurance in full competition with the whole world, not excluding Lloyds.  Any business it gets in marine insurance is got in competition and by quoting rates equal to or below those quoted by other insurance companies.  If they offered to insure cattle going to France at a rate of 15/- per head&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>£15 per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or £15 per head it was because they assessed the war risk at that figure and probably the persons concerned, if the shipment had taken place&mdash;it did not take place&mdash; would have been unable to get insurance against war risk at a lower figure <Col N="1332" /> in present circumstances on a shipment to the West Coast of France.  I do not think there is anything else I want to say in regard to this Bill.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give legal effect to an amalgamation of the two companies, which has already been carried out administratively, and to permit of the raising of the limit of the advances that can be made to the company.  May I say that the actual advancing of money to the company cannot be effected until the Dáil has approved of it?  The raising of the limit fixed by the statute merely sanctions the making of the advance but until the Dáil has voted the money there can be no advance.  In fact, there is now before the Dáil a Supplementary Estimate to sanction the advances that have already been made under the existing limit.  However, the raising of the advances is due solely to the recognised need of acquiring machinery for the proper working of those deposits when the war is over, and it does not provide for any further development in the activities of this company.  If it decided to embark upon new commercial enterprises, to open up deposits in some other area, or to work any of those deposits on a substantially larger scale than at present, then there would have to be further legislation which would give the Oireachtas a full opportunity of expressing, its views upon that enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is of a very simple character, and is entirely related to the machinery governing the preparation of the electoral register.  I think most Senators are aware of the laws under which our register is prepared, but, in case there are a few who are not aware of them, I should like to advert very briefly to <Col N="1333" /> the present position.  The Electoral Act, 1923, and the Local Government Electors Registration Act, 1924, provided for the keeping of a register, and provided all the regulations for setting up a register, and for hearing claims and objections by persons who consider that they have a right to exercise the franchise.  In connection with that enactment, the register comes into force on June 1st, and it consists of persons who are qualified by their age and residential status to vote on November 15th of the previous year.  During recent years, it has been found very convenient to hold general elections in June.  In fact, the custom of holding general elections in June, if there are no untoward or unusual political circumstances, has become one which is likely to continue in the future.  The reason is not far to seek. The weather is propitious; the days are long; the time is just between the setting of the crops and the harvesting season, and, from the standpoint of the rural community, is very convenient.  Moreover, under the Local Elections Act, 1927, in the normal course we should have local government elections every three years, and the local authorities are empowered to choose the date of the local government election as being between June 23rd and July 1st.  The Government has received representations that the time for bringing the register into force for carrying out the necessary arrangements for printing, checking proofs, and so forth, is not sufficient, and the Government considers it desirable to advance the date on which the register comes into force to April 15th, and to advance similarly the qualifying date to September 15th.  We have also received representations from returning officers that if the election is held some time in June they have barely sufficient time in which to complete efficiently all the arrangements which must include for the most part the use of the new register.  I think all political parties would be in agreement also with the general idea that more time should be allowed for them&mdash;that they should be given more time to have up-to-date registers in order to complete their preparations for an election.  The Government considered <Col N="1334" /> this matter, and has decided to alter the dates as I have already mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a very simple one.  There are only two important sections. Sections 2 and 4 are the governing sections of the Bill, and alter the dates from June 1st to April 15th and from November 15th to September 15th.  All the remaining sections of the Bill are consequential amendments.  Important changes have been made in the dates for publishing the first Electors Lists, for receiving objections, for receiving claims, for publishing claims, for hearing objections to claims, and for the final period of revision.  There are statutory limits in between each one of these events, in order that the whole machinery for completing the register should work smoothly.  The dates have been altered to conform with the new date for the coming into force of the register.  There are only two occasions where the date is not altered exactly in proportion.  One is that allowance is made for the incidence of the Christmas holiday, and a total extra period of two weeks is being given prior for the final printing of the register.</P>
      <P>I think Senators from rural areas will note that, so far as provision for their electors lists is concerned, the revising officers will have better weather and a longer day in which to do their work. Equally, I think Senators from city areas will agree that the Bill is an excellent one from the standpoint of enabling returning officers in city areas to complete their work expeditiously and efficiently.  The Bill is put forward on the basis that a very large number of general elections and local elections are likely to be held in the month of June.  That is the sole purpose of the Bill.  It is entirely concerned with machinery, and is not in any sense a Bill having any Constitutional significance.  I think that is all I need to say at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion, standing in my name and in that of Senator Douglas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad views with concern the action of the Government in preventing the publication in the Press of a report of certain proceedings of the Seanad of Wednesday, 6th December, 1944, and requests information as to the grounds under which the Government claims the right to interfere with the Constitutional provision that sittings of each House of the Oireachtas shall be public.</P>
      <P>The motion on the Order Paper arises out of certain proceedings in this House on the 6th December last.  I was not present for these proceedings and had no knowledge of them; and, indeed, it would be fair to say that I had no interest in them.  I have no knowledge of any kind as to the merits of the question that was raised on the 6th December last, but what I do want to raise in this connection is that although certain proceedings took place in this House, the newspapers were prevented from making or publishing any reference to those proceedings.  Not only was censorship exercised against part of the proceedings, but the whole proceeding itself was censored.  That particular matter was raised by Senator Sir John Keane, very circumspectly and courteously.  The Minister's reply was very brief, and is contained in column 713 of No. 5 of Volume 29 of the debates of this House, on 6th December, 1944.  The Minister, in reply to Senator Sir John Keane, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have already informed Senator Sir John Keane that this is a security matter.  He has cited certain facts in relation to two letters, which are correct.  But, as it is a security matter, I regret very much that I cannot deal with it fully here.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we may say that that reply, <Col N="1336" /> although it is by no means informative, also is not discourteous, and I am quite prepared to admit that the Minister was quite within his rights in refusing to go into the matter further. I would also say that the Minister, under the powers he has received, is entitled to delete from newspaper reports, without any consultation with anybody, such parts of these reports as he thinks might in some way be harmful to our national security.  We may, of course, differ with him about the desirability of deleting certain portions of such reports, but about his right to delete them, or his responsibility for answering as to the deletion of such portions, I do not think there can be any doubt.  His right to do so would be quite admitted by every reasonable person, in our special circumstances at the moment, but what happened in this case was different. What happened in this case was that publication in the daily Press of proceedings in the Seanad was prevented, and I am at a loss to understand on what grounds such censoring took place.</P>
    <P>I have, I suppose, a fair knowledge of public affairs in this country.  A certain matter was raised by Senator Sir John Keane on the 6th December last, and I cannot see what was the reason for preventing publication of the fact that such a matter had been raised.  We all know that there is a censorship and that letters coming from England, or going to England, as the case may be, are censored, and therefore anybody can deduce that some of these letters are completely stopped, and that that is the source of the revelations, if you can call them so, that we met with in the course of the debate on the last occasion.  What I want to know is whether there were other factors, hidden from me or from other ordinary observers, governing the taking of what seems to me to be an extraordinary step in regard to the publication of the proceedings of this House.  It is an extraordinary thing that a matter should be raised here to-night in this House or, let us say, in the other House, and that no reference to it should be found in the daily Press of the following day. <Col N="1337" /> When you arrive at that position, Sir, I think you are arriving at a position where a gross abuse of the privileges conferred on the censorship by emergency legislation is taking place.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I may say that I speak entirely as a member of this House, and I think that Senators, generally, will agree that in anything that concerns this House or its privileges I have always endeavoured to observe and to try to keep intact the privileges of this House.  Anybody who is interested in the development of the Seanad, as a House of the Oireachtas, will be in agreement with that.  I only once found myself in disagreement with the Chair, and that was on an occasion when I thought a Minister had a right to make a statement which, in fact, he was not allowed to make.  From that point of view, and also from the point of view of making for ourselves some place in the affairs of the country, I want to make this case.  Article 15, sub-section 8 (1) of the Constitution provides that sittings of each House of the Oireachtas shall be public, but that, in cases of special emergency, either House may hold a private sitting with the assent of two-thirds of the members present.  They may do so in cases of special emergency, but in normal times, according to the Constitution, the proceedings of either House of the Oireachtas must be public.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;, there, is that some part of the proceedings, and all of them, if thought fit, may be published in the public press.  So far as the proceedings on the 6th December last are concerned, the Minister has usurped that power, by which the assent of two-thirds of the members present should be given to the holding of a private sitting, and on that matter I want to take issue with him.  The Constitution says that our sittings should be public, and that implies that the proceedings should be published in some form or another, or that, otherwise, the assent of two-thirds of the House must be given to a private sitting.  Now, apparently, the Minister, by a stroke of the pen, so to speak, puts us into secret session without consulting anybody.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that members of this <Col N="1338" /> House have responsibilities and duties and that it is actually the duty of a member of this House, when certain matters are brought to his notice, to raise them in the House.  He has the right to do so, and I think it is also his duty to do so.  When a matter is raised, and if the Minister concerned has a satisfactory reply to the charges that were made or in connection with the matters debated, the public has a right to know that the matter has been raised.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt about that, apart from the gravity of the matter that may have been raised, and I feel that the public should not be deprived of the knowledge that a certain thing had been raised in the Seanad, no matter what the reply might have been, and I am very much afraid that if such a thing were allowed to happen, as has happened in this case, it might be extended very much further and members of this House or the other House, as a result, might not be given the opportunity of showing that they were performing their public duties in raising such matters in the House.</P>
    <P>That, in essence, is my case.  We have adopted a Parliamentary system here, and the essence of that Parliamentary system is publicity in regard to our proceedings.  Of that, I am sure, there can be no doubt whatever.  You cannot have a democracy in secret. You can have an autocracy in secret or a dictatorship in secret, but the essence of any Parliamentary system is that there should be publicity for its proceedings.  While it is admitted that during a war there may be certain parts of the proceedings which might not be suitable for publication, I cannot understand how it can be argued that the whole of the proceedings must be deleted.  I would like to say that the Minister exercised his powers under the Emergency Powers Act and that Act was given to him with very great good will by all sections of the Dáil and Seanad when the war broke out in September, 1939.</P>
    <P>I can remember that the Government produced this Bill and, after giving notice of it, tabled what is called a guillotine motion&mdash;that is, a motion which would prescribe, by a majority, <Col N="1339" /> of course, that certain things would have to be finished at certain times. Now, the Opposition of the time in the Dáil and here, at once said: &ldquo;We recognise the necessity for emergency legislation and there is no need whatever to use a majority to get us to pass this Bill,&rdquo; and in one sitting the Dáil passed this emergency measure and the Seanad sat into the small hours of the morning to complete it.</P>
    <P>Certain safeguards were suggested and certain assurances were given. One of the promises given as to censorship was that it would be a censorship of news and not of views.  That point does not really arise now, but it may be well to raise it&mdash;because the practice has been that if something said in either House is not to appear in the Debates of the House, the Chairman of the House is to be consulted.  It seems to me that what the Minister is doing now was never contemplated by any member of either House when the Bill was being passed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I doubt if they were contemplated by the Minister himself.  It may be said that all this talk about Parliament and so on is British.  Mind you, the British have succeeded in their own country in establishing for themselves a very fine system of liberty, whatever they did in this country or to a particular man, and it is a very wrong thing that Irish liberty, having been vindicated in this country, should be used to destroy the liberty of members of either House, or to decrease the privileges of either House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has, under the provisions of the Act, immense power.  It has been well said by somebody that all power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  I would hate to see the Minister corrupted.  I am endeavouring to improve the Minister's chance of preserving his virtue by not letting him be corrupted in this particular way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact is that the Constitution prescribes that our proceedings should be published, and we have a right under the Constitution to have our proceedings published.  This act of the Minister, in this instance, runs right counter to those particular provisions of the Constitution, and the House itself should be alert to assert its rights, because this particular power could be applied not only to this House but to the other.  It could be applied not only to the particular matter&mdash;of which I know nothing&mdash; raised by Senator Sir John Keane, but also applied to any matter raised by anybody in this House, or any number of members in this House, if the Minister thought fit to prevent the proceedings from being reported in the Press.</P>
      <P>On those grounds, I move this motion, and I do ask members to take a detached view of it, not to take a Party view of it, but to regard it as a question which concerns the whole House and the privileges of the whole House, because if we cease to be interested in these things, and if we allow the privileges and powers of this House to be filched away, we are doing a bad day's work for ourselves, for liberty, and for the future of the country.</P>

    <P>I put down this motion, therefore, because I do not understand how there could be any possible reason for preventing the public from knowing that letters going to England are censored, that something was stopped and that a Senator wanted to know in a particular case, not named, why that particular was stopped.  I move the motion in the hope that the Minister will be able to give us some enlightenment as to <Col N="1341" /> the reasons actuating him in what seems to me to be a gross violation of the privileges of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>To delete the words &ldquo;views with concern&rdquo; and insert instead the word &ldquo;condemns&rdquo;; and to delete all words from the figures &ldquo;1944&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;Constitutional&rdquo; and substitute for the words deleted the words &ldquo;in so much as such action is at variance with the&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate, somewhat in a spirit of envy, Senator Hayes on the moderate terms in which he moved his motion. I wish I could use the same restraint or anything approaching it.  I am told that the Scriptures say: &ldquo;Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.&rdquo;  This offence against the privileges of Parliament took place on the 6th December, and I am afraid that, daily since that date, the sun has gone down upon my wrath.  I really had to restrain myself and my friends have often had to restrain me regarding the almost passionate terms in which I desired to express myself regarding what, I think, the House will be satisfied is an outrage on our Parliamentary liberty. I was unable to accept the terms of Senator Hayes' motion because, if the English language means anything, I think those terms are not sufficiently emphatic for their purpose.  If a person deals you a felon blow, surely you should feel something more than &ldquo;grave concern&rdquo;.  Here, we have a felon blow dealt at the privileges of Parliament and I consider that the terms of my amendment, which condemn the action of the Minister and relate it to the Article of the Constitution, are only reasonable.  Moreover, this is not the Minister's first offence. This is the third time on which, with good cause, the Minister has been asked to explain to this House the <Col N="1342" /> reason for the manner in which the censorship is being administered.  I have been an active party on all those occasions and I claim that I have done less than my duty in bringing those matters forward.  On the first occasion, I dealt with the Minister's general attitude towards the Press&mdash; censorship not of Parliamentary debates but of general news.  On the next occasion, we had that famous and disgraceful case about the book&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I merely wanted to make a reference to them in passing.  I shall not develop that question, but I may say that even one of the Minister's supporters was anxious on that occasion.  On this occasion, we have the worst example of all.  As I said, the Minister cannot claim to be a first offender.  He is a persistent offender so far as his maladministration of the powers which Parliament gave him, with all goodwill, is concerned.  I want to examine, at the outset, the legal aspect of this matter in relation to the powers the Minister possesses and the way he uses them, as distinct from the broader and wider political aspect of the case. For that purpose, I am afraid I shall have to weary the House somewhat, and take it back to the debates which took place when the Emergency Powers Bill was before the Oireachtas&mdash;first the Dáil and then this House&mdash;in September, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future was then uncertain, very uncertain.  We have passed through many anxious periods since then, but the dangers we have surmounted have largely allayed the apprehensions we then felt.  I cannot help feeling that this is a strange time, when danger is far removed from our shores, to commit this outrage upon our liberties. When the Emergency Powers Bill was being debated in the Dáil, in September, 1939, the main concern was about the liberty of the person and essential supplies.  But the question of the censorship did arise.  Looking back, I <Col N="1343" /> cannot help feeling that it did not create the concern and apprehension that might have been expected.  At that time, we were all anxious to co-operate, and we felt that the Government would use its powers reasonably. We were further justified in that feeling by the pledges we received.  Giving expression to his desire to take Parliament into his confidence as much as possible, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are just as anxious as the Opposition are to put our views before the public.  A meeting of the Dáil, naturally, gives an opportunity to the Opposition to raise the particular doubts or anxieties that may be in the minds of the public, but it also gives us an opportunity of explaining here to the public,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask you to note the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;through our speeches, what are the reasons for any actions that we may take here, and we are just as glad to have these opportunities of explaining our position as the Opposition are.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, in the same column, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is to our interest, as the guardians of the public good, to have Deputies here and to have the public informed of developments in the way they can only be informed by discussions in the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, what can be clearer and more explicit in these remarks than that the Government intended to co-operate with the public, and that the public had no cause for alarm or anxiety about the way these powers were administered; that the Government would be only too glad to meet and explain and, moreover&mdash;I do not think it is necessary to labour the point&mdash; meet in public and let the public know what explanation the Government were prepared to give?  Then later on, in column 169 of the same volume, the definite specific question with which we are concerned, the censorship debate of Parliament came up and the Taoiseach gave an answer to Deputy Cosgrave's queries.  Perhaps I had better give Deputy Cosgrave's question:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Can we get anything like a similar <Col N="1344" /> undertaking to that which was given by the Taoiseach, that is, that in regard to our own political policies here&mdash;our political difference or policies as the case may be&mdash; it is not intended to have a censorship?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach answered:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The word &lsquo;policies&rsquo; is rather wide.  In regard to anything that is legal in the ordinary sense, there is no doubt whatever it would be quite free, in so far as there might be a question of national interests in regard to our relations with other States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave then said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would not put it further than that, taking such matters as are discussed in the House, for example, criticism of the Government in connection with the business side of these proposals, and so on&mdash;there will not be any censorship in respect of that?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: I think that undertaking could be given all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was the Taoiseach's first reaction to the censorship of our debates as a good Parliamentarian, and as I believe a genuine believer in the rights of Parliament.  That was his sponteneous reaction: &ldquo;Yes, I think I can give you an undertaking that as regards your debates there will be no censorship.&rdquo;  Then he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Discussions here in the House are privileged, and the publication of them, I take it, will be privileged also.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then Mr. Lemass saw a little danger because he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is possible that a Deputy might state here information of high military value, and the publication of it in the Press would be very detrimental in our interests.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cosgrave: That is true.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the atmosphere that prevailed when these Emergency Powers Orders were introduced.  The Taoiseach was only too willing to allow their publication, with only just the restriction that possibly there might be matters affecting our national interests and that military information <Col N="1345" /> might have to be withheld.  Now we pass from that.  I think on that basis the House was quite right to trust the Government and to expect it to handle this matter in a sympathetic and understanding spirit.  I know the Government were given and had to be given very wide powers.</P>
    <P>We pass on to a later date.  In the same volume at the meeting on 27th September, where the question of Press censorship came up more specifically, the Minister who is now in the House laid down more or less the rules and general instructions under which the Press had to work: First, &ldquo;shall not publish any information which would or might endanger the security of the State, such as information relating to the movement or equipment of our defence forces, or matters which are calculated to cause disaffection either amongst our defence forces or amongst the people or which might prejudice the people.&rdquo;  In the second category you have &ldquo;matters which are likely to prejudice neutrality.&rdquo;  Thirdly, &ldquo;matters which would or might endanger our financial security.&rdquo;  Anybody who has got the most rudimentary knowledge of what goes on now and of what restrictions are put upon the Press even at this stage knows that the Minister has moved far beyond the spirit of those undertakings.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister, if he wants specific instances of that, to receive a deputation from the Press and let them place before him a whole list of most irritating restrictions which bear no reasonable relation to our national security and are being imposed by him and his Department from day to day.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the instance which has given rise to this whole matter. I am glad to receive a tribute from Senator Hayes as to the circumspect way in which I approached this question, because I admit that on matters of censorship I am inclined to be rather passionate.  I do not much believe in the spirit of compromise.  I read of a question at the Brains Trust on the spirit of compromise and the answer that convinced me most was &ldquo;too much compromise&rdquo;.  I believe compromise creates tepid water.  If you <Col N="1346" /> want a hot bath have hot and cold water and get the right temperature. The prevailing atmosphere in political matters is tepid and with due respect to the mover I think his motion is equivalent to tepid water.  I shall supply the hot water.  I have no doubt I will get plenty of people coming with cold water to dilute it.  I do not want to labour unduly the incident.  The House has heard of it.  A certain party had two letters, one with a postal order which was held, and the same happened with the cheque that followed. I went in the first instance to the Minister and he received me courteously.  He said the addressee was not in question; he implied it was the addressor.  I gave neither the name of the addressee nor that of the addressor in the House.  I simply asked the Minister on what principle he acted when he stopped the letters without informing the writer.  I think that was a very reasonable request.  No fair-minded person, even the most dyed-in-the-wool Party politician, could say that a question of that kind could affect our national interests, even at the most critical period of the war, when the battle of Britain was on and the Germans were likely to be in England within the next week, let alone now when the war is practically confined to enemy soil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that will satisfy the Seanad.  As I say, no reasonable person, even those on the Government Benches, were they to put themselves in the position of judge, could say that that was a matter which affected our national security. <Col N="1347" /> Yet the Minister, pleading, as he is entitled to plead, security, refused to give an answer.  I was surprised at that.  I thought it discourteous, but imagine my surprise next morning&mdash; mind you, it was a surprise, although I have ceased to be surprised at what the Minister does, he does such extraordinary things&mdash;to find no reference to this matter in the Press next day.</P>
      <P>A promise was given here when the emergency powers were granted that the censorship would not be used for Party purposes.  Here it was used with what I say deliberately was a kind of personal perversity.  I picture that something like this happened. After that debate took place, I have no doubt&mdash;I may say this is only an imaginary picture&mdash;the Censor rang up the Minister and he said: &ldquo;Look here, the Press have sent me proofs of what Senator Keane said at the meeting of the Seanad&rdquo;; and the Minister replied: &ldquo;Oh, that fellow! Knock him on the head.  The cheek of the fellow!&rdquo; No doubt it was a nice friendly chat between two colleagues. That shows the background of the whole thing.  It shows&mdash;and this makes me play the part of the hot water in this business&mdash;that the Minister had no regard for the background, the sanctity of the House in a matter of that kind.  Surely in a matter dealing with the privileges of the Parliament, dealing with the rights of the individual as against the Executive, one would have expected a more reasonable approach than this attitude of: &ldquo;Oh, they are only a lot of old gentlemen talking, a sort of debating society.  What does it matter?  Knock him on the head.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be exaggerating the Minister's attitude but if he had any Parliamentary sense, any Parliamentary instinct, any historical knowledge, any regard to his pledges, any regard for the responsibility of his office, any regard for the quasi-judicial position of a Minister of State, he would surely say: &ldquo;I must think and ponder over this before dealing in this reckless manner with the privileges of the House of Parliament.&rdquo;  I do not think he can <Col N="1348" /> take exception to some of us feeling outraged in this matter.  Looking back with a short view of history, on the position of Parliament, has Parliament not always stood for the people against its oppressors?  Even in the case of Magna Charta, it was a question of the feudal lords on behalf of the people against the Crown, of the under-dog against the over-lord.  Coming right down to the time of the ill-starred Cromwell, we see that it was again a question of the fight of the Parliament against the King. Later in our time, in 1906 we had Parliament on the side of Lloyd George in his fight against the House of Lords. Parliament was the great body that always stood for the people in some form or another, even in the autocratic days when the people were represented by the feudal lords.</P>
    <P>I hope I am receiving at least the sympathy of some of the gentlemen on the far benches when I plead the background of respect for Parliament in its historical settings.  The way such powers are used distinguishes the statesman from the tyrant.  The Minister had these powers, I know, but he must be judged by the way he uses them.  I say he used them as a tyrant. He has used them as one who has no conception of what Parliament and democracy mean.  He has used them in a way in which they might be used by Dr. Goebbels and Herr Himmler.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attributing motives.  I say that they are Totalitarians.  That is their philosophy and their ideology, but it is not our ideology.  The Minister is using his power as if we had a Totalitarian ideology.  He may say it is a good ideology.  A lot of people do say that. Up to a few years ago, and I have no doubt still, we had people in this country holding such an ideology, but <Col N="1349" /> we have not them in this House. Though perhaps I should not speak for other members of the House, I should be surprised if we had people in this House with a Totalitarian ideology. We certainly have people in the country with a Totalitarian ideology, and I say, whether or not the Minister has a Totalitarian ideology, he is behaving in this matter as one who had.  We hear a lot of talk about liberty, and people want sometimes to poke fun at liberty. I have no doubt that Senator Foran sometimes regards my statements about liberty as coming from the Manchester school, a demand for <i>laissez-faire</i>, a demand to be allowed to do what we like.  Well, of course that is a picturesque way of putting it, but none of us, even those of the Manchester school, goes quite so far as that.  Some of us think there is an undue amount of regulation in public life, and others think there is not enough, but we all admit that there must be, in these days of complicated civilisation, a very considerable degree of public regulation.  The only test of anything is a specific test.  Here is a specific test: We are a democracy.  We have got adult franchise.  Perhaps unconsciously, perhaps against our will, we have taken to ourselves the whole traditions of the British Parliament.  In fact, it would be very difficult for anybody to find any difference between the way we function and the way the British Parliament functions, except, of course, in matters like this, matters of administration.</P>
      <P>The basis of this whole democratic idea is that the people must co-operate with their rulers.  The people, as a sovereign body, choose their legislators, and the only hope for democracy is that the people should become educated.  How does the ordinary person become educated?  The Minister is surely not going to tell me that you get education in books.  I had a letter the other day from a person who was concerned with getting a girl on the staff of an institution in which I am interested.  The letter said: &ldquo;She has done very well in her examinations, if you call that education.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that was a good way of <Col N="1350" /> putting it&mdash;&ldquo;if you call that education&rdquo;.  Education in the real sense comes from life.  I do not want to tell the Minister what he knows better than I do, that the reading of 90 per cent. of the people of this country does not go outside the daily papers.  He is no fool; if he wants to keep the people in ignorance, he closes down on the daily papers.  In doing so, he is closing down on the reading of 90 per cent. of the people.  The other act of the Minister with which I have had occasion to deal concerns the reading of about 10 per cent. of the people&mdash;the educated people, from whom the leaders are naturally drawn.  But the Minister now goes one better than that.  If he gets his way, he is going to impose a mental black-out on 90 per cent. of the people, and yet it is suggested that we are making too much of this matter.</P>
    <P>When I am in difficulty in matters of political history I go &mdash; I am sure Senator Magennis will sympathise with me&mdash;to a famous Irishman called Edmund Burke.  I call him to my support on this occasion with some reluctance, because he has a public statue in this city, and we know the fate of our public statues in recent years.  Edmund Burke deals, in principle, very aptly with the present situation.  He says that in no age is the form of tyranny the same as in the ages that are past&mdash;that each age has its own special form.  I may quote these words of his: &ldquo;When an arbitrary imposition is attempted upon the subject, undoubtedly it will not bear on its forehead the name of <i>Ship-money</i>....  And when we hear any instance of ministerial rapacity, to the prejudice of the rights of private life, it will certainly not be the exaction of two hundred pullets, from a woman of fashion, for leave to lye with her own husband.&rdquo;  If I may paraphrase Burke, he says too that many a stern republican, after gorging himself with a full feast of admiration of the Grecian commonwealths, and discharging all the splendid bile of his virtuous indignation on, shall I say, Oliver Cromwell and William of Orange, sits down to the coarsest and homeliest job of the day in which he lives.  That I represent as the true picture of the Minister's attitude on this occasion.  The Minister <Col N="1351" /> was, at one time, the champion of the rights of the people.  He did his part in giving to his country this Parliament, and yet, having assisted in giving this Parliament to his country, he imposes upon it the tyrannies which he condemned when he was fighting for freedom.</P>
    <P>Well this is a sorry position in which to find ourselves after 25 years of self-government&mdash;that we should have to come to this House and accuse a Minister of State of violating, of deliberately abusing, the powers which the House has conferred on him, by preventing the proceedings of this House of Parliament from being known to the masses of the people.  Really, it is time some steps were taken about it.  As the Minister knows, there are numbers of people in this country who are prepared to go to prison in defence of those essential principles of freedom.  The Minister goes along gaily and light-heartedly imposing upon the people a mental black-out.  He will not, I am sure, send people to prison in regard to this matter.  He knows that by so doing he would make national heroes of them, and he has no intention of doing that.  Instead, we are having the education of our people in the ways of life prevented by arbitrary action.  I hope the House will realise that it has a very high and important duty to perform in this matter.  I am not specially concerned&mdash; although I should like it&mdash;that the amendment in the form I put it should be passed, but if my amendment is not passed I should like the House to express its objection to and reprobation of the Minister's action by a unanimous vote on the motion by Senator Hayes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamKyle" hpid="Mr. Kyle Mr. Kyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment proposed by Senator Sir John Keane. As I see it, apart from all the rhetoric, the point is whether the Constitution of the country is the fundamental law. I was reinforced the other day by a speech of the Taoiseach, in which he stated that the Constitution is the fundamental law of the land.  If the Constitution is the fundamental law, and Article 40 means what it states, then the Minister is to be condemned <Col N="1352" /> for abrogating that Article of the Constitution, which has always been taken as guaranteeing the liberty of the Press.  I am not so confident as Senator Sir John Keane that Senators or Deputies are very much concerned about liberty.  Certainly, they are not so much concerned with it now as they were in the days when they fought for liberty, and I want to say that, so far as I am concerned, I heartily endorse the words of the amendment as proposed by Senator Sir John Keane.</P>
      <P>Article 15 has already been quoted by Senator Hayes, who proposed the original motion and, on reading for the second or third time the proceedings of this House on the 6th December last, I cannot understand the mentality of the Minister, who deliberately suppresses part of the proceedings of this House because, in so far as he does that, he is guilty of abrogating the Constitution of this country and deserving of the condemnation of this House.</P>

      <P>My difficulty in replying this evening is that Senator Sir John Keane is not such &ldquo;hot stuff&rdquo; as he evidently thinks he is.  I was hoping that he would be really so hot as to engender some heat in myself, but I think that all the heat energy he generated here this evening would not even keep a ha'penny candle going for a half-minute. He quoted Burke, and I think that the quotation he gave from Burke quite properly explains my action in stopping the publication in the daily Press of Senator Sir John Keane's statement and my reply.  He quoted those words of Burke: &ldquo;In no age is the form of tyranny quite the same as in the previous age.&rdquo;  Now, Senator Sir John Keane was associated with one form of tyranny in this country for quite a considerable time.  The most dastardly form of tyranny which this country could suffer from at the present time is the form of tyranny which would deny to this country the freedom or power to protect itself.  That is the grossest form of tyranny, and that is the form of tyranny which Senator Sir John Keane tried to practise in this <Col N="1353" /> country, and among other reasons for the sake of teaching him a lesson I tried to prohibit the publication of that report in order that we could discuss the matter here fully and let the people of the country hear the facts of the case on both sides.  The Senator says that it is an outrage for a Minister to refuse to discuss in this House a matter of public security, a matter which the Minister has privately and publicly told the Senator it is not in the public interest to discuss.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane quoted what would be done in neighbouring countries.  Well, if Senator Sir John Keane had attempted to do in a neighbouring country what he did here, not only would his speech be cut out of the public Press, but also out of the public records of the House.</P>

      <P>I do not think that <Col N="1354" /> Senator Sir John Keane would be quite so punctilious about his privileges if it were a question of a Government that was not concerned with the welfare of the Irish people.  He is most punctilious now because he is concerned, so far as I can see, to deny the right of our people to organise and protect themselves in a case of total war.  Senator Hayes, so far as I can see, this evening, made a perfect case for complete freedom of discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas and complete freedom of publication, and I completely and absolutely agree with him on that point, so far as normal times are concerned, but we are not living in normal times at the moment.  The portions of the Constitution which Senator Hayes quoted were drafted to deal with the powers and privileges of Parliament in normal times, but there are other sections of the Constitution, and under them this House and the Dáil agreed to empower the Government and put upon it the duty of protecting the interests of this small, neutral country, while surrounded, as it is, by total war. Those powers were sought by the Government because the Government felt that it was its duty to seek them, and these powers were given to the Government by the Oireachtas because the Oireachtas believed that it was in the interests of the country that the Government should have these abnormal powers in order to deal with an abnormal situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few governments, if they have any wisdom, want to exercise such powers beyond what is necessary, and it was with a good deal of hesitation, and, in fact, only after a great deal of hesitation, that I decided to exercise the powers conferred upon me so as to enable me to fulfil the duty imposed upon me, as Minister, to protect the interests of this State in a time of total war.  The particular case out of which the whole matter arose, I am not at liberty to discuss.  In times of peace, when it is a question of national security, of espionage, or Fifth Column activity, such matters can be discussed in open court, but in the case of a small, neutral country, surrounded by total war, things cannot be done in that particular way, and the Government, <Col N="1355" /> if it is acting up to its responsibilities, must carry out its duty, even though it may be a case of seeming to exceed the powers conferred upon it for the time being.  That is one of the disabilities of being a government.  Now, I agree completely with Senator Hayes that in normal times the proceedings of this House and of the Dáil should be published, but I hold very strongly, since we have no method of procedure, such as they have adopted across the sea, of deleting from the records of the House, and automatically from the papers, proceedings in which members abused their privileges, that whatever Minister has power to rectify the matter should exercise that power.</P>

      <P>I am not here to educate Senator Sir John Keane.  If he knew anything before he made the statement he made here to-night, he would have found out the procedure in other countries which he quoted as an example for us to follow.  I will educate him to this extent that before he makes statements like that he should, at least, examine the facts.  I think it would be pretty difficult to educate him, because there is no one, only somebody who was naturally stupid, who would make the statement that it was an outrage.  If we are going to get hot about it and say that it was an outrage, he should not abuse his privileges in the way he did on the occasion we are referring to, and after he had been seen by a Minister and the situation explained to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the points that have been raised, but I want to make a reply to one point in Senator Hayes's speech.  Trying to draw a straight line from one point is a very difficult matter, and I do not think even a historian or a professor of history can do it.  This total war has been going on for five years and this is the first occasion, as far as I know, that a question of censorship of the records of the Seanad has been raised, so I do not think that Senator Hayes can proceed from this point into the <Col N="1356" /> disastrous future he envisages when all records will be obliterated.</P>

      <P>May I say that I can understand a particular part of a speech being deleted, but I cannot understand all reference to the particular proceeding being taken out?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>But there has to be another point before you draw it&mdash;you would want to know where you are going.  This is a single instance, and there are five and a half years of other instances to show that the conclusion to be drawn is other than that Senator Hayes fears.  In five and a half years of total war around us, no single proceeding has been cut out of the papers, even though I have had the powers to do it, and I would like to bet that if an emergency happened to last for another five and a half years, Senator Hayes would have very few other points. However, we hope that the war will not last long and that I will be relieved of the duties and responsibilities of censoring, either in this House or in the papers, what anybody else wants to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, at the moment I am responsible&mdash;I cannot shed the responsibility.  The responsibility cannot be shed by all of the Irish people, because somebody has got to exercise the powers that are exercised in every country in the world for the protection of their people.  I am not going to be shaken while I am responsible, by any name calling by Senator Sir John Keane, the new democrat, from fulfilling my democratic duty of making certain that when the Irish people want their affairs run in a particular way, it is not going to be interfered with by <Col N="1357" /> any enemy, foreign or domestic, as long as I can prevent it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, not the amendment, was drafted jointly by Senator Hayes and myself with some care.  The object was to give the House an opportunity of debating what seemed to us a matter of considerable importance from the point of view of Parliament and from the point of view of the Seanad.  We had no desire to engender heat and I am, therefore, not very much concerned with the exact wording of the motion. It may be that Senator Sir John Keane is right, that his wording would engender more heat than ours.  He seems to have been rather more successful with the Minister than I thought at the beginning of the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to follow the Minister or Senator Sir John Keane with regard to the general question, not because I could not speak for an hour or more on the general question of censorship, but because I believe the Minister's speech, of itself, proves a complete and absolute justification for the tabling of this motion.  Even he is not surprised.  He does not even criticise us for viewing with concern the fact that a whole debate of this House should be censored.  I do not know, and I do not suppose it would be worth while, even if there were an easy way of discovering it at this stage, whether the emergency powers, under which the Minister acts, give him power to take away the constitutional rights of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know, if this were to go to the Supreme Court, whether it would or would not be held that the provisions of the Constitution that provide for publicity include publication in the Press, and I am not particularly anxious even if it could be done without cost, at this stage of the emergency, to have a clear-cut decision.  What I am anxious about is that all the members of this House, no matter what their Party affiliation, should realise that the rights and privileges of one member, even if there was not another who agreed with him, are the rights and privileges of the House as a whole, and that it is not necessary to have even the <Col N="1358" /> slightest agreement, even to the extent to which some of us would have agreement, with Senator Sir John Keane.</P>
    <P>It is right to view with concern anything which might interfere with the rights of one member, but when, at some time, you have, as we had in this particular instance, a question of the rights of the whole House, then I think the Minister, on consideration, will say that it was a proper matter for discussion and debate, not with heat, not with accusations of bad faith against anybody, but so that it should be known that, even on a very small matter, this House was jealous of its rights and constitutional privileges.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if a member of this House deems it his duty to bring forward a matter and if the Minister, in the exercise of his discretion, says, as he said in this case, that he cannot reply because it is a matter of security, it is the right of the people to know that the matter was brought forward and that the Minister could not deal with it because it was a matter of security.  The only exception to that rule I can conceive would be if the publication of that fact, of itself, would endanger our security.  If it did, what should happen?  Senators may say that the Minister could do nothing because of what I claim and what Senator Hayes claims to be the constitutional right of the Seanad.  I respectfully disagree.  I think that the Minister, before finally censoring this debate, had a specific duty to consult the Cathaoirleach.  I think that the Cathaoirleach would have had a duty to call together the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I was for a considerable time, off and on, a member of that Committee.  I think that the representatives of the different Parties on that Committee, while very anxious to maintain the rights of the House, would also be anxious to secure that no debate should be so used as to interfere with security or with the national interests in any way.  I do not think that any member&mdash;and I include Senator Sir John Keane without question&mdash; would wish that to take place.</P>
    <P>I have carefully listened to the reply by the Minister.  I hope I am wrong, <Col N="1359" /> I hope I missed something, but the only reason I heard for censoring the report of this debate was that he wanted to teach Senator Sir John Keane a lesson.  He does not know the Senator if he thinks that that would teach him a lesson.  Even if it would, the Minister has no right to censor the report of a House of Parliament for the purpose of teaching a Senator a lesson, however much he thinks it would be in the national interest for the Senator to learn the lesson.  I am sorry that the Minister gave that reason, because it tends to turn a serious matter into a farce.  The second excuse&mdash;I do not use the word &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; in any unpleasant sense; I cannot think of a better word because the Minister did not give any reasons&mdash;given by the Minister was that there was no machinery to deal with a matter discussed here the publication of which would not be in the national interest. He has not at any time said, and I do not see how he could say, that there would be any danger to our security by the publication of the few words used by himself in this House or the somewhat longer but, for Senator Sir John Keane, comparatively short, speech made on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister did suggest that one of the reasons that led him to take that step was the absence of machinery such as, he says, exists in the British House of Commons.  I know a little about procedure in the House of Commons but, on the question of knowledge of the procedure in the British Parliament, I yield entirely to the Minister. I am quite satisfied that he should be a better authority on British procedure than I am.  I am not trying to make a point of that.  He has means of getting information on these matters more quickly than I could get it.  I do not think that the procedure is quite what the Minister represented it to be. I do not think that there is a Committee to take steps if a member abuses his privileges.  There may be a Committee which deals with the deletion of matters which would interfere with the national security. But the matters which are allowed to be published and which are broadcast, affecting the proceedings in the British <Col N="1360" /> House of Commons, suggest that that Committee is either asleep or takes an extraordinarily wide view of what it is permissible to publish.  I cannot conceive that Committee agreeing to delete the subject matter of our discussion on December 6th.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that we are not living in normal times and said he agreed with Senator Hayes so far as normal times were concerned.  Senator Hayes made clear that he was not dealing with normal times.  If any Minister or any member of the Dáil were to interfere with the rights of this House in normal times, it would be the duty of the House not simply to discuss a resolution but to send a Message asserting its rights.  The only reason we proposed that this matter should be discussed by way of motion was that it had not arisen in normal times.  There was a desire, too, on the part of everybody not to raise undue difficulties.  I suggest very respectfully to the Minister that the very fact that we are not living in normal times and that it may be necessary for us all, for genuine reasons of security, to agree to a certain measure of censorship, even of Parliamentary debates, requires that there should be considerable hesitation and consideration before preventing the publication of a debate which has taken place in either House of Parliament.  The last thing I want to do is to exaggerate.</P>
    <P>But I do want to make clear that this motion was put down seriously, put down not simply for the purpose of raising many matters relating to censorship which have been discussed before, and may be discussed again, but because we see in this a matter which will be very important if it ever occurs again.  If it became the practice, and if this passed without discussion, it would be regarded as acceptance of the fact that if it were undesirable to publish some portion of a debate, then the simple way was to censor the whole debate.  That, I think, is the main reason that this motion was put down.  There was one thing which the Minister said at the end of his speech with which I am in complete and absolute agreement.  He said that he hoped it would not be <Col N="1361" /> long before he, and by that he meant everybody else, would be relieved of the responsibility of censorship of any matter.  With that I completely agree and join in the hope.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane said that he spoke as an extremist, but he spoke moderately and even jocosely.  I am not an extremist.  I am a moderate, but I believe occasionally one can be immoderate in one's moderacy.  Until to-day I had not associated the Minister with either shamefacedness or cowardice, but I desire to point out that the only way in which his action as Minister can be construed is either that of a man who is ashamed of what he has done or a man who is afraid of letting the people as a whole know what he has done, possibly because he is ashamed.  In justice to the Minister I pass over as not having been meant seriously his own explanation, that he did this in a fit of petulance in order to teach Senator Sir John Keane a lesson. I cannot believe that that was meant seriously.  I think too well of the Minister.  I think too well of any Minister in this country or in this Government to consider that he would take action which infringes the privileges of the Seanad to vent his spite against a particular member.  But the Minister went so far as to make me wonder whether I was not wrong in giving him pardon for that, because he said that if a member abuses privilege it is the duty of the responsible Minister to take steps to put him right.  If that be so, it is equally the duty of every member if the Minister abuses privilege to put him right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly on this subject.  There is one point only I wish to make.  The foundation of democracy is this, that the people should know what is being done by their representatives and by their Government.  They choose their representatives and the representatives choose the Government.  It is the business of the representatives not to back up blindly whatever may be done by the Government, but to exercise, as far as possible, a farseeing <Col N="1362" /> criticism upon those matters.  It is the right and privilege of the people of this country to know not merely what is being done but the criticisms that are being passed upon the Government by the responsible members of either House who have been elected by the people.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that there are circumstances in war and out of war when it may be the duty of a Minister or of the Government to say that a matter is a State secret or of such importance that it should not be divulged to the public.  I do not deny that it is compatible with democracy that a Minister or Government should be allowed to say: &ldquo;That is a matter upon which we have to make up our opinion upon the evidence before us, and do not wish to publish the discussion.&rdquo;  If they do that it is the right of the people to know how often they are doing it.  If the right which is given to them by the people is one that can be abused, it is the right of the people of this country to know how often the Minister or the Government refuses to answer a criticism addressed to them in the House, by pleading that it is a matter of secrecy or State privilege. The real accusation which can be brought in this particular case is not that the Minister has exercised the right of refusing to discuss the particular matter but that he should refuse to let the people know that he was resting upon these rights, and so deprive the people of the right of knowing how the Government was acting and, if necessary, showing their disapproval in a constitutional manner.  That is the point which the Minister has not met and it is the important constitutional point involved. If it is laid down in the Constitution that these Houses should meet in public what is the purpose of that? In order that the people should know what is being done, that they should come in here and listen and, although it is not put in so many words, read in the organs of the Press what is being done by their representatives and their Government.  If the Minister not only falls back on the power of closure and the power of shortening discussion, but takes steps to see that the people of this country do not even know that <Col N="1363" /> he is exercising these powers, it is a very serious breach, not merely of privilege but of the rights of the people to know what the Minister is doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I do not feel quite so strongly on this matter as my colleague Senator Kingsmill Moore, because I am inclined to look at this whole transaction in a cold, legal way.  By the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, and the Emergency Powers Orders under that Act, which have since been made, this power of censorship was given to the Minister who is now present.  He has the power to decide whether matter should be censored. That power has been given into his hands by Parliament, and he is the judge whether or not any particular matter should be censored.  On the 6th December we had a speech by Senator Sir John Keane on the adjournment. In that speech he raised certain matters concerning the transmission of letters through the post.  He raised them for the purpose of eliciting from the Minister what was the reason why these letters were held without any notification being sent to the senders. The Minister made a very brief speech. He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have already told Senator Sir John Keane that it is a matter of security.  I say here and now that it is a matter of security, and I refuse to discuss the matter further.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister censored that speech by Senator Sir John Keane, and his own speech.  I assume that censoring was a matter of security.  I do not think that he censored that speech or his own speech merely to teach Senator Sir John Keane a lesson.  It is a fundamental principle that if Parliament confers upon anybody the determination of any fact, the courts will not interfere with that person in the determination of that matter.  The Minister is the proper authority to determine whether the publication of any matter, whether that matter represents a debate in this House or not, is detrimental to the national security. He is the person entrusted with that <Col N="1364" /> power.  If he decides it is detrimental to the security of the State&mdash;he may be wrong; other people may take a different view&mdash;he at all events is the person in whom that power is vested, and he is the only person who can exercise it.  Having exercised it, there is no appeal from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never heard of our High Court of Parliament before.  What I am pointing out is that, as far as the exercise of this power is concerned, the Minister was the person entrusted by Parliament to exercise it.  We may not agree with the manner in which he exercises that power but the Minister is placed in a special position by reason of his membership of the Government, and by reason of the information at his disposal, to enable him to determine whether or not publication of any matter would be detrimental to the national security.  The ordinary members of this House or the members of the Dáil are not in the position in which the Minister is placed for the purpose of censorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has been raised as to the right of the Minister to censor this speech.  In my submission, he was perfectly and legally entitled to do it.  The only objection that can be made to that statement is that censorship of debates in this House is repugnant to the Constitution, but I cannot find anything in the Constitution which would prevent the Oireachtas from conferring upon the Minister power under the Emergency Powers Act for the purposes of <Col N="1365" /> furthering national security, to censor in the Press any statement made in Dáil Eireann or in this House.  It is true that Article XIV of the Constitution provides that the sitting of each House of the Oireachtas shall be public.  The same Article makes provision for Official Reports and publications of the Oireachtas.  Standing Order 64 (1) of the Seanad provides that an Official Report of the debates of the Seanad shall be issued under the supervision of the Cathaoirleach.  Now, there has been no interference whatsoever with the Official Reports of this House and the speech of Senator Sir John Keane and the speech of the Minister in reply are both given in full in the Official Report.  There is nothing in the Constitution which precludes censoring in the newspapers, by the proper Minister under the Emergency Powers Regulations, any statement made in this House.</P>
    <P>I think myself that a great deal of what I would call exaggerated importance has been given to this matter.  I know that on the next morning I looked for the debate in the Press and I could not find it.  The reason I looked for the debate in the Press was because I was not present when Senator Sir John Keane was speaking and I was anxious to know what happened. I am sure the great majority of the Irish people were not as anxious as I was to see what Senator Sir John Keane had said.</P>

      <P>I read his speech in the Official Debates when I received them. I was not a bit annoyed by the fact that the report did not appear in the newspapers for the simple reason that I believe that the debates of both Houses of the Oireachtas have been censored by different newspapers according as it suits them.  Last week we had a debate on the Drainage Bill and I looked in vain in the <i>Irish Press</i> for a report of that debate.  I may have got the Dublin edition and, of course, the people of Dublin are not interested in drainage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events the fact that this debate did not appear in the newspaper did not injure a single person in this country.  Of course, another matter must be considered.  An Act was passed in England in 1677 and in Ireland in 1695 called the Statute of Frauds.  It was entitled an Act for the prevention of frauds and perjuries.  While it was an Act to prevent frauds and perjuries, persons took advantage of it to perpetrate frauds, and a learned judge once said that the Statute of Frauds should not be used as an engine of fraud.  The same remark would apply to the question of privilege.  There is such a thing as Parliamentary privilege which we all highly prize and value, but it must be used in moderation.  In this case it so happened that some person who had suffered some injury at the hands of a postal official was able to get Senator Sir John Keane to raise the matter in this House.  I do not know whether many other people who suffered at the hands of the postal censorship&mdash;perhaps there were thousands&mdash;would be able to get Senator Sir John Keane to put forward their grievances in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all events, the question of privilege is a matter that must be carefully considered.  I say that in a time of national emergency, Parliamentary privilege, where the security of the State is in question, must take second place.  The non-publication in the newspapers of these particular speeches was not a breach of privilege. It was not a breach of the Constitution.  Therefore, I say at the present time, when we are so near the war and at the same time fairly well removed from it, we should act prudently and we should accept, whether we agree with it or not, the statement of the Minister that the censoring in the Post Office and in the newspapers was a matter of security.  He stated it in that way.  Personally I accept the statement.  He is the Censor and I think that if we pass either the motion or the amendment we are setting ourselves up as censors.  Therefore I <Col N="1367" /> think, that having debated this matter and having aired our grievances, the motion brought forward by Senator Hayes should be withdrawn.</P>
